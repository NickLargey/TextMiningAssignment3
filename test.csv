Now's the Time,Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine If I should bring my brothers and you bring the others Then I can sing a song like Jeru just for you Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode If I can have a pref'rence I'll even make ref'rence To why you write a song like Jeru just for you Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you write these extended bridges can it be romance that always haunts me in my reverie? So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight If you can come early I'll never be late And now you're all invited I hope you're delighted To sing a little song like Jeru just for you just for me too Gather around tale to be told Maybe it's new maybe it's old listen my friend Blowin' away doin' alright Plain' all day workin' all night listen again Movin' along coverin' ground Singin' the song lovin' the sound listen and then blow together birds of a feather Out playin' the blues and "I Got Rhythm" All at once a moment came without a warning Got so hot we had to cool it Go for glory tell you the story Out payin' our dues until we found we were assisting at an unexpected borning 'twas the birth of the Cool So now I can tell you why I'm always Trying to tell you listen come with me New York and we're together in my reverie So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two Forget all the others just me and just you And while we're versifying We'd better start trying To write another song just for me Just for you one more Jeru,Blues
The Sky is Crying,The sky is crying look at the tears roll down the street The sky is crying look at the tears roll down the street I'm waiting in tears looking for my baby and I wonder where can she be? I saw my baby one morning and she was walking on down the street I saw my baby one morning yes she was walking on down the street Made me feel so good until my poor heart would skip a beat I got a bad feeling my baby my baby don't love me no more I got a bad feeling my baby don't love me no more Now the sky's been crying the tears rolling down my door,Blues
Always Free,I live in a little house on the side of the street Where the grass is dead but they water the concrete In the summer I watch the people float by In the winter I watch them weep and cry I Live in a little house on the side of the street I live in a little house on the side of the road Where the people starve just to feed their cars and boats In the fall the men they stomp and shout In the spring the women frolic about I Live in a little house on the side of the road yeah Oh try to believe That work will set you free Only wise men see that we were Always free I live in a place where the people wonder why Why the grass is always greener on the other side In the day they go to work and wait In the night they drink their fears away I Live in a place where the people wonder why Oh try to believe That work will set you free Only wise men see that we were Always We're always free Yeah Yeah Oh try to believe That work will set you free Oh try to believe That work will set you free Only wise men see that we were Always Always free yeah We were always free What the hell nice But I'll drink another drink and then we'll do it again,Blues

Dark Matter,Steal the lights from our eyes Take my blood from my heart We're in all of this dark matter Take the breaths from my chest Take the pulse and I'm outta line We're losing time dark matter Denounce the demagogues King diamond to discard Deplore the dialogue Your word against the law It's strange these days When everybody else pays For someone else's mistake This blame takes shape Still everybody else pays For someone else's mistake You're running away We're pulling apart In all of this dark matter I once heard a sin And now it's stuck in my head Or is it the press? No one knows what happens next Renounce the demigods King diamond to discard Deplore the dialogue Your word against the law It's strange these days When everybody else pays For someone else's mistake This blame takes shape Still everybody else pays For someone else's mistake No tolerance for intolerance intolerance for- No patience left for impatience no more No love lost for lost loves No sorrow for the unaccountable It's strange these days When everybody else pays For someone else's mistake This blame takes shape Still everybody else pays For someone else's mistake,Rock
Runaway,On the street where you live Girls talk about their social lives They're made of lipstick plastic and paint A touch of sable in their eyes all your life all you've asked When's your Daddy gonna talk to you? But you were living in another world Trying to get your message through No one heard a single word you said They should have seen it in your eyes What was going around your head Oh she's a little runaway Daddy's girl learned fast All those things she couldn't say Ooh she's a little runaway Take a line line every night Guaranteed to blow your mind I see you out on the streets Calling for a wild time So you sit home alone 'Cause there's nothing left that you can do There's only pictures hung in the shadows Left there to look at you You know she likes the lights At night on the neon Broadway signs She don't really mind It's only love she hoped to find Oh she's a little runaway Daddy's girl learned fast All those things she couldn't say Ooh she's a little runaway No one heard a single word you said They should have seen it in your eyes (seen it in your eyes) What was going around your head Oh she's a little runaway Daddy's girl learned fast All those things she couldn't say Oh she's a little runaway Daddy's girl learned fast Now she works the night away Oh she's a little runaway Daddy's girl learned fast All those things she couldn't say Oh she's a little runaway Daddy's girl learned fast Now she works the night away,Rock
Smoke On the Water,We all came out to Montreux On the Lake Geneva shoreline To make records with a mobile yeah We didn't have much time now Frank Zappa and the Mothers Were at the best place around But some stupid with a flare gun Burned the place to the ground Smoke on the water a fire in the sky (Smoke) on the water you guys are great They burned down the gambling house It died with an awful sound Funky Claude was running in and out He was pulling kids out the ground now When it all was over Find another place Swiss time was running out It seemed that we would lose the race Smoke on the water a fire in the sky Smoke on the water Burn it down We ended up at the Grand Hotel It was empty cold and bare The Rolling truck Stones thing just outside Huh making our music there now With a few red lights and a few old beds We made a place to sweat No matter what we get out of this I know I know we'll never forget Smoke on the water a fire in the sky Smoke on the water (I can't hear anything) one more time (Smoke on the water) hey!,Rock

Deeper Well,My Saturn has returned When I turned 27 Everything started to change Took a long time but I learned There's two kinds of people One is a giver and one's always trying to take All they can take So I'm saying goodbye To the people that I feel are real good at wasting my time No regrets baby I just think that maybe You go your way and I'll go mine It's been a real good time But you've got dark energy Something I can't unsee And I've got to take care of myself I've found a deeper well I used to wake and bake Roll out of bed hit the gravity bong that I made And start the day For a while it got me by Everything I did seemed better when I was high I don't know why So I'm getting rid of the habits that I feel are real good at wasting my time No regrets baby I just think that maybe it's natural when things lose their shine So other things can glow I've gotten older now I know How to take care of myself I've found a deeper well Hmm When I was growing up We had what we needed Shoes on our feet but the world was as flat as a plate And that's okay The things I was taught only took me so far had to figure the rest out myself And then I found I found a deeper well Hmm mmm,Country
I Remember Everything,Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind Beach towel rests on the dryin' line Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford? Labrador hangin' out the passenger door The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes Blame it on the beach grown men don't cry Do you remember that beat down basement couch? I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about How your mama ran off and pawned her ring I remember I remember everything A cold shoulder at closing time You were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose Strange words come on out Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke Pictures and passin' time You only smile like that when you're drinking I wish I didn't but I do Remember every moment on the nights with you You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind But when the hell are you gonna ease mine? You're like concrete feet in the summer heat It burns like hell when two souls meet No you'll never be the man that you always swore But I'll remember you singin' in that '88 Ford A cold shoulder at closing time You were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose Strange words come on out Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke Pictures and passin' time You only smile like that when you're drinking I wish I didn't but I do Remember every moment on the nights with you Cold shoulder at closing time You were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose Strange words come on out Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke Pictures and passin' time You only smile like that when you're drinking I wish I didn't but I do Remember every moment on the nights with you Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind Beach towel rests on the dryin' line Do I remind you of your daddy in my '88 Ford?

Fighting Myself,Now sometimes these thoughts in my head speak so loud Every little thing that I think about Just builds on top of the pain and doubt Even though I wanna just let it out I try to act like I don't mind it try to keep my mouth so quiet But sittin' there in my silence just seems to amplify it When I thought that keepin' this inside would make it better I never thought that I would end up ruining it forever But every time I think I got everything put back together I end up making more regrets making more regrets Falling from grace I watch it all come apart Knowing I could've changed it all from the start Fighting myself I always lose Fighting myself I always lose I didn't want you to think I'm worn out so easily I wish I'd held it in so you never knew what built up inside of me Now I don't know how it overflows spilled out unwillingly But now everything that I learned to hate came out for you to see I don't want you to promise you can change everything and make it better 'Cause you can bet I'm gonna end up ruining it forever And every time you think you got everything put back together I end up making more regrets making more regrets Falling from grace I watch it all come apart Knowing I could've changed it all from the start Fighting myself I always lose Fighting myself I always lose Falling from grace I watch it all come apart Knowing I could've changed it all from the start Fighting myself I always lose Fighting myself I always lose I can't run with this weight on my back I can't see 'cause I'm focused on the past I can't breathe I need to break free From the anger that is constantly inside me I can't run with this weight on my back I can't see 'cause I'm focused on the past I can't breathe I need to break free From the anger that is constantly inside of me Falling from grace I watch it all come apart Knowing I could've changed it all from the start I can't breathe I need to break free From the anger that is constantly inside of me Falling from grace I watch it all come apart Knowing I could've changed it all from the start I can't breathe I need to break free From the anger that is constantly inside of me,Metal
Ace of Spades,If you like to gamble I tell you I'm your man You win some lose some It's all the same to me The pleasure is to play Makes no difference what you say I don't share your greed The only card I need Is the Ace of Spades The Ace of Spades Playing for the high one Dancing with the devil Going with the flow It's all a game to me Seven or eleven Snake eyes watching you Double up or quit Double stake or split The Ace of Spades The Ace of Spades You know I'm born to lose And gambling's for fools But that's the way I like it baby I don't want to live forever And don't forget the joker Pushing up the ante I know you got to see me Read 'em and weep The dead man's hand again I see it in your eyes Take one look and die The only thing you see You know it's gonna be The Ace of Spades The Ace of Spades uh,Metal

Bat Country,He who makes a beast out of himself Gets rid of the pain of being a man Caught here in a fiery blaze won't lose my will to stay I tried to drive all through the night The heat stroke ridden weather the barren empty sights No oasis here to see the sand is singing deathless words to me Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone) Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone) No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention As I adjust to my new sights The rarely tired lights will take me to new heights My hand is on the trigger I'm ready to ignite Tomorrow might not make i t but everything's all right Mental fiction follow me show me what it's like to be set free Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone) Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone) No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention So sorry you're not here I've been chained too long my vision's so unclear Now take a trip with me But don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem Caught here in a fiery blaze won't lose my will to stay These eyes won't see the same after I flip today Sometimes I don't know why we'd rather live than die We look up towards the sky for answers to our lives We may get some solutions but most just pass us by Don't want your absolution 'cause I can't make it right I'll make a beast out of myself yeah Gets rid of all the pain of being a man Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone) Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone) No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention So sorry you're not here I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear Now take a trip with me But don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem I've known it from the start All these good ideas will tear your brain apart Scared but you can follow me I'm too weird to live but much too rare to die,Metal
