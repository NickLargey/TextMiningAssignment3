You go out when you get ready
You come home when you please
You don't ever want to love me
Think it outta be all right with me

Listen, when I try to talk to you, baby
And let you know just how I feel
All you tell me if I don't like it
There's someone else out there will

Oh, I done got wise to you, woman
You're not the only bird that flies in the sky
Or if you don't ask me no questions, darling
You know I, I won't tell you no lie

Because I like love your arms to be 'round me
And your lip to be close to mine
Oh, I want to love you, woman
Be with you all the time

I'm comin'
Yeah, come on, I got her strength
Come on, call me
Yeah, going on down to [Incomprehensible]

Ooh, I done got wise to you, woman
You're not the only bird that flies in the sky
Or you don't ask me no question, darlin'
You know I, I won't tell you no lies

Because I like love for your arms to be 'round me
And your lip to be close to mine
Hey, I want to love you, woman
And be with you all the time

You know what I said
Ooh, haa
Come on now
