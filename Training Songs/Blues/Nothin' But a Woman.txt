You can give me an hour alone in a bank
Pay all my tickets, wipe the slate blank
You could buy me a car, fill up the tank
Tell me a boat full of lawyers just sank
But it ain't nothin' but a woman
Nothin' but a woman, no, no
Don't need nothin' but a woman
Any time I'm feelin' low

Well, you could fly us to Dallas on a jumbo-jet plane
If we run late and miss it, we can take the night train
When the pressure is on, things getting insane
Only one cure for that kind of strain

It ain't nothin' but a woman
Nothin' but a woman, no, no
Don't need nothin' but a woman, yeah, yeah
To get me through the show

Yeah, you can make me a bet, give me a ten-point spread
Give me French brandy that will clear my head
When it's all over, feeling half-dead
Only one thing, just like I said

It ain't nothin' but a woman
Nothin' but a woman, yeah, yeah
Any time I got a woman
Things can't be too bad

You can buy me a house, turn over the deed
Bring six pounds of California weed
But my weakness ain't drugs, whiskey, or greed
Only one thing that YOUNG BOB needs

It ain't nothin' but a woman
Nothin' but a woman
Yeah, you right
Ain't nothin' but a woman to get me through the night

Mmmmm

It's like I said, man
Ain't nothin' but a woman
Yeah, look at her
And that one over there
