People say you love but one at time
For every woman there`s a man
My baby say she wasn`t put here forever
So she`s gonna get as many as she can

What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
`Cause that`s the only thing I know to do

Well, some people may be wrong sometimes
But they can`t be wrong all the time
Like they say a cat has nine lives
Nine loves has the woman of mine

What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
`Cause that`s the only thing I know to do

Well, the women are funny these days
They do wrong in so many ways
They`ll have a man twiddling his fingers
Or either drinking his life away

What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
`Cause that`s the only thing I know to do
