Oh, no matter what you say, baby
No matter what you do
The way you been treating me, woman
Is coming back home to you

And your crying won't help you, woman
Oh, crying won't help you, baby
Oh, crying won't help you, woman
'Cause you've been so mean to me

Oh, you must remember baby
No matter, where you go
Watch those seeds you scatter, woman 'cause you're gonna reap just what you sow

And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, oh, crying won't help you, baby
'Cause you've been so mean to me

Oh, the way you been treating me, just can't understand
I'm gonna leave you woman, let you do the best you can
And your crying won't help you, baby
Crying won't help you now

Oh, oh, crying won't help you, woman
'Cause you been so mean to me, look out

Oh, just before I leave you woman
Just before I shake your hand
I'm going to get me a woman, baby
Let you get you a man

And your crying won't help you, woman
Crying won't help you now
Oh, oh, crying won't help you, baby
'Cause you been so mean to me

Whoo!
