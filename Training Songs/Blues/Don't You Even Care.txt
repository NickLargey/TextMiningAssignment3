You walk the streets
All the night long 
And you know
Know that's wrong
What's a matter, baby?
Don't you even care?

You drink
And you smoke
And you're out there high
Skied up on that coke 
Hey, baby
Don't you even care?

You took my credit cards
Driving around in my car, too
You checked into some hotel room, now baby
What are you out there trying to prove?

Please bring it home
Don't leave this young man
Don't you leave him all alone
Baby, you wrong
Don't you even care?

Mmmm
Baby, you took all my credit cards
Driving around in my car, too
You checked into the Motel 6, baby
What are you out there trying to prove?

Please, bring it home
Don't leave this young man
Don't you leave him all alone
Baby, you wrong
Don't you even care?

Baby, you know that's wrong
Don't you even care?
Baby, you know that's wrong
Don't you even care?
Baby, you wrong
Don't you even care?

Baby, you wrong
I want my money back
