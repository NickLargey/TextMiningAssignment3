Got to have your love night and day
Not just a part but all your heart
Ninety-nine and a half
Just won't do

Yeah, it just won't do
I've got a half of real love and affection
Though we live, though we live in the wrong direction
Ninety-nine and a half just won't do

Yeah, it just won't do
We got to bring it on down now

I've got a half of real love and affection
Though we live, though we live in the wrong direction
Ninety-nine and a half just won't do, yeah
It just won't do

Got to have 100
Got to have 100...
