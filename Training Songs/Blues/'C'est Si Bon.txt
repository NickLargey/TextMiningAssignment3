Hmm, c'est si bon 
Lovers say that in France 
When they thrill to romance 
It means that it's so good 

Oh, c'est si bon
So I say it to you 
Like the French people do 
Because it's oh-so good, ba-ba-doo, doo day

Every word, every sigh
Every kiss, dear 
Leads to only one thought 
And it's this, dear!
 
Hmm, it's so good
Nothing else can replace 
Just your slightest embrace 
And if you only would
Be my own
For the rest of my days 
I will whisper this phrase 
My darling, c'est si bon, oui oui!
