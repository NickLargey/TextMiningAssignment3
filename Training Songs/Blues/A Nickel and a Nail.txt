Oh, I once had love
And plenty of money, hmmm
But some way, somehow
You know I failed, yes I did
Now all, all I have
In my pocket, it's a shame
All I can give account of
Right now is a nickel and a nail
That's all I have
I said all, all I have
Is a nickel and a nail

My friends, oh oh
Oh, they just don't know, no they don't
They still deep down in their hearts
They think I'm doing swell
But they don't know
Because (when I'm around them ?) I smile
And every now and then I jingle, yes I do
Oh, they hear me jinglin´
Oh, they hear me jinglin´
With a nickel and a nail
That's all it is
I said all, all I have
Is a nickel and a nail

Now a nickel and a nail
Might save my pride, you see
But the need for your sweet loving
Oh baby, can't you see it's killin´ me

Oh, you said a long time ago
You told me that the thrill was gone
I didn't believe you
You said Milton
You better hit that ole lonesome, lonesome trail
I had to leave you
Oh baby, now that I think about it
I realize you didn't care if I made it
I don't believe I will
Oh girl, I can't go too far
For a nickel and a nail, no I can't
I said I can't, I can't make it far
