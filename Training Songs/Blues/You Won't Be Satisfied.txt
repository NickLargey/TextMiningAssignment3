You won't be satisfied until you break my heart,
You're never satisfied until the teardrops start!
I tried to shower you with love and kisses,
But all I ever get from you is,
Naggin' and braggin'
My poor heart is saggin'

The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame,
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same!
You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart,
Oh you won't be satisfied until you break my heart!
