I wanna jump but I'm afraid I'll fall.
I wanna holler but the joint's too small.
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me too.
I got a rockin' pneumonia and a boogie woogie flu.

Want some lovin', baby, that ain't all.
I wanna kiss her but the gal's too tall.
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me too.
I got a rockin' pneumonia and a boogie woogie flu.

I wanna scream, I want you all to know,
I would be runnin' but my feet's too slow.
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me too.
I got a rockin' pneumonia and a boogie woogie flu.

Yeah!

Well, all right! Yeah!

I wanna scream, I want you all to know,
I would be runnin' but my feets' too slow.
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me too.
I got a rockin' pneumonia and a boogie woogie flu.

Baby. comin' now I'm hurryin' home.
I know she's leavin' 'cause I'm takin' too long.
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me too.
I got a rockin' pneumonia and a boogie woogie flu.

I wanna scream.
I wanna scream.
I wanna scream.
I wanna scream.
