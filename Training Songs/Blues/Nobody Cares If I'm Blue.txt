All the old gang that I once knew
Now have left me two by two.
The only beau (...?)
Iâ??m so lonely by my only.

Each and every one it seems
Meets the ideal of their dreams.
Iâ??ve searched everywhere for my ideal.
Now Iâ??m beginning to feel

Nobody knows, nobody care if Iâ??m lonesome.
Nobody cries, nobody sighs if Iâ??m blue.
It seems that night after night 
I sit alone and twiddle my thumbs.

But I just keep right on hoping, keep the door open
But nobody comes.
Ainâ??t it a crime kisses of mine are just wasted?
Then summer starts, Iâ??m thinking whatâ??ll I do?

Like a play-thing on the shelf
I guess Iâ??ll have to play by myself.
'Cause nobody knows, nobody cares if Iâ??m blue.

Nobody knows, nobody cares if Iâ??m lonesome.
Nobody sighs, nobody cries if Iâ??m blue.
I sit at home constantly,
My company is just the four walls.

But still I keep right on hoping, keep the door open
But nobody comes. 
Ainâ??t it a crime loving like mine is just wasted?
When summer starts, Iâ??m thinking â??whatâ??ll I do?â??

When it comes to happiness,
I must be a step-child I guess
'Cause nobody knows, nobody cares if Iâ??m blue.
