He got me feeling so fine
He thought the sun had to shine
He turned my water to wine
He’d do it every time

Ain’t nothing better than that
I let him play with my cat
Got nothing on but his hat
Ain’t nothing wrong with that

And all that I want him to know, that I want him to know
He’s at his first damn song
Better than I ever had, more than I can stand

I found me a better man
Better man who loved me
Better that, better that
Better than you ever could

I don’t wanna know anymore
I get so out of control
I found me a better man
You grease my pen but I done your cat

He’s no complicated man
He’s happy holding my hand
He likes to swim in my tub
I like his rubber duck

He never stolen my car
Or tried to pull my guitar
He doesn’t flirt with my friends
My money he don’t stand

I found me a better man
Better man who loved me
Better that, better that
Better than you ever could

Don’t want none anymore
I get so out of control
I found me a better man
You grease my pen but I done your cat

Love you have in the sun ever since
Love has surely been so good to make
I finally found myself up in the sky

I found me a better man who love me
A better lad
Better than you ever can

I found me a better man
Better man who loved me
Better that, better that
Better than you ever could

I don’t wanna know anymore
I get so out of control
I found me a better man

I found me a better man
Better man who loved me
Better that, better that
Better than you ever could

Grease my pen and I done your cat
