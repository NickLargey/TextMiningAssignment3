Woke up this morning, my baby was gone
Woke up this morning, my baby was gone
I felt so bad, my baby's gone

I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me
I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery

Well baby, I'm all alone
Yeah, baby, I'm all alone
I ain't no lovin'
Since my baby's been gone
Oh, lord

All alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
I had no lovin'
Since my baby's been gone, everybody

Yeah babe, I'm all alone
Ooh babe, I'm all alone
I ain't had no loving
Since my baby's been gone
