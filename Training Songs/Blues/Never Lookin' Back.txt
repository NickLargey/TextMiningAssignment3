Walkin' blow walkin' slowly 
Walkin' blow walkin' slowly 
I was a 
Try to forget you like I said you 
Wanna tell this 
Rollin' walkin' walkin' slowly 

And I'm never lookin' back 
I said all I need to see 
I don't want no more 
Be there I'm never lookin', lookin' back. 

One thing make it all right 
One thing, I can get you through the night. 
Don't need another 
While I'm leaving 'cause I'm gonna lose my mind 
One thing make it all right 

And I'm never lookin' back 
I said all I need to see 
I don't want no more 
Be there I'm never lookin'. 
All I know is something not change, gonna change 
Show me 

And I'm never lookin' back. 

And I'm never lookin' back 
I said all I need to see 
I don't want no more 
Be there I'm never lookin', lookin' back.
