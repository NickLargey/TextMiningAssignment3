Keep your hand to yourself; she belong to me
Keep your hand to yourself; she belong to me
All mine, she's all mine
Leave her alone
Hands off
Hands down

All mine
She's my baby
I love her
She's gonna love me
Oh, baby
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Now, look, buddy; keep your hand down to yourself
It's all mine, all my property
Don't belong to you
Hands down and eyes open
Oh, baby, you're mine
Oh, baby, all mine
All mine
