I can read your mind 
Don't you know it's easy for me after all this time 
And I know when you lie 
If were talking on the phone or one on one
The truth you never hide

I don't need you to teel me there's something wrong
Because your eyes give you away
I can't seem to get my head around you
Being gone

So before you go, so before you leave
Remember, remember, remember
That your heart's not unbreakable
Remember, remember, remember
That I still love you

All the things I thought I'd never see
Have now come to be
You said our love was strong
I said that we belong
But somehow I lost you suddenly

I can't seem to forget about you being gone
'cause your eyes are unmistakeable
I can't seem to get my head around you
Being gone

So before you gone, so before you leave
Remember, remember, remember
That your heart's not unbreakable
Remember, remember, remember
That I still love you

I can't seem to get my head around you
Being gone

So before you gone, so before you leave
Listen to me , listen
Remember, remember, remember
That your heart's not unbreakable
Remember, remember, remember
That I still love you

You said I would never leave you
I said i think you're crazy
You said I would never leave you
I said I think you're crazy
