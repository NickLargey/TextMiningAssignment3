(Hey, baby, what do I have to do)
(To make a hit with you)

You gotta dance with me Henry (All right, baby)
Dance with me Henry (Don't mean maybe)
Rock with me Henry (Any old time)
Talk to me Henry (Don't change your mind)
Dance with me Henry (All right)
You better dance while the music goes on
Roll on, roll on, roll on

While the cats are ballin' (Roll on, roll on)
You better stop your stallin' (Roll on, roll on)
Its intermission in a minute (Roll on, roll on)
So you better get with it (Roll on, roll on)
Dance with me Henry (Roll on, roll on)
You better dance while the music goes on
Roll on, roll on, roll on

Oooo-ooo-ooo-wee
Henry, you aint movin' me
You better feel that boogie beat
And get the lead out of your feet

You gotta dance with me Henry
Dance with me Henry
Rock with me Henry
Talk to me Henry
Dance with me Henry
You better dance while the music goes on

Roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll
Rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock
Roll, roll, roll
Roll on, roll on, roll on

Rock with me Henry (All right, baby)
Dance with me Henry (Don't mean maybe)
Rock with me Henry (Any old time)
Dance to me Henry (Don't change your mind)
Jump with me Henry (All right)
You better dance, dance while the music goes on

Rock!
