Well, now it's three o' clock in the mornin'
And I can't even close my eyes
Three o' clock in the mornin'
And I can't even close my eyes
Can't find my baby
And I can't be satisfied

I've look down around me
And my baby can't be found
I've looked all around me, people
And my baby, she can't be found
You know if I don't find my baby
People, I'm going down to the golden ground
That's where the men hang out

Goodbye, everybody
I believe this is the end
Ohh-oh, goodbye, everybody
I believe this is the end

I want you to tell my baby
Tell her, please
"Please forgive me, forgive me for my sins"
