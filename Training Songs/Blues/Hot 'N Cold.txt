You change your mind
Like girl changes clothes. yeah
You
P.M.S like a bitch, I would know

And you over think
Always speak
Critically
I should know

That you're no good for
Me
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no

You're in and your out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when its right
It's black and it's white

Your hot then your cold
Your yes then your no
Your in then your out
Your up then your down
