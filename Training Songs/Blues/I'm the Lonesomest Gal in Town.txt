I'm a lonesomest gal in town
Everybody has thrown me down
I got no angel child to ever call me,"Dear"
Got no honey man for me to cuddle near

But I'm learnin' to roll my eyes
And someday you may be surprised
When I steal someone's lovin' man
And kiss him with a smack

I'll hug him and I'll squeeze him
But I'll never give him back
'Cos I'm lonesome, so very lonesome
I'm the lonesomest gal in this here town

If you read in the papers some day
That some poor girl has passed away
Don't shed a tear if you should hear
That gal was me and if you see

My picture in the paper with a smile on my face
I was broken hearted that smile was out of place
If you wanna save a gal from her grave
Find me a man if you can

I'm the lonesomest gal in town
Everybody is throwin' me down
I got no angel child to ever call me,"Dear"
Got no honey man for me to cuddle near

But I'm learnin', I'm gonna roll my eyes
And someday you're gonna be surprised
When I steal someone's lovin' man
And kiss him with a smack

I'll hug him and I'll squeeze him
But I'll never give him back
'Cos I'm lonesome, so very lonesome
I'm the lonesomest gal in this or any other town
