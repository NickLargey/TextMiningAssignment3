Well, I woke up this mo'nin
Early with the risin' sun
Woke up this mo'nin
Woke up with the risin' sun
Well, I thought about my baby
And all the good she done

Well, my heart beat like a hammer
My eyes got full of tears
Well, my heart beat like a hammer
My eyes got full of tears
Well, she been gone 'bout a hour
But it seem like a thousand years

Well, I should-a loved her more
I know I didn't treat her right
Well, I should-a loved her more
I know I didn't treat her right
Well, a woman like that
You need to love everyday and night
Yeah!

Woo
Woo
Woo
Woo
Woo

Well, don't never dog your woman
You know you doin' wrong yourself
Don't never dog your woman
You know you doin' wrong yourself
She get the devil in her mind
Go wild 'bout somebody's else.
