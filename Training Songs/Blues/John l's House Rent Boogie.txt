Hey
It's the House Rent Boogie

I come home last Friday, talk to the woman that I lost my job
She says, don't confront me and so I have my rent next Friday
And next Friday come, I didn't have the rent and out the door I went
Yes, yes

Hmm, hmm
Yes, yes

Come here now, y'all, right 'cross the street here
Help me get this rent together
Some give me a nickel and some give me a dime

I'm tired of keepin' this movin' every night
I can't hold out much longer
Now I got this rent, now let's get together, y'all
Let's have a ball

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
