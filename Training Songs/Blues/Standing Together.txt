Have I told you I love you
Or has it been a while since I said I did?
Have I told you htat I care
Or have I said something I can`t face?
These are thoughts that go through my mind
To make sure that my love stands the test of time, and
When I think of you loving me
Yes, I know it`s a love that was meant to be

Standing together is you and me
Living in love is our destiny
We will be floating on like an endless sea
We will be standing together

If I took you for granted
Well, that will never ever happen again
You tought me love is an action
More than a lover, you were my best friend
You brought me to a love so new
And the joy that I feel, I owe it all to you
When I think of you loving me
It`s a love that I know that was meant to be

Standing together is you and me
Living in love is our destiny
We will be floating on like an endless sea
We will be standing together

Standing together is you and me
Living in love is our destiny
We will be floating on like an endless sea
We will be standing together

With open ears and a listening heart
Tears fell, and we rejoiced inside
Our new love grew side by side, hand in hand
And slowly we began to stand

Standing together is you and me
Living in love is our destiny
Floating on like an endless sea
We will be standing together
