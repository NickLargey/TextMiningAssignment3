I wanna be alone with you, baby
No one but me and you
I wanna be alone with you, baby
No one but me and you
I don't want a soul, don't want a soul, baby
I don't want a soul hangin' around

Ten thousand miles from nowhere, baby
Baby, just me and you alone
Ten thousand miles from nowhere
Baby, just me and you alone
I don't want a soul, don't want a soul, baby
I don't want no one but you

You know I love you, baby
I don't want no one hangin' around
You know I love you, I love you, baby
I don't want no one hangin' around
I wanna be alone with you, baby
I don't want no one around but you, yes, yes

I don't want your mother, baby
And neither your father
I don't want a soul, don't want a soul, baby
But just me and you, just me and you, baby
Just me and you

Ten thousand miles from nowhere, baby
Just me and you
I don't want your brother, baby, not your sister
I don't need your mother and your father
Your two timing friend, just me and you, me and you
We want to be alone, I want to be alone

I want to be alone with you, baby
I want to be alone with you, baby
I want to be alone with you, baby
Just me and you darlin' and no one else
