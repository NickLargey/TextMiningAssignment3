Please don't talk about me when I'm gone, oh honey
Though our friendship ceases from now on
If you can't say anything real nice, it's better
Not to talk at all, is my advice

You go your way I'll go mine, best we do
Here's a kiss, I hope that this brings lots of luck to you
Makes no difference, how I carry on
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone

You go your way I'll go mine, best we do
Here's a kiss, I hope that this brings lots of luck to you
Makes no difference, how I carry on
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
