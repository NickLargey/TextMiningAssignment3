Whiskey and wimmen almost wrecked my life
Whiskey and wimmen almost wrecked my life
Were'nt for whiskey and wimmin, I'd have money today

Nightlife, nightlife, nightlife
Ain't no good, ain't no good for me
I had a good start, but wimmen and whiskey tore it down

Whiskey and wimmen ain't no good for me
Whiskey and wimmen ain't no good, ain't no good for me
I had a lot of money and big fine car, but I lost everything I had
Aww I did
