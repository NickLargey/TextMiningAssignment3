I was an innocent child
'Till you taught me your style.
You got me doin' things
That I'd never have done
Don't criticize me, save me
'Cause whatever I am, you made me
Whatever I got, you gave me
Whatever I am, you made me
Whatever I got, you gave me

I'm tryin' to hang on
Because my love is so strong
You got me doin' things
That you know I'd never have done
I say don't criticize me, save me
'Cause whatever I am, you made me
Whatever I got, you gave me

Well, I'm tryin' to be good
Like a woman can be.
But you kept on talking, talk to me
And as soon as I fell, you put me down
And now you got 'em talking 'bout me
All over this town
You know I can't, can't eat a bite
And I can't sleep at night
'Cause you got me doin' things
That you know ain't right
Don't criticize me, save me
Whatever I am, you made me
Whatever I got, you gave me
Whatever I am, you made me
Whatever I got, you gave me
