Ever since the world begin 
Man have received the right to live from God above 
But there is only right that you can give 
That is the right for me to have your love 

That's why I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 
Yes I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 

No use resisting, I'll keep insisting 
Stop your conniving girl, I ain't jiving 
I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 

Yes, I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 
I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 

Night time, day time, sunshine or rain 
I'll be ridin that ol' freedom train 
I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 

Yes, I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 
I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 

Tonight at eight in the morning at four 
You'll find me sitting at your front door 
I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 

Yes, I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 
I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 

I'm gonna sit in till you give in
