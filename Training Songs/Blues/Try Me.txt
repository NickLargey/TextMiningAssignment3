Try me like I'm gone
Try me like I'm playing
Try me like I ain't walking out this stuff that I be saying
Try me like I'm out here flexing flexing for you man
Try me like I ain't really who I'm saying that I ain't him
Try me like I'm playing

We so deep it's so out we been around for so long
So when you try to shut us down but they end up getting rolled on
They crucify our leader first then thought that they got rid of us
In three days He cracked the grave and now there's centuries of us
We're simple man we still sin but there a couple things that we won't do
One is deny the Son hold Him back is number two
We made it through the crusades we made it through the reformation
Great sin great men but we endured through generations
Through generations through generation Africa Europe Asia
Every tongue every tribe all races all nations
No this is not a game and never ever can it be
The move is not some little clique but it's Christianity
For now He rules internally the 6th day was detoured
In Adam her life's lost in Christ her life restored
The fourth kingdom will come as it is in heaven praying
That the Lord will come quick try us we are not, playing

Before I right a verse trying to sound cool or swagged out
I been fast in all that let this man shout
I ain't retired in awhile let me cash out
Now I'm a gonna testify bring my past out
I was living with no concern for my soul
First in my block to rock west coast
Rapping and trapping painful and lost
The beats that he'd toss somehow was slow
I was in it to win it I was fixing to get it
Just give me a minute and I'm on
But then I repented and this kid was delivered
Now longer a child now I'm grown
So liar liar pants on fire put em out
Please desire His desire live it out
Grown folks playing with the sword
The 9-5 stretch was given for us to live it out?
Uh acting all big and bad like they ain't gotta give a count
I beg to differ on the last day you get slain like Jack the Ripper
Down to the lake of fire mister can't breathe up under that water flipper
I run the way the God commands enlarge my heart to understand
Gotta be B E perfect gotta be B E holy gotta let the Spirit control me
Gotta be a little less fony if it is all that than the Spirit's up on me

Try me like I'm playing
Try me like I ain't walking out this stuff that I be saying
Try me like I'm out here flexing flexing for you man
Try me like I ain't really who I'm saying that I ain't him

Young Noah I don't understand Flame why they calling us hypocrites
Flame: Why because they seen the views and lifestyles that contradict
Young Noah: But we ain't out here flexing man we unashamed we walking this
We trying to be the alternate Jesus Christ is ultimate
Flame: But often it's the opposite it's obvious they never met Him
Cause if they did I'm positive they'd positively represent Him
Cause if they truly saved then the Holy Spirit is living in em
We all whack the only difference is all the Christians is saved sinners
Young Noah: So basically what you saying is what I need to praying is
That God would make me like Him to be a light and invite them
Flame: Absolutely Excellent That's what I'm saying
Let your lips and life say "Try me I am not playing"
