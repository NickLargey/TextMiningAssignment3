(verse 1)
Elvis sang viva Las Vegas
Marylin on the Silver Screen
Joplin, Gable, & Betty Davis
Boagie, Hendrix, & Jimmy Dean

(pre-chorus)
I don't know about the status quo
But I really don't see this obsession
to feel the need,
to make you want to say...

(chorus)
You want to be, You want to be, 
You want to be a Star
You want to be, You want to be
You want to be 

(verse 2)
Wannabes sell their soul for money
corner of Hollwood & Vine
shooting stars but it's kinda funny
how they slowly fade with... time
