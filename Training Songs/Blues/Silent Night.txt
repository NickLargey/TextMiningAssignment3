Silent night, holy night
All is quiet, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quakes at the sight
Radiant beam from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
