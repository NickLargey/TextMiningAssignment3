Seasons mean nothing
You went away and I'm falling
Even clouds have tried their best
To move and give my tears a rest

Seasons mean nothing
You went away and I'm falling
Even when the cold disarms
It still feels like there's something wrong

Seasons mean nothing
You went away and I'm falling
Even when the leaves turn brown
In sympathy about the ground
