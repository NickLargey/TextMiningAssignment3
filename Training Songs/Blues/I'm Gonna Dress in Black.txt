I'm walking the long road to Georgia
Yeah, the long road that's taking me back
Gonna live in the hills, far away in the hills
And I'm gonna dress in black

Way high in the hills in Georgia
Gonna live in an old tin shack
Nobody I'll see and no one will see me
And I'm gonna dress in black

'Cause I went down big city
Had money, had money in my sack
Found a girl so fine, I thought she was mine
But she left me without a shirt to my back

Way out in the hills in Georgia
I'll live in my old tin shack
I'll think of the time that woman was mine
And I'm gonna dress in black, yeah

'Cause I went, I went down to big city
I had money, had money in my sack
Found a girl so fine, I thought she was mine
But she left me without my shirt to my back

Yeah, way out, way out in the hills in Georgia
I'll live in my old tin shack
I'm gonna think of the time that woman was mine
And I'm gonna dress in black

Yeah, I'm gonna dress in black
Oh yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna dress in black
