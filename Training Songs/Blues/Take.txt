Take, take all you can
From the life you’ve been given
And stop making plans
This world is all that you need
You just have to notice
Remember to breathe

There’s a price that you pay
With the games that you play with that devil
And you better be sure when you walk through that door before you meddle
Life is so short and you’re going to get caught being bought
And the choices you make and the demons you wake must be fought
