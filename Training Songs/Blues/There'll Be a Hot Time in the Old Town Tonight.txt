Come along, get you ready Wear your bran', bran' new gown
For there's gwine to be a meeting In that good, good old town
Where you knowded everybody And they all knowded you
And you've got a rabbit's foot To keep away de hoo-doo.

When you hear that the preaching does begin
Bend down low for to drive away your sin
And when you gets religion, you want to shout and sing
There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight, My baby

When you hear dem a bells go ding ling ling
All join 'round and sweetly you must sing
And when the verse am through in the chorus all join in
There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight.

There'll be girls for ev'ry body: In that good, good old town,
For there's Miss Consola Davis And there's Miss Gondolia Brown
And there's Miss Johanna Beasly She am dressed all in red,
I just hugged her and I kissed her And to me then she said:

Please oh please, oh do not let me fall,
You're all mine and I love you best of all,
And you must be my man, or I'll have no man at all,
There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight, My baby
