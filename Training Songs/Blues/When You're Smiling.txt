When you're smiling
When you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you
When you're laughing
When you're laughing
The sun comes shining through
But when you're crying
You bring on the rain
Stop your cryin' and be happy again
When you're smiling keep on smiling
And the whole world smiles with you

But when you're crying
You bring on the rain
Stop your cryin' and be happy again
When you're smiling keep on smiling
And the whole world smiles with you
