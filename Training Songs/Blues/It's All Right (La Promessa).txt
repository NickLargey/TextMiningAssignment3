Main street lights, morning hours
Lead me down to quiet streets
Early traffic with it's radio songs
Someplace two rivers meet

Will you be in my life?
Kiss me in the shadows
Time, time, time's going to keep the promise
It's alright, it's alright

Mercy falls on my sacred ground
Pretty woman cries but makes no sound
I am lost, it don't matter
If a paper house comes tumbling down

Going to be in your life
Standing in the shadows
Time, time, time's going to make the days flow
It's alright, the promise, it's alright, the loveless

Only a moment in time
The prayers of all the people will fly
Blessing the city tonight
I'll wait for the sound of your voice to sing

Love comes
And it's alright, that's all

Only a moment in time
The prayers of all the people will fly
Blessing the city tonight
I'll wait for the sound of the voices to sing

Love comes
And it's alright, that's all
Believe me
And it's alright, that's all
