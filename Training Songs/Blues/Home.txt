You say it's time to go 
But you don't want to leave 
Fooling with the keys 
I'd like to see the show 

But I just don't think it's that easy 
But if it's everywhere you look 
If it's easy to see 
We'll all be floating on a breeze 

Bishop takes a rook 
It looks like the way back 
Is moving the stone 
And I was playing out the role of pretender 
Trying to get them straight into line 
She said she needed me to defend her 

Home, home

You say you're sitting at the bus stop 
Waiting at the gate 
Got the ticket in your hand 
I'm getting kind of hot 
I don't seem to have got what you paid for 

And it isn't worth the fuss 
But it's looking in the way 
You know he doesn't understand 
It's not the way you planned out the handout 
To pay the band 

I was standing in the line with the crazies 
Smoking half and drinking the rest 
Feeling fine and kind of lazy 
Hoping I was passing the test 
Home, home
