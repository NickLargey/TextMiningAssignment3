Circles and cycles
Phases and stages
And scenes that
We've all seen before

Let me tell you some more

Washing the dishes
Scrubbing the floors
Caring for someone
Who don't care anymore

Learning to hate all the things
That she once loved to do
Like washing his shirts and never complaining
Except of red stains on the collars

Ironin' and cryin'
Cryin' and ironin'
Caring for someone
Who don't care anymore

Someday she'll just walk away

Phases and stages
Circles and cycles
And scenes that
We've all seen before

Let me tell you some more
