Sometimes you need to be alone
It don't matter now
Shut the door, unplug the phone
It don't matter now
Speak in a language they don't know
It don't matter now

Well I don't think about that stuff
No, I don't think about that stuff
It don't matter now

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo

Build a castle out of sand
It don't matter now
Well it won't last and it won't stand
It don't matter now
But with a suitcase in your hand
It don't matter now
 
Well I don't think about that stuff
No, I don't think about that stuff
It don't matter now

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo

A bad man running your hometown
Surf your way on through the crowd
It don't matter now
Change your name, you won't be found
It don't matter now

Well I don't think about that stuff
No, I don't think about that stuff
It don't matter now
 
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
It don't matter now
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
It don't matter now
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
It don't matter now
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Well it don't matter now (doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo)
