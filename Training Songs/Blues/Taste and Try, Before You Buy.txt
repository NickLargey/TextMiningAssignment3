TASTE AND TRY SAVOY BROWN

My mother told me
When I was young
Many people try
To con you son
You got to separate
The truth from the lies
You got to taste and try
Before you buy

The army man says
Sign on for five
The army show you
A real man's life
You know I don't dig
That army jive
You got to taste and try
Before you buy

My woman looks at me
My woman says
Now pack your bags boy
And get out of my bed
Five long years
You still ain't done me right
You got to taste and try
Before you buy

Now this is my life
It's the way I be
May not suit you
But it sure suits me
You got to live before you die
Taste and try
Before you buy
