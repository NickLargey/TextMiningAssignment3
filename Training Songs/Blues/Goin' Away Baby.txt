i'm going away just worry you off my mind 
now you keeps me worrying al the time
i ain't never loved but 4 womens in my life
my mother, my sister, my sweetheart and my wife
if you don't want me baby don't dog me around
just like you found me
you can put me down
she says goodbye baby if you call that gone
you can leave me now but i declare you won't stay long
