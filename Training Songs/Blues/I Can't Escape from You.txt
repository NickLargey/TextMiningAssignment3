I've tried and tried to run and hide
To find a life that's new
But wherever I go I always know

I can't escape from you

A jug of wine to numb my mind
But what good does it do?
The jug runs dry and still I cry

I can't escape from you

These wasted tears are souvenirs
Of love, I thought was true
Your memory is chained to me

I can't escape from you

There is no end, I can't pretend
That dreams will soon come true
A slave too long to a heart of stone

I can't escape from you

{This is Hank Williams speaking for all the boys
And saying "If the good Lord's willin'
And the creeps don't rise, we'll see you for long"
And until then}
