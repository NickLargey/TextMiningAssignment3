For weary weeks I waited
And hoping for the best
But blues will make me ramble
And the rails are leading west

I'm feeling oh, so lonesome
Pleasure I can't find
I'm leaving you mean mama
Just to worry you off of my mind

That old kindly whistle
Just fall in line and smile
Mean, my mama haunts me
And I crave the peace of mind

I don't know where I'm going
I'm feeling kind of square
I've been from several places
And I'm going to be from here

Seems there's something missing
There's feelings in my breath
I crave to cover distance
So mean mama give me wreath

I hear the rails a singing
The sky is clear and blue
I'm going to leave you mama
When the train comes rolling through

No money in my pocket
I'm roving around so flat
And soon I'll be strolling
Down that railroad track

And when I'm miles away
Riding all the while
I think of you mean mama
I think of you and smile
