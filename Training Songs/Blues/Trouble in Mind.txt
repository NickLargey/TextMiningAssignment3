Trouble in mind, I am blue
But I won't be blue always
For the sun will shine in my back door again

Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind
Life ain't worthwhile livin'; feel like I could die

I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome rail road iron
Let the 2:19 train ease my trouble of mine

Trouble in mind, I am here
My poor heart is bein' slow
Now I have no trouble in my life before

Trouble in mind, oh, yes, I am blue
But I won't be blue always
Yes, the sun will shine in my back door someday
