I, I know, oh, yes, I know
That you and I will never meet again
Woah, for you, for you were meant for somebody else
(Somebody else)

Woah, woah, woah, that night, oh, yes, that night
That night when first we met I fell in love with you
And now I simply can't forget
(I can't forget)

Oh, darling, what if
We never meet again beneath the moonlit sky
But I know that my love will follow you
As the years go passing by

Oh, I know, oh, yes, I know
That you and I will never meet again
For you, for you were meant for somebody else
(Somebody else)
