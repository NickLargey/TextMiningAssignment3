I need you so
To keep me happy
If I can't have you
I cannot go on
I need your arms
Around me tightly
I miss them nightly
When you are not at home
When day is done
Oh I need you so
I long to hear your lil'
Knock upon the door
When you leave me
I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry
'Cause I need you so
When day is done
Oh I need you so
I long to hear your lil'
Knock upon the door
When you leave me
Baby I try not to worry
Please come back in a hurry
Because I need you so
