Jesse James and Frank James
Billy the Kid and all the rest
Supposed to be some bad cats
Way out in the West

But if they could've dug me and my gangster ways
They would have hung up their guns, child and made it to their graves

'Cause I'm a gangster of love (gangster of love)
Tell me you know, tell me you know
A gangster of love
When I walk in a bar
Girls come from near and far
Say "he's a gangster of love"

Jumped on my white horse
Rode across the border line
Roped 55 girls
Kissed them all the same time

Take 25 or 30, load 'em all on a freight
There's a million dollar reward for me in each and every state

'Cause I'm a gangster of love (gangster of love)
Tell me you know, tell me you know
A gangster of love
When I walk in a bar
Girls come from near and far
Say "he's a gangster of love"

Yeah!

Jumped on my white horse
Rode across the border line
Roped 55 girls
Kissed them all the same time

The sheriff said "Is your name Johnny Winter?" in a very deep voice
I said "Yes sir Mr. Sheriff, and that's your wife on the back of my horse

'Cause I'm a gangster of love (gangster of love)
Tell me you know, tell me you know
A gangster of love
When I walk in a bar
Girls come from near and far
Say "he's a gangster of love"
