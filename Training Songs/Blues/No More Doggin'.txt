Honey, no more doggin', foolin' 'round with you
Honey, no more doggin', foolin' 'round with you
I'm gonna let you out, baby, and that's what I've got to do

Well, told you all the straights and I made you fine
You spend my money on whiskey, beer, and wine
No more doggin', foolin' 'round with you
I'm gonna let you out, baby, and that's what I've got to do

Well, you told me that you love me and you told me a lie
Yes, I'll love you until the day I die
No more doggin', foolin' 'round with you
I gotta let you out, baby, and that's what I've got, oh, yes

Well, you know I love you, baby, and I can't help myself
Yes, I'll love you until the day I die
No more doggin', foolin' 'round with you
I gotta let you out, baby, and that's what I've got to do
I gotta let you out, baby, and that's what I've got to do
I gotta let you out, baby, and that's what I've got to do
