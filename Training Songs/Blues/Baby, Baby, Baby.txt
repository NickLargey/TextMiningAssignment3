Baby, baby, baby
Love me, love me, do
Love me, love me true
The way that I love you

Baby, baby, baby
You're my kind of guy
And I'd want to die
If you should say we're through

You smile and I'm happy
You frown and I'm blue
For me there's no sunshine
Unless the sun shines for you

Baby, baby, baby
Take me, take me, please
Put my heart at ease
Love me as I love you
