Baby, you understand me now?
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don'tcha know that no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But oh, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

You know sometimes, baby I'm so carefree
Oh, with a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's me one thing I never mean to do
'Cause I love you

Oh, baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Don't let me be misunderstood

I try so hard so please don't let me be misunderstood
No, no, no, please
