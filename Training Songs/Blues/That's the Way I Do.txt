I wished for lovely night
And my gal to hold me tight
That's the way I do
When I wanna make love

How 'bout that, high?

I want a lovely song to sing
I want kisses an everything
That's the way I do
When I want to make love

Don't you do the same thing, boy?

When she starts baby talkin'
Then, I'll do baby talk, too, yeah man
I say, papa's little hootsie, tootsie, wootsie
Your daddy do love you

You know what I'm talkin' about then?

Wish for a night in June
And my feeling come so soon
That's the way I do
When I want to make love

Get it now boys, get it now

And if she starts t' baby talkin'
Then, I'll do baby talk, too
I'll say-a, papa's little hootsie, tootsie, wootsie
And your daddy do love you, yeah

And I wish for a night in June
And my dream, you come so soon
That's the way I do
When I want to make love
