I'm worried, worried as a man can be 
I'm worried, worried as a man can be 

Worried 'bout my baby, she gone away from me 
I'm worried about my baby, I wonder where she gone 
Worried about my baby, and I wonder where she gone 
I hope some day, my baby will come back home, oh yes 

I hope someday, my baby love is gonna return 
Hope someday, my baby love will return 
If she don't come back to me, 
My whole live will go to ruins
