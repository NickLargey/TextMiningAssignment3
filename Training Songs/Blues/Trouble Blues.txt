So many tears
Since you went away
I'll always think of you
Each night and day

Someday, someday, my darlin'
I won't be troubled no mo'

Trouble, trouble
Has its misery
Already had
The best of po' me

Someday, someday, my darlin'
I won't be troubled no mo'

You heard my story
I'll sing my song
'Bout you leavin' po' me
You know that's wrong

Someday, someday, my darlin'
I won't be troubled no mo'
