Wake up early in the morning
I got you on my mind
Even a simple phone call would suit me just fine

Tears, tears and more tears
I can't help but keep on crying
Tears, tears and more tears
I can't get you off of my mind

You didn't say what happened
You just walked away
You've been nothing but sorrow
And a lot of rainy days

Tears, tears and more tears
Baby won't you please come home
Tears, tears and more tears
Oh you've been gone too long

I remember the good times
The good times we had
How can you leave all that behind
Like it was just another place you've had

Remember the time when we drank sweet wine
I thought that everything was fine
Remember the walk in the park
When we talked about love and peace of mind?
Remember the night when I held you tight
Let the world pass us by
Remember the day when I heard you say
We can make it if we try

Tears, tears and more tears
What happened to the love we had?
Tears, tears and more tears
I got the blues and I got them bad

Wake up early in the morning
I got you on my mind
Even a simple phone call would suit me just fine

Tears, tears and more tears
I can't help but keep on crying
Tears, tears and more tears
I can't get you off of my mind

Tears, tears and more tears
Baby won't you please come home
Tears, tears and more tears
Oh you've been gone too long
