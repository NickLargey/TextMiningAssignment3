So you think you`ll take another piece of me 
To satisfy you`re intellectual needs? 
(Do you want action?) 
Well, I think it`s time 'cause you`ve been pushing me 
You`d better recognize my superiority 

Liar (liar) Liar (liar) - You know you believe it 
Higher (higher) Higher (higher) - 'cause I`m the main man 

[Chorus:] 
And that`s why everyone wants a piece of the action 
Everybody needs the main attraction 
I`ve got what everybody needs - 
Satisfaction guaranteed 
Everybody wants a piece of the action 

Well, I was suicidal 'cause you was my idol 
Baby, baby, baby bring me to your knees 
Well there was a time I would`ve walked the line 
But you bled me dry with your insatiable greed 

Liar (liar) Liar (liar) - You know you believe it 
Higher (higher) Higher (higher) - 'cause I`m the main man 

[Chorus] 
Do you want (do you want?) 
Do you want action 
Everybody wants, everybody needs 
Everybody wants, everybody bleeds 
Let`s go! 

[Chorus]
