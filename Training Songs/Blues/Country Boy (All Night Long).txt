Don't say I don't love you
Because I stays out all night long

Don't say I don't love you
Because I stays out all night long

You know I'm a country boy
And I don't know what's going on

Don't say I don't love you
Because I will never treat you right

Don't say I don't love you
Because I will never treat you right

I may be a country boy

But I will always treat you right
