They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no'
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go

I'd rather be at home with ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no'
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
(Now rocking with the best Amy baby)

The man said 'why do you think you here?'
I said 'I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near'
He said 'I just think your depressed',
(The best Amy Amy)
Kiss me, yeah baby, and go rest

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no' (Yes)
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know

Young, uh
More money, more checks, I'm addicted to fresh
Six pair of kicks is my definition of 12 steps
Kick back in the back, get the phantom to drop
Bass blaring outta my system, that's how I detox
O when will he stop, he still pumping that real shit
My flow so dumb, my face is numb, nigga, I don't feel shit
Where's a therapist? Yeah, I'm outta control
They tryna make me go to rehab, I won't go, no
And so I'm addicted, I'm Britney, Whitney, and Bobby
Betty Ford ain't ready for us, ain't nothing can stop me
Oh look he's collapsing, just look how he's rapping
Every time I try to get out it pulls me back in
Amy should have rehabed him,'stead she doubled his ration
Can you blame me for being a slave to my passion?
My heroine flows more deeper than Marilyn's nose I'm an O.D.
'Til I'm in peace like Anna Nicole,
Hov!

I don't ever wanna drink again
I just ooh I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend
It's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go
