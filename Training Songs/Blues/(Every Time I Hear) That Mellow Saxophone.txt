I wanna mambo, sambo, do my number
Hold my baby all the summer
Every time I hear that mellow saxophone
I wanna rip it, rock it, really bop it
Flip it, flop it, Davy Crockett
Every time I hear that mellow saxophone
I wanna rock, rock, rock
Roll, roll, roll
Bop, bop, bop

I wanna rip it, rock it, really bop it
Whooo, Davy Crockett
Every time I hear that mellow saxophone

I wanna rock, rock, rock
Roll, roll, roll
Bop, bop, bop

I wanna mambo, snambo, do my number
Hold my baby all the summer
Every time I hear that mellow saxophone
I wanna rip it, rock it, really bop it
Flip it, flop it, Davy Crockett
Every time I hear that mellow saxophone
I wanna rock, rock, rock
Roll, roll, roll
Bop, bop, bop

I wanna rip it, rock it, really bop it
Flip it, flop it, Davy Crockett
Every time I hear that mellow saxophone
Every time I hear that mellow saxophone
Every time I hear that mellow saxophone
