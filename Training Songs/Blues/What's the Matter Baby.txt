What's the matter baby
You can't stay at home
What's the matter baby
You can't stay at home
There is nothin' good on street
So you must be doin' wrong, oh
You leave home in the morning
And come back the next night
You leave home in the morning
And come back the next night
You know you have a good man
But you not treat me right
One day baby I will find a trail
One day baby I will find a trail
Then I find me a big stick
And put it across your head
