I can't wait anymore
I can't wait anymore
You know that I will always get my way
I can't wait anymore
I can't wait anymore
What are you up to now to make me stay?

Baby, it's been too long for me
Baby, you're gonna be in my head
Maybe I need your hands tonight
Baby, you know how to do it right
I'm your girl

Baby, I've got the hots for you
Baby, you're turnin' me upside down
Maybe I'll give you all of me
Baby, I hope that you've got the key
Treat me good

I'm not takin' anyone
Wouldn't be the same
I've been looking for someone
Around 'n' around
