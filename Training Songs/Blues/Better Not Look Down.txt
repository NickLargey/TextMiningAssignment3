I´ve been around and i´ve seen some things
People moving faster than the speed of sound
Faster than the speeding bullet
People living like superman
All day and all night
And i won´t say if it´s wrong or if it´s right
I´m pretty fast myself
But i do have some advice to pass along
Along in the chorus of this song

Better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you don´t look down

An old girl friend of mine showed up the other day
That girl have lived in love and for love
And over love, and under love all her life
If the arrows from cupid´s bow that had
Passed through her heart had been sticking
Out of her body she would have looked like
A porcupine, and she asked me
B.b. do you think i´ve lived my life all wrong?
And i said: the only advice i have to pass
Along in the chorus of this song
Girl

Better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you don´t look down

I was walking down the street at sunrise one morning
In london, england
And there was a very large rolls royce limousine
Pulling slowly along the street
And in that rolls royce was the queen of england
Looking tired
Just go back from a party, and the queen leaned out and
She said: aren´t you b.b. king? she said:
Oh b.b., sometimes it´s so hard to pull things together
Could you tell me what you think i ought to do?
And i said:

Better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you don´t look down
