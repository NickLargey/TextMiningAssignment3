Organ grinder, organ grinder
Organ grinder, play that melody
Take your organ, grinder, and grind some more for me

Grind it north, grind it north
Grind it north, grind it east or west
But when you grind it slow, that's when I like it best

Organ grinder, organ grinder
You don't have to pass your hat around any more
'Cause you're just the grinder I've been waitin' for

Organ grinder, organ grinder
Your sweet music seems to ease my mind
It's not only your organ, but it's the way you grind

Organ grinder, organ grinder
Organ grinder, you've found that sweet lost chord
Start grindin', and grind your room and board

Organ grinder, organ grinder
Organ grinder, don't tell me you're through
'Cause if you want a little intermission
Then mama's gonna grind a while for you

Organ grinder, organ grinder
Organ grinder, I will give you anything you choose
If you'll just cure my organ, of those grinding blues
