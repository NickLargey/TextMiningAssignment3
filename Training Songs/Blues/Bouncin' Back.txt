Her name came up today
To my surprise
My eyes watered up
But I didn't cry

I pictured our good times
And I almost had a laugh

I'm finally bouncin' back
I'm finally bouncin' back, yeah

Fall and winter's gone
I've made it through the cold
Shivered through some storms
Rained all night all alone
I didn't like that

I can see that silver lining
I see it now at last

I'm finally bouncin' back
I'm finally bouncin' back
I'm finally bouncin' back

Last week, I took her name
Off my mailbox
Threw out some shoes and clothes
She left behind

I even took her picture
Off of my dresser
I believe these are very good signs
I believe these are very good signs
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I've got the urge to sing again
I've got the urge to dance
I can see myself again
Giving love just one more chance

I've been away too long
Way off track

I'm finally bouncin' back
I'm finally bouncin' back
I'm finally bouncin' back

I've been away too long
Way off track

And I'm finally bouncin' back
I'm finally bouncin' back

I've got the urge to dance
I believe that I'll
Give love just one more chance
