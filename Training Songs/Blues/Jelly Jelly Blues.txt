Hello baby, I had to call you on the phone
Hello baby, I had to call you on the phone
`Cause I feel so lonesome
And daddy wants his baby home

It's a down-right rotten,
Low down dirty shame
It's a down right rotten
low down dirty shame
The way that you're treatin' poor me
I know I'm not to blame

Jelly jelly jelly
Jelly stays on my mind
Jelly jelly jelly
Jelly stays on my mind
Jelly roll killed my pappy,
And wrung my mama stone blind.
