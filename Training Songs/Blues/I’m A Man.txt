Well, you pretty women
Standing in line
Make love to you, baby
In an hour's time

Now I'm a man
I spell M-A-N, ooh

The line I shoot
Will never miss
Make love to you, baby
You can't resist

Now I'm a man
I spell M-A-N
Man

Goin' back down
To Kansas too
Bring back a little girl
Just like you

Now I'm a man
I spell M-A-N
Man
