We may not have a cent
To pay the rent
But we're gonna make it
We may have to eat beans everyday
But we're gonna make it
And if a job is hard to find
And we have to stand
In the welfare line
I've got your love
And I know you got mine
And we're gonna make it

We may not have a home
To call our own
But we're gonna make it
I know we will
We may have to fight hardships alone
We're gonna make it, I know we will
'Cause togetherness
Brings peace of mind
We can't stay down all of the time
I've got your love
And you know you've got mine
And we're gonna make it
I know we will

The car may be old
Our two rooms cold
But we're gonna make it
And though we can't spare
A roach a crumb
But we're gonna make it
I know we will
And if I have to carry around a sign
That says, "Help the deaf
The dumb and the blind"
I've got your love
You know you've got mine
We're gonna make it
I know we will

We may not have a home
Just to call our own
But we're gonna make it
I know we will
We may have to fight hardships alone
But we're gonna make it
I know we will
'Cause togetherness
Brings peace of mind
We can't stay down all of the time
I've got your love
You know you got mine
We're gonna make it
I know we will

We're gonna make it

We're gonna make it, baby
I know we're gonna make it, baby
