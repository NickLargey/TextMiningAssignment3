Stealin', stealin', pretty mama
Don't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my
Same old used to be

Now, put your arms around me
Like the circle round the sun
I want ya to love me, mama
Like my easy rider done

If you don't believe I love ya
Look what a fool I've been
If you don't believe I'm sinkin'
Look what a hole I'm in

Stealin', stealin', pretty mama
Don't ya tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my
Same old used to be

I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama
Don't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my
Same old used to be

The woman I'm lovin'
She just my heigh-th and size
She's a married woman
Come to see me sometimes

If you don't believe I love you
Look what a fool I've been
If you don't believe I'm sinkin'
Look what a hole I'm in

I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama
Don't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my
Same old used to be

I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama
Don't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my
Same old used to be

Stealin', stealin', pretty mama
Don't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my
Same old used to be.
