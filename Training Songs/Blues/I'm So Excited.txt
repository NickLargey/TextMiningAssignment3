I get so excited, baby, see you walkin' down the street
I get so excited, darlin', see you walkin' down the street
Babe, I get so excited, darlin'; just can't help myself

My mama, oh, she told me to leave you alone
My mama, oh, she told me to leave you alone
But my mama didn't know what you were puttin' down, oh no

Night time is the right time
To be with the one you love
You know when night come, baby, I know
You so far away

So excited, darlin', when you're not around
I get so excited, baby; don't know what to do, all right

If I can't be with you, baby, I don't want nobody else
If I can't be with you, baby, I don't want nobody else
I get so excited, baby, walkin' down the street
