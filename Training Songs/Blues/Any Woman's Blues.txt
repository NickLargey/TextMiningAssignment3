My man ain't acting right, he stays out late at night
And still he says he loves no one but me
But if I find that gal, that tries to steal my pal
I'll get her told, just you wait and see
I feel blue, I don't know what to do
Every woman in my fix is bound to feel blue too, 'cause

I love my man better than I love myself
Lord, I love my man better than I love myself
And if he don't have me, he won't have nobody else

My man's got teeth like a lighthouse on the sea
My man's got teeth like a lighthouse on the sea
And everytime he smiles, he throws them lights on me

His voice sounds like chimes, I mean the organ kind
His voice sounds like chimes, I mean the organ kind
And ev'rytime he speaks his music ease my troubling mind
