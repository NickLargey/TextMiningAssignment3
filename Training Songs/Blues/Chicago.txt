I'm sorry
I missed your party
Retarded, yeah
Retarded

My words only seem half hearted
Then there's this guy who writes you and tells you
He's better than me and
He's gonna have you

Yeah
He's gonna have you
I'm sorry
I'm in Chicago

It's crushing me into a bundle
Then I look at the stars in the sky
Made out to you by some guy we both know
And pretty soon you'll be high as a kite

Looking finer than ever
All alone I kiss my pillow goodnight
And I wish you were there
I'm sorry

I'm so pathetic
It's crushing me
But your smile is like an anesthetic
Then I look at the stars in the sky

Then I look at the starry sky
Yeah
He's gonna have you
Yeah

He's gonna have you
