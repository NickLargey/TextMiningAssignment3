I've got a whoopee mama
She makes whoopee all the time
I've got a whoopee mama
She makes whoopee all the time

She stays full of dope and liquor
And clowns all over town

Whoopee mama
I sho' been good to you
Whoopee mama
I sho' been good to you

But I've done got tired
Of the dirty way you do

My whoopee mama
Treats me like a slave
My whoopee mama
Treats me like a slave

I goin' to buy me an army special
And put my baby in her grave

I work all the summer
An' I work all the fall
But even spend the winter
In a dank of overhauls

Whoopee mama
You so unkind to me
But I'm sho' goin' to get you, baby
Yes, you wait and see

You told me that you loved me
An' I caught you in a lie
Smile the day you quit me, mama
That's the day you'll die

Whopee mama
I'm goin' to mow you down
I'm gonna send your beautiful body
To some lonesome buryin' ground
