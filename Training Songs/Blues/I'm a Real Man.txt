I'm a real man, got some real guitar I'm a real man,
I don't even know where the boys are
I don't mean to frighten you little girl 'cause you're so sweet and nice
I don't need to tell you twice

I'm a real man I got to rock like a real man
Don't get no shock from that elevator music in your computer program
How'd you like to rock with a real man

Real man baby,
I ain't lyin' just thirty-one years old now 
And I don't mind dying you can put the voodoo on me
Girl ain't nothin' I can't dodge check out this 
Lincoln in my garage kids these days, talkin' about
These young folks they're just about as wild 
As Pollyanna after she growed up man,
After a hard day in the coal
Mine, I sure don't want to live just 
About as dangerous as a junior executive

I'm a real man
I got to rock like a real man
Don't get no shock from that elevator music in your computer program
How'd you like to rock with a real man

Every dollar I earn, I turn around and I burn and if I land in jail,
I know a whole lot of women willing to pay my
Bail you might think I'm just some fool on a boast
But people are already talkin' now from coast to coast this
Ain't Dan Rather talking, I ain't no president's son but I know how to have my fun

I'm a real man
I got to rock like a real man
Don't get no shock from that elevator music in your computer program
How'd you like to rock with a real man
