Let's call it a day
If you don't love me now
That's all you have to say, I'll understand somehow
Let's call it a day
It seems that the thrill has gone
I'll let you go your way, and let your own

You treat me cool, I ain't no fool
I know you found somebody new
Made up my mind, I ain't the kind
To hang around and be another fool for you

Best you call, it a day
Your game has made me cry
Let's put the tears away
And let so-long be our goodbye

Lead

I won't sit around and be another fool for you

We should call, it a day
I promise, I promise I won't cry
When I hear you say this is our last goodbye
