You're breaking my heart 'cause you're leaving
You've fallen for somebody new
It isn't too easy believing
You'd leave after all we've been through

It's breaking my heart to remember
The dreams we depended upon
Your leaving is slow dying ember
I'll miss you my love when you're gone

I wish you joy though tear drops burn
But if some day you should care to return
Please hurry back and we'll make a new start
Til then you're breaking my heart

I wish you joy though tear drops burn
But if some day you should care to return
Please hurry back and we'll make a new start dear
Til then you're breaking my heart
