I don't even know your name
But I love you just the same
Darling, let me hold your hand
Till I make you understand

If you only, only knew
Just how much I love you
Loving you the way that I do
You'd take the night to love me too

I'm like the picture on the wall
Please don't let me fall
It's my heart I'm thinkin' of
So won't you please, please accept my love

If you let me be your slave
Your love, I'll cherish to my grave
And if you should die before I do
I'll end my life to be with you

I'm like the picture on the wall

Your love, I'll cherish to my grave
And if you should die before I do
I'll end my life to be with you
