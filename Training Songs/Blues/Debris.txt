Kids they watch everything you do
Kids they grow up to be like you
When your daddy left you standing there
Well, kid then you learned to disappear

You built a wall between you and the world 
You thought it could protect you from the hurt

If you’re lonely, come lay down with me
If you’re tired, baby, we can just go to sleep
You don’t have to stand alone in your debris

Spark a fire burning in your mind
Birthmark parents fighting all the time

You drown turning up the radio
Shot down looking for someone to hold you

When you were fifteen you ran from home
Don’t you think it’s time to let your childhood go

If you’re lonely, come lay down with me
If you’re tired, baby, we can just go to sleep
You don’t have to stand alone in your debris
If you’re thirsty, come drink from my cup
If you get scared baby you know I’ll back you up 
You don’t have to stand alone in your debris

Lay down your guns and set your spirit free
And know that you are loved and love is all you need 

You built a wall between you and the world 
Don’t you think it’s time to let your childhood go

If you’re lonely, come lay down with me
If you’re tired, baby, we can just go to sleep
You don’t have to stand alone in your debri
If you’re thirsty, come and drink from my cup
If you get scared baby you know I’ll back you up
You don’t have to stand alone in your debris
