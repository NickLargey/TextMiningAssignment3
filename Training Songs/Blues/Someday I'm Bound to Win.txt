Though you drivin' me away, baby
An' I ain't done nothin' wrong
Though you drivin' me away, babe
An' I ain't done nothin' wrong
Well, I hate to go an' leave you, baby
'Cause we've been together so long

Baby, though you never told me
I'm wise enough to know
Baby, though you never told me
I'm wise enough to know
From the way you're tryin' to do me, baby
I know you don't want me, no mo'

I tried to be a good looser
Some old day I'm bound to win
I tried to be a good looser
Some old day I'm bound to win
I may catch you when you're down, baby
And you may need my help again

Every bad luck fella
Has a good luck day sometime
Every bad luck fella, baby
Has a good luck day sometime
It may be cloudy today, mama
I know the sun is bound to shine
