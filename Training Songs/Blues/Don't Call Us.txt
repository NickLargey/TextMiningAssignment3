Ridin' in on your big horse you look me up and down
Starin' at me like I'm some kind of stranger in your town
And I was down and out needin' a friend
And you're one, you help me put my life back together again

Don't call us, oh we'll call you, I heard
Don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you

Don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you
Ooh oh, well we'll call you

I heard you fell from grace, tumbled from your throne
How does it feel now to be left all alone?
The tables have turned, it's sad but it's true
Now, you need somebody who will care for you

Oh, you need mamacita, [Incomprehensible] that is true
Oh, you need mamacita, but that is true

Oh, don't call us, oh we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you
I said, don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
Then we'll get in touch with you

Those same people you meet on the way up
Oh, are the same people you meet on the way down
Now tell me how does it feel
When you find yourself layin' there on the ground, oh yeah
Tell me now

Don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you
Don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you

Don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you
Don't call us, we'll call you

Get in touch with you
Get in touch with you
Get in touch with you

Don't, don't call us
Don't don't, we'll call you
Don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you

Don't call us, we'll call you
Don't call us, we'll call you
