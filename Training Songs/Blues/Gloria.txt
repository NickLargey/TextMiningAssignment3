Well, I saw her...she was walkin' down the street
She was looking mighty tasty...she was looking so good to me
So I walked up to her with my very best smile on my face
She just kinda laughed and said "are you through?
Can we get on, can we get on down to your place."
She come to my house
She come up my stairs
She tell me she need me
She look like she cares
She make me feel good
She make me feel good all night
She make me feel good
She make me feel all right
I said "baby...what's your name? "
I said "baby...what's your name? "

And she said g...l...o...r...i-i-i-i-i-i-a
G-l-o-r-i-a (gloooria)
G-l-o-r-i-a (gloooria)

You know, I saw her again...the very next day
She was walkin' on that same strip of road
And she was headin' my way
Now, I'll never forget the night before
In fact, I'll never forget that week
But there I sat, motionless, somber, silent, unable to speak
You see, to my sorrow, and to my shame
In all the excitement, I'd forgotten this girl's name
I said "baby...what's your name? "
I said "baby...what's your name? "
And she said g...l...o...r...i-i-i-i-i-i-a
G-l-o-r-i-a (gloooria)
G-l-o-r-i-a (gloooria)
