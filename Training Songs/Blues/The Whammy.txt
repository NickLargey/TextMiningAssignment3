I met a big woman 
With eyes of fury 
And the voice 
Is hard as stone 

Said she'd get me 
Couldn't live without me 
Said she'd use her mojo bone 

Wuaaaaaaaargh 
She put the whammy 
Whow, yes, yeaaaaaah 
She put the whammy 
Wuaaaaaaaargh 
She put the whammy 
On poor poor me 

Whow, wow, 
I'm walking sideways 
Oh, oh, my mind 
My mind's in neutral [?] 
Ooouh, she put the evil eyeball 
Dead on me, aah 

I bought a shotgun 
A great, big, long shotgun 
I put the bell upside her head 
I said ‘release me 
Hey there, woman, release me 
Or I'll blow the moonlight 
Clean through your bald head 

Wuaaaaaaaargh 
Whoaaargh 
She put the whammy 
Oh, the whammy 
Yeaaheah, yeeeaheah 
She put the whammy 
On poor poor me 
Wuaaargh, wuaaargh 
I'm walking sideways, 
Ooh, my mind's in neutral [?] 
Aaaargh, 
She put the evil eyeball 
Dead on me, wuaargh 

Moooan… 
Moooan… 
Moooan… 
Moooan…
