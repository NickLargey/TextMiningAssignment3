And I can't hide it
Because I'm maybe on the outside
She could be lost but I don't know the cost
So maybe I'll jump head first 

And I could be right
Yeah I could be wrong
Pick up the phone nobody's home
It's been four days since the last you know
I've got two days off and I'm feeling blue
Pat's done playing on the stereo
I've got nowhere else I need to go
And I know this lonely mess ain't blue
Pick up the phone cause I've got to know
I've gotta figure it out before it starts to show
And there's one chance left before it's blue
I take a shotgun ride to the corner bar
No telephone call I wonder where you are
And it's time for me tonight to paint the town blue

So she is gonna disappear
And leave me without a where or why (i don't know why)
She could be gone but I'm hoping that's wrong
So maybe I'll just lay awake

And I could be right
Yeah I could be wrong
Pick up the phone nobody's home
It's been four days since the last you know
I've got two days off and I'm feeling blue
Pat's done playing on the stereo
I've got nowhere else I need to go
And I know this lonely mess ain't blue
Pick up the phone cause I've got to know
I've gotta figure it out before it starts to show
And there's one chance left before it's blue
I take a shotgun ride to the corner bar
No telephone call I wonder where you are
And it's time for me tonight to paint the town blue
And I don't know but this feeling surrounds me
I'm not sure what it means
But I feel it just the same 
And it feels like this life is turning blue

Pick up the phone nobody's home
It's been four days since the last you know
I've got two days off and I'm feeling blue
Pat's done playing on the stereo
I've got nowhere else I need to go
And I know this lonely mess ain't blue
Pick up the phone cause I've got to know
I've gotta figure it out before it starts to show
And there's one chance left before it's blue
I take a shotgun ride to the corner bar
No telephone call I wonder where you are
And it's time for me tonight to paint the town blue

Faded blue faded blue well yeah yeah yeah
Faded blue faded blue well yeah yeah yeah
I'm so blue that I can't see through to you and I just keep getting so blue
Faded blue faded blue oh yeah
