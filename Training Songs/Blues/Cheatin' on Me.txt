You ain't the gal you used to be
You used to mean so much to me
You had me blind but now I see
I know, you been cheatin' on me

So, get your D's and your dosies's too
Be on your way, I'm through with you
I can't stand the way you do
I know, you been cheatin' on me

As good as I've been to you
You let the devil fool you
Hurray and Hallelujah
You know, you had it comin' to ya

Though there is nothing to confess
I have seen enough to know the rest
What I'm doin' in for the best
I know, you been a-cheatin' on me

Get it now
