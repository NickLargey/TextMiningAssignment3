You let me down
All over town
I guess by now I should be gone
Yet here I stand
Still in your hands
Cause you're the best I've ever known

I try and try to say good-bye
I just can't leave your love alone
And after you what will I do
I just can't leave your love alone

I walk away most everyday
Don't need a love that hurts me so
Then every night you get it right
Until I'm moaning soft and low

I try and try to say good-bye
I just can't leave your love alone
And after you what will I do
I just can't leave your love alone
