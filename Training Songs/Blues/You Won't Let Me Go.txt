I want you and I need you
I'm all packed up to go
Darlin', if you love me
Ooh, you won't, you won't let me go

Your love for true love
Never runs smooth, you know
But if your love is a true love
You won't let me go

If you don't say you love me
I'm gonna walk right out the door
I'll hope that you'll stop me
So I can hear you call me, darlin', once more

I love you, yes, I love you
With all my heart and soul
Baby, if you love me
You won't let me go

If you don't say that you love me, baby
No, I'm gonna walk right out the door
I'll hope, hope that you'll stop me
So I can hear you call me, darlin' once more

Oh, I love you, yes, I love you
With all my heart and soul
Baby, if you love me
You won't let me go
