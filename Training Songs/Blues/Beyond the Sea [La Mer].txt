Some where beyond the sea, some
Where waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing
Somewhere beyond the sea she's there
Watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high then
Straight to her arms
I'd go sailing
It's far beyond the star, it's near
Beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt my heart will
Lead me there soon
We'll meet beyond the shore, we'll kiss
Just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea and
Never again I'll go sailing

It's far beyond the star-it's near
Beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt my heart will
Lead me there soon
We'll meet beyond the shore, we'll kiss
Just as before
Happy we will be beyond the sea and
Never again I'll go sailing
And never again I'll go sailing
And never again I'll go sailing
