From the little town I ran from
To the city where I strayed
There`s been some good time living
And some good music played
And some good loving made
I like it
I like it just that way
I want to roll roll roll forever
I want to feel the beat go on
I want to roll roll roll forever
I want to feel it till it`s gone
I want to roll roll roll forever
And live from song to song
Right there in the music
Is right where I belong
When I meet my Maker
With my music in my hand
He`ll smile down when He sees me
And ask about the band
I know He`ll understand
He knows life
And life can be so grand
I want to roll roll roll forever
I want to feel the beat go on
I want to roll roll roll forever
I want to feel it till it`s gone
I want to roll roll roll forever
And live from song to song
Right there in the music
Is right where I belong
