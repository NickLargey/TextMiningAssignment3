In the wake of every heartache
In the depth of every fear
There were diamonds, diamonds 
Waiting to break out of here.

Don’t you think I hear the whispers
Those subtle lies, those angry pleas
There just demons, demons
Wishing they were free like me.

We’re the fire, from the sun
We’re the light when the day is done
We are the brave, the chosen ones
We’re the diamonds, diamonds
Rising about the dust.

Oh oh, rising about the dust
Oh oh, rising about the dust
Oh oh, rising about the dust
Oh oh, rising about the dust

All your curses will surrender
Every demon worth will kneel
They’re just mountains, mountains 
about to turn into fields.

We’re the fire, from the sun
We’re the light when the day is done
We are the brave, we’re the chosen ones
We’re the diamonds, diamonds
Rising about the dust.

Oh oh, rising about the dust
Oh oh, rising about the dust
Oh oh, rising about the dust
Oh oh, rising, rising, rising, rising

You’ve taken down
So many others
Oh but you’ll know my name when you see
And in these ashes I’m stronger still
You’ll learn to feel my pain, yeah you will.

Oh oh, rising out the dust
Oh oh, rising out the dust

Oh oh

Oh oh, rising, rising, rising
