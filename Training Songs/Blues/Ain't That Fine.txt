I'm so glad I'm livin'
Everything is all right
I got lovin', baby
To come home to every night

Ain't that fine?
Ain't that fine?
Ain't that fine
'Cause she's mine?
Ain't that fine?

If money did my talking
I couldn't breathe a sigh
My baby's love is one thing
Even money can't buy

Ain't that fine?
I wanna tell you that's fine
That's divine
'Cause she's mine
Ain't that fine?

She's a tall, tandy model
A bundle of charms
But my baby beats the motto
'Cause she's got a pair of arms

Ain't that fine?
Don't you know that's fine?
Ain't that fine
'Cause she's mine?
Ain't that fine?

The higher cost of living
Doesn't bother me
As long as my baby's love is tax-free

Ain't that fine?
I wanna tell you that's fine
Ain't that fine
'Cause she's mine?
Ain't that fine?
