This world
Is going up in flames
And nobody
Wanna take the blame
Don’t tell me
How to live my life
When you
Never felt the pain

Oh, oh, oh
Come on babe
They don’t hear me cry
They don’t hear me try
They don’t hear me cry
For what I gonna do, yeah baby

I can’t turn my head away
Seeing all these things
The world
Is burning up in flames
And nobody
Wanna take the blame

You oh you
You oh you
Me oh me

They don’t hear me cry
They don’t hear me try
Don't stomp on that light

It’s killing me
Oh babe
Come on babe, get it right

Gotta be
A better world
Gotta make it baby
Gotta make it right

Ooh

Yeah, yeah, yeah baby, aha aha, oh baby
