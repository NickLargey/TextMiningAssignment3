Your cheating heart will make you weep 
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep 
But sleep wonÂ´t come the whole night through 
Your cheating heart will tell on you 

When tears come down like falling rain 
You'll toss around and call my name 
You walk the floor the way I do
Your cheating heart will tell on you

When tears come down like falling rain 
You'll toss around and call my name 
You walk the floor the way I do 
Your cheating heart will tell on you
