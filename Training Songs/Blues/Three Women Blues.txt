Got three womens
Yellow, brown and black
I got three womens
Yellow, brown and black

It'll take the Governor of Georgia
To judge one of these women I like

One for in the morning
One for late at night
One for in the morning
One for late at night

I got one for noontime
To treat your old daddy right

These blues at midnight
They don't leave me till day
These blues at midnight
They don't leave me till day

I didn't have none of my three women
To drive these blues away

One is a Memphis yellow
The other is a Savannah brown
One is a Memphis yellow
The other is a Savannah brown

One is a Statesboro dark skin
She'll really turn your damper down

Now if I had listen
To what my three women said
Now if I had listen
To what my three women said

I'd aâ€‘been home sleeping
In a doggone feather bed
