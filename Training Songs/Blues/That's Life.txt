That's life, that's what people say. 
You're riding high in April, 
Shot down in May. 
But I know I'm gonna change their tune, 
When I'm right back on top in June. 

That's life, funny as it seems. 
Some people get their kicks, 
Steppin' on dreams
But I just can't let it get me down, 
'Cause this big old world keeps spinnin' around. 

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, 
A poet, a pawn and a king. 
I've been up and down and over and out 
But I know one thing: 
Each time I find myself flat on my face, 
I pick myself up and get back in the race. 

That's life, I can't deny it, 
I thought of quitting, 
But my heart just won't buy it. 
'Cause if I didn't think it was worth a try, 
I'd have to roll myself up in a big ball and die.
