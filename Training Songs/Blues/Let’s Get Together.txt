I've been cooped up all alone
Barely breathing by the phone
Open up, open up, open up your mind
Let's get together
You and I

Oh oh oh come on
Oh oh oh there's something
Oh oh oh come on now
Oh oh oh we got something
I believe this is part of the start of something good
Let's get together
You and I

I know I been a bad girl
But deep inside I am a pearl
I believe, I believe that the good is on the rise
Let's get together
You and I

Oh oh oh come on
Oh oh oh there's something
Oh oh oh come on now
Oh oh oh we got something
I believe this is part of the start of something good
Let's get together
You and I

Come on boy
Let's get together again
You know, I've been missing you so
I know I let ya down
When I went out with your little brother danny
Last saturday night
But I was thinkin' about ya all the time
After all you are the one 

Oh oh oh come on
Oh oh oh this is something
Oh oh oh come on now
Oh oh oh we got something
I believe this is part of the start of something good
Let's get together
You and I

I believe this is part of the start of something good
Let's get together now
You and I
You and I
