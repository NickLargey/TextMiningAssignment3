Oh oh oh
Bless you for the good that’s in you, bless you every day
There’s some good in everybody, we’re just made that way
Good Morning, oh miserable, you’re not as bad as you make out
That frown don’t set right get right up and shout
Bless you for the good that’s in you, bless you every night
If you shine like a love light beamin’ you’ll make out all right
Now if any old evil comes around today, 
just turn it right around and chase it away
Bless you for the good that’s in you, bless you every day

You know that life is like an old steam engine, 
you can either go ahead, or in reverse
Now the road ahead may look pretty rocky, 
but the road behind is bound to be worse
If you close your eyes you won’t see the sunshine 
if you plug your ears you won’t hear a thing
And if you shut your heart you’ll shut out 
the feeling and there’ll never be any reason to sing
Bless you, yeah bless you, yes Bless you, yes bless you
That frown don’t set right get right up and shout
Oh bless you for the good that’s in you, bless you every night
If you shine like a love light beamin’, you’ll make out all right
If any old evil comes around today, turn it right around and chase it away
Bless you for the good that’s in you, bless you every day
Bless you, hmmm bless you, yes bless you
Bless you for the good that’s in you, bless you every day
