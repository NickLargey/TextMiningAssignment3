Jeepers, creepers, where'd ya get those peepers,
jeepers, creepers, where'd ya get those eyes?
Gosh all, git up, how'd they get so lit up,
Gosh all, git up, how'd they get that size?

Golly gee! When you turn those heaters on
woe is me, got to put my cheaters on.
Jeepers, creepers, where'd ya get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers, how they hypnotize!
Where'd ya get those eyes?
