Mini skirts and tight dresses,
You know they're so tight they can hardly wiggle
Ha, and big legs too you know)
Everywhere I go, there's a mini skirt there
Everywhere I go, there's a mini skirt there
Tight skirts, tight skirts, everywhere
Oh yeah
I go walkin' in the park, there's a mini skirt there
I go walkin' in the park, there's a mini skirt there
Mini skirt, tight skirts, everywhere
Yeah yeah, mini skirt, mini skirt, way up above the knee
Way up, above the knee, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, above
I go to strollin' in the park, I see mini skirts out there
I go out in the park, I see mini skirts out there
Mini skirts, mini skirts, everywhere
Yeah, look-a here now
I go walking down the avenue, I see out there, mini skirts
Way up 'bove the knee
Mini skirts, mini skirts, everywhere
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout, mini skirt
And tight, skirt,
And big legs
Strollin' down the avenue
I can't stand it
