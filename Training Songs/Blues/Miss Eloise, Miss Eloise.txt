Well, I gotta leave my baby, now
'Cause she won't leave these numbers 'lone
Well, I gotta leave my baby, now
'Cause she won't leave these numbers 'lone

She keep me worried and bothered, Lord
And troubled all the time

Lord, I work hard ev'ryday
And my baby, she won't let me be true
Well, I work hard ev'ryday, people
My baby just won't let me be true

My baby don't do nothin'
But play the races all the time
My baby plays five-forty-two
Here come, five-forty-nine

My baby told me this mornin'
Said, now her daddy go
God knows, God knows
I wasn't there no more

I say, ooh
Baby, how could I get 'ware, to the way you do
Well, I decided I would start workin'
My babe won't leave these numbers 'lone
No, she won't

Goodbye baby, gotta let you go
You won't leave these numbers, oh Lord
Leave, leave these numbers alone
