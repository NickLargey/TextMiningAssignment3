My baby treat me so mean
I don't know right from wrong
My baby treat me so mean
I don't know right from wrong
I'm here, today
But tomorrow I may be gone

I had so much trouble
Until I don't know what to do
I had so much trouble
Until I don't know what to do
The way you treat me, baby
Is comin' home to you

Because I'm dogged around
Baby, and drivin' from do' to do' 
Yeah
Baby, an driven from do' to do'
But I raise my hand
I won't be dogged no mo'

'Now boy, let's get this thing'

So good-bye, baby 
Yes, I'm leavin', now
So, bye-bye, baby
Babe, I'm leavin' now
Because you done me
Me, no good, now how.
