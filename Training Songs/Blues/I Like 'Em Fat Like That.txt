You know I like being surrounded by such voluptuosity,
Such pulchritude, to be mothered and smothered,
Basted in sweet sumptuousness.

Let the cats all criticize,
Joke about my baby's size,
She's reet with me because you see,
I likes 'em fat like that.

When she bounces down the street,
She's a whole heap of honey and ain't she sweet,
Feels so fine to know that she is mine,
I likes 'em fat like that.

You can have all those lean chicks tender and tall,
But when it comes to mean kicks,
A big fat momma's the best of all,
After I get through working well I reach and grab my hat,
And I hurry home,
Don't want her to be alone, coz
I likes 'em fat like that.

Tell me why do you like them

More bounce to the ounce

Say why do you like 'em?

More room to rump

How big do you like 'em?

Tons of fun

How wide do you like 'em?

Well, like that.

So you like 'em like that.

Yeah, I'm a chubby chaser.

Ooh, look at her go.

Don't try to run

Ooh, it must be jelly, 'cos jam don't shake like that.

You can have all those lean chicks tender and tall,
But when it comes to mean kicks,
A big fat momma's the best of all,

And I hurry home,
Don't want her to be alone, cause
I likes 'em fat like that,
Now thin may be in, but fat is where it's at!
