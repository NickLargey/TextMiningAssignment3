Left Chicago in the summer, New York in the fall
Detroit in the winter didn't prove a thing at all
I got those roamin' blues, yes, I got those roamin' blues
Can't find no place to settle, woo, I got those roamin' blues

Joined a club in old Saint Louis, that G.I. free loot club
Stood in line so long man, wore my legs down to a nub
I hit the road again, yes, I hit the road again
Can't find no place to settle, so I hit the road again

I thought I'd made it, Jack in good old Albuquerque
I was on the wrong track, you know they tried to make me work
Ain't that a killer? I hit the road right quick
Yes, that judge was much too slick
Can't find no place to settle, woo, I hit the road right quick

Then Las Vegas was the next stop, that fast town left me weak
The dice man made twelve passes and I was up the well-known creek
Those gamblers put me down, yes, I had to walk right out of town
Um, um, that ain't no place to settle, um, I had to walk right out of town

Ah, but I hit the greatest town of all, Frantic Frisco
Got me a gal with plenty gold, and she just won't let me go
I think I've found a place, yes, I got my boots all laced
Found me a home, don't have to roam
It's good news, I've lost those roamin' blues
