tried to treat you nice and kind
but you wouldn't pay that no mind
oh baby you don't seem to understand
that's your alibi
i believe you got another man
wait for you day and night
and try to do the things that right
oh baby
you don't seem to understand
let me hold your hand 
to get you to understand
