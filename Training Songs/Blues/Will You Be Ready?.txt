You need a life that shows
Every single day, every way
Light that glows
You need a life that shows

People deal with you every day
They see you come, and likewise go
They listen to the words that you say
What you stand they don't they know

A little upward show will let them know
It's the Lord you stand for
You need a life that shows
You need a to be a light,

(Light that glows)
Sometimes blending in is misunderstood
As being afraid, being ashamed
Take a stand my friend this you should

You belong to Jesus
Be proud your wearing His name
'Cause you are His go ahead be a witness
Go on and be a guiding light

You need a life that show
You're the only help that someone's ever know
So you need to be a light that glows
(You need a life that shows)

Let your light shine before all men
Let it shine, shine. 
Let it shine, shine. 
Let it shine, shine. 
Let it shine, shine.
