'S wonderful, 's marvellous, that you should care for me
'S awful nice, 's paradise, 's what I love to see

You made my life so glamorous; you can't blame me for feeling amorous
'S wonderful, 's marvelous, that you should care for me

C'est magnifique, 't is what I seek, that you should care for me
C'est elegant, 't is what I want, 't is what I long to see

My dear, it's four leaf clover time, from now on my heart's working overtime
'S exceptional, no bagatelle, that you should care for me
