Went ballin' the other night
Started drinkin' and got real tight
I blew each and all my friends
Felt so good, I had to blow again

I said, "Hey, bartender
Hey man, looka here"
Draw, one draw, two draw
Three, four glasses of beer

Saw a chick sittin' on the end
I said, " Baby, can't we be friends
You're looking sweet as you can be
Come on down and drink with me"

I said, "Hey, bartender
Hey man, looka here"
Draw, one draw, two draw
Three, four glasses of beer

We were having so much fun
Didn't know it was half past one
Sat down to have one more
Looked the clock and it was almost four

I said, "Hey, bartender
Hey man, looka here"
Draw, one draw, two draw
Three, four glasses of beer

Juke box playin' and everything
All the cats began to sing
I heard somebody called, said
Last round for alcohol

I said, "Hey bartender, hey bartender
Hey bartender, hey bartender
Hey bartender, hey bartender
Draw one, two, three, four glasses of beer"
