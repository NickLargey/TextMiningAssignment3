I can't quit lovin' you
I can't quit, darling
I'm hypnotized by the things that you do

You lift me up when I'm feeling down
Make me forget why I'm blue
There's no need to wake me up now, baby
I belong to you

I can't quit lovin' you
I can't quit, darling
I'm mystified by the way that you do

All my life I've been looking
But always in vain
Now all of that's changed, baby
Since I have you, since I have you

Oh, I'm not lying
I've been trying to feel as good as I do
Daytime, midnight and morning
I wouldn't be alive without you

I can't quit lovin' you
Not gonna quit ya, darling
I'm paralyzed by the things that you do

All my life I've been lookin'
But always in vain
Now all of that's changed, baby
Now that I have you
All of that has changed, baby
Now that I have your love

There's no need to wake me up
No, no, no, no
No, no, never gonna give you up
No, I can't do it
No, I can't quit
Never gonna give you up
No, no, no, no
