If I give up my friends I've known
And in return you give up yours
Before we think what would we do later on
What kind of life would we have
Just in case we both are wrong?

I could give up my woman, you can give up your man
But it don’t make sense to take the chance
Before we think what would we do later on
What kind of life would we have
Just in case we both are wrong?

They said love is a gamble, we know it’s true
Why gamble on me and why should I own you?
Before we think what would we do later on
What kind of life would we have
Just in case we both are wrong?

If I give up those friends I'd known
And in return you give up yours
Before we think what would we do later on

What kind of life would we have
Just in case we both are wrong?
What kind of life would you have
Just in case we both are wrong?

We better think, we better think, oh, oh, yes
We better think, we better think
We better think, we better think
What life would we have
In case we both are wrong?

We better think, think, think
Think, think, think, think, think
What kind of life would we have
Just in case we both are wrong?

We better think, think
Think, think, oh, think
