Babe, we got to have little talk
I ought to pack up my things an walk
I know a dollar goes hand to hand
Before I met you, go from man to man
I'd rather drink muddy water or
Sleep in a hollow log

'Yas, yas'

What's the use, just like a Georgia mule
My friends laughed
And they called me a fool
Your kisses are as sweet as can be
Before I'll let you make a sap out of me
I'd rather drink muddy water or
Sleep in a hollow log

'Beat it out there, papa
'What I'm talkin' about there'

(guitars & bass)

Love you baby but you won't be fair
You don't know how to be on the square
Have your fun baby if you must
Before I'll have a woman, I can't trust
I'd rather drink muddy water or
Sleep in a hollow log

'Yas, yas'

(Da, da-da-da, da-da)
(Da, da-da-da, da-da)

'Play it!'

(Da-da-da)
(Da-da-da)
(Da-da-da)
(Da-da-da)
(Da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da).
