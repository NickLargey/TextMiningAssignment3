I once lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money I didn't care
Always taking my friends out for a good time
Buying champagne, gin and wine

But just as soon as my dough got low
I couldn't find a friend no place I go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna squeeze it and squeeze it till the eagle grins

Nobody wants you when you're down and out
In your pocket not one penny
And your friends you haven't any

And soon as you get on your feet again
Everybody is your long lost friend
It's mighty strange, without a doubt
But nobody wants you when you're down and out

You know folks, I once had a mansion
Sitting way up on the side of a hill
I'd give champagne and caviar parties
Just for fun and to get a thrill

But the wrong folks made it in my town
They finally got in
And now I can't muscle up enough money
To buy a shot of gin

But you know, if I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna squeeze it and squeeze it
And squeeze it till the eagle grins

It's mighty strange without a doubt
But nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants you when you're down and out
