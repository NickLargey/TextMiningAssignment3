AUNT RHODY
Go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody,
Go tell Aunt Rhody that the old gray goose is dead.
The one she's been saving to make a feather bed.
The old gander's weeping, because his wife is dead.
The goslings are mourning, because their mother's dead.
She died in the mill pond from standing on her head.
Go tell Aunt Rhody that the old gray goose is dead.

Traditional, from old France. Some say the philosopher Rousseau
Had a hand in its making.
