I've got the key to the highway
Yes, I'm billed out and bound to go
I'm gonna leave here runnin'
'Cause walking's just too slow

I'm going back to the border
Where I'm better known
'Cause you haven't done nothin'
But broke up our happy home

Now give me one more kiss, baby
Yes, before I go
'Cause when I leave here this time, baby
I 'clare I won't be back no more

So long, goodbye
Yes, I have to say goodbye
'Cause I'm gonna walk, walk this old highway
Until the day I die
