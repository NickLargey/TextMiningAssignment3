She's dressed up like a swedish queen
With her hair piled on her head
She's got the boots jacked up, dressed on the right
The woman is heading ? ? ? ? ? ? type
She drives up in her daddy's porche
With her poodle at her toes
Allegator bag, seal in her hair
I wanna tell ya some more
I can't afford a horse, or a ride
I was ? ? ? ? ? ? a day in bed
The t.v. was on, the money was gone
Whiskey flowing in my head

She's a queen of the night
She's the queen of the streets
Anyway we want
Gotta king of the kings
I'm the king of the kings

She's the king of the night
She's the queen of the streets
Anyway we want
Gotta king of the kings
I'm the king of the kings

Ha!

She's a queen of the night
She's the queen of the streets
Anyway we want
Gotta king of the kings
I'm the king of the kings

She's the king of the night
She's the queen of the streets
Anyway we want
Gotta king of the kings
I'm the king of the kings

She looks up with her twilight eyes
Her ? ? ? ? ? ? are silver red
I got time to spare, cash to spend
It's time to place your bets
Sisters are fighting ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
Gonna burn up through the night
And when the sun comes up, I'll be on top
She gonna lose her sight {hey!}

She's the gleam of the night
She's the queen of the streets (ha!)
Anyway we want
Gotta king of the kings
I'm the king of the kings

She's the dream of the night
She's the queen of the streets
Anyway we want
Gotta king of the kings
I'm the king of the kings

(she's the) dream of the night
She's the queen of the streets (of the streets)
Anyway we want
Gotta king of the kings
King of the kings (woo)

She's a thing of the night
She's the queen of the streets
Anyway we want
Gotta king of the kings
King of the kings

She's a dream of the night
She's the queen of the streets
Anyway we want
Gotta king of the kings
King of the kings

She's the king of the night
She's the queen of the streets
