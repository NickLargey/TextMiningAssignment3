They call me the Hunter
And that's my name
A pretty girl like you
Are my only game

I bought me a love gun
Just the other day
And I aim
To aim it your way

Ain't no use to hide
No there ain't no use to run
'Cause I got you in the sights of my
My love gun, my love gun, my love gun
God-dammed!

The first time I saw you
Walkin' down the street
I said to myself
"Boom! Boom! Ain't she sweet!"

I got my love gun loaded
Loaded with a-huggin' and kissin'
And when I pull the trigger
There ain't gonna be no missin'

Ain't no use to hide
No there ain't no use to run
Cause I got you in the sights of my
My love gun, my love gun, my love gun
God-dammed!
