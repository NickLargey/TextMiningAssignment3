Got a fine looking woman
I call her, 'That gal of mine'
Yes, she's a fine looking woman
I call her, 'That gal of mine'
Yes, the reason I love her
Because she is dressed so fine

Well, she's a fine looking woman
And she lives across the town
Well, a fine looking woman
And she lives across the town
Yeah, my baby's trying to leave me
She's trying to put me down

Hey, it's bye bye baby
Bye bye and fare you well
Yeah, it's bye bye baby
Bye bye and fare well
Well, what I'm gonna do now
Baby, that's hard to tell

Hey, it's bye bye
Bye bye baby, bye
Well, I'll go bye bye baby
Bye bye bye baby, bye bye
Yes, since you're gonna leave me
I have no need to cry
