Oh yeah, the woman she's livin' on a poor man's pay, 
I bought my babe a mink coat, 
With fur just to match her hair 
When I asked her out for dinner, 
She said, "Oh this is just common wear" 
I work hard on two jobs, 
And I make overtime every day 
Oh, you know I got a, I got a rich man's woman, 
But she's livin' on a poor man's pay 
I bought my babe a Cadillac, 
She said, "That's just a common gift" 
When she passes me walkin' on the streets, 
She refuse to give me a lift 

I told you I work hard on two jobs, 
And I make overtime every day 
Oh, you know I got a, I got a rich man's woman, 
But she's living on a poor man's pay 
There ain't no use for you to argue, 
Just go ahead and let the girl have her way 
Even if she's a rich man's woman, 
And I know she's livin' on a poor man's pay 
I told you I work hard on two jobs, 
And I make overtime every day 
Oh, you know I know I got myself a rich mans woman, 
But the woman she's livin' on a poor man's pay
