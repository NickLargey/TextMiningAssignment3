Let's make it, let's make it, baby
Let's make it, oh, right now, oh, yeah
Let's make it, oh, baby, me and you
I don't care what the world may say
Let's make it, let's make it
Let's make it, oh, babe, oh
Oh, yeah, not your mother or you
Not your sister or me and you
Let's make it, right now
Let's get it while gettin' it, it's good, oh
Let's make it, let's make it, baby
We ain't sayin' nothin'; we ain't sayin' a thing
Let's make it, me and you
Let's make it, let's make it, let's make it
