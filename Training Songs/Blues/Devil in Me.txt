There’s a girl in Shelbyville,
Gave her life to Jesus.
First Antioch Baptist Church
Where her daddy preaches.
She's pretty as her mama,
she's only 23.
She could be angel
Lord, cause she's bringing out the devil in me.

Lord forgive me for what i’m thinkin.
Its Saturday night and i'm high and I been drinkin,
But Tomorrow morning across the aisle,
I look over and see her smile,
Bow my head and the choir sings,
Lord forgive me, she's bringin out the devil in me

Sundress on a willow tree,
Moon on the water.
I know the Lord’s been good to me,
when I look at the preachers daughter
She's my Delilah,
she brings me to my knees,
she could be an angel, cause she's bringing out the devil in me.

Lord forgive me for what i’m thinkin.
Its Saturday night and i'm high and I been drinkin,
But Tomorrow morning across the aisle,
I look over and see her smile,
Bow my head and the choir sings,
Lord forgive me, she's bringin out the devil in me.
