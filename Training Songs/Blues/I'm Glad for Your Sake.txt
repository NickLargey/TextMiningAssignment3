You've found a new love
And you say it's divine
I've glad for your sake
But I'm sorry for mine

I hear you saying
It's the real thing inside
I'm glad for your sake
But I'm sorry for mine

Oh, how it hurts my pride
To have to step aside
And watch somebody new
Taking my place with you

But if you're happy
I don't care if I pine
I'm glad for your sake
But I'm sorry for mine
I'm glad for your sake
But I'm sorry for mine
