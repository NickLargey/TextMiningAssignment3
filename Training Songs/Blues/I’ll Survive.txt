You say you're leaving, you've shattered my dreams
All of our plans dear, forgotten it seems
Yes, it had to happen
I'm not surprised, but I'll, I'll survive

Your friends have shown you a better way
All my years of loving you, ending today
Yes, you go on, darlin'
I'll dry my eyes, but I'll, I'll survive

Go on, may god bless you
It was fun, while it was fun
Have fun, baby, I hate to lose you
It's all over, what's done is done

Yes, go on darlin', seek your fortune and fame
Yes, your good luck or bad luck, baby
Your friends must take the blame
Oh, I can't beg you, baby
I've got too much pride, but I'll, I'll survive

Oh, I'll, I'll survive
