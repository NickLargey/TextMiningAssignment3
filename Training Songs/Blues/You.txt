Sometimes when I look around 
At people who are lonely 
I feel a sense of sadness deep inside 
It makes me wonder how I got along 
Before I found you 
And what I'd do if you should turn around 
And say goodbye 
 
Cause baby you 
You're what I'm living for 
I couldn't have asked for more 
Right from the moment that I found you 
I knew that you 
You were the one for me 
The one who could make me see 
This world could be a brighter place 
 
Sometimes when I think about 
The friends I left behind me 
I feel a sense of sadness deep inside 
It makes me wonder how I knew 
That one day you would find me 
And what I'd do if you should turn around 
And say goodbye 
 
'Cause baby you 
You're what I'm living for 
I couldn't have asked for more 
Right from the moment that I found you 
I knew that you 
You were my brightest star 
And whether you're close or far 
You're always here inside my heart 
 
'Cause baby you 
You're what I'm living for 
I couldn't have asked for more 
Right from the moment that I found you 
I knew that you 
You were my brightest star 
(You were my brightest star) 
And whether you're close or far 
You're always here inside my heart 
 
Yes, baby you 
You're what I'm living for 
I couldn't have asked for more 
Right from the moment that I found you 
I knew that you 
You were the one for me 
(You were the one for me) 
The one who could make me see 
This world could be a brighter 
This world could be a brighter 
With you this world's a brighter place
