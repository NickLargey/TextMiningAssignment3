Oh, stingy Ginny saved up all her pennies
Straight to the bank she would go
The sharks would have their hands around her
But none could get her dough

Ginny's fellow was a slick high yeller
Sent away to jail one day
He cried for bail then turned real pale
When I heard Ginny say

I've got what it takes
But it breaks my heart to give it away

It's in demand, they want it everyday
I've been saving it up for a long, long time
To give it away would be more than a crime

Your eyes may roll, your teeth may grit
But none of my money will you get
You can look at my bank book
But I'll never let you feel my purse

Oh the one woman
Who believes in safety first, safety first
And if you want my money, here's my plan
I'm saving it up for a real good man

I've got what it takes
But it breaks my heart to give it away
I've got what it takes
But it breaks my heart to give it away

It's in demand, folks crying for it every day
I've been saving it up for a long, long time
To give it away would be more than a crime

Your eyes may roll, your teeth may grit
But none of this small change will you get
You can look at my bank book
But I'll never let you put your hands on my purse

Lord, I'm one woman
Who believes in safety first, safety first
And if you want my money, here's my plan
I'm not saving it up for those naked man

I've got what it takes
But it breaks my heart to give it away
