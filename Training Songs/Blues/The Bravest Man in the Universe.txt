The bravest man in the universe
Is the one who has forgiven first
The bravest man in the universe

I got a story I want to tell
Gather round me
Gather round me boys and girls

I once was lost
But now I’m found
When I beer up so high
I always know how to come down

The bravest man in the universe
Is the one who has forgiven first
Yeah
Shame on me, shame on you
It’s up to us
What we say and what we do

Would you stay in the sun
Would you stay in the sun much too long
You try to find the shade
Shade that makes you feel at home

The bravest man in the universe
Is the one who can forgiven first
The bravest man in the universe
Oh ah
The bravest man in the universe
