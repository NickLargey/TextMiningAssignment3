Why don't we get along
Everything I do is wrong
Tell me what's the reason
I'm not pleasing you

I may kiss you but then
You don't never say, kiss me again
Tell me what's the reason
I'm not pleasing you

If you must keep me in doubt
How would I know what to do
You can change me about
I'll be what you want me to

So, I tried, yes, I tried
Still you're never satisfied
Tell me what's the reason
I'm not pleasing you
