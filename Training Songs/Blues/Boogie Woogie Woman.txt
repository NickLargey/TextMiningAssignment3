Boogie-woogie all the time
I got a boogie-woogie woman
Boogie-woogie all the time
If she keep on boogyin`

Well, she boogies in the mornin`
And she boogies all night long
Well, she boogies in the mornin`
And she boogies all night long
Yes, and the...come
She`s still goin` strong
Well, she boogies in the mornin`
And she boogies late at night
Well, she boogies in the mornin`
And she boogies late at night
Well, I don`t mind her boogyin`
`Cause her boogyin` is all right
Well, she`s a bogie-woogie woman
And she boogies all the time
Well, she`s a bogie-woogie woman
And she boogies all the time
Well, if keep on boogyin`
She bound to lose her mind
