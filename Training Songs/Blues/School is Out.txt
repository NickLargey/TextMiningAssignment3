(Anderson/Barge/Guida/Royster)
(C) - (F) - (G)

(C) No more books and studies
And I can (F) stay out late with my buddies
(C) I can do the things that I wanna do
'Cause (G) all my cares are through
I can (C) root for the Yankees from the bleachers
And don't (F) have to worry 'bout teachers
And (C) I'm so glad that school is out
Well, (G) I'm gonna sing and (C) shout!

CHORUS:
(School is (G) out)
Everybody's gonna have some fun
(School is (C) out)
Everybody's gonna jump and run
(School is (G) out)
Come on, people, don't you be late
(School is (C) out)
I just got time to take my girl out on a date
(C) School is out at last
And (F) I'm so glad I passed
(C) Everybody come and go with me
We're gonna have a night with (G) Daddy G

People, are you ready, people, are you ready
For the show time, show time that's in your town ?
People, are you ready, people, are you ready
For the show time, show time that's in your town ?
