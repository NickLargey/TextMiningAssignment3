In the evening, after the sun goes down 
In the evening, after the sun goes down 
The womens all tell me I'm the sweetest man in town 
Now I've got a little woman, she's got money, marbles and chalk 
She bought me a fine Cadillac, man, that's why I don't have to walk 
In the evening, after the sun goes down 
The womens all tell me I'm the sweetest man in town 
I've got a little woman, she's just as sweet as she can be 
I wants the whole world to know, she's all right with me, 
when in the evening, after the sun goes down 
The womens all tell me I'm the sweetest man in town
