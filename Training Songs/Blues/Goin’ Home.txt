Goin' home tomorrow
Can't stand your evil way
Goin' home tomorrow
Can't stand your evil way
When you're around me
I'm full of misery all day

I can't go on
I can't go on this way
I can't go on
I can't go on this way
You don't want my lovin'
So I'm goin' away to stay

Don't try to find me
Don't even call me on the phone
Don't try to find me
Don't even call me on the phone
I'm better off without you
So won't you leave poor me alone
