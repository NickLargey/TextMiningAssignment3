Baby it's a cold hard world out there 
Broken hearted people everywhere 
Takin' whatever love they get 
I don't want to wind up like that, so 

[Chorus:]
Baby throw your arms around my neck 
Lay your pretty head against my chest 
Listen to one heartbeat then the next 
Cause baby I don't want to lose you yet 

You know I love you and I know you love me 
It's everything that love's supposed to be 
But I don't want to look up one day 
And find out we let it slip away 

[Chorus ]

Can't tell you nothin' 'bout love I guess 
That you don't already know 
But girl, when you're in my arms like this 
I don't ever want to let you go 

Baby maybe I'm wrong but what it I'm right 
And everything's depending on us tonight 
Maybe we'll pass this way again 
But honey I don't want to wait 'til then, so 

[Chorus]
