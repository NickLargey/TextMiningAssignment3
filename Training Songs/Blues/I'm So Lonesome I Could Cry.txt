Hear that lonesome whippoorwill 
He sounds too blue to fly
That means he's lost the will to live 
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a night so slow 
As time goes draggin' by
The moon just went behind the clouds 

To hide its face and cry
The silence of a falling star 
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are 
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry 
I'm so lonesome I could cry
