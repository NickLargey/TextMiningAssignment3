There's nothing that I know here on this earth good enough for you 
So if I want to show you all you're worth, 
I'd have to try shopping up in the sky. 

I'll buy you a star, 
Not just a star but the best one in the sky. 
You'll have a cloud to sleep on, 
A cloud as light as an angel's sigh. 
A fine silver chain made from the rain of a summer afternoon. 

I'll buy you a star my darling 
But I won't rest until I buy the moon. 
A fine silver chain made from the rain of a summer afternoon. 

I'll buy you a star my darling 
But I won't rest until I buy the moon. 
But I won't rest until I buy the moon.
