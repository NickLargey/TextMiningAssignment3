Now here it is three o' clock in the mornin'
Can't even close my eyes
Oh, three o' clock in the mornin', baby
Can't even close my eyes
Well, I can't find my baby
Lord, and I can't be satisfied

Lord, I've looked around me
Whoa, my baby can't be found
Whoa, looked all around me, people
Whoa, my baby can't be found
Well, if I don't find my baby
I'm goin' down to the boilin' ground, that's where the mens hang out

Well, I'm bound to find her
Yeah
Come here, baby

Well, goodbye, everybody
Lord, I believe this is the end
Oh, goodbye, everybody
Lord, I believe this is the end

Well, you can tell my baby
To forgive me for my sins
