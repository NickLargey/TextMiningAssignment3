My song is a serious matter
It reflects what i feel
If i say i love you, i mean it
`cause in my song
Every line is for real

Every man or woman
Enjoys going home
To a peaceful situation
To give love and receive love
Without any complications

Whether my tune is short or long
Whether my lyrics are weak or strong

I like to live the love
That i sing about in my song
I like to live the love
That i sing about in my song

Music is love
And my love is music
In perfect harmony
So when i sing
I have sung all about
The love of you and me

I never got angry with my guitar
`cause when i strike a chord
It gives me what i want to hear
So i'm finding out that
We are quite like my song together, my dear

Outside answers
Should always be forbidden
Problems should be solved
And never hidden

I like to live the love
That i sing about in my song
I like to live the love
That i sing about in my song
