He fills the room like champagne
Into an empty glass
As they slither to him like snakes
Through the grass

His stance is quiet with grace
Before they throw him into the rat race
And he turns to me to say I'm a lonely boy
Even with the life I asked for

Lonely boy, why don't you see
You're exactly the same as me?
You could be the most beautiful thing
That I ever did see with your head pointing down
And your friend's leaving town

He sung like an angel
That had stepped deep inside
While I payed my guitar
And scribed and cried

And the nails that we jam into our hearts
Are essential and needed for the part
And he turns to me to say, I'm a lot like you
Does that mean, boy, I'll be lonely too

Lonely boy, why don't you see
You're exactly the same as me?
You could be the most beautiful thing
That I ever did see with your head pointing down
And your friend's leaving town

Days are passing like November rain
Constantly falling but nothing here remains
And he turns to me to say I'm a lot like you
Does that mean, boy, I'll be lonely too

Lonely boy, why don't you see
You're exactly the same as me?
You could be the most beautiful thing
That I ever did see with your head pointing down
And your friend's leaving town

Your home getting high everyday
Don't you think it's strange?
