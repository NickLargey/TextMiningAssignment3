Can't Go On Without You

Can't believe that you've gone gone
Darlin' I was so wrong
Feelin' like I do
Can't go on without you
Darlin' now that you've gone gone
I don't wont to live on
Don't know what to do
Can't go on without you
You can tellin' me and tellin' me
Someday tears are cryin'
But I was the foolish one
To let you say goodbye
Sorry now that you've gone gone
I know I was so wrong
Feelin' sad and blue
Can't go on without you
