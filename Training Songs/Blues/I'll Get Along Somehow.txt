Many months have come and gone 
Since you called me on the phone 
To tell me that we were threw
You'd thought it would break my heart
But I fooled you from the start
Because I never did trust you

Well you'd thought you're mighty wise
To run around with other guys
And still sayin' you were still mine
While you had one or two 
I had a dozen more than you
So you got the foolin' that time

O let it rain and let it snow
I don't care no, no, no
I'll never worry now
You're the one that wasn't fair
Wasn't in you to play square
I'll Get Along Somehow

So you keep goin' you way
I'll keep traveling mine
At the end you'll need a friend
You'd be the one to sit and pine
So let it rain and let it snow
I don't care no, no, no
I'll Get Along Somehow

So you keep going you way
I'll keep traveling mine
But at the end you'll need a friend
You'd be the one to sit and pine
So let it rain and let it snow
I don't care no, no, no
I'll Get Along Somehow
