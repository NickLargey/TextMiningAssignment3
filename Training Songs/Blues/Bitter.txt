You push me away bitterly
My apologies fall on your deaf ears
You curse my name bitterly
And now your eyes they look at me bitterly 

I stand ashamed amidst my foolish pride
â??Cause for us there'll be no more
For us there'll be no more
And now my eyes look at you bitterly
Bitterly bitterlyÂ
