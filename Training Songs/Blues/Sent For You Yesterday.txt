Don't the moon look lonesome
Shining through the tree?
Don't the moon look lonesome 
Shining through the tree?
Don't your arms look lonesome
When your baby's packed to leave?

Sent for you yesterday
Here you come today, today
Sent for you yesterday
Here you come today
If you can't do better
Might as well just stay away
