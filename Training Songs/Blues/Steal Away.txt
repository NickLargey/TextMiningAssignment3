When I left Tulsa
Jamie was an innocent young lady
God only knows why she gave herself
To a guy like you

She called me crying
And said she was
Gonna have your baby

But you just
Turned your back on her
Like all cowards do
And I swore I'd get you

Don't let the sun
Set on you in Tulsa
Don't let the sun
Set on you in Tulsa

If the sun goes down on you
And you're still here
You're going down too
Don't let the sun
Set on you in Tulsa

Jamie's the only thing
I ever really cared for
And she don't deserve
This kind of shame

She's carrying a child
That you're to blame for
But you just laughed and said
Ain't no way he's gonna get your name

And I swore I'd get you
For what you're putting her through
And believe me, brother
The only reason I ain't got you
Jamie cried and begged me not to

Don't let the sun
Set on you in Tulsa
Don't let the sun
Set on you in Tulsa

If the sun goes down on you
And you're still here
You're going down too
Don't let the sun
Set on you in Tulsa

Don't let the sun
Set on you in Tulsa
Don't let the sun
Set on you in Tulsa
