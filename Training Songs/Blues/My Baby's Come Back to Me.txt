Last time I saw her, there was a tear in her eye
Her voice gave a little quaver, when she tried to say good bye
Then the days grew dim, and the nights turned cold
My mind was as black as coal
She just walked back into my life, and brought a smile in my soul

My baby's come back to me
Ain't got the blues no more
My baby's come back to me 
The blues is out the door
My baby's come back to me
My baby's come back to me
She makes me feel so good

She was thinkin' about the future, she didn't see a light
The sadness of a love, that she didn't feel was right
She had to get away, and work her feelings through
She made the right decision, she knew what she must do

My baby's come back to me
Ain't got the blues no more
My baby's come back to me 
The blues is out the door
My baby's come back to me
My baby's come back to me
She makes me feel so good 
Yeah

My baby's come back to me 
Ain't got the blues no more
Mmmm y baby's come back to me 
The blues is out the door
My baby's come back to me 
My baby's come back to me
She makes me feel so good
She makes me feel so good
