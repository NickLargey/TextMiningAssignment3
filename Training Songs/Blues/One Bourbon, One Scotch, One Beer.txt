Want to tell you a story
About the house-man blues
I come home one Friday
Had to tell the landlady I'da lost my job

She said that don't confront me
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't get the rent
And out the door I went

So I goes to the landlady
I said you let me slide?
I'll have the rent for you in a month
Next I don't know

So said let me slide it on
I notice when I come home in the evening
She ain't got nothing nice to say to me
But for five year she was so nice

Loh' she was lovy-dovy
I come home one particular evening
The landlady said
You got the rent money yet?

I said no, can't find no job
Therefore I ain't got no money
To pay the rent
She said I don't believe

You're tryin' to find no job
Said I seen you today you was standin' on a corner
Leaning up against a post
I said but I'm tired,

I've been walkin' all day
She said that don't concern me
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't have the rent

And out the door I went
So I go down the streets
Down to my good friend's house
I said look man

I'm outdoors you know
Can I stay with you maybe a couple days?
He said let me go and ask my wife
He come out of the house

I could see it in his face
I know that was no
He said I don't know man
Ah she kinda funny, you know

I said I know,
Everybody funny, now you funny too
So I go back home
I tell the landlady I got a job,

I'm gonna pay the rent
She said yeah? I said oh yeah
And then she was so nice
Loh' she was lovy-dovy

So I go in my room,
Pack up my things and I go
I slip on out the back door
And down the streets I go

She a-howlin' about the front rent,
She'll be lucky to get any back rent
She ain't gonna get none of it
So I stop in the local bar you know people

I go to the bar, I ring my coat,
I call the bartender
Said look man, come down here,
He got down there

So what you want?
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
Well I ain't seen my baby
Since I don't know when

I've been drinking bourbon, whiskey,
Scotch and gin
Gonna get high man I'm gonna get loose
Need me a triple shot of that juice

Gonna get drunk don't you have no fear
I want one bourbon,
One scotch and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

But I'm sitting now at the bar
I'm getting drunk, I'm feelin' mellow
I'm drinkin' bourbon,
I'm drinkin' scotch,

I'm drinkin' beer
Looked down the bar,
Here come the bartender
I said look man, come down here
