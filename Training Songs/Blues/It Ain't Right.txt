You know it ain't right to treat me like you do
You know it ain't right to treat me like you do
When you don't want me to, do these things to you
You know it ain't right to treat me this-a way
You know it ain't right to treat me this-a way
Takes my money, and go off to play
You know it ain't right to say what you did
You know it ain't right to say what you did
You've got another man, and you can't keep it hid
You know it ain't right to stay out all night long
You know it ain't right to stay out all night long
I ain't got nobody, to carry my business on
