Don`t throw your love on me so strong.

Yeah,
Your love is like a faucet,
You can turn it off and on.
Hey baby,

What you been puttin` down.

Hey baby,
I like
What you been puttin` down.
Oh, but you can search
The whole world over
And no love like yours
Can be found.

Baby when you change your mind.
Well, someday baby,
Baby when you change your mind.
You can search
The whole world over
For me
And I`ll be hard to find.
