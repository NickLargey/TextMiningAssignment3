That's my girl
Take a look at her, she belongs to me
Yes, that's my girl
Hands off, don't touch

She looks just like an angel
But she's human all the same
So I'm not takin' chances
I won't tell her address or even her name

Cause that's my girl
I'm addin' her to my family
And I love that girl
And everything's fine

So until the day that she says yes
Keep my fingers crossed
Cause that's my girl
And she's gonna stay mine

That's my girl, you hear me
I'm addin' her to my family
And I love that girl
And everything's fine

So until the day that she says yes
Keep my fingers crossed
Cause that's my girl
And she's gonna stay mine

She's all mine, every curvy line
And even those dark brown curls
Now lay off, that's my girl
