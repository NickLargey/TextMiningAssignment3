Well, you had me, where you want me
Baby, did me like you pleased
But after ten long years
My heart began to get even

That's alright
Whoa, that's alright
S'alright the way ya doin' me
Baby, you'll be sorry one day

Well, whenever there was trouble
I was always around
But when ya got on your feet
You know, you put me down

That's alright
Whoa, that's alright
S'alright the way ya doin' me
Baby, you'll be sorry one day

Well, it's a-one thing 'bout the women
That I just can't understand 'em
Ev'rything they need
But still they wants another man

That's alright
Whoa, that's alright
S'alright the way ya doin' me
Baby, you'll be sorry one day

Well, when your troubles start to fallin', baby
Just like the rain
You're gonna need me, baby
Just to hold yo' hand

That's alright
Whoa, that's alright
S'alright the way you did me
Baby, you'll be sorry one day
