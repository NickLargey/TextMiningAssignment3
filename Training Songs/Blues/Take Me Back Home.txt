The first time you gave me freedom
For the first time I felt free
As long as you were right with me here
There’s nothing else that I would need

You take me back there
Take me back home, please
No, I can’t go in there
Just take me back home, home
Is where I wanna be

I was a fool before I met you
Only fools find it hard to believe
You just might be my only savior
If you are, then come and save me
If that’s true, come back and save me

You take me back there
Take me back home, please
No, I can’t go in there
Just take me back home, home
Is where I wanna be

Where all my stumbling misses
And all your wonderful kisses
That’s where I want to be
That’s just me

You take me back there
Take me back home, please
No, I can’t go in there
Just take me back home, home
Is where I wanna be
