Oh, stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by me, now baby, stand by me
Now stand by me
Oh baby, if you please

Now once you said you loved me
That we would never part
But now you want to leave me
You know you're gonna break my heart

But stand by me
Oh baby, stand by me
Stand by me
Oh baby, if you please

Now baby, you know I love you
You know I love you through
I love you so bad, honey
That I don't know what to do

But stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Stand by me
Oh baby, if you please

Get sick or worried
Time for worrying too
I gave you all of my money
I don't know what to do

Well, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Stand by me
Oh baby, if you please
