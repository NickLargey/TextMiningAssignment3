(Huddie Ledbetter)
(D) - (A) - (C) - (E)

(D) On a Monday, I was are (A) rested
On a Tuesday, I was locked up in (D) jail
On a Wednesday, my trial was at (A) tested
On a Thursday, nobody would go my (D) bail
(D) Al (C) most (A) done, I'm almost (E) done, (D) al (C) most (A) done
And I ain't gonna bring them yellow women no (D) pail

Take these stripes, stripes from around my shoulder
Take these chains, these chains from around my legs
Lord, these stripes, it sure don't worry me
But these chains, these chain's gonna kill me dead

Yes, I'm almost done, almost done, almost done
And I ain't gonna bring them yellow women no pail

On Friday, my baby went a-walking
On a Saturday, she locked me outa the door
On a Sunday, we were sitting down a-talking
On a Monday, she pawned all of my clothes
