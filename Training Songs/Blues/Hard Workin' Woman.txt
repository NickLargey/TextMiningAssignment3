Got a hard working woman, works hard all day long
Got a hard working woman, she works hard all the time
She's a hard working woman, I call her that gal of mine

Well, I went uptown and bought her clothes
My baby got my money, put me outdoors
She's a hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman, works hard all the time

Well, I bought her clothes and I bought her hair
My baby's gone, gone away somewhere
She's a hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman, works hard all the time

She works hard all day, doing the best she can
When you come home at night, she's got another man
She's a hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman, works hard all the time

Well, I give her my dough to spend on the line
When it comes to loving, she's the gal of mine
She's a hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman
Good loving mama, and I love her all the time
