You thought all I ever was, was through
(Oh-oh!)

You thought I'd be hurt when you left me, babe
But I found another thing, (owoo!)
Yeah, you thought I'd be hurt when you left me, babe
But I found another thing

But sometime what you lose,
Is nothin' compared to what you win

(Ow-ooo)

A good man may fall, babe (oh yeah)
But ya get back on your feet
(Yeah, I know, I know, I know)
You know, you know
A good man may fall, babe
You know ya get back on your feet
Yes, I've got a good thing goin' now woman
