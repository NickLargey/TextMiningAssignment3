To those of you seeking perfection
Oh Lord it's not a long, long way to go
All you need is a bit of reflection
Just might seem like changing direction right now
Don't go around taking up no collections
On your way down
There's nobody left to crown

What if politicians were all good guys
Oh Lord don't we wish they were
We would not be so dependent
On courts of laws that make us all feel like defendants sometimes
If we want freedom we've got to amend it
On our way down
There's nobody left to crown

Be it ever so humble
There's no place like home
Homeâ?¦home on the range
Where the fear and the antidotes play
Where seldom is heard 
An encouraging word
And our leaders do nothing all day

What if they gave an election
And nobody came to vote
The system it needs a bit of correction
Just might seem like changing direction right now
As it stands we don't even make the selections
And to get into Heaven we even need a connection
On our way down
There's nobody left to crown

Nobody left to crown
Nobody left to crown
Nobody left to crown
Nobody left to crown
