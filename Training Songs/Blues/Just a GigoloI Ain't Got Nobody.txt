I'm just a gigolo and everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance, selling each romance
Ooh, and they're sayin'

There will come a day when youth will pass away
What will they say about me?
When the end comes, I know
They was just the gigolos
Life goes on without me

I'm just a gigolo and everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance, selling each romance
Ooh, what they're sayin'

And there will come a day when youth will pass away
What will they say about me?
When the end comes, I know
They was just a gigolo
Life goes on without me, 'cause

I ain't got nobody
Nobody cares for me
Nobody cares for me
I'm so sad and lonely
Sad and lonely, sad and lonely
Won't some sweet mama come and take a chance with me?
'Cause I ain't so bad

An' I'll sing her sweet love songs
All of the time
She will only be, only be
Bip boz dee, boze dee, bop, biddly bop

I ain't got nobody
Nobody cares for me
Nobody cares for me
Nobody cares for me
Nobody cares for me

Humala bebuhla zeebuhla boobuhla
Humala bebuhla zeebuhla bop

I ain't got nobody
Nobody cares for me
Nobody cares for me
I'm so sad and lonely
Oh lonely, oh lonely, lonely, lonely
Won't some sweet mama, come and rescue me
'Cause I ain't so bad

An' I'll sing her sweet love songs
All of the time
She will only be, only, only, only
Only, only, only, only be
Baby, c'mon sugar, darling

Ain't got nobody, baby
