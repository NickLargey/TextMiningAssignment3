Is it true what they say about Dixie? 
Does the sun really shine all the time?
Do the sweet magnolias blossom at ev'rybody's door? 
Do folks keep eating possum 
Till they can't eat no more?

Is it true what they say about Swanee? 
Is a dream by that stream so sublime?
Do they laugh, do they love, like they say in ev'ry song? 
If it's true, that's where I belong
