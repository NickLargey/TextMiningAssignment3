My love has come along
My dreams become air so
My days have arrived, yea sunny
Funny why all so blue

The man is like a drug
In the late night when I can’t get enough
Love in all its splendor
Surrender its every blow

Where is the blues that I know?

This is love, what was I thinking?
This is love, what the hell am I, am I gonna do?
And that man, he got me sinking
To the bottom of the blue

It’s what I choose
Love is the baddest blues

The joy versus the kind
No, my joy, it ain’t the same
So I put it plain and simple
Just like front page news

Love is the baddest blues
Love is the baddest blues

This is love, what was I thinking?
This is love, what the hell am I, am I gonna do?
And that man, he got me sinking
To the bottom of the blue

Guess that I, I’ll lose
Love is the baddest blues
