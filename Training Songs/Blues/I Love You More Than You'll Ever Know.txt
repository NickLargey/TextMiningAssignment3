If I ever leave you
You can say I told you so
If I ever hurt you baby
You know I hurt myself as well

Is that any way for a man to carry on
You think he wants
His little loved one gone
I love you baby
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

When I wasn't making too much money
You knew where my paycheck went
You know I brought it home to baby
And I never spent one red cent

Is that any way for a man to carry on
You think he wants
His little loved one gone
I love you baby
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

I'm not trying to be any kinds of a man
I'm trying to be somebody
You can love trust and understand
I know that I could be yeah a part of you
That no one else could see
I just got to hear you say
It's alright yeah yeah yeah

I'm only flesh and blood
But I could be everything
That you demand
I could be president
Of General Motors baby huh
Or just a tiny little grain of sand

Is that any way for a man to carry on
You think he wants
His little loved one gone
I love you baby, I love you baby
I love you more than you will ever know
