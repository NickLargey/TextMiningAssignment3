He brings a tear into my eyes
When I begin, Lord, to realize
If you don't think that, honey
You'll be lonesome
You know I'll drown, drown
Oh Lord, in my own tears

I know it's true into his mind
A little rain is bound to fall
But since you been gone, honey
I'm so blue, it just keeps rainin'
Keeps right on rainin' more and more

I didn't cry just like a child
My poor tears, Lord, they were runnin' wild
If you don't think that, baby
You'll be home soon now
You know I'll drown, drown
Oh Lord, in my own tears
