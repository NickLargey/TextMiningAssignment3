Things I used to do
I don't do no more
I just love one woman
Instead of tryin' to love four
I stopped drinkin' humble
Now my head is clear
I'm really takin' care of business
You can tell from the smile I wear
Oh yes I'm livin' right
Put the bad lights out
Gotta good thing goin' 
With the best lookin' woman in town
Lies I used to tell
I don't tell no more
I ain't got to duck indoors
Like I did before
All my thoughts and crooked dice
I give to Stagger Lee
I'm just gonna be your lover
That's good enough for me
Oh yes I'm livin right
Put the bad lights out
Gotta good thing goin'
With the best lookin' woman in town

Dreams I used to dream
I don't dream no more
What's the use of dreamin'
When I got what I was lookin' for
I got someone who wants me
And give me the biggest thrill
Bigger than the thrill I found on Blueberry Hill
Bigger than the thrill I found on Blueberry Hill
Bigger than the thrill I found on Blueberry Hill
