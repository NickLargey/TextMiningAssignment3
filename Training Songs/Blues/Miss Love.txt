Miss love, where [Incomprehensible] tonight?
Long way from my sight
And I miss love tonight
Tossing, turning in my room
Hoping I will see her soon

Warm arms and a tender caring smile
In your arms I could be but that’s not so
So I miss love tonight
Wishing, hoping for your touch
Could it be I ask too much?

Miss love, I do miss love
Wonder am I worthy of
This love I do miss love
Miss love, I hope you do too

Caring words, rolling off your tongue
I watch your sweet lips as
Each sound takes me on a trip
Thinking back to what you said
I need to hear your voice again

Back home, across the ocean wide
Where I long to be but that’s not so
So I miss love tonight
Back across the ocean wide
Is there some one by your side?

Miss love, I do miss love
Wonder am I worthy of
This love I do miss love
Miss love, I hope you do too

I’m the one that, I’m the one that
I’m the one that wants you
I’m the one that needs you
I’m the one that wants you
I’m the one that needs you

Miss love, where are you tonight?
Long way from my sight
And I miss love tonight
Yes, I miss love tonight
I miss love tonight
My, my, my, my, my
