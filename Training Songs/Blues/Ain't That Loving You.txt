Oh, hey baby, yeah
Take that loving baby
Yeah yeah

You think I love you
For just one thing
To you my love this may 
Be the way that it seems

But I love the way, that you carry yourself
I even love you, love you, love you, love you
The way you wear your hair

Ain't that loving you
Ain't that loving you
For more reasons than one

Somehow, my love
You've been misled
By the things that 
That other guys have said

Well, I love you, for what you are
I even love you
For what you may become

Ain't that loving you
Ain't that loving you
For more reasons than one

Did it ever occur to you
Why I do all that a man can do?
To keep that smile on your face
It's because I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 
In, uh, so many ways

Somehow, my love
You've been misled
By the things that 
That other guys have said

But I love you, for what you are
I even love you
For what you may become

Ain't that loving you (Oh oh) 
Ain't that loving you (Baby)
Ain't that loving you (Ain't that loving you, girl, yeah)
Ain't that loving you (Ain't that loving you, yeah, yeah)
Ain't that loving you (You and you and you and you and you)
Ain't that loving you (Let me say that one more time) 
Ain't that loving you (You, you, you)
Ain't that loving you (My good love, my good love)
Ain't that loving you
