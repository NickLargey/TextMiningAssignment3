When I go to bed, late at night 
I hold my pillow real tight 
Ain't got nobody to keep me war
I just sit at home, alone

When I get up in the morning
If I'm able
It ain't no breakfast
Sitting on my table
No one calls my on my telephone
I just sit at home alone

All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long

Maybe on day, I'll find someone
Someone who feels like me
We can help satify one another
And fulfill each other needs

Now when that day comes, I hope it's soon
I won't sit at home in my lonely room
And I wonder, I wonder someone will come along
I won't sit at home
Sit at home alone
Sit at home alone
All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
