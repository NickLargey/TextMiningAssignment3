Trouble trouble trouble
Troubles is all in the world I see
Trouble trouble trouble
Troubles is all in the world I see
Oh you know some time I wonder

What in the world is gonna happen to me
When I wake up early in the morning
Blues and troubles all round my bed
When I wake up early in the morning
Blues and troubles all round my bed
You know I never will forget people

That life's ? when I heard my baby say
She said I'm leaving you in the morning
And your crying wont make me stay
She said I'm leaving you in the morning
And your crying wont make me stay
Oh she said I know you cry baby
Honey the further you go on you drive me away

She said I'm leaving you in the morning
And your crying wont make me stay
She said I'm leaving you in the morning
And your crying wont make me stay
Oh she said I know you cry baby
Honey the further you go on you drive me away
