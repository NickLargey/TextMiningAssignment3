Happiness is leaning on my shoulder
Like a cigarette burning me all over it is killing me
I'm slipping through the cracks of my sweet misery
Sunday morning stories of you
Is always all about you

Happiness is crying in the kitchen drinking
Like a friend and all my ugly wishes it is listening
While I'm choking on my pride and all the songs I scream
Sunday morning stories of you
Is always all about

Happiness is laughing at me like a clown
Watching my nirvana crashing to the ground
In the middle of the perfect nervous breakdown
Happiness any day now... any day now

Loneliness is hiding with the lonely faking
Gratefulness while polishing his trophy
She was beautiful but beautiful don't matter after wonderful
Sunday morning stories like these
Are always about

Happiness is laughing at me like a clown
Watching my nirvana crashing to the ground
In the middle of the perfect nervous breakdown
Happiness any day now any day now any day now

Running always running always falling on my
Falling on my face, on my face

Happiness is laughing at me like a clown
Watching my nirvana crashing to the ground
In the middle of the perfect nervous breakdown
Happiness any day now any day now

Any day, any day now
Happiness any day now
Happiness is any day now
Happiness any day now
