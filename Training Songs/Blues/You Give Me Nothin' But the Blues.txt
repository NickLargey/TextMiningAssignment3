You give me nothin', nothin' but the blues
You give me nothing but the blues
You give me nothin', nothin' but the blues
You give me nothing but the blues
But baby, still I go for you

You always lie to me
You've always been untrue
You always lie to me
You've always been untrue
You give me nothing but the blues
But baby, still I go for you

You make my night so miserable
You make my day so blue
You make my night so miserable
You make my day so blue
You give me nothing but the blues
But baby, still I go for you

Come on and ease my troubles
No one can but you
Come on and ease my troubles
'Cause no one can but you
You give me nothing but the blues
But baby, still I go for you
