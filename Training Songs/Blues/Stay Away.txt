Monkey see, monkey do
I don't know why
I’d rather be dead than be uncool
I don't know why
Every line had the rhythms
I don't know why
Let’s move, love is blind
I don't know why

Stay, stay away
Stay away, stay away
Oh

Give an inch, take a smile
I don't know why
Fashion shirt, fashion style
I don't know why
Throw it out, keep it in
I don't know why
Help, tap, pull skin
I don't know why

Stay, stay away
Stay away, stay away
Oh

Ooh, ah
Baby

Give an inch, take a smile
I don't know why
Fashion shirt, fashion style
I don't know why

Stay, stay away
Stay away, stay away
Stay away, yeah
Stay away, ooh
Ah
Ah
Ooh, stay away, babe
Don’t know, no, no, no, no
Ah
