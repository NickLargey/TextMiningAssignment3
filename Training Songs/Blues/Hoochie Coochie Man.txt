The gypsy woman told my mother, while fore I was born, 
I gotta boy child comin, he's gonna be a son of a gun, 
He gonna make pretty womens, jump and shout, 
Then the world wanna know, what's it all about. 
I'm a heroe, everybody knows I'm him, 
I'm your hoochie coochie man, 
Everybody knows I him. 

I got a black cat bone, I got a mojo too, 
I got the John de Conqueroo, I'm gonna mess with you, 
I'm gonna make you women, lead me by my hand, 
Then the world will know, I'm your hoochie coochie man. 

I'm a heroe, everybody knows I'm him, 
Well you know the hoochie coochie man, 
Everybody knows I him. 

On the seventh hour, on the seventh month, 
On the seventh day, the seven doctors say, 
He was born for good luck, and that you'll see, 
I got seven hundred dollars, and don't you mess with me. 

I'm a heroe, everybody knows I'm him, 
Well you know the hoochie coochie man, 
Everybody knows I him.
