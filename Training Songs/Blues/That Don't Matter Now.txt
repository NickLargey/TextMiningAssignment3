I wake up every mornin' with the risin' sun
Thinkin' of my baby and all the good she's done
But, ooh, ooh, that don't matter now

You'll miss your water when your well go dry
I miss my baby when she said goodbye
But, ooh, ooh, that don't matter now

I stay so worried
I don't know what to do
No one to love me
Or tell my trouble to

Play that thing, Mr. Piano man
Play it 'til it gets through to everybody
Drink another pint, William?
I'm gonna get drunk and pitch me a boogie woogie

Still a good fella, oh, yes
Live a good fella, you'll die one
Is that right? Oh, yeah

I miss her huggin' and her kisses too
No one could love me like my baby do
But, ooh, ooh, that don't matter now

I miss the way she starch and iron my clothes
I miss the way she give me good jellyroll
But, ooh, ooh, that don't matter now

I'm so unhappy, blue as I can be, oh, yes
I love my baby
Well, she don't care for me
Ooh, yeah
