Let me tell you baby 
Try to understand 
You can never keep me 
So you'd better use me while you can 

I'm gonna rock and roll you baby 
Roll you till the break come down, yeah 
Know by then now people 
There'll be some lovin' goin' on, yeah 

Well I ain't no main man 
Always on the road 
Now I got a side-tracked woman 
Most every place I go 

You gotta rock and roll you mama 
While I tell her gonna break come dawn 
You know by then now people 
Gonna be some lovin' goin' on 

Gonna head on now, fuckin' roll! 

I got time for it honey 
Love like cherry wine 
Match your feel like your four-wheel 
Give eye sight to the blind 

Gonna rock and roll you mama 
Rock and roll you all night long 
You know by then now people 
Gonna be some lovin' goin' on
