With your reckless wisdom
And your arms baking 
With your eyes brittle 
And your heart of stone 
Well I think I see a weasel 
Come climbin off the floor 
Since they say my baby left the door 
With your key all broken 
And your face a-flutter 
With your spare ribs groaning 
And you're panic-stricken 
What's that you're wearing? 
I feel you in my soul 
Since the day I turned around 
Day I turned around [2x] 
With your fingers missing 
And your paper dreams
