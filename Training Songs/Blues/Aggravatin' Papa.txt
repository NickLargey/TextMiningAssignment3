I know a triflin' man, 
They call him Triflin' Sam, 
He lives in Birmingham, 
'Way down in Alabam, 
Now, the other night, 
He had a fight 
With a gal called Mandy Brim, 
She sadly stated, she was aggravated, 
And she yelled these words to him: 

Aggravatin' Papa, don't try to two-time me! 
Aggravatin' Papa, treat me kind or let me be; 
Listen while I get you told, 
Stop messin' round with my jellyroll, 

If I catch you out with your high-brown baby, 
I'll smack you down, and I don't mean maybe! 
Aggravatin' Papa, I'll do anything you say, 
But when you start to running, don't you run around my way; 

Now, Papa, treat me pretty, nice and sweet, 
'Cause I possess a forty-four that don't repeat, 
So, Aggravatin' Papa, don't try to two-time me! 

Aggravatin' Papa, don't try to two-time me! 
Aggravatin' Papa, treat me kind or let me be; 
Listen while I get you told, 
Stop messin' round with my jellyroll, 

If I catch you out with your high-brown baby, 
I'll smack you down, and I don't mean maybe! 
Aggravatin' Papa, I'll do anything you say, 
But when you start to running, don't you run around my way; 

Got one hand on my razor, one arm around my gun, 
If I catch you foolin' round, I'll tear your doghouse down, 
So, Aggravatin' Papa, don't try to two-time me!
