Well, don't you hear me callin' you?
You know I've been in love with you
Answer me, answer me, my love
I called you once before, tell me where did you go?

Baby, let me hold your hand
I wanna make you understand
Come to me, come to me, my love
I wanna make love to you under the stars above

Well, don't you hear me callin' you?
I just wanna make love to you
Answer me, answer me, my love
Yes, I really love you, baby, and I need your love
