Come upstairs and I'll show you where all my
Where my demons hide from you
Just look at who I have become
I am so ashamed you were the one that made me feel the way I do

You broke me
And taught me
To truly hate myself
Unfold me
And teach me
How to be like somebody else

When I felt strong enough
I was discovered by the love
I had been waiting for so long
You told me none of that was real
I cannot hide how low I feel
To know that you were never wrong

You broke me
And taught me
To truly hate myself
Unfold me
And teach me
How to be like somebody else

You're lost and found
Fallen out
Broken down

You broke me
And taught me
To truly hate myself
Unfold me
And teach me
How to be like somebody else

You broke me
And taught me
To truly hate myself
Unfold me
And teach me
To be like somebody else
