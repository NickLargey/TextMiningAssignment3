When ya touch my hand
An' talk sweet talk
I got a knocking in my knees
And a wobble in my walk

I'm trembling
And I'm shaking

A when ya take me in your arms
To talk romance
My heart starts doing the St. Vita's dance

An' I'm panting
An' I'm shaking

Early in the morning time
Late in the middle of the night
Whenever this chill comes over me 
I want to hug you with all-a my might, ay-ay

An' I'm sweating
An' I'm shaking

A chill an a fever
So I've been told 
Makes your head spin around
An' your feet run cold

I got fever
An' I'm shaking

Feel like I been run through the mill
I can't move around an' I can't stand still

I'm so jittery
An' I'm shaking

Samson was a mighty good man
Strongest in his day
Then along came Delilah an' clipped his wig
An' it looks like you took me
The same old way

So, I'm 'noy-vous'
An' I'm shaking

Well, a storm rocks a ship on a sea
The wind shakes the leaves on a tree
I'm like a nervous wreck
I'm all shook up 
And that's what you are doing to me

'Cause I'm jumping
An' I'm shaking
An' I'm jumping
An' I'm shaking

Shaking
Shaking, shaking, shaking
Shaking, um
I'm shaking

Shaking
Shaking
I'm shaking
