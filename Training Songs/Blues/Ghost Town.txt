When I walk up Main Street
It isn't the same street
To me it's a haunted avenue
The crowded ballroom seems empty and blue
This town's a ghost town without you
What memories I find
In the caf√© we dined in
The sound of our laughter lingers on

This was a gay town
From dusk until dawn
Now it's a ghost town  since you're gone
Sweetheart your face is in all those places
And my heart embraces each vision of you
If only we'd make up
These shadows would break up
And I'd see that sun come shining through
So, darling, come back, I need you, I do
