Well, worry worry worry
Worry is all I can do
Yes, worry worry worry baby
Worry is all I can do
Yes, my life is so miserable baby
Baby, and it's all on account of you

Yes, it hurt me so bad
When you said that we were through
Yes, it hurt me so bad, baby
Baby, when you said we were through
Hey, but I would rather be dead
Baby, then to be here so alone and blue

Yes, someday, baby
When the blood runs cold in my veins
Hey, someday, baby
Baby, when the blood runs cold in my veins
Well, you know you won't be able to hurt me no more, baby
'Cause my heart won't feel no pain
