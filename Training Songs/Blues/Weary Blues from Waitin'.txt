Weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' too long
These blues have got me cryin'
Oh, sweet ma-a-ma, please come home.

The snow falls 'round my window
But it can't chill my heart
God knows it died the day you left
My dream world fell a part.

Weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' too long
These blues have got me cryin'
Oh, sweet ma-a-ma, please come home.

Through tears I watch young lovers
As they go strollin' by
Oh, all the things that might have been
God forgive me if I cry.

Weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' too long
These blues have got me cryin'
Oh, sweet ma-a-ma, please come home
