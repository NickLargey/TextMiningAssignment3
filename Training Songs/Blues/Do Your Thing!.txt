if the music make you move
you can dig the groove
groove on
if you feel like you wanna make love
under the signs above
love on love on
if there's something you wanna say
talkings the only way
whatever you wanna do
you gotta do your thing
if you feel like you wanna scream 
thats the way you let out steam
scream on scream on
if singing is your thing
sing on on 
if you wanna make love all night
and the feelings right
make love all night
wahtever you want to do
you gotta do your thing
