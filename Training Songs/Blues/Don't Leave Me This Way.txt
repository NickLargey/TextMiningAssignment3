Woke up at this mornin'
'Bout to break a day
Fell down on my knees
All you could hear me say
Don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way
'Cause the woman I love 
Is goin' home and stay
I lay down cross in my bed
To rest my achin' head
Tears runin' from my eyes
All I could do was cry
Don't leave mi this way
Don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way
'Cause the woman I love
Is goin' home and stay
Oh ph ph oh
The woman I love
Is goin' home and stay

I went down to the corner
To get myself a drink
I thought that it will help me
Because I could not think
Oh oh oh oh oh
The woman I love
Is goin' away to stay
