I was sittin' at home 
Thinkin' to myself 
I started thinkin' bout you 
How much I do love you 
I really do 
I would never trade you 
Never forsake you 
'Cause nothin' could be better 
That's why I wrote you this letter 
I love you always lady 
 
Last Night 
I wrote a short letter 
And it went this way 
Dear baby I love you just thinkin' of you 
Love always 
 
Now I know I could've called 
But it seemed much better this way 
'Cause I'm missin' my baby 
I'm so blessed your my lady lady 
Now I know I can't wait till tomorrow 
When your in my arms again 
Holdin' and kissin' you doin' thing thing we love to do 
But 'till then 
 
Last night 
I wrote a short letter 
And it went this way 
Dear baby I love you just thinkin' of you 
Love always 
 
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo

 
Oh baby I love you, I love you, I love you 
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do 
Just to prove that I really, really love you 
Baby I want you, I want you, I want you 
And there's nothing that I'd rather do 
Than to love you I love you always 
Every night and every day

Oh baby I love you, I love you, I love you 
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do 
Just to prove that I really, really love you 
Baby I want you, I want you, I want you 
And there's nothing that I'd rather do 
Than to love you I love you always 
Every night and every day

Oh baby I love you, I love you, I love you 
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do 
Just to prove that I really, really love you 
Baby I want you, I want you, I want you 
And there's nothing that I'd rather do 
Than to love you I love you always 
Every night and every day

Oh baby I love you, I love you, I love you 
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do 
Just to prove that I really, really love you 
Baby I want you, I want you, I want you 
And there's nothing that I'd rather do 
Than to love you I love you always 
Every night and every day
