Someone really loves you
Guess who, guess who
Someone really cares
Guess who

So open your heart
Oh, then surely you'll see
That the someone who really cares is me

Someone will wait eternally, eternally
Someone who'll need your love, oh, so desperately

So open your heart
Oh, then surely you'll see
That the someone who really cares is me

The someone who really cares
Who really cares is me
