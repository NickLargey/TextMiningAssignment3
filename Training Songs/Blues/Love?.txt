Love is a way of feeling
Oh, love is a way of feeling less alone
So what's all the fuss about?

"F*ck it"
Love: the paradox of needing
Oh love,
Make way for breeding
(Give it to me)
(Give it to me)

I know what I stand for;
I stand for me

I'll wait for the night to come
So far, suicide at home
For I'm not the man you know
This love it's about control

Oh what a feeling
Oh what a feeding
Know the chosen ones, are here!
All hail

I'll wait for the night to come
So far, suicide at home
For I'm not the man you know
This love,
It's about control(you fucker!)

(All in the name of love)
(All in the name of love)
(All in the name of love)
(All in the name of love)
