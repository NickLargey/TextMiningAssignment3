My baby woke up this mornin'
Said B, you must clean up and go
Well, my baby woke up this mornin'
Said B, you must clean up and go

'Cause the way that you been doin'
Can't take those treatments no more

If you ever lay down at night
And wake up cold and [?]
Your baby's gone and left you
She had another man

Why, I'm gonna move to the deep blue sea
Well, I'm tired of being all alone and livin' in misery

Well, when I woke up this mornin'
She was sittin' down before the glass
And when I start to talk
All she would do was laugh

I'm gonna change my ways
I'm gonna move to the deep blue sea
Well, I'm tired of being all alone and livin' in misery
