You're 'bout as smooth as sand paper
The way you try to run your game
No, it ain't gonna work
'Cause we don't feel the same
Tell me why you're sensing
I fancy you, really I don't care
I just laugh and say to myself
He's thinking he's stringing me along

I hope you know that I'm no fool 
And you can move how you wanna move 
The truth is I don't care
I need to make it clear
Do whatever it is you gotta do it
Won't hurt me
It won't hurt me

Save your crocodile tears 
I was hip to them a long time ago
Stop right there (right there)
'Cause you don't have to be putting on a show 

What you tryin' to prove 
you can move how you wanna move 
The truth is I don't care
I just wanna make it clear
Do whatever it is you gotta do it
Won't hurt me
It won't hurt me
It won't hurt me
It won't hurt me
It won't hurt me (hurt me)

(It won't hurt me)

I'll give you my advice
Sure, we share sometimes
But I can't make love to the feeling of love
I hope you're listening

Do whatever it is you gotta do it
Won't hurt me
It won't hurt me

Do whatever it is you gotta do it
Won't hurt me
It won't hurt me (yeah)

Do whatever it is you wanna do it
Won't hurt me
It won't hurt me
No, it won't hurt me
It won't hurt me
It won't hurt me
