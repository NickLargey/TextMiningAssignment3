I'm going but I'll be back
Just look for me, you'll see
That I'll be back
Well, like my mama & pop
Yes, an I'm gonna bring a cop
Just to make you give me back my love
Before I blow my top - pow!

I'll get you
Before I stop
No, and you can't take my love
And let me drop
'Cause I decide that you must know 
No, I can't let you go
But it's time for me to blow
But I'll be back

(harmonica & instrumental)

Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!

I'll get you
Before I stop
Well, but you can't take my love
And let me drop
'Cause I decide that you must know 
No, I can't let you go
But it's time for me to blow
But I'll be back.
