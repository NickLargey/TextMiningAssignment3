Rock-rock, do-wop-bop-bop-bop
Rock-rock, do-wop-bop-bop-bop

Let's rock, baby, baby, let's roll
Let's bop to satisfy our soul
A-don't wait till we old and gray
A-let's rock, baby, right away
And listen to me like you know you should
Now let's rock (oh yeah) while the rockin's good

Let's dance, baby, baby, let's hop
A-clap your hands and do the new style bop
A-let's mambo to the bongo drums
A-do the cha-cha; it's a lot of fun
A-listen to me like you know you should
Now let's rock (oh yeah) while the rock is good

A-while we're young and a-spring is sprung
Let's go moonlight strollin'
'Cause once you're old and your blood gets cold
Say, no more rockin' and a-rollin'

Let's swing, baby, baby, let's shout
And tell the old folks what it's all about
A-don't wait till your bones are stiff
C'mon and give your little heart a lift
Listen to me like you know you should
Now let's rock (oh yeah) while the rock is good

Rock-rock, do-wop-bop
Bop-bop, do-wah-bop
Rock-rock, do-wop-bop 
Bop-bop, do-wop-bop
Rock, rock, rock-rock-rock
Rock, rock, do-wop-bop
Rock-rock, do-wop-bop
Bop-bop, do-wah-bop
Rock-rock, do-wop-bop 
Bop-bop, do-wop-bop
Rock, rock, rock-rock-rock
Rock, rock, do-wop-bop

Say, while we're young and spring is sprung
Let's go moonlight strollin'
'Cause once you're old and your blood gets cold
Say, no more rockin' and a-rollin'

Let's sing, baby, baby, let's shout
A-tell the old folks what it's all about
A-don't wait till your bones are stiff
C'mon and give your little heart a lift
A-listen to me like you know you should
Now let's rock (oh yeah) while the rock is good

Let's rock (oh yeah) while the rock is good!
(Oh yeah)
