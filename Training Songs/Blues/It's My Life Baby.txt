Yes, it's my life, baby, don't try to change my ways
Well, if you want my loving, don't make no graveyard play

But everything I get a bottle you add your little touch

Well, it's my life, pretty baby, let me live it like I please
Well, if things aren't gonna suit you, baby you can take off with the breeze
