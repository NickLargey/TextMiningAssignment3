It's a long, long lane that has no turning
And it's a fire that always keeps on burning
Mister devil down below
Pitchfork in his hand
And that's where you are going to go
Do you understand?
Devil's gonna git you
Devil's gonna git you
Oh, the devil's gonna git you
Man, just as sure as you's born

Devil's gonna git you,
Devil's gonna git you,
Oh, the devil's gonna git you,
The way you're carryin' on

You go away, stay for weeks
On your doggone spree
Come back home, get in my bed
And turn your back on me
Oh the devil's gonna git you
I mean the devil's gonna git you
Man the devil's gonna git you
Sure as you's born

Dirty two-timer, dirty two-timer,
Dirty two-timer, you ain't coming clean

Oh the devil's gonna git you
I mean the devil's gonna git you
Oh the devil's gonna git you
You know what I mean

I don't want no two-time stuff
From my regular man
Don't want nothing that's been used
'Cause it's second-hand
The devil's gonna git you
Oh the devil's gonna git you
Man the devil's gonna git you
Sure as you're born to die
