Merry Christmas baby, you sure did treat me nice
Ooh, merry Christmas baby, sure you did treat me nice
Gave me that love for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise

Now I'm feelin' mighty fine, got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feelin' mighty fine, I got all that good music on my radio
I wanna kiss you baby
While you're standing 'neath the mistletoe

Well, I'm feelin' mighty fine, I got good music on my radio
Well I'm feelin' mighty fine, we got all that good music on my radio
Well, I wanna kiss you, Bonnie
While I'm standing here 'neath the mistletoe

Saintee came down the chimney
About half past three
Left these pretty presents
That you see before me
Ooh, Merry Christmas pretty baby
Sure your show been good to me
I haven't had a drink this morning
I'm all lit up
Ooh, baby, I'm all lit up
I'm all lit up, ooh, like a Christmas tree
