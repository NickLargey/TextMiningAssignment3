(Don't go Fat Man, don't go Fat Man!)
Cause where I've been mistreated, I ain't gonna stay that long
(You know she loves you, you know she loves you)

Yeah she told me that she's all mine, that no other would take my place
But I know that she was lyin' from the fresh sheets on her bed
Yes I know you lied to me darlin', but you won't have to lie to me no more
(She wasn't lying, she wasn't lying)
Yeah when a woman starts lyiong, somebody''s got to go
(Bye bye Fat Man, bye bye Fat Man!)

So good bye baby, I tried my best to get along with you
(Bye bye baby, bye bye baby)
