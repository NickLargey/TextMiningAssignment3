who drank my beer while I was in the rear?
who drank my beer while I was in the rear?
somebody point me out that moocher
I'm gonna dislocate his future

I walkd into this bar room
???? chalk
I ordered up a beer then I had to take a walk
while I was gone some no good John
had drank up my last dime
I never thought a man could stoop to such a petty crime

who drank my beer while I was in the rear?
such stealin calls for action
I'm demanding satisfaction

Now beer don't evaporate or skoot off like a fly
it don't got legs to walk away, that proves there was a guy
?????
be honest with me boys point them thugs out to me
