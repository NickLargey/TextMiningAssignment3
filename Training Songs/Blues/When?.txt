When you were with me 
I remember 
All the fun things 
We did toguether

How to forget 
All the bad times we were toguether
And all the the good times two

When you were with me
I just felt like a new person
But now that your not here with me
I don't know what to do
I just forgot what I did 
When I was with you.
Ohhhhhhhhh.

The love that you gave me
And the care that I needed
No one does it like you did 
And now that your not here 
I miss all that you did for me.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 

I think that now I know 
Why you did all the things
That I didn't liiiiiiike

'Cause were you were with me 
You just wanted to proteeeect me

When you were with me
I just felt like a new person
But now that your not here with me
I don't know what to do
I just forgot what I did when I was with you.
Oh.

The love that you gave me
And the care that I needed
No one does it like you did 
And now that your not here 
I miss all that you did for me.
Oh 

I just want to thank you 
For all the things you did
For me

Thank you for my good health,
For the good food ,
For a good live two.

I just miss when you were with me

When you were with me
I just felt like a new person
But now that your not here with me
I don't know what to do
I just forgot what I did when I was with you.
Oh.

The love that you gave me
And the care that I needed
No one does it like you did 
,and now that your not here 
I miss all that you did for me.
Oh
