You damn right, I've got the blues
From my head down to my shoes
You damn right, I've got the blues
From my head down to my shoes

I can't win, 'cause I don't have a thing to lose

I stopped by my daughter's house
You know I just want to use the phone
I stopped by my daughter's house
You know I just want to use the phone

You know my new grandbaby came to the door
And said, granddaddy, you know ain't no one at home

I said now look out

You damn right, I've got the blues
From my head down to my shoes
You damn right, I've got the blues
From my head down to my shoes

You know I can't win, now people, 'cause I don't have a thing to lose

Alright

You damn right, I've got the blues
You damn right, I've got the blues
You damn right, I've got the blues
You damn right, I've got the blues
Yeah
