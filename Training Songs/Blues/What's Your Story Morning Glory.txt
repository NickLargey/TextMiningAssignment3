What's your story, morning glory
What makes you look so blue
The way that you've been acting
I don't know what to do
For I love you, sure as one and one make two
What's your story, morning glory
Got a feeling there's a lot you're concealing
So, won't you let me know your point of view

What is your story, morning glory
You've got me worried too
The postman came this morning
And left a note for you
Did you read it, then you know that I love you
What's your story, morning glory
Give your answer to this patient romancer
Oh, won't you tell me that you love me too
