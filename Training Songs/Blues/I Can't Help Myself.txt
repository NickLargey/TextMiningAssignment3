Sugar pie honey bunch you know that I love you
I can't help myself I love you and nobody else

Wanna tell in and out my life you come and go
Leaving just your picture behind
and I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger or wink your eye I come a running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings and there's nothing I can do

Sugar pie honey bunch I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face I get all choked up inside

When I call your name girl it starts the flame burning in my heart
tearin it all apart no matter how I try my love
I cannot hide 'cause

Sugar Pie Honey Bunch you know that I'm weak for you
Can't help myself I love you and nobody else
Sugar Pie Honey Bunch do anything you ask me to
Can't help myself I want you and nobody else
Sugar Pie Honey Bunch you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Can't help myself, no I can't help myself
