You know I'm just crazy about you baby,
Wonder, do you ever think of me.
You know I'm wild about you baby,
But you don't care nothing in the world for me.

Oh I can't sleep at night
I just cats nap through the day
Can't go on much longer
Lord, living this way.

You know I'm just crazy about you baby,
Wonder, do you ever think of me.
You know I'm wild about you baby,
But you don't care nothing in the world for me.

Well there ain't but the one thing momma
That makes your daddy drink.
Say that you don't love me,
Lord, I begin to think.

You know I'm just crazy about you baby,
Wonder, do you ever think of me.
You know I'm wild about you baby,
But you don't care nothing in the world for me
