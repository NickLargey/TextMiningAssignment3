winter
turn on the night
turn on your love light
I'm a non-believer
but I believe
in your smile
well I'm gonna talk to you baby
on brandy-wine
mars in the stars
mars is arisin
mars in the stars mars is arisin
and I feel like I'm way in a deep dream baby
feel like I'm way in a deep dream
yes
lovers
light in the inn
what are they thinking?
patterns falling
down the sky
and the fire
and the kiss
of the country night
your tender strong freaky love
strangers and mountains
and blurred in a snow flight
mars in the stars
mars is arisin
the world's insane
the paper's gone mad
but our love is a peace vibe
yes

let's go down by the grapevine
drink my daddy's wine
get happy
down by the grapevine
drink my daddy's wine
get happy 
happy
oh sweet blindness
a little magic
a little kindness
oh sweet blindness
all over me
four leaves on a clover
I'm just a bit of a shade hung over
come on baby do a slow float
you're a good lookin' 
and aint that sweet eyed blindness good to me
down by the grapevine
drink my daddy's wine
good mornin'
down by the grapevine
drink my daddy's wine
good mornin
mornin'
oh sweet blindness
a little magic
a little kindness
oh sweet blindness
all over me
please don't tell my mother
I'm a saloon and a moonshine lover
come on baby do a slow float
you're a good lookin' riverboat
and ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me
(don't ask me cuz I) 
ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin'
ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin'
ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin'
wine
of wonder
wonder
(by the way)
sweet blindness
a little magic
a little kindness
oh sweet blindness
all over me
don't let daddy hear it
he don't believe in the gin mill spirit
come on baby do a slow float
you a good lookin' riverboat
and ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me
good to me
now ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me
