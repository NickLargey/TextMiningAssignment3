I've got a mean woman, and she's always doing me wrong
 Yes, you know she's mean, and she's always doing me wrong
 I believe to my soul, I've got leave my home
 She is a mean woman, oh, she never treats me right
 Oh, mean and evil woman, and she never treats me right
 Only go around every day, and don't come home 'til midnight
 Lord, if only, only she would treat me fair
 Oh, if i could get my baby, if could only get her to treat me fair
 Oh, she would own me, yes, she would own me anywhere
