Ooh baby, baby you don't move no more
Oo-wee baby, you don't move no more
I believe, baby I believe I'm gonna let you go

Lord, early in the mornin', baby
You don't wash my face like you used to do
Well, early in the mornin', baby
You don't wash my face like you used to do
Well, you know baby, baby you know that'll never do

Oh, if I should cry, baby would that do poor B. any good?
Well, if I should cry darlin', honey, would it do poor B. any good?
Well, I hate for all my people to know baby
I'm the biggest fool in the neighborhood
