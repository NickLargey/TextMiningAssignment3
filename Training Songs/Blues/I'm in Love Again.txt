Yes, this mean I'm in love again
Had no lovin' since you-know-when
You know I love you, yes I do
And I'm savin' all my lovin' just for you
Need your lovin' and I need it bad
Just like a dog when he's goin' mad
Hoo-ee, baby, hoo-ee
Baby, won't you give your love to me?
Eeny-meeny and miney-mo
Told me you didn't want me 'round no more
Hoo-ee, baby, hoo-ee
Baby, don't you let your dog bite me
