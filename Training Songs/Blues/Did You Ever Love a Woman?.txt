Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might?
Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might?
Well, and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right

You fix her breakfast in the morning
Stay at home everyday
Even wash the dishes
If she have to go away
You send the children to school
Even mend their hose
Stay up all nights with the babies
Even wash their dirty clothes

Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might?
Yes, and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right?

But when it's time to go to bed
The woman grabs you in her arms
She holds you real tight
She hugs you with all her charms
She calls you a lot of sweet names
Then she turn out the light
She sets your soul on fire
And you say, "babe, everything is all right"

Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might?
Well, you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right?
