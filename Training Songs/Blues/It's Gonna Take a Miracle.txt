Loving you so
I was too blind to see you
Letting me go
But now that you've set me free
It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you
Oh oh, didn't you know
It wouldn't be so easy
Lettin' you go
I could have told you
That it's gonna take a miracle 
Oh-uh yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you
Oh, tho' I know I can't forget about you
Or come so will show you how much
You're turning me around, destroying me
I'll never be the same anymore
You must realize
You took your love and left me
Quite by surprise
You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you
