Don't cry my sweet girl
Nothin' I say is written in stone
don't' cry my sweet girl
You won't really be alone
Woa-oh
I'll help you pack your things
I'll walk with you out to the car
I'll hold on to the ring
I won't forget the way things are
Woa-oh
My sweet love

Your disappointed eyes
Are haunting me like my big lies
I see you glaring now
I see you staring in the fire
Woa-oh
My sweet love

Don't cry my sweet girl
Nothing I saw is written in stone
Don't cry my sweet love
You won't really be alone
Woa-oh
My sweet love
My sweet love

Don't cry my sweet girl
You won't really be alone
Don't cry my sweet girl
You won't really be alone
Don't cry my sweet girl
You won't really be alone
