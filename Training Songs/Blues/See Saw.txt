Your love is like a see-saw baby, see-saw
Your love is like a see-saw, baby, see-saw
First it's up and then it's down
It changes so fast, it never hits the ground
It goes up, down, and up Like a see-saw
When you said you'd be my baby, see-saw
When you said you'd be my baby, see-saw
I thought your love was sincere
But at this rate, it won't last a year
It goes up, down and up, like a see-saw
Monday it's a huggin and a kissin
And Tuesday somethin' I've been missin'
Wednesday ev'rything is fine
Thursday you done changed your mind
Friday it's the day we make up
Saturday the day we break up
Sunday things are goin all right
Monday you want to start up fightin'
Your love is like a see-saw baby
Your love is like a see-saw baby
First you're glad and then yo're mad
You're the strangest girl I ever had
It goes up, down and up, like a see-saw
