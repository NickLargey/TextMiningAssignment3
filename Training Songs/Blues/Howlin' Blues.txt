I'm gonna leave you, I'm goin' away
I'm gonna leave, I'll be back someday
Oh well I can't stay here, no need in me stayin'
Here's nothin' for me to lose
Woooo, woooo,
Woooo, I'm goin' away,
Well I can't stay, 'til you hurt my feelings
I'm goin' away
I'm going to New Orleans, I'm worried about you
I be so broken hearted, I won't know what to do
So good bye babe, I hate to go
Here's nothin' to lose
