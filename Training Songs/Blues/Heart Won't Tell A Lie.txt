I don't get around much like I used to 
I don't cry not unless I want to
Might mean somethin' yeah

Might because I lost my baby
Or it might be my mind, yeah

Well you might think
That I'm talkin' crazy
I might even believe its true
Cause right my life's a little  hazy
I cant even put on my shoes
My big girl think the world has gone crazy darling
Or it might be my mind

[Chorus]
Search your soul and you will find 
That your heart won't tell a lie

I cant lie even if I want to 
Cause my momma didn't raise no fool
And I've seen what you been beleivin'
And I know about the golden rule
Not because I'ma dreamer baby
Or it might be my mind, my mind

[Chorus: x2]
