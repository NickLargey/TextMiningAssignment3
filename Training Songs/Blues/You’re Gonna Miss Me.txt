Oh you're gonna miss me baby
And I'll be so far away
Oh you're gonna miss me baby
And I'll be so far away
You know you better change now baby
Baby there's always another day

Oh your friend will always tell you baby
They'll say that you're going strong
Oh your friend will always tell you baby
They'll say that you're going strong
Well they'll smile and call you lover
Fool, don't you know you're doing wrong

Oh you better stop right now baby
You better stop now and draw the line
Yes you better stop right now baby
Baby better stop now and draw the line
Oh, I want you to tell me that you love me baby
And love all your no-good friends behind
