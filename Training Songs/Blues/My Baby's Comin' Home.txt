I've lost the blues there's nothing else to lose
I'm gonna count my twos I'm takin off my shoes
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home
When I first heard this boy, I did the twist
My baby's comin home

The things I did before that made her go
I ain't doin no more and I'm telling you so
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home
when I first got her wire boy I thought I would die
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home

Im meatin allmy planess i'm meatin all my trains

I'm checkin on the bus boy I'm kickin
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home
if she was comin back to you boy you'd be a fool too
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home

I ain't had what it take to make me shake
I'm bout to get a break and lose this ole ache
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home
I'm gonna change my ways i'll be busy for days
My baby's comin home
