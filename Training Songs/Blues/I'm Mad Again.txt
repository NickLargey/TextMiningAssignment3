I had a friend one time
At least I thought I did
Taken that man in my house
Give him my food over my table
That I couldn't afford

He come to me, he said
"Johnny, ain't got no place to stay"
I said, "Yes, man, come to my house"
I get you a place to stay, and a bed to sleep in
That I couldn't afford

When I found out you with my wife
Now I'm mad, like Al Capone
Well, I warned you one time
Next time I warn you
I'm gonna use my gun on you

'Cause I'm mad with you
I'm mad with you, like Al Capone
Look, man, I told you one time before
But this time I'm gonna teach you
A little lesson you won't forget

Take this man right down by the riverside
I might drown you,
I might shoot you
I don't know

Gonna tie your hands, gonna tie your feet
Gag you so you can't talk to nobody
I'm mad, I'm mad with you
You're sinkin'; I'm mad
