tell me whats the reason you keep on teasin me
you said you don't want me but you won't let me be
tell me whats the reason you do the things you do
you're breakin my achin heart till it pains me through and through

i get up in the mornin
feelin kind of good
hopin my baby
will do the things she should
i hold you in my arms
tight
and the only thing you want is another fight
