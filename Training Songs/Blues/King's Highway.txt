Walkin' down king's highway
With a brown paper bag in my hand
Nothin' else but the clothes I got on
But I ain't lookin' back

I ain't lookin' back
Blame it on the midnight girl
And that wicked spell she cast
She pulled me in with them liquid eyes

Now I ain't looking back
I ain't lookin' back
Oh what a tangled web she weaves
I was losing my mind

Starin' down the barrel of a gun
It's just a matter of time
Walkin' down king's highway
Black cat crossin' my path

I know that's her trying to make me stay
But, I ain't looking back
I ain't looking back
King's Highway

I got to travel that
King's Highway
