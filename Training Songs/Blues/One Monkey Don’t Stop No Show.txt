You wanna get rich you got to get out and dig
You want long hair go buy yourself a wig
Please believe me, gonna tell it to you slow
It's a real true sayin', "One monkey won't stop no show".

You can live in the country
You can come to town
What goes up
Is bound to come down
Please believe me, gonna tell it to you slow
Well pick up on what I'm sayin', "One monkey won't stop no show".

You can travel by bus
You can come by train
Travel by thumb
But you will get there just the same
Please believe me, gonna tell it to you slow
Yeah, dig what I'm sayin', "One monkey won't stop no show".

You don't have to be rich
Now to have plenty friends
Keep some cash on hand
If you pay off in the end
Please believe me, gonna tell it to you slow
Pick up on what I'm sayin', "One monkey won't stop no show".
