I've been in every bar
Been in every honky-tonk
Been tryin' to find my daddy
With that broke down piece o' junk
Ask everyone to help me
Cried, "Help me if you can
you'll lnow my daddy
He's that trombone playin' man
Where is my daddy?
Tell me where is my daddy
With that big long slidin' thing?

I even ask a man
That played a steel guitar
He said that you don't need him
To be moved eight to the bar
He brought his amplifier
And he hitched it in my plug
He planked it, and he plunked it
But it just wasn't good enough
'Cause I need my daddy
Need my daddy with that big long slidin' thing

Well, then a knock came at my door
I said, mmh, my daddy's back
I opened up the door
And there stood Piano Jack
He said, "I came to do some tinklin'
On your piano keys
I said, "Don't make me nervous
This ain't no time to tease
Just send me my daddy
Send me my daddy with that big long slidin' thing

Well, the first time he played
I ask him how it was done
He said, "I blow through here
Then I work my fingers and my thumb
I slide it right up
Then I slide it back again
And I gdet a lot o' wind
And then I slide it back again
That is my daddy
With that big long sliding thing, oh yeah
