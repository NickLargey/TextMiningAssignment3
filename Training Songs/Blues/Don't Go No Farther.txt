You need meat, go to the market
You need bread, try the bakery
You need love, don't go no further
Just come on home to me

I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
Somebody's gotta love me

You need grits, go to the grocery
You need fish, go to the sea
You need love, look for me, baby
And just come on home to me

I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
Somebody's gotta love me

You need money, go to the bank dear
You need honey, look for the bees
You need love, don't go no further
Just come on home to me

I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
Somebody's gotta love me
