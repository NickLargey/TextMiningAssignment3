Kiss me 
Uh huh 
Kiss me 
Kiss me 

Do you know what I think you know 
Do you know where it leads to now 
You can be the one for me 
but I'm tired of waiting around 

One thing  just think 
It's not very hard to do 
I'm gonna go running all my life 
If I leave it all up to you 

Shut up and kiss me 
Kiss me 
Kiss me mouth to mouth 
Shut up and kiss me 
Kiss me 
There's nothing to talk about 

Why don't you kiss me 
Kiss me 
Something deep and strong 
Shut up and kiss me 
Kiss me 
I've been waiting far too long 

Kiss me 
That's right 
Kiss me 
That's right 
Uh-huh 

You talk too much 
For an easy kinda man 
Come on just a little too strong 
So I just don't understand 

One thing, don't think 
Can read you just like a book 
I've seen your watching me well 
Don't just look 

Shut up and kiss me 
Kiss me 
Kiss me mouth to mouth 
Shut up and kiss me 
Kiss me 
There's nothing to talk about 

Why don't you kiss me 
Kiss me 
Something deep and strong 
Shut up and kiss me 
Kiss me 
I've been waiting far too long 

Kiss me 
That's right 
Said kiss me 
Oh kiss me 
That's right 

Uh-huh, Uh-huh 
Uh-huh, Uh-huh 
Said kiss me 
Kiss me 

Uh-huh, Uh-huh 
Uh-huh, Uh-huh 
Said Kiss me 
Kiss me 

Gonna make you 
Gonna get you 
Gonna get you now 
Never, never gonna get a chance again 
So I guess I have to show you how 

Gonna make you 
Gonna take you 
Gonna make up your mind 
Never, never gonna get a chance again 
So let's do it tonight 

Shut up and kiss me 
Kiss me 
I've been waiting far too long 

Why don't you kiss me 
Kiss me 
Kiss me 
Uh-huh 

Shut up and kiss me 
Kiss me 
Shut up and kiss me 
Shut up and kiss me 
Kiss me mouth to mouth
