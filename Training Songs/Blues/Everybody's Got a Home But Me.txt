Scooted out of Frisco over Route 101
Got a hitch as far as San Jose
Rode aboard a Greyhound till I ran outta dough
Bid the bus goodbye at Monterey
But I seen a lot of things along the way
And I did a lot of thinkin' on the way

I rode by a house
With the windows lighted up
Lookin' pretty as a Christmas tree
And I said to myself
As I rode by myself
Everybody's got a home but me

I rode by a house
Where the moon was on the porch
And the girl was on her fella's knee
And I said to myself
As I rode by myself
Everybody's got a home but me

I am free and I'm happy
To be free
(To be free)
(To be free)
To be free in the way
I wanna be
(Wanna be)
(Wanna be)

But once in a while
When I'm talkin' to myself
And there's no one there to disagree
I look up and I cry
To a big empty sky
Won't there ever be
A home for me somewhere
Everybody's got a home but me
