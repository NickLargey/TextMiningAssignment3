Paranoid and pissed off
Now that I got the money
Fifty acres and a model A
Right in the middle of Trump country
I told you there goes a neighbourhood
Now mister Williams ain't so funny
I see you looking out your window
Can’t wait to call the police on me
When I know you think I'm up to somethin'
I'm just eating out but still hungry
And this is my analogy
I ain't even near you can't till you put me
I remember when you used to tell me

'Nigga run, nigga run
Go back where you come from
Nigga run, nigga run
Go back where you come from
We don't want, we don’t want your kind
We think you’s a dog born
F*ck you, I'm America’s son
This is where I come from

This land is mine
This land is mine
This land is mine
This land is mine

Up till the sun comes up
No I can't stop grindin'
And I can't let ’em break me
No I can't let 'em find me
You can meet my friend the governor
Only if you wanna try me
Or you can meet my other friend the judge
Just in case you think I'm lyin'
And I know you think I'm up to somethin'
I'm just eating out but still hungry
And this is my analogy
I ain't leaving here you can't take it from me
I remember when you used to tell me

'Nigga run, nigga run
Go back where you come from
Nigga run, nigga run
Go back where you come from
We don't want, we don't want your kind
We think you's a dog born
F*ck you, I'm America's son
This is where I come from

This land is mine
This land is mine
This land is mine
This land is mine

This land is mine
