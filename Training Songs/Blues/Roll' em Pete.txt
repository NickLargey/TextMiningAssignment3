Well, I got a gal, she lives up on the hill
Well, this woman's tryin' to quit me, Lord, but I love her still
She's got eyes like diamonds, they shine like Klondike gold

She's got eyes like diamonds, they shine like Klondike gold
Every time she loves me, she sends my mellow soul

Pretty baby, I'm goin' away and leave you by yourself
You've mistreated me, now you can mistreat somebody else
