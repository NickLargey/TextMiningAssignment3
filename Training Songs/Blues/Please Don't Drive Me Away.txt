Baby please don't you drive me away
Baby please don't you drive me away
Now, you know I need you, want you by my side
My love for you I'll never hide

Now if you love you will hear my plea
Put me out and that's the end of me
Baby please don't you drive me away

One more thing honey
You know I want you, I love you so
I never, never, never, never, never let you go
Baby, please don't you drive me away, oh yeah

Oh please, please don't you drive me away
Don't you hear me telling you?
Don't drive me away

Let me tell you
You know I need you, want you by my side
My love for you I'll never hide

Won't you love me, won't you hear my plea?
Put me out and that's the end of me
Baby please don't you drive me away
