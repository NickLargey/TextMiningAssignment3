My gal gon' sail
To some foreign distant land
My gal gon' sail
To some foreign distant land

An' I'm gon' be
Some other woman's man

Said on, sail on, little girl, sail on
Go on, sail on, little girl, sail on
You gon' keep on sailin'
Till you lose yo' happy home

When that mean old train
Carried my gal away, befo'
When that mean old train
Carried my gal away, befo'

I was young and wild
People, I didn't know

I could change my mind
And love somebody else
I could change my mind
And love somebody else

I lived in misery
But I brought it on, myself

But I'm so glad
I don't feel that way, no mo'
But I'm so glad
I don't feel that way, no mo'

If she can stand to leave me
I can stand to see her go
