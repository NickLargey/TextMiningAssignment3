Either your butt’s too big
Or your hair’s too long
Or your eyes too wide
Or your head’s too strong
Either you got too much
Or you got too less
Either you’re under woman
Or you’re over dressed (ha!)

All those opinion’s gonna make you fake
Go on and brush it off it’s just dead weight
Only thing that matters
That you need to know
You’ll only find it in your heart and soul

Whoa whoa whoa
Haters gonna hate
People gonna say what they say
But we don’t care about that anyway
Whoa whoa whoa
Don’t you ever change
People gonna say what they say
But we don’t care about that anyway

If you’re lookin’ good
Then you must be dumb
If you ain’t got money
Then you’re not someone
Either you’re too young to matter
Or you’re way too old (too old)
Public opinion is so hot and cold

So don’t you listen to a word they say
They gonna keep on talkin’ anyway
Only thing that matters
That you need to know
You’ll only find it in your heart and soul

Whoa whoa whoa
Haters gonna hate
People gonna say what they say
But we don’t care about that anyway
Whoa whoa whoa
Don’t you ever change
People gonna say what they say
But we don’t care about that anyway

We don’t care what they say
We don’t care let haters hate
People gon’ say what they say
We don’t care about that anyway (anyway)

We don’t care what they say
Don’t you ever ever change
People gon’ say what they say
We don’t care about that anyway (anyway)

Whoa whoa whoa
Haters gonna hate
People gonna say what they say
But we don’t care about that anyway
Whoa whoa whoa
Don’t you ever change
People gonna say what they say
But we don’t care about that anyway

Whoa whoa whoa
We don’t care about that anyway
