I got the blues
I feel so lonely
I'd give the world if I could only make you understand
Yes, it surely would be grand
I'm simply wild about my baby
Ask her won't she please come home
Since she's gone I stay worried all the time
So, baby, won't you please come home?
You know your daddy's all alone
I have tried but all in vain
Never no more to call your name
Since you left, you know you broke my heart
But that will never make us part
Every hour, every day
You can hear me say
Baby, won't you please come home to your daddy?
Baby, won't you please come home?
Since you left you know you broke my heart
But that will never make us part
Every hour, every day
You can hear me say
Baby, won't you please come home to your daddy?
Baby, won't you please come home?
