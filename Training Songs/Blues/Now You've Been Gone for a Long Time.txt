Now you've been gone for a long time,
Run off with my heart into the night,
Once I'd have thought that you'd never let me go,
Now I'm alone after all.
I've sat for hours at my table
Poring over maps about our stars.
All they would say is that you were always here,
Now like a ghost you've disapeared.
Strange how you came like a reed up from the sea
Up from the blood in my veins
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. . .
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. 
Now that the cold and the silence
That you left behind you are my friends.
I wonder why you padlocked up my heart
if you never meant to return.
Now you've been gone for a long time,
Run off with my heart into the night,
Once I'd have thought that you'd never let me go,
Now I'm alone after all.
