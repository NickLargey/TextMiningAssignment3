Lower down your chariot, baby
And let your daddy ride
Low down your chariot, baby
And let your daddy ride
'Cause your daddy's sick and tired
You know I wanna lay down

I hold out my handle
I stretch forth hand to thee
Hold out my handle girl
And I stretch forth hand to thee
I gonna love you little girl
I don't want nobody else

Yeah, little girl
I got to leave you now
Yeah, little girl, little girl
I got to leave you now
