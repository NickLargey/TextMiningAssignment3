I don't know my real name
I don't know when I was born
I don't know my real name
I don't know when I was born
The trouble I've been havin'
Seem like I was raised in an orphan home

My mother died and left me
When I was only two years old
My mother died and left me
When I was only two years old
And the trouble I've been havin'
The good Lord, only knows

I been treated like an orphan
And been worked, just like a slave
I been treated just like an orphan
And I've been worked, just like a slave
And if I never get my revenge
Evilness will carry to my grave

Play it one time

Now, I've been havin' trouble
Ever since I've been grown
Now, I've been havin' trouble
Ever since I've been grown
I'm too old for the orphan
And too young for an old folks home

Play it boys, play it, play it
Yes, yes
