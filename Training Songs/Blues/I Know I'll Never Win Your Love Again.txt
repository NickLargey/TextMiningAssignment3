Day and night I worry over you
I'm payin' now for bein' so untrue
I pray each night although it seems in vain
I know I'll never win your love again
I won your love for such a precious jewel
You pleaded dear and yet I was so cruel
A love so rare cannot be bound and chained
I know I'll never win your love again
[ steel ]
I try so hard to change what cannot be
And yet how weak my efforts seem to me
In fate's cruel hands forever I'll remain
I know I'll never win your love again
Within my heart there'll always be a chill
Until at last it's beating shall be still
My weary soul will find it's journey's end
I know I'll never win your love again
