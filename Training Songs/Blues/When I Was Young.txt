When I was young and in my prime
The girls used to hold me up all the time
But I'm gettin' old every day
It's a pity that now I ain't gettin' any!

So la la la la
La la la la la

They used to call me their lover man
But what they call me now is a dirty shame
If I could live my life all over again
I'd never pass the age of ten!

So la la la la
La la la la la

You heard my strong, I sung my song
Believe me nobody wants you when your youth is gone
So take my advice as a friend
When your youth is gone, that's the end!

So la la la la
La la la la la
