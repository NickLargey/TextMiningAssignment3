I have a tendency to keep a worryin'
No matter where I am or go, and it's all because
You say you don't want me no more, no more

You've got me cryin', you've got me sighin'
You've got me tellin' folks that never knew
How much you've got me worryin', 'bout you

Sun don't seem to shine, no more, because of the rain
My birdie's lovely song don't even sound the same

I try to sing, I try to dance
But when I find myself, I'm in a trance
'Cause you got me pretty worried 'bout you

Yeah, get it now, little low'

Sun don't seem to shine, no more, because of the rain
My birdie's lovely song don't even sound the same

I try to sing, I try to dance
But when I find myself, I'm in a trance
'Cause you've got me, yes, you've got me
And I'm worrin' 'bout you
