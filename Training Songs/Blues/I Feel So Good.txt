I got a letter
It come to me by mail
My baby's a comin' home
I hope that she won't fail

Because I feel so good
I feel so good
You know I feel so good
Feel like ballin' the jack

I drove into town to that old station
Just to meet her old train
My baby said, "She's a comin' home"
I hope that she won't fail

Because I feel so good
I feel so good
You know I feel so good
Feel like ballin' the jack

Feel so good, I hope I always will
Feel just like I just got out of jail
Where ever I'm with you

Because I feel so good
I feel so good
You know I feel so good
Feel like ballin' the jack

All right, I can see you
Let's have you
Are you with me up there?
Are you with me, are you with me?

Feel so good

Shout as loud as you can
'Cause we're going to try
And record this, so you're gonna know
You're gonna know what
