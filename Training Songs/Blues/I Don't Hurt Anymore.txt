I don't hurt anymore
All my teardrops are dried
No more walkin' the floor
With that burnin' inside
Just to think it could be
Time has opened the door
And at last I am free
No I don't hurt anymore

No use to deny I wanted to die
The day you said we were through
But now that I find you're out of my mind
And I can't believe that it's true
I've forgotten somehow
That I cared so before
Yes, it's wonderful now
That I don't hurt anymore

Just to think it could be
Time has opened the door
And at last I am free
I don't hurt anymore

No use to deny I wanted to die
The day you said we were through

And I can't believe that it's true
I've forgotten somehow
That I cared so before
And it's wonderful now
That I don't hurt anymore
Yes, it's wondeful now
That I don't hurt anymore
