The news is out all over town
That you've been seen, oh runnin' 'round
I know that I should go but then
I just can't go, you win again

Oh this heart of mine will never see
Oh what everybody knew but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
Well what can I do you win again?

Oh this heart of mine will never see
Oh what everybody knew but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
Well what can I do, you win again?
