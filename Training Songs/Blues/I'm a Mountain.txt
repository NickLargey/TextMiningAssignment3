Well now how did they get that lady on TV
Laughing so naturally
For a Wal-Mart ad
Is it not as bad as I thought?

There's a woman sending poisonous mail
And they caught her now she's sitting in jail
While the weather station forecasts hail
From the tropics

Oh I spent the day in a shopping mall
Through the biggest storm of the century
I'm a mountain
I'm a mountain like you said to be

The sports man and his double chin
Don't listen to me in this state I'm in
Saying things about people that I don't know

Well it's just that way when you get hurt
And the things you need you're made to work 
You must decide if you will die or grow

Oh I spent the day in a shopping mall
Through the biggest storm of the century
I'm a mountain
I'm a mountain 
Like you said to be
