It's easy to say you love me
It's easy to just play the part
I want to believe you love me
But you can't fool my heart

You gave me a promise true dear
But somehow I knew from the start
That you'd never keep your promise
No, you can't fool my heart

I know you're just pretending
And the things you say are untrue
And I'm sure you'll soon be spending
Your love with somebody new

I don't have to keep pretending
I know that we're drifting apart
You might think you are fooling someone
But you can't fool my heart

I know you're just pretending
And the things you say are untrue
And I'm sure you'll soon be spending
Your love with somebody new

I don't have to keep pretending
I know that we're drifting apart
You might think you are fooling someone
But you can't fool my heart
No, you can't fool my heart
