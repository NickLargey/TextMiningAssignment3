Oh, how I'm sufferin', in my mind
You keep me worryin', Lord all the time
I try to smile but my friends all leave
But nothing I could do to ease my sufferin' mind

It hurts me so bad to be losing the one I love
I cry, I cry and pray to the Lord up above
But where can I find
Someone that could ease my sufferin' mind

If I have any witness
You know that you will find
That life means nothing to you, baby
If you have a worried mind

So forgive me for what I do
'Cause I live on with a sufferin' mind, oh
