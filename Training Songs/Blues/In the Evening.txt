In the evening, in the evening
Baby, when the sun goes down
In the evening, baby when the sun goes down
Well, ain't it lonesome, man ain't happy, Sonny Boy
When your love is not around
Oh, when the sun goes down

Last night I laid sleeping
I was thinking to myself
Last night I lay there sleepin'
I was thinkin' to myself
Thinkin 'bout the one that we loved best, gone
Mistreat you for somebody else

Oh, when the sun goes down
Sun rises in the east
It sets in the west 
Sun rising east, Sonny Boy
Said take me in the west 
Well, ain't it hard to tell, your heart to *car'
Which ones that will fit you the best

Oh, when the sun goes down 

Woo, hittin' me
Oh, ooh, oh
Hoo, hittin' you
Love, is cold, Sonny
Hoo, gettin' mean
Lordy!

Goodbye, my old sweetheart
Where have you been?
Yeah, just went away 
I may be back there, see you again
Some rainy day
Well, in the ev'nin, in the ev'nin, baby
Honey, when the sun goes down

Oh, when the sun goes down.
