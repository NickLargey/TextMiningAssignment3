(Ha, ha, ha, ha)

Pick me up in the mo' nin'
Honey, just to let me know, oh
Baby, girl in the evenin'
Way upon the fifteen floor
Girl, you know I love you an' I
Can't stand to see ya go

Remember on the first day I met you
Remember ev'rything you said
Oh, baby, told me you love me
That went ta my head
Oh you know I love you and I
Can't stand to see you go

I backed up, to the window
I looked down on the ground
Oh baby, don't say you're leavin'
If you do I'm gonna jump down

Oh I know I love you
An' I can't stand to see you go

Hurry baby, if ya leavin'
Call me on the phone, woo
Oh baby, ooh I'm waitin'
I'm livin' here all alone

Girl you know I love you and I
Can't stand to see you go
