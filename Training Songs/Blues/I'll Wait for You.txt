Along about the evening
I feel so blue
And though my heart is grieving
I'll wait for you

I'm writing you a letter
'Cause our love's so true
Although I'm sad and lonely
I'll wait for you

When the moon was high
And the lights were low
That's the time when you and I
Said our love would grow

If you ever get the notion
You'll miss me too
Make it in a hurry
I'll wait for you

'Round 'bout the midnight
I miss you so
So baby, won't you do right
I'll wait for you

You need my arms around you
To hold you tight
I'll give you all my lovin'
Both day and night

When the moon is high
And the lights are low
That's the time when you and I
Know our love will grow

If you ever get the notion
You'll miss me too
Just make it in a hurry
I'll wait for you
