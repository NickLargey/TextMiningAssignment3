I'm gonna get high
And it ain't no lie
And swing alone and have a ball
I'm gonna get high

Oh me, oh my
Nobody know why
Oh my baby don't you cry
I'm gonna get high

It ain't no need of no one
Tryin' to shame me
But what a state I've got in
Who could blame me? Oh, yes

I'm gonna get high
I'll do it or die
And swing alone and have a ball
I'm gonna get high, yeah, yeah

Beat it out for me, then

And it ain't no lie
And swing alone and have a ball
I'm gonna get high

Oh me, oh my
Nobody know why
Oh my baby, don't you cry
I'm gonna get high

It ain't no need of no one
Tryin' to shame me, yeah-yeah
But what a state I've got in
Who could blame me? Oh, yeah

Oh, I'm gonna get high
I'll do it or die
And swing alone and have a ball
I'm gonna get high

Zip it now

Swing alone and have a ball
