My name is, Washboard Sam
But they call me, Lovin' Joe
Listen to what I says
If you really wants to know 

Ooh, baby
Meet me down in lover's lane
I want you to sit an listen
Hoo, girl to my wonderful plan

Now, baby I'm not a bad man
You know we ain't no kin
If you don't wanna be my woman
We will still be friends

Ooh, babe
Meet me down in lover's lane
I want you to sit an listen
Hoo, girl to my wonderful plan

Now, when we are talkin'
I want you to hold my hand
Look me in the eye
I think I can make you understand

Whoa, babe
Meet me down in lover's lane
I want you to sit an listen
Hoo, Lord, to my wonderful plan

Play it one time, boy, play it one time

I'll ask the ladies in yo' neighborhood
About my plans
And they all will tell you
That Lovin' Sam, is 'The Man'

Ooh, babe
Meet me down in lover's lane
I want you to sit an listen
Hoo, girl, to my wonderful plan.
