You're the one, you're the one that I adore
You're the one, you're the one that I adore
And the way I love you baby
Only me and the good Lord knows

I'm gonna copyright your kisses and all your hugs
And I'll put a claim baby on all your love

Cause' you're the one, you're the one that I adore
And the way I love you baby
Only me and the good Lord knows

All my friends tell me including my kin folks
You ain't no good for me
But I don't worry about it, I wonder why should they be

You're the one, you're the one I adore
And the way I love you baby
Only me and the good Lord know
