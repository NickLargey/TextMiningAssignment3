I see your mouth moving
But there's a circus coming out
Always busy proving
What the world is all about
It's no use looking you in the eye
I don't believe a word you say

Blame it on hard living
Blame it on the times
Blame it on the victims
All stumbling behind
I don't even need to look you in the eye
I don't believe a word you say

Don't know what to do without you
Don't know what to do with you
Used to look at you with wonder
Now I look at you and wonder
I can't even look you in the eye
I don't believe a word you say
