Won’t you ride, and you can’t be told now
You can’t be told now, you can’t be told
Won’t you ride, and you can’t be told now
You can’t be told now, you can’t be told

Spent his whole life running
Trying to make it tomorrow
Seems like he was lonely
But he makes it stop
See hoe he live it see where it bends
Same destination, 6 feet in the ground

He go back like the sound
You can’t be told, you can’t be told
He go back like the sound
You can’t be told, you can’t be told

I ain’t trying to be nobody
But my past is here
I ain’t like you every’s around
And I have nothing less
Yeah I gotta break the law
Break you free from these chains
I did some things, when that judge call my name

You start running, every day every night
You wanna ride
You start running, every day every night
You wanna ride

Won’t you ride, and you can’t be told now
You can’t be told now, you can’t be told
Won’t you ride, and you can’t be told now
You can’t be told now, you can’t be told

Won’t you ride, and you can’t be told now
You can’t be told now, you can’t be told
