Troubles, trouble, troubles, troubles is all in the world I see
Troubles, trouble, troubles, troubles is all in the world I see
Oh sometimes I wonder, wonder what is gonna become of me

When I wake up early in the morning, blues and troubles all around my bed
Oh when I wake up early in the morning, blues and troubles all around my bed
Oh I never will forget people, the last words I heard my baby said

She said I'm leaving you in the morning, BB and crying won't make me stay
She said I'm leaving you in the morning, BB and your crying won't make me stay
Ah the more you cry honey, the farther you're going to drive me away

Oh if you just got to go baby, I hope you will come back one day
Oh yes if you just got to go baby, please come on back some day
Oh but I never will forget baby, baby the way we used to love and play
