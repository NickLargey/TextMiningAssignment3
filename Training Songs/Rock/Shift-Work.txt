She's ten to five
But I'm shiftwork
And my woman alive
Shiftwork 

Shiftwork 
I thought shiftwork would work
But it's good as broken us apart 

Lights flash over me 
Twenty-four hour bulb
I'm just home for tea 
But she's in work mode 

Shiftwork 
Shiftwork 
And they will shake you by the hands 
For shiftwork 
But being abandoned by your woman 
Is the price for shiftwork 

Shiftwork 
Shiftwork 
Shiftwork 
Shiftwork, you let me down 
Gave me a hard heart 
You just cracked my mind 
You split us apart 
Shiftwork 

Shiftwork 
Shiftwork 
Raise your wages per year one grand
By shiftwork 
But I can see me go, go, going from this land
Because of shiftwork 

Shiftwork 
I don't give her a chance 
She gets the the morning rant
Gets in at eleven 
Doing overtime
I'm going out at the time 
Just to hang out with a woman who was my... 

Shiftwork 
She was ten to five 
But I'm shiftwork 
And that woman that once was mine 
It's just shiftwork 

Shiftwork 
Shiftwork 
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now 

Shiftwork 
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now 
Shiftwork 
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now 

Shiftwork 
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now 
Shiftwork 
Now, now, now, now 

Where are you going?
This work has not yet reached
Cessation.
