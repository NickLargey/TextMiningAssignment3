She thinks of John Travolta on the same day as me
She even likes artichoke hearts like me
She likes corn
Corn on the cob
She eats cornflakes before she goes to her job
Well she's an artist, she's got everything she needs
She's very modest 
Got a bruise on her knee
She's got a mole on her back
It's hairy and black 
She's got a butt like a pillow and she likes to wear black

Well I wanna be her hero
Wanna be her man
Well I wanna be her lover any way I can
And I wanna be her friend and I'm doing all I can
'cause I love her little smiles and all the letters she sends
She sends me

She's a dopey little girl and her names not Nancy
In her own little world her names Diane
She likes to play piano
Love to hear her play
She likes to talk to me
I love to hear her say
She loves me a whole freakin lot
She loves me a whole freakin lot
She loves me a whole freakin lot
Oh she loves me a whole freakin lot

Well I wanna be her hero
Wanna be her man
Well I wanna be her lover any way I can
And I wanna be her friend and I'm doing all I can
'cause I love her little smiles and all the letters she sends
She sends me

Well I wanna be her hero
Wanna be her man
Well I wanna be her lover any way I can
And I wanna be her friend and I'm doing all I can
'cause I love her little smiles and all the letters she sends

Well I wanna be her lover for the rest of my life
'cause I know I'm gonna love her for the rest of my life
Well I wanna be friend and I'm doing all I can
'cause I love her little smiles and all the letters she sends
She sends me
