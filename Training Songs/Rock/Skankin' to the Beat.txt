Skankin' to the beat is an alright feelin'
Skankin' to the beat got my toe jams peelin'
Skankin' to the beat got the rude girls squeelin'
I'm just skankin' to the beat

Dancin', I'm dancin' to the Rastafarian up beat
Hangin' with my rude ska brothers in the street
Our brother over here say, "Turn up the box a"
Dancin' and dance could rock us all the day long

It'll knock your sock off
Sayin' there's no brother Fishbone
So, get up off your seats and let's skank to beat
Said Fishbone brothers, let's skank to the beat

Skankin' to the beat is an alright feelin'
Skankin' to the beat got my toe jams peelin'
Skankin' to the beat got the rude girls squeelin'
I'm just skankin' to the beat

Skankin' through hard times, slim with the good
I said all this kickin' doesn't make it feel real good
I don't know what's up, now grindin' like it should
All they wanna do is turn on that reggae beat
All they wanna do is skank to the beat, skankin'
All they wanna do is skank on the street

Skankin' to the beat is an alright feelin'
Skankin' to the beat got my toe jams peelin'
Skankin' to the beat got the rude girls squeelin'
I'm just skankin' to the beat

Let's slow down the pace for the human race
Said let's low down the pace for heaven's sake
Let's slow down the music to drum 'n' bass
Let's slow down the pace and make it alright

Now, it's my time to say what I got to say
Now, it's my time to just skank my way
I said you skankin' to the east, you skankin' the west
I'm skankin' with my rude girl with the big breast

Oh, east or west, I love to skank
Oh, east or west, said I love to skank
Oh, [Incomprehensible] and I love to skank
Oh, [Incomprehensible] said I love to skank

Skankin' to the beat is an alright feelin'
Skankin' to the beat got my toe jams peelin'
Skankin' to the beat got the rude girls squeelin'
I'm just skankin' to the beat

Skankin' to the beat is an alright feelin'
Skankin' to the beat got my toe jams peelin'
Skankin' to the beat got the rude girls squeelin'
I'm just skankin' to the beat
