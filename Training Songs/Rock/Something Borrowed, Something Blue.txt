Polystyrene, I wanna daydream, I need an enemy to get me through,
Prodigal sunscreen, our love's a guillotine, something borrowed, something blue.
Another ship sunk, family tree trunk, deep scar diving, I look for you,
And we're hoping and we're choking, something borrowed, something blue.

I get the feeling I could leave you on the interstate,
I get the feeling like I just broke through.
I get the feeling like you never mattered anyway,
Something borrowed, something blue.

It gets harder, my father, the weight you manage and the damage too,
Polystyrene, I wanna daydream, something borrowed, something

I get the feeling I could leave you on the interstate,
I get the feeling like I just broke through.
I get the feeling like you never mattered anyway,
Something borrowed, something,
I get the feeling I could leave you on the interstate,
I get the feeling like I just broke through.
I get the feeling like you never mattered anyway,
Something borrowed, something blue, something borrowed, something blue,
Something borrowed, something blue, something borrowed, something blue.

Ten floors, I'm falling, guess who I'm recalling?
Oh yeah, it's true, my life begins and ends with you.

I get the feeling I could leave you on the interstate,
I get the feeling like I just broke through.
I get the feeling like you never mattered anyway,
Something borrowed, something,
I get the feeling I could leave you on the interstate,
I get the feeling like I just broke through.
I get the feeling like you never mattered anyway,
Something borrowed, something blue, something borrowed, something blue,
Something borrowed, something blue, something borrowed, something blue.
