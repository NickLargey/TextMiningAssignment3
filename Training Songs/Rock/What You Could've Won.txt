It's closing time and it's getting late
Can you fetch my coat?
'Cause I don't feel too great anymore
But I want to stay
Don't you want to stay as well?

I don't think that you do
I've got this funny feeling
That you don't feel like I do
This conversation's just passing you by
I know it, I can see it in your eyes

You've had one too many, low and behold
You're telling the secrets that can't be told
It feels so special, it feels so right
But then you knock me back and I fall
I fall to the floor

And all he wanted was a kiss
All he wanted was a chance tonight

I'm walking home, I'm pissed and I'm frozen
My minds being warmed up
By that little token of you
In your little way
But they're sleeping in your today

And now beeps the phone
I fumble round to answer
But I end up with it on hold
Late night taxis keep passing me by
I feel sick and look to the sky

I've had one too many, low and behold
The late night lovers stay out in the cold
I ring your number and feel so bold
You kick me into touch and I fall to the floor

And all he wanted was a kiss
All he wanted was a chance tonight

And yeah, your ignorance was bliss
Your ignorance was paradise
Just give him a chance
Just give him a sign or something
Tell him what you want

'Cause before too long he'll find somebody else
It's then that you'll know you want him more
You call his name and he doesn't respond
He knocks you back and you fall

You're not just a number upon a computer
Or a waiting list
You're not just a number upon a computer
Or a shopping list
