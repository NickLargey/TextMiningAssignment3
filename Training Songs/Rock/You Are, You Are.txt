You are you are
Hopefully mistaken
Like old ties
You'll soon be broken down
Like all the rest who tried

You are you are
Something quite surprising
Story's odd
Concerning love
The scene will change for you, you know

You are you are
Just a good reflection
Nothing more
You'd like to take me for the world
To see you leave

You are you are
A living exhibition
Defying age
Like a seasoned veteran
Of men for cash

I know how to hide and wait for you
I know how to wait I won't forget
Exactly what you are
See her shine like stars
Before they burn
See her shine with stars
Before they fade away
Such a shame
The best of fame
