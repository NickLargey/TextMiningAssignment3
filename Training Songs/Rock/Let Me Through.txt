Lovin' is a wild thing
And if you stand in my way
I'm gonna bully bully bully
Bully till I'm free

The apple is shining
Like glass on a highway
Devotion is salt in, salt in
Any wound of my say

I got a bloodhound tooth, hanging like a dagger in a bar back west
If you try and pull it down, you know I'll save all my best

Shots for you
Boom, boom, boom
Shots for you
Boom, boom, boom

Trouble is my heart twin
Oh, I shovel as I sing-sing
I'm gonna dig it till I cut through
Heaving on the whole thing

The moon is mindless
But its pulling is timeless
I'm gonna bully-bully like this, hike this
Until my path is windless

I'm a bad man, let me through, I'm a bad man, let me through
I'm a bad man, let me through, I'm a bad man, let me through

I got a bloodhound tooth, hanging like a dagger in a bar back west
If you try and pull it down, you know I'll save all my best

Shots for you
Boom, boom, boom
Shots for you
Boom, boom, boom

Ooh, no one knows better than
Ooh, than the wrecker and the wrecked man
Ooh, don't need no protector, I'm a bad man, let me through

I'm a bad man, let me through, I'm a bad man, let me through
I'm a bad man, let me through, I'm a bad man, let me through, ow

I got a bloodhound tooth, hanging like a dagger in a bar out west, yeah
And if you try and pull it down, you know I'll save all my best

Shots for you
Boom, boom, boom
Shots for you you you
Boom, boom, boom

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
