Yeah umm 
See it's situations like this 
That causes us players to get caught up 
In umm the truth (truth hurts)
Yeah 
(Truth hurts) what you doing, where you been?
I paged you and you ain't hit me back 
I been callin' and I know you see my number on that caller I.D.
Just listen to the words (truth hurts)

I got reason to believe that you've been foolin' around 
The way you feel, the passion in us 
The things you did 
It don't matter to me 
For what it's worth just don't lie to me 
'Cause that ain't what I need right now
Baby, everything we built on trust 
You're tearing it down 
'Cause I know the truth hurts (truth hurts)

Tell me the truth now 
What cha been doing and who 
Ya been doing it with (truth hurts)
Where you been going and 
How you been putting ya thing down (truth hurts)
Whatever you was working  
I hope that it was worth it baby (truth hurts)
I got reason to believe that you been foolin' around 

Girl, I'm really tryin' hard to understand 
I want to move on and put it in the past 
'Cause, you claim that you ain't doin' nothing 
Must be my insecurities
It's got the best of me right now 
What I know I can't hold it inside of me 
It's gonna drive me insane 

(Truth hurts, truth hurts) Tell me the truth now 
What cha been doing and who 
Ya been doing it with (truth hurts)
Where you been going and 
How you been putting ya thing down (truth hurts)
Whatever you was working  
I hope that it was worth it baby (truth hurts)
I got reason to believe that you been foolin' around

Now wait a minute
Oh, listen babe (truth hurts)
The truth is I've got the secret 
I've been keeping from you baby 
'Cause I know that you 
Gonna tear up the place 
Punch me in my face 
Pull the hot clips out

My guilty conscience 
Is the real reason I wrote this song
