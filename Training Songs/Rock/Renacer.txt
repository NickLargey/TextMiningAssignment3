The gate you're afraid to enter
Holds the treasures you seek
Your flesh, my bones
Young hearts, old souls
The gate you're afraid to enter
Holds the treasures you seek
Silver and gold
Young hearts, old souls

This is the death of the subconscious you knew
Follow the inner voice, follow the truth
Forever we are bound to this burial ground
Unless we let the light shine through

(Reborn)
My heart it no longer bleeds[?]
(Reborn)
I've got the love that I need
Stop wasting your time waiting on misery
I'm reborn eternally

When you look in the mirror
Are you proud of what you see?
When you look in the mirror
Are you the person you thought you'd be?

The gate you're afraid to enter
Holds the treasures you seek
Your flesh, my bones
Young hearts, old souls
The gate you're afraid to enter
Holds the treasures you seek
Silver and gold
Young hearts, old souls
Your flesh, my bones
Young hearts, old souls
