I've been kicked, I've been hit
I've been scratched, I've been bit
I've been pushed around, shoved around
Had it rough but it ain't enough

'Cause I never knew an angel could be so wild
I never felt love till I tried your style

Lipstick and leather
Black and red, oh yeah
Lipstick and leather
Rock and roll, baby
Made a mess of my head

I've been slapped, I've been blamed
I've been attacked and I've been chained
Yeah, you put me down, slapped me 'round
Long enough but love is tough

'Cause you're ready, willing, able to please
Somebody tell me why I'm down on my knees
I said, this must be love or I'm going insane
There's such a thin, thin line between pleasure and pain

Lipstick and leather
Black and red, oh yeah
Lipstick and leather
Black and red

The girl gets around
Red lips like a traffic light
But when the girl gets down
Leather love's gonna burn all night

Oh, lipstick and leather
Black and red, oh yeah
Lipstick and leather
Black and red

I've been kicked, I've been hit
(Lipstick and leather)
I've been scratched and I've been bit
You can knock me down, I'm gonna get back up
(Lipstick and leather)
Yeah, I had it all but it ain't enough

I've been scratched
(Lipstick and leather)
I've been attacked and chained
Driven down on my knees
And I'm goin' insane

Over lipstick and leather
Black and red
'Cause that rock 'n' roll, baby
Made a mess of my head

With your lipstick and leather
Black and red, oh yeah
But your lipstick and leather
Black and red, oh

Lipstick and leather
