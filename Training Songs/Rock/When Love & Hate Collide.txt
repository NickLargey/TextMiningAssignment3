You could have a change of heart if you would only change your mind
Instead of slamming down the phone girl for the hundredth time
I got your number on my wall but I ain't gonna make that call
When divided we stand baby united we fall

Got the time got a chance gonna make it
Got my hands on your heart gonna take it all I know, I can't fight this flame
You could have a change of heart if you would only change your mind
'Cause I'm crazy 'bout you baby time after time

Without you, one night alone
Is like a year without you baby do you have a heart of stone?
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside when love and hate collide

I don't wanna fight no more I don't know what we're fighting for
When we treat each other baby like an act of war
I could tell a million lies and it would come as no surprise
When the truth is like a stranger hits you right between the eyes

There's a time and a place and a reason and I know
I got a love to believe in all I know got to win this time

Without you, one night alone
Is like a year without you baby do you have a heart of stone?
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside when love and hate collide

You could have a change of heart
If you would only change your mind
'Cause I'm crazy 'bout you baby
Crazy, crazy

Without you, one night alone
Is like a year without you baby do you have a heart of stone?
Without you, one night alone
Is like a year without you baby if you have a heart at all
Without you, can't stop the hurt inside when love and hate collide
