You run away
You could turn and stay
But you run away from me.

I tried to be your brother
You cried and ran for cover
I made a mess, who doesn’t
I did my best but it wasn’t enough

You run away
You turn and stay
But you run away from me.

You run away
You could turn and stay
But you run away from me.

I’ll give you something you can cry about
One thing you should try it out
Hold a mirror shoulder high
When you’re older look you in the eye
When you’re older look you in the eye

I tried but you tried harder
I lied but you lied smarter
You made me guess who was it
I did my best but it wasn’t enough

You run away
You could turn and stay
But you run away from me

You run away (I tried to be your brother)
You could turn and stay (You cried and ran for cover)
But you run away from me (I made a mess, who doesn’t, I did my best but it wasn’t enough)

It's not something you cry about (Cry!)
It’s not something you lie about

You run away (I tried to be your brother)
You could turn and stay (You cried and ran for cover)
But you run away from me (I made a mess, who doesn’t, I did my best but it wasn’t enough)
