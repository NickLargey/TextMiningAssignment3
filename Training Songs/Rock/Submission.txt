Sink into warm flesh
I want to taste your skin
Want to see you undressed
And see you shake your thing
You're bound and helpless
And burning from within
There for the taking
I want to hear you sing

You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on, submission
You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on, submission

There's nothing I won't do
Even if it's wrong
To please you
That's where I'm coming from
You warp my senses
You're coming on so strong
I gotta go down
I gotta get it on

You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on, submission
You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on, submission

Sink into warm flesh
You got me in a daze
You give me fever
You hold me in your sway
You're my addiction
For you I'd take the blame
Feel the friction
And take it all the way

You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on, submission
You turn me on
You cut me with your tongue
You take it all on, submission
