The ash set in then blew away
It's getting lost into the sea
I grew so close to all the thoughts I had, to leave forever
I left the chill and voice, the screams in kids, and ran for shelter

You know I won't say sorry
Do you know I won't say sorry? 
The pain has a bad reaction
A blend of fear and passion
Do you know what it's like to believe? 
It makes me wanna scream

I see a glow from far away
A faint reflection on the sea
I left some words quite far from here to be a sure reminder
I laid them out in stone in case they need to last forever

You know I won't say sorry
Do you know I won't say sorry? 
The pain has a bad reaction
A blend of fear and passion
Do you know what it's like to believe? 
It makes me wanna scream

I see the stars, they're in your eyes
A playful kiss kept undecided
I'm fast asleep in the nick of time
You lost your wish, I can't help you find it
I'm on my knees to sworn the start
A fresh new start to be undecided

If love's the word, that you say 
You say it, I will listen
