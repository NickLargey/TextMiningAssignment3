Falling in hate with you
More and more everyday
Falling away from this in every way
Is it right is it wrong
You and I don't belong

Falling in hate nothing to say don't want to hear you
Falling away nothing to give no
Falling in hate nothing but fear in you heart
Falling away nothing to live for

To you its a game to me its a joke
A mile to hang by with one inch of rope
Is it wrong is it right
You and I day and night

Falling in hate nothing to say don't want to hear you
Falling away nothing to give no
Falling in hate nothing but fear in you heart
Falling away nothing to live for

Despite what you think of me
And despite what you say
I gave you everything
And you threw it away

Falling in hate nothing to say don't want to hear you
Falling away nothing to give no
Falling in hate nothing but fear in you heart
Falling away nothing to live for
