Take me down so easy
Somewhere under the falling sky
Turn around to see me
Anywhere you want to be tonight

Stay with me tomorrow
So I know tonight will last
Stay with me tomorrow
So I feel our hearts running fast

Live it on so easy
Don't need anything but us tonight
Break my fall, don't leave me
All I ever want is here tonight

All the silly songs you sing
They keep me holding on
All the crazy love you bring
It keeps me holding on and on and on
