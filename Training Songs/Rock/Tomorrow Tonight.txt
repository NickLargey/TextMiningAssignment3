I was the kid in that picture
Lost in the green grass
Gimme a scene on the silver screen
Buy me a beer or a love supreme
Happy the man in the promise land
Hey Rudy, don't you know

I fell in love and made the payments
I pledged allegiance to a lie
Gimme a page out of history
Stuck in a town called Willoughby
What kind of love are you dreaming of?
Hey Rudy, don't you know

When you find the truth
You won't care about tomorrow
In your Sunday suit, tonight
Well I must confess
Don't care about tomorrow
Tonight

I sold my soul to the Devil
I had it all and got bored
Give me a ride on the old cyclone
Count me in like Dee Dee ramone
Staying alive when you're 25

When you find the truth
You won't care about tomorrow
In your Sunday suit, tonight
Well I must confess
Don't care about tomorrow
Tonight

It happens all the time, just like summertime
It happens all the time, in my state of mind

When you find the truth
You won't care about tomorrow
In your shark skin suit, tonight
Well I must confess
Don't care about tomorrow
Tonight
