I'll try anything once
Cause that's my choice
Ain't got time for jokin'
Getting straight to the point
Drive a hard, hard bargain
You get closer to the bone
If you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
You don't wanna be alone

[Bridge]
I'm in heaven when I'm lovin' you
I'm in heaven tell you what we'll do

[Chorus]
Down in the passion pit
Where everyone gets a hit
Down in the passion pit
Where everything seems to fit

You know the tough get goin'
When the goin' gets tough
I'm looking for some lovin', can't seem to get enough
Too much temptation
It's driven me mad
Well you been good baby
I'll be bad

[Bridge]

[Chorus: x2]

Down in the passion pit
The passion pit
Down in the passion pit
Get a hit, get a hit
