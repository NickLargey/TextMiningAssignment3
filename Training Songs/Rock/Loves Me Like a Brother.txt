She loves me like a brother
When I'm standing by her side
She loves me like a brother
There's nothing that she won't confide.

I been standing by, watching the young thing growing
And quite frankly, I don't like what I see
I could give you lessons on how you should treat her
Cause she means so much to me
She comes to me crying when she gets down and out
Talkin' 'bout something bad you put her through
Not gonna stand for the lies of a man
Gonna wipe away her tears
Through a woman's roughest years.

I been hearin' stories and some nasty rumors
Ã¢??bout the way you've been out tomcat 'n round
Better stay away now from my prize possession
If you plan to cover that much ground
She comes to me crying when she gets down and out
Sayin' what a loser you can be
Not gonna stand for the lies of a man
Gonna wipe away her tears through the woman's roughest years.

Don't you hurt her
I'm not gonna stand for it
Don't you hurt her
It's me that you're dealing with.
She loves me like a brother
When I'm standing by her side
She loves me like a brother
There's nothing that she won't confide.
