Down in the valley you're close to the sun
But we're heading closer as close as can come
So you said you have to put some truth into your words

Down in the valley, inside your mansion
You won't have to speak to express what you feel
But I said you know how it feels but not what to do

It doesn't make sense how you can leave the ground
And enter the sky and stay there too

But no one's gonna come
Tell you how its done 
Tell you how it feels
'Till you come down
It doesn't work by itself
How come? 

Down in the valley a myriad of fools
And sometimes they invite you to do what you do,
And these fools share my opinion that flying is crazy too

Down in the valley a choice has been made
A new reputation, it sleeps in your bed
Like you said it never was better than how it was

I know what you say how things fall apart
Now that they grow I'm talking in the dark

But no one's gonna come
Tell you how its done 
Tell you how it feels
'Till you come down
It doesn't work by itself
How come? 

But no one's gonna come
Tell you how its done 
Tell you how it feels
'Till you come down
It doesn't work by itself
How come? 

You can just call
I will pretend not to care 
You'll pretend all
And I'll pretend you called

But no one's gonna come
Tell you how its done 
Tell you how it feels
'Till you come down
It doesn't work by itself
How come?
