I've been living so fast 
Turned away from you, away from my fast 
I've been feeding on my fears 
Keep me away from here 

I've been running so fast 
Away from love, away from our past 
When I fall into you 
You take what is old and make it new 

You should've killed me for the things I've said 
You should've put me in the ground 
You should've killed me for the things I've done 
Shoot me down, way down 
Shoot me down, way down 

Don't know what I was thinkin' 
When I was livin' that way 
And if God hadn't taken me there 
Don't know how I would have answered Him 

All this life we lead 
Has caused the blood you bleed 
All the sins of man 
The sins drove the nail 
Drove the nail right through you hands
