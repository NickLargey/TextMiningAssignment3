Armadillo skin and the leafy green
Our minds are where we keep her
The ideals born of the western world
Were always buried deeper

When at the end of the working day
We imitate the mountains
Riding high on a wanderlust
To question what we came for

You know, we're living for your love
You know, we're living for you
Come out of the dark elusive one
Hear your subjects who call you

You know, we're living for your love
You know, we're living for you
Come out of the dark, be sure of this
Nirvana we adore you

Burned and dry our sights are high
Forever young with wonder
With our bare hands, built an empire there
To sacrifice and plunder

You know, we're living for your love
You know, we're living for you
Come out of the dark elusive one
Hear your subjects who call you

You know, we're living for your love
You know, we're living for you
Come out of the dark, be sure of this
Nirvana we adore you
