Sometimes it goes
But never goes away
And when it comes
To nothing I can say
Seems like forever
Forever I will wait
Sometimes it goes
But it never goes away

Who, who and when it comes
The arms of sympathy
Oh, oh
Arms of sympathy

I just wanted you to know
It's OK now
Oh, oh

Sometimes it comes
Now heat up like the sun
I sit and wait
Waits for me to run
Seems like forever
Forever I will wait

Who, who and when it comes
The words like symphonies
Oh, oh
Words like symphonies

And I just wanted you to know
It's OK now
And I just wanted you to know
It's OK now
I just wanted you to know
It's OK now
I just wanted you to know
It's OK now
Oh, oh

Sometimes it goes
But never goes away
Sometimes it goes
But never goes away

Oh, who and when it comes
The words like symphonies
Oh, oh

And I just wanted you to know
It's OK now
I just wanted you to know
It's OK now
And I just wanted you to know
It's OK now
I just wanted you to know
It's OK now
Oh, oh

Ooh, oh

Oh, oh
