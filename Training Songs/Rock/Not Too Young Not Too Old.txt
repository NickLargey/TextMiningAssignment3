Not Too Young, Not Too Old
I not too young and I not too old
Listen up everybody
This ain't Aaron party
Part two, I'm older now
Come and show me body
Girl, whatcha gonna do
Come and talk to me in the backseat
Baby backstreet

We could surf the board
Surf the net, better yet
We could make a little bet
If we get together, yo, it gonna be da bomb
Hit me all baby, Aaron Carter dot com
See when it comes to girls

I not too young
Baby face back up on the seat
But when I get in trouble
Hey, I not so old
I put my cap way down
And say I thirteen-years-old
That how we roll
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I not too young, and I not too old
Here we go

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I not too young, I not too old
It A to the A to the are O N
I'm all growing up now
Running to your friend
It's all sewn up now
Where do I begin?
Don even playa hate
Trying to say I look ten
I'm not telling you again
I all up in da video
Catch me in the studio
That my life bro. It in my blood

Hey, it ain't my fault
You want to step to me
We can take it to the asphalt
Shoot some hoops can
Slam dunk the funk
Battle on the roller blades
You're calling me a punk
Bring on the skateboards
Or the BMX. Show me what you got

Is that all? Please, next
I'll wipe the floor with you
Where the concentration
Don even talk about the Sony PlayStation
I make it happen if it seems that you won
Aaron Carter got you open
Don't front, don't front
Let's roll
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I not too young, and I not too old
Here we go

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I not too young, I not too old
He steppin' out with the older boys
Cover up your ears 'cause we makin that noise
He steppin' out with the younger girls
Cover up your eyes 'cause we rock the world
He steppin' out with the older boys
Cover up your ears 'cause we makin that noise
He steppin out with the younger girls
Cover up your eyes 'cause we rock the world

See, when it comes to pickin'
All the girls were cruisin'
Am i right?

All I need is hello, hello.
I'm not too young, I'm not too young.
Switch it off, yo
Hit me on the pager
A real teenager, with a fake beard
Batting in the majors
That how we roll
And when it suits me
I'm between 12 and 18-years-old
Here we go

Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I not too young, and I not too old
Here we go
Here we go
Here we go
