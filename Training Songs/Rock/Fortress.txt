It's bitter
Tastes a lot like winter
And will it- release me 

So heavy
How much more to bring down the levy
And kill me - don't kill me 

[Chorus ]

I've been stayin' high...
And I've been feelin' sorry 
For myself
And I've been resurrecting my
Fortress to protect myself 

Shattered 
Tired, beaten, worn down and tattered
Can you-even hear hear me?
What do you expect out of me
I'm being buried alive and screaming 
Can't you see - Can't you see me ? 

[Chorus] 

Weary
My hands slapped I'm cautious and leary
Of tryin' - oh but I'm tryin' 

How am I to figure it out
All alone I've been kickin' around
Without my home - I'm so lost... 

[Chorus]
