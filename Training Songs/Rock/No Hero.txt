No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
Oh, I'm no hero

Don't pretend to be surprised
'Cause you can see through my disguise
Don't you know I wish that I could be a better lover?
I've got everything I need

Don't you wish that you could let me see a thing or two?
But I'd just rather watch you bleed
It's true, so what will you do?

No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
Oh, I'm no hero

No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
Oh, I'm no hero

Don't expect to be amused
Because I am only to abuse you
Don't I wish that I could ever see a better lover?
You've got everything you need

Don't I wish that I could let you see a thing or two?
But you'd just rather watch me bleed
It's true, so what will I do?

No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
Oh, I'm no hero

No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
Oh, I'm no hero

No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
Oh, I'm no hero

No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
Oh, I'm no hero

No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
No hero, no hero
Oh, I'm no hero
