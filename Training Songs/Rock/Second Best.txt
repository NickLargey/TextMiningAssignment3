Coming over to your house I see you waiting
Turning over all the things I used to treasure
Falling into something new and undetermined
Not to worry, second best is not the end of life

Burning bridges, empty words but not forgotten
Empty fridges, dusty rooms and burning ashtrays
Failing for you, taking every chance to prove it
Got to worry see the things I cherish start to slip

I don't know what you want me to be
'cause you push me around till I can't even breathe
I don't know what you are doing to me
You have turned me into something ugly and cheap

Indecision, tender words with hidden meanings
Try to listen, tolling bells is all I'm hearing
Count the hours till they fade and all's forgotten
In the passion nothing seemed to matter at the time
