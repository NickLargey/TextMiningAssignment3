Impatiently I wait to refill my prescription
And count the tock 
of the drugstore clock
A prototype they say to combat my affliction
Extra gravity 
to control me
But thatâ€™s my fun 
and I like fun

And so do you
As we float away
So do you
As we float away

My excellence at parkour
Is not to be discounted
As I leap away 
and disappear
My excellence at parkour 
might be unexpected
At the age of 58 
it comes as quite a surprise

But not to you
We float away
Not to you
As we float away
