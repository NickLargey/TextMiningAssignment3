I thought I saw you.
Out on the avenue.
But I guess, it was just someone
Who looked a lot like I remeber you do.
'Cause, I thought I heard your voice.
In a bar, making a choice.
But, no. It was just someone
Who sounded a lot like I remeber you do.

'Cause that's impossibe, that's im...
That's impossibe, that's imposs...
That's impossibe, that's impossible.

'Cause you're in New York, but I'm not.
You're in Tokyo, but I'm not.
You're in Nova Scotia, but I'm not.
Yeah, you're Everywhere That I'm Not
Yeah, you're Everywhere That I'm Not
I'm Not, I'm Not, I'm Not.

I thought I felt your touch.
In my car on my clutch.
But I guess, it was just someone
Who felt a lot like I remeber you do.

'Cause that's impossibe, that's im...
That's impossibe, that's imposs...
That's impossibe, that's impossible.

'Cause you're in New York, but I'm not.
You're in Tokyo, but I'm not.
You're in Nova Scotia, but I'm not.
Yeah, you're Everywhere That I'm Not
Yeah, you're Everywhere That I'm Not
Yeah, you're Everywhere That I'm Not
I'm Not, I'm Not, I'm Not.

(Instrumental Break)

I thought I saw you.
Out on the avenue.
But I guess, it was just someone
Who looked a lot like I remeber you do.
I thought I felt your touch.
In my car, bu no such luck.
No. I guess, it was just someone
Who felt a lot like I remeber you do.

'Cause that's impossibe, that's im...
That's impossibe, that's imposs...
That's impossibe, that's impossible.

'Cause you're in New York, but I'm not.
You're in Tokyo, but I'm not.
You're in Nova Scotia, but I'm not.
Yeah, you're Everywhere That I'm Not
Yeah, you're Everywhere That I'm Not
Yeah, you're Everywhere That I'm Not
Yeah, you're Everywhere That I'm Not
(Oh, Come On!)

(Oh, Yeah, Yeah!)

You're Everywhere That I'm Not
You're Everywhere That I'm Not
You're Everywhere That I'm Not
Yeah, you're Everywhere That I'm Not
