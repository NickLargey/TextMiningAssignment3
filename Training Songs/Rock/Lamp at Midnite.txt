You take my heart like a bow and arrow
And shoot it at me I know
I walk the tight rope when it's narrow
To earn my degree I know

Now I'm the last boy at the playground
Who's laughin' at me - I know, I know, I know
And through the corridor I follow you
And the chaos trips my mind

Now I write you short stories
Just to say we're gonna love each other all the way
Well I know you're not the talkin' kind
And if you really want to know me

(Oh, you know)
Burn a lamp at midnite
Said I really want to know you
(Oh, you know)

Burn a lamp at midnite
In a red school house where I see you
In the morning light - I know
Send me sailin' to pick you flowers

From the isle of white - You know, you know, you know
Take my eyes to the pages
Where I draw pictures of your name
Now I speak in dialects

Just to say
(We're gonna love each other all the way)
You're not the kind of girl that plays the game
And if you really want to know me

(Oh, you know)
Burn a lamp at midnite
Said I really want to know you
(Oh, you know)

Burn a lamp at midnite
And to really understand me
(Oh, you know)
Burn a lamp at midnite, night, night, night

And through the corridor I follow you
And the chaos trips my mind
Now I write you short stories
Just to say

(We're gonna love each other all the way)
But I know you're not the talkin' kind, kind
And if you really want to know me
(Oh, you know)

Burn a lamp at midnite
Said I really want to know you
(Oh, you know)
Burn a lamp at midnite

And to really understand me, oh you know
Burn a lamp at midnite
I said I really want to know you, oh you know
Burn a lamp at midnite yeah
