Goin' to California
Suitcase in my hands
Never run away a boy
When you can walk away a man

Pride it comes to find you
In your hopes and in your dreams
Like a thief who tells his lover
He's got one last thing.

'Cause I can see the shadows
At the foot of my door
I can see the faces
That don't doubt us anymore
I can see it coming
I pray I don't go blind
In the middle of our reckoning time

Easy is a refuge
And it's an easy place to be
But when the sun shines on you
What will the whole world think

'Cause I can see the shadows
At the foot of my door
I can see the faces
That don't doubt us anymore
I can see it coming
I pray I don't go blind
In the middle of our reckoning time

Whoa
Whoa
In the middle of our reckoning time

The nature of the broken
Spirit of the chosen
We stand alone
A journey through the purpose
The weight of when it's worthless
The roads don't show
In the middle of our reckoning time

Goin' to California
Suitcase in my hands
Never run away a boy
When you can walk away a man
