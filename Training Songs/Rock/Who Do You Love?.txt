Driving off in the rain and snow
Oh the jets ain't jumping 'cause the clouds too low
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
The ice on the window the highway the sea
Who do you love is it him or is it me
Hey, hey I want to know

I called Detroit city on the telephone
The man on the line tell me you ain`t home
I want to know
Who's that voice
What's it say
There's a deep red glow in the early morning sky
Who do you love better make up your mind

Don't want to buy love
Don't want to try love
I just want your love babe

Hey alright!
Well it's five in the morning and the place is dead
I'm gonna rest my body on a empty bed
Who do you love
I gotta know
What's his name baby
What's your game
Make up your mind are you his are you mine
When you get back I ask you one more time
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
