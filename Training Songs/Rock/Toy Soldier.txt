Toy soldier, poor boy

(1,2: Doesn't know he'll wind up like a broken toy]
	
[3:   Gonna come home to be broken like a toy]	  

[1,2: A  3: F, to coda]	

(Broken toy, huh! like a broken toy)

Verse 1:	
A lonely soldier needs his girl
But he's halfway 'round the world
If he knew the truth he'd hurt
'Cause his girl's become a flirt
'Round the town they say  toy

[repeat chorus]

Verse 2:	Oh how he dreams of his return
And the coming home he earned
All his dreamin' was a waste	
There's a new face in his place	
She ain't waiting for you
