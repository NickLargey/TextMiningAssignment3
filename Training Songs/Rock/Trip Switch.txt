Sharing secrets with another world
Rubbing shoulders with some unknown lovers
Making waves through the universe
Starting wars with anonymous brothers
Trip switch, trip switch
Make a wish and I'll count to three
Press the button and we'll both be happy
Sending signals is a dirty trick
I get my love in a digital packet
Trip switch, trip switch

What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go down?
What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go?
Down, down, down, down, down, when the lights go
Down, down, down, down, down, lights go

Gimme data 'cause I need a hit
How I love stratospheric numbers
Information, I've been craving it
Gimme yours then gimme all the others
Trip switch, trip switch

What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go down?
What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go?
Down, down, down, down, down, when the lights go
Down, down, down, down, down, the lights go

They put out the lights, they put out the lights
They put out the lights

What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go down?
What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go?
Down, down, down, down, down, lights go

What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go?
What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go?
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, when the lights go down
