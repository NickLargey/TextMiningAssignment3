One-two-three-four, one-two-three-four!

Hey girl I'm calling all stations
Blowing down the wire tonight
I'm singing through these power lines and I'm running on time and feeling alright
Skipping over the currents in the air
Reaching to see if you're out there
Coming 'cross your radio station, calling out nation to nation
If you can hear me then say alright
And if you can, meet me in the city tonight

I was busted for feeling no pain
Charged with doing things I can't explain
Picked up for parole violation, locked with the boys in the subway station
Handcuffed on the killing floor
Transmitting from behind these jailhouse doors
And if you're sick, if you're tired, if you're broken
Check the line, check the time, check the action, check the score
Come and get me if I ain't right
But if I am, meet me in the city tonight

Everybody's lost in romance
Do you feel the way I feel, oh
I'm just searching, girl
For the blood, for the bone, for the muscle, for what's real

I was busted for feeling no pain
Charged with doing things I can't explain
Picked up for parole violation, locked with the boys in the subway station
I pushed my way through the hardened crowd
I shoved my way through the hardened crowd
Past the sign saying "this is not allowed"
To where someone standing straight is shouting out loud

Handcuffed to the jailhouse door
Transmitting from the gallows' floor
And if you're sick, if you're tired, if you're broken
Check the line, check the time, check the action, check the score
If you can holler then say alright
If you can holler then say alright
If you can holler then say alright
If you can holler then say alright
If you can holler then say alright, and if you can

Meet me in the city tonight
Meet me in the city tonight
Meet me in the city tonight

In the city, meet me in the city tonight
In the city, meet me in the city tonight
In the city, meet me in the city tonight
In the city, meet me in the city tonight
