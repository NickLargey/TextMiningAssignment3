Driving far from home.
On a midnight radio.
Reckless and alone.
On a long black road.
The city is burning like a dream. 
Like a lady smoking in 
The night.
And she lets out a silent scream. 
So far from the
Morning light. 

And I don't know where to go.
And I don't know where I've been.
And I don't know If I'll still be here. 
When the sun rises again.
But somewhere in the distance. 
There's a tower and a light.
Broadcasting a resistance. 
Through the rain and through
The night.
Hold me in the darkness.
Love is playing in the darkness.
On a midnight radio. 

So grab your little sister.
Wake up your children and your wife.
Cause a new train's coming mister.
Around the boarders of the night.
Wavelengths of love are playing on a midnight radio.
Through the static and the rain.
On a midnight radio
