The full moon is rising over dark water
And the fools below are picking up sticks
And the man in the gallows lies permanently waiting
For the doctors to come back and tend to him,

The Flat Earth Society is meeting here today, singing happy little lies,
And the bright ship Humana is sent far away with grave determination...
And no destination,

Lie lie lie
Lie lie lie
Lie lie lie
Lie lie lie
Lie lie lie
Lie lie lie

Yeah, nothing feels better than a spray of clean water
And the whistling of wind on a calm summer night
But you better believe that down in their quarters
The men are holding on for their dear lives,

The Flat Earth Society is somewhere far away,
with their candlesticks and compasses
And the bright ship Humana is on its way with grave determination
And no destination,

The Flat Earth Society is meeting here today, singing happy little lies,
And the bright ship Humana is well on its way with grave determination
And no destination,

Lie lie lie
Lie lie lie
Lie lie lie
