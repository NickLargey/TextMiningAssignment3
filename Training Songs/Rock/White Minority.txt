We're gonna be a white minority 
We won't listen to the majority 
We're gonna feel inferiority 
We're gonna be white minority 

White pride 
You're an American 
I'm gonna hide 
Anywhere I can 

Gonna be a white minority 
We don't believe there's a possibility 
Well you just wait and see 
We're gonna be white minority 

White pride 
You're an American 
White pride 
Anywhere I can? 

Gonna be a white minority 
There's gonna be large cavity 
Within my new territory 
We're all gonna die
