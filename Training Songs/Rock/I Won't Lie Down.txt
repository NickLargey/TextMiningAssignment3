does anybody see him? 
another set up for the fall 
does anybody hear him? 
he's screaming at the same blank wall 

everyone can't be right 
but everyone will decide 

i'm not afraid of the price i pay 
i won't lie down as you walk away 

i know you must have seen him 
i'm sure you must have heard it all 
i know you used to be him 
did anybody care at all?
