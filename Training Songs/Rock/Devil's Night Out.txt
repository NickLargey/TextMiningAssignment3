Remember that night? It seems so clear
Now he's back and I'm glad he's here
Three long years, millions of beers
But the devil is back, so girls, dry your tears
In his favorite club, in his favorite seat
Well I saw the Devil, wing tip shoes on his feet,
Pork pie hat on his head, he was diggin' the beat.
And the band ripped like demons
When he screamed, "Turn On The Heat!"
Well the Devil was drinkin' and dancin' up a storm.
The band was so hot, my beer got warm
Just when I thought it would all cool down,
That evil motherfucker screamed "Burn this place down!"
Wouldn't know the devil if he punched them in the face
Couldn't drink a six-pack, never mind a case.
Don't know how to skateboard, that's just a fuckin' crock
Most of all, they got no balls
And don't know how to rock!
