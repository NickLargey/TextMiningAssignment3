What they promised
Will now comes true
Don't tell me girl
You should've knew

Plastic gangsters and two bit hoods
Heading for the ninties in their kid gloves
Rolly, rolly
Heading for the prize of the king clown

They say that money's
The root of all crime
But I know people
Who just love the big time

Hearts & Minds
Hearts & Minds
Hearts & Minds
You can't have our Hearts & Minds

Tomorrow is girl
Another day
Come with me and
Forget today

Hearts & Minds
Hearts & Minds
Hearts & Minds
You can't have our Hearts & Minds

Little by little, little by little
Little by little, little by little

Hearts & Minds
Hearts & Minds
Hearts & Minds
You can't have our Hearts & Minds
