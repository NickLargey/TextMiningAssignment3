Standing in line at the grocery
Staring back at the trash magazines
Martians say earth girls are lonely
Well that's no news to me

In the parking lot I saw two cowboys
Fighting for a handicapped space
So what is a girl to do now boys
To make sense of this place

There's too much wrong in the world tonight
Too much I can't understand
I wanna board up these windows and turn out these lights
And lie down with an innocent man, oh lie down with an innocent man

I don't need a strong man's protection
No I don't want a faithless man's love
Just a little respect and affection
Would be more than enough

'Cause I've been shot down by love's aimless arrows
And I've shot a few wild ones myself
But these days the choices are narrow
And you've got to aim well

There's too much wrong in the world tonight
Too much I can't understand
I wanna board up these windows and turn out these lights
And lie down with an innocent man, oh lie down with an innocent man

I've been holding my heart like a lantern
Looking out for just one honest face
All the noise out there won't matter
If I can trust in just one quiet place

There's too much wrong in the world tonight
Too much I can't understand
I wanna board up these windows and turn out these lights
And lie down with an innocent man

Yeah there's too much wrong in the world tonight
Too much I can't understand
I wanna board up these windows and turn out these lights
Lie down with an innocent man, oh lie down with an innocent man
Lie down with an innocent man
