I don't know what you think your tryin' to do
there ain't no loop hole that you ain't crawled thru
your cookin' the books your throwin' the game
I oughta call it all because of rain
I keep on keepin' on tryin' to make it work
but I got to tell ya your hittin' where it hurts

I'm fightin' feelin's I ain't never felt
its like your lettin' fly below the belt
I'm in a pinch...I'm feelin' a crunch
You blindside with your sucker punch
let me make my point before I meander
whats good for the goose is good for the gander

your hittin' where it hurts
your hittin' where it hurts
your doin' dirty work
its a real shakey deal
your hittin' where it hurts

they say a whistlin' girl and a crowin' hen
always come to the same sad end
your hands look scabbed your dress is a mess
you got lies in your eyes champagne on your breath
you got a wild streak so dang hot
light a cigarette if you hit the right spot

your hittin' where it hurts
your hittin' where it hurts
your doin' dirty work
its a real shakey deal
your hittin' where it hurts

your hittin' where it hurts
your hittin' where it hurts
your doin' dirty work
its a real shakey deal

(hittin' where it hurts) ya hit me
aww ya hit me where it hurts
ya doin' dirty work
now its a real shakey deal
ya hittin' where it hurts 

hey!
