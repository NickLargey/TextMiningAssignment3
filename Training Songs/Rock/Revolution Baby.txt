Hey! Hey!
AB-boy blue, he's the King of the Groove
He got booster charged, Electra-Glide, high healed shoes
And he moves, and he grooves, yeah he grooves

Now Xuxu's a Queen, she's a Queen Bee babe
She's all fired up and ready to rave
And she knows, how to go, and she go go's

She goes I'm so bored of this institution
I need something to set me loose and
Music's gonna be my revolution baby
Revolution, revolution, you could be my revolution baby

Well I seen you out honey, burnin' the streets
A big black turbo, hey! that ain't no jeep
That machine, what a dream, oh man it's so mean

Say I've had enough of burnt out reunions
I need something to set me loose and
I want you to be my revolution baby
Revolution, revolution, you could be my revolution baby

My revolution, babe
My revolution, babe oh yeah!

Hey! You know we got an 'A' Bomb Star v the USSR
Got us all wrapped up and ready to blow and you know
When it blows, oh man it's really gonna blow

Say I'm so tired of all this confusion
Everyone talking like there's no solution
When a change of heart could be the revolution baby
Revolution, revolution, you could be my revolution baby

Yeah yeah yeah
Your mama's rich and your daddy's good looking
I got the hunger so tell me what's cooking
I got the time man, if you gat a dime man
Don't waste your time man, that's a Capital crime man
I got the will, if you got the thrill
And I'll sell you my trash if you pay me cash
The man's got the stash, but we got the hash...
Hey! what you got in that bag? I don't believe you...
Well the boys want the boys and girls want the girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Geogie's buying coke, and Michael's selling cola
Don't leave the bag out or you'll get turned over
Twenty empty houses and they put you on the waiting list
Twenty years of day school and they put you on the night shift
But you got yours and I got mine
You know we're doing OK, yeah we're doing fine
Lucy's in the Sky, she got tears in her eyes
'cause we're all on the same side when the mushroom hits the sky
Just open your heart babe and you can start the revolution

Right now, revolution
Just start the revolution
Right now, come on
Just start the revolution
You know that you could be that
Revolution baby
Why'know, why'know, why'know that you could
Be that revolution baby
Just start the revolution
Right now, come on
And start the revolution
