So wide awake keep your secrets
So many ways to keep you here
So misinformed that I don't know
The many ways that I have to learn

Just so I'm right I devastated you
And just so you'll see that I suffer I do
Call it a night well okay but I will
Call me tomorrow promise you will

So wide awake keep your secrets
So many ways to keep you here
So misinformed that I don't know
The many ways that I have to learn

I just shot myself in the foot again
And I got myself in this dilemma that I'm in
And I'd hate to ask are you over me yet
Cause I'd hate to see what I'd be without you

So wide awake keep your secrets
So many ways to keep you here
So misinformed that I don't know
The many ways that I have to learn

I want to be better so much better
I want to be better so much better I
I want to motherfuck myself

So wide awake keep your secrets
So many ways to keep you here
I'm so misinformed that I don't know
The many ways that I have to learn

The many ways that I have to learn
The many ways that I have to learn
So many ways
So many ways
