I was stuck on a pin and we were equally nervous
I could not get through
So where is the chain that will keep us together
This much is true
My love is real
Until it stops

Don't you wanna go down
Like old mayakovsky
In a sea of blue
And if I was the king
She's the knife in the water
There's so much to loose
When my love is real
Until it stops

So throw up your hands for south california
And not a lot to loose
I would not sleep until I tried every way
To bring your little black heart back
Love is real
Until it stops
