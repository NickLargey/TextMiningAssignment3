The fields are near and I won't trust the air with secrets
I can't stop holding this treasure in my arms
For all the water in the ocean could never turn
This swan's legs from black to white

Let them say, let them say
Let them say what they please

You won't be leaving my arms ever, I promise you that
Even if you want me to let go, honey
Even if you want me to let go

You won't be leaving my arms ever, I promise you that
Even if you want me to let go, honey
Even if you say the things that make me want to lose you

We went on drinking, celebrating something
I looked at you and said that I'm forever yours
You looked at me and said, oh, the idea of being in love
The idea, the idea of being forever yours

You won't be leaving my arms ever, I promise you that
Even if you want me to let go, honey
Even if you want me to let go

You won't be leaving my arms ever, I promise you that
Even if you want me to let go, honey
Even if you say the things that make me want to lose you

Screaming from the inside of me, a lonely and pleading phantasm
We only get what we see, gazing so desperately
Between the things that we fear, gazing so desperately
Elaborate delusions, we're watching segregating illusions

Between the things that we see, and the things that we fear
No, no, it won't make them disappear

You won't be leaving my arms ever, I promise you that
Even if you want me to let go, honey
Even if you want me to let go

You won't be leaving my arms ever, I promise you that
Even if you want me to let go, honey
Even if you say the things that make me want to lose you

Even if you want me to let go, honey
Even if you want me to let go, honey
Even if you want me to let go, honey
Even if you want me to let go, honey
