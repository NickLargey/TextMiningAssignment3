Hey hey hey if you're ready to rage
Raise your hands up, this what rock and roll looks like
Yeah yeah yeah, wearing leather and lace
Raise your hands up, this what rock and roll looks like

Umm, microphone check one, two
Yeah, yeah, it's Porcelain baby
And this is what Rock n Roll looks like

The dark days falling down on my stand
I feel the thirst to get it in
Trouble, trouble, drink it down
Like a king, I take the crown
Flush away the pain til my expense
'Cause we're the kids that belong to the night
We gonna get this, we gonna start a fight

Lipstick smeared across my face
Not a drop will go to waste
Baby the beast is yours to chase
'Cause we're the kids that belong to the night

Come be my soccer ball and get yo ass kicked
I like my pizza cold, I like my glass full
I don't like bullshit, but I like red bull
I smell like Guns and Roses
I look like money, bitch
I taste like Rock n Roll
I make her lick her lips
And all the drama's dead
I'm in the past life
I forgot her name but I remember last night
You can do what you do
I done did enough
I'm on that gangsta shit
I don't give a f-ck
Weezy
