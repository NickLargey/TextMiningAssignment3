I was walking, thinking if I had a girl
I could wear some dark sunglasses to sheild me from the modern world
So I caught another foreign movie, filmed in my hometown 
Drank a lot of coffee and smoked a couple cigarettes and hopped on the inbound

She works downtown (You wanna go)
My knees won't leave the ground (You wanna go)
But I dig her style
Only had to dial
617-SMILE
For a wild life

Weak for weeks I lost my knees and quit the town
Staining sheets and pulling weeds, I'm loosing ground
So I bought another rocking record
Put it down just for sound
Smoked a lot of coffee and drank a couple cigarettes and hopped on the inbound

She works downtown (You wanna go)
And my knees don't mind the ground (You wanna go)
It's a creepy kind of style
But it's easy for awhile
Just look before you smile
On a wild life
