Can I act like an angel 
If I live like a jerk 
Can I keep on disguising 
Can I make believe 
That I don't deceive 
No, no, no 

Send the wild women out the backdoor 
My wife is knocking at the frontdoor 
They made me a winner they made me a sinner 
I don't know what to do 
Dirty money in my left hand 
While the preacher's shaking my right hand 
They made me a winner they made me a sinner 
I don't know what to do 

When I'm riding on top of 
The wave of success 
Will I lose my devotion 
Will I fail to see 
What I used to be 
Oh, oh, oh 

Send the wild women out the backdoor 
My wife is knocking at the frontdoor 
They made me a winner they made me a sinner 
I don't know what to do 
Dirty money in my left hand 
While the preacher's shaking my right hand 
They made me a winner they made me a sinner 
I don't know what to do  

I'll have to carry on 
As two persons in one
