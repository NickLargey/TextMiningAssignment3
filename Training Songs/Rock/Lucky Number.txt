Feel's like a heist when you wake me up
Some clothes are thrown then I'm pushed down a corridor
On front door step for a last time

I don't look back as we tearaway
The scene is set for another day
We will go past your marker then go darker

Oh I got myself a lucky number
Oh myself, my sisters and my brothers

What happened next he would never say
The tables turned and he did escape
He went south into Spain and lived his days there

But when news came that he passed away
You could not find him in his grave
He had gone into dark night, endless walking

Oh I got myself a lucky number
Oh myself, my sisters and my brothers

I think if you look that is seems though the man has escaped
He has got away and he wont come back for many year
I think if you check that it seems that you made a mistake
He has got away and he wont come back for long long year

Oh I got myself a lucky number
Oh myself, my sisters and my brothers
Oh I got myself that lucky number
Oh myself, my sisters and my brothers
