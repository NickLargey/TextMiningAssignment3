I live for the minute
I live for a day
Doin' my thing
And you're doin' your own yeah
Do what I want to yeah
Do what you want to
Keep your advice
I'm wishing you well
Your Beverly Hills
But I vacation in Hell oh yeah
Do what I want to yeah
Do what you want to
Your way isn't my way
My word's not what you'd say 

Do your own thing
Your own thing
Do your own
Do your own thing (Repeat 3x)
Do it!

Play the guitar
A gypsy at heart
You synchronize your
Walks in the park oh yeah

Do what I want to yeah
Do what you want to

I'm Jack & Coke and candy bars
You're champagne and caviar
Oh yeah
[REPEAT CHORUS]

[SOLO]

Your way isn't my way
My word's not what you'd say
My way isn't your way
Your word's not what I'd say
[REPEAT CHORUS (3x )]
