There are some things a guy gets from his pop
Some of these things get spaced, others are never forgot
Believe in such a tradition, I got in my truck cab

Ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh
Piss bottle man

Same as first, lyrics are:
Miles and miles all the while I feel secure
Even when a fuse gets short I can keep my nerve
Believe in such a tradition I got in my truck cab

Ooh ooh ooh
Piss bottle man

Short Riff
Piss bottle man
Short Riff
Piss bottle man

Ooh ooh ooh
Piss bottle man

Driving in his shoes, using the bottle he used
Every time I pop I think of my pop and pay my dues
Respect such a tradition, I got in my truck cab.

Ooh ooh ooh
Piss bottle man

Ooh ooh ooh
Piss bottle man
