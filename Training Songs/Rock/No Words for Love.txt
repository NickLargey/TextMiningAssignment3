I've been tryin' to tell you, baby
Just how good life could be
If I just had you by my side for eternity

But you're always goin' somewhere
You've got something on your mind
I know, I know, I can make the time

But it's gotta be right, it's gotta be at night
When we're all alone and I'm holding you tight
And I'm lookin' in your eyes with the stars out, up above
I know, I've tried but there's no

No words for love, not my lovin'
No words for love, no, not my love
When I'm lookin' in your eyes
With the stars out, up above
I swear, I tried, but there's no

Now there you are, baby, in your Disney little world
When I look at you, I see a tired little girl
Tired of waitin', tired of waitin' for a chance
A chance to let go and find some real romance

But it's gotta be right, it's gotta be at night
When we're all alone and I'm holding you tight
I look into your eyes with the stars out, up above
I swear, I've tried but there's no

No words for love
Not my love baby, not my love, baby
No words for love
All my love, baby, all my love, baby

No words for love
Not my love, baby, not my love, baby
Not my love babe
No, no, no, no, no, not my love

No words for love
For my love, for my love, for my love
No words for love
For my love, baby, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, baby, no, no, no, baby
