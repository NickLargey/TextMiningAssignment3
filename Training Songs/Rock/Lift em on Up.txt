Lately I been wastin' this hard, hard life
Seems like nothin' ever turns out right
The day's too short, the nights too long
Meet you in the middle if it turns out wrong

Johnny got a job but it ain't no good
Nickels and dimes you know he never could
Seem to make it clean, I'm tellin' you
When the devil got your soul
There ain't much you can do

Now he prays for a light in the dark
To lift 'em on up (lift 'em on up)
An' he swears with his hand on his heart
To lift 'em on up (lift 'em on up)
You can tear the night down
And turn it inside out

Johnny looks around but all he sees
Is a tired old city livin' on its knees
Blue jean faces, fadin' fast
Backs are breaking but the hard times last

Now he prays for a light in the dark
To lift 'em on up (lift 'em on up)
An' he swears with his hand on his heart
To lift 'em on up (lift 'em on up)
You can tear the night down
And turn it inside out
You can tear the night down

Yesterdays....johnny (johnny, johnny)
Johnny and me used to have a dream
If ya ran real fast, it'd set you free
So we kept on running, but our legs got tired
And the dream just kinda faded when the spirit died - hey

To lift 'em on up, lift 'em on up
Now he prays for a light in the dark
To lift 'em on up (lift 'em on up)
An' he swears with his hand on his heart
To lift 'em on up (lift 'em on up)
You can tear the night down, you can tear the night down
You can tear the night down and turn it inside out

To lift 'em on up, lift 'em on up, lift 'em on up, lift 'em on up
