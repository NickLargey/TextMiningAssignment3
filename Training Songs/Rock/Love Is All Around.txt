Who can turn the world on with her smile
Who can take a nothing day
And suddenly make it all seem worthwhile
Well it's you girl and you should know it
With each glance and every little movement you show it
Love is all around no need to waste it
You can have the town why don't you take it
You're gonna make it after all
