My name is Casanova
I'm basically a man
I have the head of a wolf
The appetite of an entire land
This song is going out to the girls
You're all looking fucking fine
Baby spread those shaking legs
Because I'm feeling fucking hungry tonight
I like to feed on broken hearts
There ain't no taste like lovers falling apart

If I offer to buy you a drink
Trust me when I say it's non-alcoholic
You're no good to me if you can't even speak
I don't want you passing out I want you sucking my dick
If I offer to buy you a drink
Trust me when I say it's non-alcoholic
I want you to wake up and remember my name
When you're washing my cum off your fucking face

My name is Casanova
I'm basically a man
I have the head of a wolf
The appetite of an entire land
This song is going out to the girls
You're all looking well buff
I'm sick of all this long term shit
I just wanna f*ck

My name is Casanova
I'm nothing but a beast
Baby the way you're shaking those hips
Has got me ready for a fucking feast
This song is going out to the girls
I want to feel your body close against mine
Why waste time with conversation
When we can f*ck for the rest of our lives

The hardest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return
