I'm closing up, I'm closing in
Couldn't wait for this moment to come
Couldn't wait for this day to begin
Won't be afraid, got so much pride
And I've never been a loser
And I just can't lose tonight

[Chorus]
Winning it all, ain't gonna walk away
Giving it all, no matter what you say
Ain't gonna fall, don't want to lose today
Winning it all

This time it's right, my time has come
Gonna give everything that I've got
Till it's over and victory's won
No second chance, no giving up
Because no one remembers a loser
And I don't intend to be one
