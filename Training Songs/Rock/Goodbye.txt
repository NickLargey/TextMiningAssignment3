("Goodbye, Fat Man!")

Goodbye you can go
I don't want you no more
Goodbye you can go
I don't want you no more
You don't mean me no good
So it's best for me that you go
You gonna need me
You gonna need me some more any day
You gonna need me
You gonna need me some more any day
Yes I'll be gone
I'll be gone far away

I ain't gonna cry
Cryin' ain't goin' bring you back
I ain't gonna cry
Cryin' ain't goin' bring you back
Yes I really love you Baby
But ain't gonna be no days like that
