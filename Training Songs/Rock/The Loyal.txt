High strung and poorly hung 
I think we're much too young 
I hear a sound from your left lung 
A melody so beautifuly sung sarkasm 
Spread your wings oh what sweet joy it brings 
'Come home' the whole town sings 
They will greet us like kings to everyone's delight 
We crash at the speed of light so deep 
In the whitest white this could have been our burial site 
Well ok, I am here for the loyalist 
I wanna see its face and ok, 
I am here for the loyalist 
This is the nesting place
