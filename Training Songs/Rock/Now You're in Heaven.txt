Well you could be happy
Ah happy in my arms
Ah don't look distracted
I'll use my fatal charms
Well you could be happy
But only with me
If you come alive
You can spend your life with me

Well now you're in heaven
Well now you're in heaven

Well you could be lovin'
Ah lovin' in my arms
It's after you're happy
You need my lovin' charms
Well you could be lovin'
But only with me
Just take hold of my hand
It's a trip in ecstasy

[Chorus]
Well now you're in heaven
(Could be happy, could be lovin')
Well now you're in heaven
(You're in heaven, take hold of my hand)
Well now you're in heaven
You're in heaven with me

Well now that you've loved me
Been happy in my arms
You don't look distracted
You lust my subtle charms
Well what do you think now, baby
Do you like it with me
Tell me what you think
Cause I want to know
Yes, I want to know

[Chorus: Repeats]
