Well you can get a hand
There's one to be had
They're all working on the other side of town

Tonight must be the night
Everybody's set their sights
And the lovers jamboree is where they're bound

Well, everybody will find someone
Someone's looking out for me

So I'm shutting up the shop
Let the loving never stop
You can drop me at the lovers jamboree

Let me tell ya

There's something in the air 
That's kicking back despair
What a strange thing, I'm feeling good tonight

The gangs and wrecking crews
Have all declared a truce
As the lovers jamboree begins to [bite]

Well now, everybody's got to get there
And I'll be taking two 'f our friends
Tell the left man be so kind
Not to call if he don't mind
He'll find me at the lovers jamboree

Let me tell ya

Well now, everybody's got to get there
And I'll be taking two 'f our friends

Tell the postman hold my mail
Or redirect it to the jail
Tell the Hebrew and the Greek
To get the God up good and steep
Tell the meek the mild the halt and lame
The sisters of mercy, they're shrouded in flame
The Church and him are sharing the blame
For the lovers jamboree

For the lovers jamboree
The lovers jamboree
