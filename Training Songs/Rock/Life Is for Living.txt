You and me
Our life is drifting along
Watching the world as it's singing it's song.
High above
Someone is calling to me:
Life is for living and living is free.

You to me
Are like the sun in the sky
See how you fly you have wings of your own.
You and me
Our love will last without end

Ride with the wind won't you follow me home.
Turn around and see the circles we spin
And we're taking our chances on where we begin.
Up above
The rain is falling on me

Life is for living and living is free.
You to me
Are like the sun in the sky
See how you fly you have wings of your own
You and me
Our love will last without end
Ride with the wind won't you follow me home.

Taking up time
Trying to write a line till the break of day.
Given a sign
Can you make it rhyme
Tell me what to say.
Making it fine can you ease my mind help me drift away.

Turn around
And see the circles we spin
Taking our chances on where we begin.
Up above
The rain is falling on me
Life is for living and living is free.

You to me
Are like the sun in the sky
