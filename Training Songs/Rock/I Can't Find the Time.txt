I've searched through each moment of each passing hour
But your memory grows stronger I find
Oh they tell me in time I'll forget you but somehow I can't find the time
They tell me in time I'll find another and happiness again will be mine

Oh they tell me in time I'll forget you but somehow I can't find the time
Oh something each moment reminds me of you you're always in up on my mind
Oh they tell me in time I'll forget you but somehow I can't find the time
Oh something each moment...
Oh something each moment...
