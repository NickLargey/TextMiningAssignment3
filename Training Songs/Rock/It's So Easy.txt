All I want to know
Is when you go
Do you think of me
'Cause I could let you go 

But there'd be a hole
Where my heart used to be 
 
It's so easy holding you near 
I could melt in your arms and disappear
Loving you baby is breaking my heart tonight 
It's so easy but it isn't right o I saw you today

You walked away
And I couldn't breathe
'Cause I know how it will feel
It's a love so real
When you're touching me
 
It's so easy holding you near 
I could melt in your arms and disappear
Loving you baby is breaking my heart tonight 
It's so easy but it isn't right o I saw you today
 
Every night I lay here alone
After you leave me and go home
She doesn't know that we can¹t let go
And it¹s hurting me so
 
It's so easy holding you near 
I could melt in your arms and disappear
Loving you baby is breaking my heart tonight 
It's so easy but it isn't right o I saw you today
 
Baby it's so easy
