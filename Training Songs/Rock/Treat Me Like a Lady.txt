I know I look like an open book
But if you took another look
You just might discover
What's under my obvious cover

Well, toy doll
No, I don't want that name
And if I gotta play that game
Then you gotta love her
Think comin', don't walk past, runnin' away

Treat me like a lady
Show me you're proud of me
Love me like your baby
Out in a crowd with me
Treat me like a lady, yeah
Show me or just go before we start

Snap, pop, it's easy as one, two, three
You thought you had it made with me
Forget it, my Romeo
Rover, I'm not a pushover

Oh, hey, you, I'd give and you know I would
And love you like a good girl should
But don't treat me like any other
Ooh, I want my lover

To treat me like a lady
Don't be ashamed of me
Love me like your baby
Stop playing games with me
Treat me like a lady, yeah
Show me or just go before we start

Baby, don't lie to me
Don't even try with me
If you don't love all the way
Say goodbye to me, yeah

Treat, treat, treat me like a lady, lady
Come here and love me, love me like a lady, baby
Treat, treat, treat me like a lady, lady
I wanna love you, love you like a lady, baby
Treat, treat, treat me like a lady, lady
I want you to love me, love me like a lady, baby
Treat, treat, treat me like a lady, lady
