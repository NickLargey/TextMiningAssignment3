Thursday evening six o'clock
I stepped into a world of living all alone 
Just a simple note that read
I cannot explain why this must be but now I've gone
Friday all day long I could tell myself that's what I wanted anyway
But Friday night has left me
Left me coming down with only lonely Saturday
I could take a walk uptown
I could have a drink or two with some old friends of mine
But they'd ask me how she's been
I don't think that I could take it I would die inside
I can live without a lot but living without her has something new to say
Cause Friday night has left me
Left me coming down with only lonely Saturday
Time on my hands hope the lord understands a man shouldn't feel this way
Time and time again wish that clock would spend this lonely Saturday
Time and time again wish that clock would spend this lonely Saturday
