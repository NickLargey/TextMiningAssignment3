Ya know it's your boy I-Y-A-Z and big time rush! (woo! woo!)

If I ruled the world, I'd throw all the money
In the air like confetti
If I ruled the world, every house got a DJ and a backyard party.
And I'd break all the borders down, when I shake the ground

If I ruled the world
I'd dream out loud

So everybody get up, up
Out of your seats
Kick off your shoes, like you're down at the beach
Jump up, up, up
On the beat singing "Aye oh!", "Aye oh!", "Aye oh!"
Up, up, out of your seats
Be who you are love is all you need
All of us geeks, freaks and wannabes singing "Aye oh!"

If I ruled the world, I would give it, give it all to you, give it, give it all to you
If I ruled the world, I would give it, give it all to you, give it, give it all to you

If you were my girl
You'd never have to worry about another thing, no
'Cause I'd rule the world, and you'd be right next to me
Running the show
We'd throw every rule in the book down and
Bring down the house
If you were my girl
We'd dream out loud

So everybody get up, up
Out of your seats
Kick off your shoes, like you're down at the beach
Jump up, up, up
On the beat singing "Aye oh!", "Aye oh!", "Aye oh!"
Up, up, out of your seats
Be who you are love is all you need
All of us geeks, freaks and wannabes singing "Aye oh!"

If I ruled the world, I would give it, give it all to you, give it, give it all to you
If I ruled the world, I would give it, give it all to you, give it, give it all to you

I'd be beatin' on my chest; I'm the king of the hill.
Iyaz and big time rush keepin' it real.
Magic carpets girl, we go wherever,
I ain't tryin' a run game, I ain't tryin' to be clever.
Girl, I'm'ma be the king, and you will be the queen.
Goin' a hundred miles an hour,
Girl, we runnin' the streets.
And if the cops ever try and pull us over,
Tell 'em "Hey, Mister Officer, we own ya!"

So everybody get up, up
Out of your seats
Kick off your shoes, like you're down at the beach
Jump up, up, up
On the beat singing "Aye oh!", "Aye oh!", "Aye oh!"
Up, up, out of your seats
Be who you are love is all you need
All of us geeks, freaks and wannabes singing "Aye oh!"

If I ruled the world, I would give it, give it all to you, give it, give it all to you
If I ruled the world, I would give it, give it all to you, give it, give it all to you
If I ruled the world, I would give it, give it all to you, give it, give it all to you
If I ruled the world, I would give it, give it all to you, give it, give it all to you
If I ruled the world, I would give it, give it all to you, give it, give it all to you

I would give it, give it all to you, give it, give it all to you, if I ruled the world.
