This one is for the girl who says she's unlucky in love 
You deserve to have the world at your feet 
And if one person, one man could be enough 
I wish it could be me 
I wish it could be me 

This one is for the boy whose daddy never had time for him 
I Wish I could build you a little house for you to hide in 
And give you back your summers 
I'd give you back all your summers 
You still have summers 

Life is sweet life is sweet life is sweet 
Bittersweet 
And the days keep rolling along 

This one is for the girl who says those voices in her head 
Never leave her alone 
Don't listen to your teacher, you're not crazy 
Just smarter than the rest of them 
Paint a picture, write a song 
Tell your story, bang a gong 

Life is sweet life is sweet life is sweet 
Bittersweet 
And the days keep rolling along 
Rolling along 

This one is for the boy who's not allowed to be part of the gang 
You don't need those losers I think you're beautiful 
And you meet a girl and you fall in love and it doesn't work out 
Well it won't be the first time and they don't make a cure for that 
So you eat your breakfast, read a book 
Open up your window, be alone 

Life is sweet life is sweet life is sweet 
Bittersweet 
And the days keep rolling along
