I said I didn't want to cause you any misery
It's got to be that I could never
You said anywhere you go I'm coming with you
And that's alright I think I like that
I know you were standing by me when the walls came down
You stood your ground and that's all right yeah
All right you can make a difference with a single word
I think you heard
That I'm the man in the moon
That I'm the man in the moon

Coming to get you
Coming to get you
Made a selection, got a connection to you now.
Hey girl if you should ever want me, you just look outside

I'm in the sky I'm shining down now
Shine on, silver moon shall be just like your sanctuary
The man inside that moon is me, yeah
I know you were standing by when the walls came down

You stood your ground and that's all right yeah
All right you can make a difference with a single word
I think you heard

[Chorus]
Stars are falling
Stars are falling
Stars are falling on my head
Stars are falling
Stars are falling
Stars are falling on my head

I said I didn't want to cause you any misery
It's got to be that I could never
You said anywhere you go I'm coming with you
And that's all right I think I like that.

[Chorus]
