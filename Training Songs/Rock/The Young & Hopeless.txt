Hard days made me
Hard nights shaped me
I don't know they somehow saved me
And I know I'm making something out of this life they call nothing

I Take what I want
Take what I need
You say it's wrong, but its right for me
I won't look down

Won't say I'm sorry
I know that only god can judge me

[Chorus]
And if I make it through today
Will tomorrow be the same
Am I just running in place
And if I stumble and I fall
Should I get up and carry on
Will it all just be the same
'Cause I'm young and I'm hopeless
I'm lost and I know this
I'm going nowhere fast that's what they say
I'm troublesome I've fallen
I'm angry at my father
It's me against this world and I don't care
I don't care

No one in this industry
Understands the life I lead
When I sing about my past
It's not a gimmick, not an act

These critics, and these trust fund kids
Try to tell me what punk is
But when I see them on the street they got nothing to say

[Chorus]
And if I make it through today
Will tomorrow be the same
Am I just running in place
And if I stumble and I fall
Should I get up and carry on
Will it all just be the same
'Cause I'm young and I'm hopeless
I'm lost and I know this
I'm going nowhere fast that's what they say
I'm troublesome I've fallen
I'm angry at my father
Its me against this world and I don't care
I don't care I don't care... and now I don't care

I'm young and I'm hopeless
I'm lost and I know this
I'm going nowhere fast that's what they say
That I'm troublesome I've fallen

I'm angry at my father
Its me against this world and I don't care
I don't care. I don't care. I don't care.
