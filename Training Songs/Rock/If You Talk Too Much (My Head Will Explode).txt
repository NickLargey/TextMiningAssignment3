I don't want you to try and save me, 
No I don't want you at all, 
If we're through, then you don't blame me, 
'Cause that won't do at all 

If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 

You've no time to reconcile me, 
There's no time left to call, 
And I'll take my share, and then I'll vanish, 
I want my share, that's all. 

If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 

Can't complain, I feel sly
You can get up and go 

I don't want you to try and save me, 
No I don't want you at all 

If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 
If you talk too much my head will explode 

Explode, explode
