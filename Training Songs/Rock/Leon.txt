Leon came along
To see me on the road
He took the time to come backstage
And make himself known

And although we'd never been real close
As friends we'd shared some times
Worked the clubs, once traveled music
Together for a while

Leon, you've been away too long
The world ain't still the way it used to be
Leon, you've been away too long
To turn your back, now, on your family

Tomorrow I'll be in Amsterdam
He smiled and shook my hand
Wished me all success
And I said try to understand

"But I envy you", he said
And I tried to share his loss
Told him how the road
Was still as tough as it was

Leon, you're been away too long
The world ain't still the way it used to be
Leon, you've been away too long
To turn your back, now, on your family

My plane flew into Amsterdam
And lying in my room
I heard the news how Leon died
That very afternoon

I telephoned my flowers
With some words I hoped were kind
With our backstage conversation
Still burning in my mind

Leon, you've been away too long
The world ain't still the way it used to be
Leon, you've been away too long
To turn your back now on your family
