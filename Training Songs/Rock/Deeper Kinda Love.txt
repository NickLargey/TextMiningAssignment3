A deeper kinda love 
Has no borderlines, no ties 
A deeper kinda love 
Can bring you down and lift you up so high 

A phoenix starts to rise from the ashes inside my soul 
Leaving old wounds behind, a new me is born 
And you show me your world 
So dangerous, but I let go 

And when I fall, I fall deep 
Into a deeper kinda love 
A deeper kinda love 
Can also bring hurt and pain 

And in the shadow that it casts 
Lies jealousy, fear, and hate 
The more I have to win means the more I have to lose 
And it hits home 

And when I think of losing you 
And your deeper kinda love 
you've shown me a world 
So dangerous, still I let go 

And when I fall, I fall deep 
Into a deeper kinda love 
A deeper kinda love 
Has no borderlines, no ties 

A deeper kinda love 
Can bring you down and lift you up so high 
A phoenix starts to rise from the ashes inside my soul 
Leaving old wounds behind, a new me is born 

And you show me your world 
So dangerous, but I let go 
And when I fall, I fall deep 
Into a deeper kinda love 

Show me your world 
A deeper kinda love 
Show me your world 
A deeper kinda love 

Show me your world 
A deeper kinda love 
Show me your world 
Just show me your world 
Show me your world 

A deeper kinda love 
Show me your world 
A deeper kinda love 
Show me your world 

A deeper kinda love ...
