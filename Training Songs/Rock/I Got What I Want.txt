No amount of money could ever buy my love 
'Cause there's no prettier face could take your place 
No amount of rivalry, nobody but you gets to me 
I'm way past falling in love with you 

I got what I want 
Nobody can take it away 
I'll keep what I got 
I'm never gonna lose it 
I got what I want 

No friendly persuasion could ever change my mind 
Like water off a duck's back 
It's wasted time 

I got what I want 
Nobody can take it away 
I'll keep what I got 
I'm never gonna lose it 
I got what I want

Always knew what I wanted 
So I've never been satisfied 
I never settled for second best 
And I wasn't denied 

Nobody can take it away 
I got what I want 
Never gonna lose it 
I got what I want 
Nobody can take it away 
I'll keep what I got 
Never gonna lose it 
I got what I want 
Nobody can take it away 
I'll keep what I got
