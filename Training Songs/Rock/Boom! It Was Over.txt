I had the impression our love was "a-ok"
When I looked in her eyes I thought I had it made
We were cruisin' right along down a wide open road
But what lurks around the corner I guess you never know
It was love beyond a shadow of a doubt
That's when the lights went out

Like steppin' off a corner on a busy street
Like a pretty girl can knock you off your feet
Like a change in the weather or the drop of a hat
Boom! It was over just like that

Like a touchdown pass in overtime
Like a thunderbolt from a clear blue sky
Like a knockout punch sends a man to the mat
Boom! It was over just like that

Maybe I didn't know what I thought I knew
Now was it what I did or what I didn't do
You know I thought she thought I was a helluva guy
Ain't it funny how things change in the blink of an eye
She smiled a smile so sweet and calm
That's when she dropped the bomb

Like steppin' off a corner on a busy street
Like a pretty girl can knock you off your feet
Like a change in the weather or the drop of a hat
Boom! It was over just like that

Like a touchdown pass in overtime
Like a thunderbolt from a clear blue sky
Like a knockout punch sends a man to the mat
Boom! It was over just like that
