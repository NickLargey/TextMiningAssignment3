Well I was willing orders while I thought you heard 'em say
So you drifted off to see what's not in yourself

Light is turning slowly will it lay out on the plains
No more nights to watch you roll back in
No relief of no rain

You're still singing songs of rivers
Like through accidents within
And telling people lies of
Lions, treasures and kings

Nothing's more revealing than the dancer and the doubt
Waving to forget what's never gone
Always there, never rise

And all these riots are broken sounds
Like the last voice you heard
And you drown, oh no

You know this is wind and walls
And weathered leaves and terraces
The minnows in your pockets win the
Rabbits on trails

This is not the future but I sense it's up right up there, oh
Just another hour, another pass
Another day anywhere

And all these riots are broken sounds
Yeah, you sleep on the track
Every night, oh no

And we don't know if your treasure is safe
Or where you'll be when they find you some

And you know they're always following me
So when I get there you trust me some, sweet

I'll catch 'em

This is where you're passionate of seasons and their strength
And this is where you'll breath and walk and know they will end

The light is turning slowly through the hand up on your chest
So lay it on the plains where there is ?
There is love, there is rest

From all these riots of broken sounds
Where you sleep on the track
Every night, oh no

And we don't know if your treasure is safe
Or where you'll be when they find you some
And you know you're always following me

I'll be the best when the silence comes
