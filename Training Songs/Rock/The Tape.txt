Now they're calling for the second time today 
Asking for to borrow those two tapes again 
Is it really worth the struggle of covering up? 
On the brink and learning how to live with it 
Got experience from method toting deep within 
And they say it's so inflammable
Am I caught in a trap with all the remains of a letdown?
All the remains of a letdown

Speak out if you got it
Watch out if you run
Since I heard someone died at a screening downtown of a tape

Now they're running round drawing circles and 
Living up to everything you think of them 
Such a senseless slender guy and his greater half 

On a mission for the local government 
Looking for a tape that's gonna pay the rent 
And they say it's so inflammable 
The cats will whine the dogs will itch 
So bury the beat and forget them 
Raise the remains of a letdown

Speak out if you got it
Watch out if you run 
Since I heard someone cried at a screening 
Downtown of a tape
Of a tape
OK

Now it's coming out the story we all knew 
In equal parts all that you did and that you didn't do 
Was it really worth the struggle of covering up?

Leave it playing till it spells the ending back 
Is this what happens if you suffer like a cardiac?
Will you beg to be excused for always dumbing down 
Or wrenching up 
Now all that's left is a letdown
The view in reverse of a letdown

Speak up if you got it
Watch out if you run 
Since I heard someone died at a screening 
Downtown of a tape, of a tape
