You've had it all and you wanted more
You've had nothing and you wanted for nothing
You take a look through the open door
See it all going on out there
Time goes by, time goes by
And if you didn't laugh you could almost cry

What do you think of it so far?
Do you wonder where there might be something better?
Do you think about where you are?
Do you wonder where you're going?

Five days a week for a slice of pie
Six pack of beer for an anaesthetic
You laugh a lot but you don't know why
And you don't seem to care 'bout that
Life goes on, life goes on
You don't know what you've got 'til it's almost gone

What do you think of it so far?
Do you wonder where there might be something better?
Do you think about where you are?
Do you wonder where you're going?

This three piece suite
These aching feet
This one way street
This funny old town
This unmade bed
These thoughts unsaid
These books unread
This merry go round

Time goes by
And if you didn't laugh you could almost cry
Life goes on, life goes on
You don't know what you've got 'til it's almost gone

What do you think of it so far?
Do you wonder where there might be something better?
Do you think about where you are?
Do you wonder where you're going?
