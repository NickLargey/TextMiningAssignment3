Everybody moving further away
Everybody moving further away
Everybody moving further away
Everybody moving further away

See you where the light ends
I'll be shooting across the silver
Through the breaking sky
And back before you know
Wheeling in formation
And I know what you're thinking

So turn your eyes away
And let me be alone

Everybody moving further away
Everybody moving further away

See you where the lie turns
I'll be shooting caps of silver
But it's different now

I'm the only one who flies
Wheeling in formation
And I know what you're thinking
But they're all strangers now
And the silver doesn't shine

Everybody moving further away
Everybody moving further away

There with all the people
There with all the people
Oh, I surrender, this is
Oh, I surrender, this is it  
Oh, I surrender, this is it 
Oh, I surrender, this is it 
Oh, I surrender, this is it
