Well she grabbed me and asked me,
If I had a name,
She told me she was interested to see,
If I could play the game,
She said her name was victory,
She didn't want to know the rules,
That's just the way I wanted to play,
In a game designed for fools.

Chorus:
We were beatin' the odds, we were beatin' the odds,
We were beatin' the odds again,
We were gambling with our souls,
We were playing to win,
We were beatin' the odds again.

Well I rolled the dice feelin' cold as ice,
And Victory drew the cards,
We knew that loosin' when the stakes were high,
Could really hit us hard,
I strapped into the drivers seat,
With Miss Victory by my side,
She knew at a glance she was takin' a chance,
By coming along for the ride.

Chorus:
We were beatin' the odds, we were beatin' the odds,
We were beatin' the odds again,
We were gambling with our souls,
We were playing to win,
We were beatin' the odds again.

Time and space stood still that day,
With Victory's soul and mine,
We were running a race between heaven and hell,
And we could not find the finish line,
And when it was all over we won it in the end,
We were splittin' the prize when she opened her eyes,
And said Baby let's try it again.

Chorus:
We were beatin' the odds, we were beatin' the odds,
We were beatin' the odds again,
We were gambling with our souls,
We were playing to win,
We were beatin' the odds again.

Chorus:
We were beatin' the odds, we were beatin' the odds,
We were beatin' the odds again,
We were gambling with our souls,
We were playing to win,
We were beatin' the odds again.
