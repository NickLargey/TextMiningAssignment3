There's a light that shines on 
Everyone tonight 
But it seems we're just too blind to see 
There's a love that's so deep 
We should never want 
But do we really know what we need? 

[Chorus]
I never thought there would be 
Someone who'd mean so much to me 
In my mind there was no 
Such thing as perfect love 
But now I'm holding you tonight 
And I can see that you were right 
To believe there can be perfect love 

You can live your whole life trying to avoid 
Being hurt, like you've been hurt before 
Then one day you may wake up 
And feel a love so strong 
That you can't hold it back anymore 

[Chorus]

Ever since you called my name 
Nothing's ever been the same 
I want to give my heart to you 
And your perfect love so true 
Oh, your perfect love 
But now you're here with me tonight 
And I can see that you were right 
To believe there can be perfect love
