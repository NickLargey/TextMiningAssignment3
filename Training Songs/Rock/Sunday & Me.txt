Her eyes would make an angel smile
They'd call her Sunday
She'll take a man and drive him wild
Her name is Sunday
And one day I'm gonna make her mine
It's gonna be so fine
You wait and see (ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo)
It's gonna be (ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo)
Just Sunday and me

There's not a star that shines as bright
Her name is Sunday
She'll take the dark out of the night
They call her Sunday
And one day I'm gonna take her home
Tell the world that she's my own
You wait and see (ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo)
It's gonna be (ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo)
Just Sunday and me

Sunday, Sunday, Oh!

Oh I see bells and wedding gowns
When I see Sunday
And all I dream of walkin' down the aisle
With Sunday
And one day it's gonna come for sure
The day that I've been livin' for
You wait and see (ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo)
It's gonna be (ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo)
Just Sunday and me

Sunday, Oh!, Sunday
