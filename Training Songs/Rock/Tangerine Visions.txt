Easterly winds whisking the kids
There are new-borns all around
Lampposts guide them but the lights just died there
And they slow to a crawl

Misting aside their eyes open wide
At the sight of golden youth
Fathers and mothers gather in numbers
When the sales greeter do

Dreamt of the leaves, stitched up the seams
And they all counted down
Each one mutter pair with another
And the young ones go round

Fading dreams and rich tangerine
The sky began to fall
Figures stack up whether they close up
They make the final call

With warmth from the sun and visions of what they want
Rise up as one counting down to one
With warmth from the sun and visions of what they want
Rise up as one counting down to one

With warmth from the sun and visions of what they want
Rise up as one counting down to one
