I never meant for you to get hurt,
And how I tried,
Oh how I tried.

I could never give you just what you deserved,
Another man, would surely learn.

I know these words, they only serve to twist the knife,
But I'll try, to make them heard.
Maybe it's better now I've gone away,
Maybe it's not,
Oh, who can say.

And though it's hard, for me to say,
I know you're better off this way.

And when I told her I didn't love her anymore,
She cried.
And when I told her, her kisses were not like before,
She cried.
And when I told her another girl had caught my eye,
She cried.
And I kissed her, with a kiss that could only mean goodbye.

And though it's hard, for me to say,
Maybe you're better off this way.
And though it's hard, for me to say,
I know you're better off this way.

Get away
Get away
Get away
Get away
Get away
Get away
