It's the way you're nervous when you speak 
The way I know just what you mean 
It's the kind of thing that's bitter sweet 
It's the funny feeling deep inside 

So many different sides but still so easy to define 
'Cause you know it everytime and not just in your mind 
But you can feel the butterflies...
Sendin' chills down your spine 

What is love? 
But a kiss on a rainy day 
A smile that won't go away 
A safe place to run 

What is love? 
But a complicated simple truth 
A bond between me and you 
The number one 

Uh that's love 
And the things that never cross your mind 
You're doin' all of the time 
It's with someone special, it's alright 

It's like dancing when you walk 
And singing when you talk 
Your happy just to be alive 
But in the morin`, 

Don't pretend, 
Let it go and take it in 
You don't have to understand 
The how, why, and when's 

What is love? 
But a kiss on a rainy day 
A smile that won't go away 
A safe place to run 

What is love? 
But a complicated simple truth 
A bond between me and you 
The number one 

So take off your hat and stay for a minute 
Love is a precious thing if you let it 
In you'll never know what you'll find till you give it, 
Sometime, sometime 

What is love? (what is love? ... yeah) 
But a kiss on a rainy day (a kiss on a rainy day) 
A smile that won't go away (a smile that won't go away) 
A safe place to run 

What is love? (what is love?) 
But a complicated simple truth (a simple truth) 
A bond between me and you (between me and you) 
The number one 

What is love? (what is love?) 
But a kiss on a rainy day (a kiss on a raining day)
A smile that won't go away (a smile that won't go away)
A safe place to run (a safe place to run) 

What is love? (what is love?) 
But a complicated simple truth (a simple truth)
A bond between me and you (between me and you) 
The number one (the number one) 

All that's love (all that's love) 
What is love 
What is love?
It's a kiss on a rainy day

Oh that's love
Ohh oh ohhh
