In this moment
No-one is pulling me down into the ground
In this moment
No-one is pulling me down into the ground

I can't help it if I'm happy
I can't help it if I'm happy not to be sad
'Cause when you walk in the room
I see things that I can't understand

I want you endlessly
I want you endlessly
I want you endlessly

I was tired
Working myself into an early grave
I was lonely
Trying to teach myself how to behave
But these things have their own patterns
These things are fathomlessly out of our hands
And when you walk in the room
I know my life's never going to be planned

All of these old addresses
All of these empty guesses
You carry all of their weight on your back

I want you endlessly
I want you endlessly
I want you endlessly
I want you endlessly

In this moment
No-one is pulling me down into the ground
