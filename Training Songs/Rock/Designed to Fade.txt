Waiting in the pressure room
Watch the floor begin to crack
Check the time and hold your breath
Shake the witches from your back
But you won't break as you bend
You hold your grace until the end
 
All the better things we made
Every little change of shade
Maybe it's designed to fade
But I feel loved again
 
There is no protection here
They don't offer guarantees
But we just want something to mean something
For once, just for once
 
All the better things we made
Every little change of shade
Maybe it's designed to fade
But I feel loved again
 
Could you give it up ?
Have you had enough ?
Fall where I stand
Could you give it up ?
When you've had enough
You're in command
 
All the wasted things we do
All the trouble we go to
It's designed to fade it's true
But I feel loved again
