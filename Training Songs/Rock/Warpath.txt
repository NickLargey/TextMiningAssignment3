These eyes see carmine through concrete masks
Amid fantasies of strangers, I'm indulging myself.

This fractious fever is fervent 
With feelings of extinction. 
This violence is silenced by consequence.

Keep these secrets in my skin
?

Bloodshot and blooming, sanguinary and ruby. 
A muted dreaming. 
A clandestine paradise ? paradise

Keep these secrets in my skin
?
