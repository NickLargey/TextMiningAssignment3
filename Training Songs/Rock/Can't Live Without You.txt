One, two, one, two, three, four
You stand in front of the band with all those scarves in your hands
I see you play imaginary guitars
You people shaking your heads
Right till the end of the set
You really turn me on wherever we are

Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you

Put your hands in the air so I can see you are there
I want to see all your lights shining on
Want you to stand up and dance gonna leave you no chance
To take a breath between each single song

Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you
 
Stand up and shout
We're ready to rock, we're ready to roll
Stand up and shout 
Are you ready, are you ready
Come on and get it

Stand up and shout
We're ready to rock, we're ready to roll
Stand up and shout 
Are you ready, are you ready
Come on and get it

Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you
(Can't live, can't live without you)
