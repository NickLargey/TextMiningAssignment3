I see what's happening, I can read between the lines
I see what's happening, I can read between the lines

There's always a punk mother fucker popping that weak shit
Thug thumb, internet gangsters not on no street shit
Where we come from we don't f*ck with no polices
We pay their salary and they pay us back with mistreatment
Now peep this, Sandra Bland hanging in the cell
But just the day before she calling her mama for bail, hell
Now they get nervous when niggas in Ferguson
Get to popping the trunk, bust back and try to service them
Let's turn the tables like some brawlers in a bar fight
They killed Tamir Rice in plain sight and said it was alright
Now the people taking it to the streets because they're uptight
Now let the tear gas fly while the canines bite

It ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun
I see what's happening, I can read between the lines
It ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun
This time around the revolution televised

Standing outside school, got the clapman
Twelve roll by, woop woop Pacman
Do a turn around, roll up in they ass man
'Ay, what's your name?
And why don't you pull your pants up?'
Ay, I'm a kid and I'm scared, I don't answer
This sucker nigga tried to put me in some hand cuffs
I'm scared as f*ck so I buck, I don't a give a f*ck
I feel that dirty offer reaching for his ray gun
I grab his pepper spray, find his eye, spray some
Fight for my life like a mother fucking Trayvon
Fight for my life like a mother fucking Mike Brown
'Cause I refuse to be the next nigga shot down

It ain't no fun when the rabbit's got the gun
I see what's happening, I can read between the lines
It ain't no fun when the rabbit's got the gun
This time around the revolution's televised

It ain't no fun when the rabbit's got the gun
I see what's happening, I can read between the lines
It ain't no fun when the rabbit's got the gun
This time around the revolution's televised
