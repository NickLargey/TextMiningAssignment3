There's a story that I read about in books
About the bad times that people had
That's how he planned it
You can't do nowt about it
Too many people

The black plague came along and wiped out quite a few
The rats came with the graves, that's how we knew
That's how he planned it
You can't do nowt about it
Too many people

This ain't no story
No fairy tale
These things have happened once before
Ask yourself the question
When will it end
There ain't no foolin' death
So you just gotta sit and wait

Break

Too many people
Too many people

This ain't no story
No fairy tale
These things have happened once before
Ask yourself the question
When will it end
There ain't no foolin' death
So you just gotta sit and wait

A million people died
In great wars, that we know
They sacrificed their lives
Just goes to show
That's how he planned it
You can't do nowt about it

Too many people (there's too many people)
Too many people
Too many people
Too many people oh yeah
