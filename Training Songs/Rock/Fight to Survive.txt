And it all began the day that he was born
The boy looks up the sky1s blue the sun so warm
At time spent (that's numbered)
The young ones on the loose

(As) the (clock) keeps turning , times (are) spent in fast
(Cooling) off his burning fire, through his soul
He brings out hope, fight for survival
You fought the frantic and is easy falling down
He feels the emptiness that pushes (him) towards the ground

Oh, bring out your shield
Raise high your sword
(fight to survive)
Run, plea for your life
Took toward the sun
Fight to survive

As you walk along the shore
Your thoughts run by
The questions are you envy Thor's
Though deep inside and you feel like thunder

Since you are on the loose
As the times keep going lives fly by fast
Then you feel you're growing tired
You say no, look toward the sun, Fight for survival

You fought the frantic and is easy falling down
He feels the emptiness that pushes him towards the ground
