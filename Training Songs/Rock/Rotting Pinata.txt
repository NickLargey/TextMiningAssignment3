Get on the rodeo that is
Your life
Beat on me
Spill my insides out on
The ground
Cut on me
I will go when i say die
I will rot away
Like a rotting pinata

See my soul
It cuts a hole in the sky
Standing near
Watch the birds eat out my
Eyes
It will rot away
Like a rotting pinata

Here lies this junk of me
Here lies this wreck that
Was me
Oh God help me rot
I don't look quite the
Same
Grab my beating heart
Tear it from this broken
Cage today

I'm rotting
I'm coloring
I'm red and black
I'm twice my size
Don't cry for me
Just pull the plug
And let me fly

I will rot away
Like a rotting pinata
