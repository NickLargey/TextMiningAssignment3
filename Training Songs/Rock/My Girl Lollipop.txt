My Girl Lollipop, you make my heart go giddy up, 
You are as sweet as candy, you are my sugar dandy, 
Oh, oh, my girl lollipop, never ever leave me, 
Because it would grieve me, my heart told me so. 
I love you, I love you, I love you so, 
And I don't want you to know, 
I need you, I need you, I need you so, 
But I'll never let you go. 
My Girl Lollipop, you make my heart go giddy up, 
You set my world on fire, you are my one desire, 
Yeah, My Girl Lollipop. 

I love you, I love you, I love you so, 
And I don't want you to know, 
I need you, I need you, I need you so, 
But I'll never let you go.
