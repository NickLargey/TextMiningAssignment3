She rattles her chain and she's in her purse
She buys a little something to make her feel worse
She's got a boyfriend in Brooklyn
He's got a wife in Manhattan

Sometime comes, it's hotter than heaven
She picks up mascara at the 7-11
There's a lot goin' on but nothin' happenin'
Make her acquaintance, she's high maintenance

Sometimes a circle feels like a direction
Up and down, still lookin' for perfection
There's a lot goin' on but it all adds up to nothing
Sometimes a circle feels like a direction

Take me to Vegas where the elevators go sideways
And all the city lights collide
I've got a can of jet fuel and a brilliant intuition
You've got spurs on your boots and spider-man eyes

Sometimes a circle feels like a direction
Up and down, still lookin' for perfection
There's a lot goin' on but it all adds up to nothing
Sometimes a circle feels like a direction

This noise in my head
Some things are easier done than said
Make me mine

Sometimes a circle feels like a direction
Up and down, still lookin' for perfection
There's a lot goin' on but it all adds up to nothing
Sometimes a circle feels like a direction

I'm just a girl who's lookin' for affection
Spinnin' my wheels til I lose the connection
There's a lot goin' on but it all adds up to nothing
Sometimes a circle feels like a direction
