Looking out for a girl named Caroline
The kind of girl everybody like to meet
Standing there like she couldn't care
Hoping her heart never missed a beat
She got her look and you know that it's always there
I wouldn't have it any other way
Fact is you can take her anywhere
There is no reason but I gotta say

She's your very best friend
When you're digging in a hole
She'd read a good book
But she loves her rock and roll
You say what you want
But she's gonna take control
Caroline, you know, got a lot of soul

Gotta run, gotta hide, get outside of town
Somewhere we go she isn't far behind
Seems like another day in paradise
Another day for me to lose my mind
Now she'd be there, anywhere, didn't have a chance
And I believe everybody knows
She is the girl that you can't ignore
And isn't that the way it always goes?

She's your very best friend
When you're digging in a hole
She'd read a good book
But she loves her rock and roll
You say what you want
But she's gonna take control
Caroline, you know, got a lot of soul
So I'm never going back, gotta keep on moving on
Catch you doing this, when it's over dead and gone
No more looking cool down the barrel of a gun
Come on Caroline, still we gotta run
Come on Caroline

Got her look and you know that it's always there
I wouldn't have it any other way
Fact is you can take her anywhere
There is no reason but I gotta say

She's your very best friend
When you're digging in a hole
She'd read a good book
But she loves her rock and roll
You say what you want
But she's gonna take control
Caroline, you know, got a lot of soul
So I'm never going back, gotta keep on moving on
Catch you doing this, when it's over dead and gone
No more looking cool down the barrel of a gun
Come on Caroline, still we gotta run
Come on Caroline

She's your very best friend
