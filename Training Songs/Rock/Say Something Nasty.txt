Well, it's just like Jesus said
go put some shit  inside their heads
you got to stand up  for getting down
so roll me a joint and pass that  thorny crown

Gotta , Say something nasty
really let loose
Pay no attention
Ain't nothing but the truth

I got my foot to the floor
Cause I don't give a damn any more
If gotta worship  that rumbling sound
Better kneel down and pray before the baddest wheels in town

Say something nasty
really let loose
Pay no attention
Ain't nothing but the truth

Hit me 

If you don't like what I gotta say
then get your dead ass out of the way
I â€˜ll bring your whole world crumbling down
Easier than  shootin dead dogs inside a pound

Say something nasty
really let loose
Pay no attention
Ain't nothing but the truth
You've gotta hit them they're down baby
Kick 'em  in the dirt
Give me three seconds
show you where it hurts
