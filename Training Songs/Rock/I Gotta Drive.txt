I have been waiting for this day for such a long time. 
My engine’s tuned up and she’s running real fine. 
There’s my girl. Wow she looks pretty. 
She came to watch me race today, here at Drag City. 

If it’s the last thing that I do, I gotta win this race. (Gotta win this 
Race) 
Got a lot to feel and really set the pace. (Really set the pace) 
This inside lane is where I’m gonna stay. (Where I’m gonna stay) 
Gonna grab the lead and really show the way. (Really show the way) 

She loves me now but she’s gonna love me more! 
So I gotta drive like I never drove before. 

I’m taking seven grand but it's not enough. (I gotta drive. I gotta drive) 
There’s one car left to pass and it’s gonna be run. (I gotta drive. I gotta 
Drive) 
But now the last turn nears and he’s driftin' wide. (I gotta drive. I gotta 
Drive) 
So I’ll power shift down and then I’ll slide inside. (I gotta drive. I 
Gotta drive) 

She loves me now but she’s gonna love me more! 
So I gotta drive like I never drove before. 

With a length to spare I just crossed the line. (On their feet now what a 
Race) 
And there’s the checker flag this race is mine. (Checker flag this race is 
Mine) 
I hear a thousand voices and race crowd roar. (Yay yay) 
But her’s is the only one that I’m listening for. (There’s my baby looking 
Fine) 

She loves me now but she’s gonna love me more! 
Cause today I drove like I never drove before.
