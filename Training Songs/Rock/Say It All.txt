Last stop
Montauk
Try to get
Back on track
No vacation
Don't give up
Just don't look back
If you're looking for an answer, dig in
I have said too much already 
I cannot win
This could go on for forever on end 
There's nowhere to turn 
Nowhere to begin this isn't a joke it's merely a sin

There is no way to say it all 
Play it again and say it all
I said a little
The rest is a riddle
Our night's too short to say it all
Play it again and say it all
You know the punch line 
It's all in the punchline

Pale wind blowing
Cutting right
To the core
You're so patient
When the wreck washed ashore
If you ever need forgiveness, I give
I have done so many incomprehensible things 
This could go on for forever on end
There's nowhere to run 
Nowhere to escape
Don't tell me you knew until we awake

There is no way to say it all 
Play it again and say it all 
I said a little 
The rest is a riddle

Our night's too short to say it all 
Play it again and say it all 
Do you know the punchline?
It's all in the punchline

Now and again we can leave it all behind
Now and again we can leave it all behind

There is no way to say it all
Play it again and say it all
I said a little 
The rest is a riddle
Our night's too short to play it all
Say it again and play it all
You know the punchline
It's all in the punchline

I said a little 
The rest is a riddle
You know the punchline
It's all in the punchline

I said a little the rest is a riddle
You know the punchline, it's all in the punchline
