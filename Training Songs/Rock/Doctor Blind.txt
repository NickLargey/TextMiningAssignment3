The Lack of Light
Hollow Sea
Poison Beaches
Limousines
Toothless Dentists
Cops That Kill

My baby's got the lonesome lows
Don't quite go away overnight
Doctor blind just prescribe the blue ones
If the dizzying highs
Don't subside overnight
Doctor blind just prescribe the red ones

aaaaaahhhhhhhhh

hard to hold
Cold to touch
Fall to pieces
Treat the rush in hindsight
With prime time talk
All your pain
Will end here
Let the doctor
Soothe your brain, dear

My baby's got the lonesome lows
Don't quite go away overnight
Doctor blind just prescribe the blue ones
If the dizzying highs
Don't subside overnight
Doctor blind just prescribe the red ones

aaaaaahhhhhhhhh
