The chef prepares a special menu
For your delight, oh my.
Tonight you fly, so high up
In the Vanilla Sky

Your life is fine
It's sweet and sour
Unbearable great
You've got to learn
Every hour, you must appreciate.

This is your time,
This is your day.
You've got it all.
Don't blow it away.

Melted tin beads,
Cast you fortune
In a glass of wine.

Snail or fish,
Balloon or dolphin
See your silver shine.

This is your time,
This is your day.
You've got it all,
Don't blow it away.

In the vanilla,uh, in the vanilla,oh, in the vanilla sky.
In the vanilla,ah, in the vanilla,uh, in the vanilla sky.
Mmmm in the Vanilla Sky
