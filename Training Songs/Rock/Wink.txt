When I woke up today, I was feeling ok. But my mind started turning as breakfast was burning. My soul slipped away to a red evening sky, and a lovers sweet sigh, in the wink of an eye. In the wink of an eye.
Just try not to think, cause it will drive you to drink. But I cannot forget the all the things that you said while when were high. I was flying too high, hung out to dry, in the wink of an eye.
What more can I say, why should I even try. After reading your letter, I don't know whether to laugh or to cry, or just say goodbye, just say goodbye. With a wink in my eye.
