Betty was a working girl
living in the bottom half of the world
Saving up for Friday night
dancing underneath the lights, she would whirl

Dance, come on Betty sing, come on Betty, fly by night

Every man she meets appears to like her, then they whisper
'You coming outside?'
Leaning up against the fence
breathing hard and trying hard not to cry

Love, come on Betty give, come on Betty live for love

Who loves you Betty, always something standing in your way
You better get out Betty babe
Who loves you Betty, always someone looking the other way
You better get out Betty babe

There's always someone left behind, the crippled boy
the last in line, the lost soul
Love today is bought and sold
Betty wants the love of days gone old

Prim, proper little miss, gimme a little kiss, don't fuss

Who loves you Betty, always something standing in your way
you better get out Betty babe
Who loves you Betty, always someone looking the other way
you better get out Betty babe
