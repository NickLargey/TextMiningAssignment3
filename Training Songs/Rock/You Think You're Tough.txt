You say it's tough
Having nowhere to go
And no one to meet you baby
You say it's rough
Havin' all this to show
And no one to see you maybe
You take a a walk
Don't even stop
When you get to the end
You say "Hey!" (Hey!)
You think you're tough
You handle your own
You call the shots, come on,
No way

When you find your own way out
Then you're on your own
When you find there's no way out
You're not alone

You think you're tough
Harder than stone
You think you're tough
Your talk's gettin' old
You think you're tough
Harder than stone
You think you're tough

You say you're pro 
To push and shove
My foolish love, well maybe
You say your luck
Is runnin' on empty
Don't try and confuse me baby
You take a a walk
Don't even stop
When you get to the end
You say "Hey!" (Hey!)
Just wanna win
Don't wanna lose
If it takes all I've got
I'll give it, will do yeah

When you find your own way out
Then you're on your own
When you find there's no way out
You're not alone

You think you're tough
Harder than stone
You think you're tough
Your talk's gettin' old
You think you're tough
You're hard as stone
You think you're tough
I'll call your bluff
You think you're tough
You're hard as stone
You think you're tough
I'll call your bluff
You think you're tough
I'll call your bluff
You think you're tough
You're hard as stone
You think you're tough
You're hard as stone
You think you're tough
I'll call your bluff
You think you're tough
You're hard as stone
You think you're tough
I'll call your bluff
