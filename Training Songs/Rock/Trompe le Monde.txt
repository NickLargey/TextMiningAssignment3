Why do Cupids and Angels continually haunt her dreams
Like memories of another life is painted on her shirt in capitals
Out on the free free way there's only she an the they
Represented by the lights

We went to the store and bought something great
Which samples this song from Washington state

Go, go little record go it is named by some guy named Joe
And the words are the letters of the words
Said electrically played for outer space and those
Of they who paid this song is twice occurred
And now its time to go away on holiday
