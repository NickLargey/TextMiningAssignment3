My heart is as black as my soul
My mind is a head but its whole
I?m loosing in a back of direction
I?m dreaming of a resurrection

Hey hey hey yeah yeah
I can't get you off my mind

I keep on bring me down
Thinking of the way you used to feel
Dreaming about your face
Thinking of another place

Hey hey hey yeah yeah
I can't get you off my mind

I'm still thinking about you
What everyone wants

Hey hey hey yeah yeah
I can't get you off my mind
