Sitting here wonderin' 'bout things
That only the Lord knows
Tryin' to feel all the pain you have inside
Misery shows
It doesn't matter how hard you try
It still shows

Please take his hand
The time has come to learn
Please take my hand
Let me take you to learn

I just want to show you
That you don't have to run anymore
I can show you your life has just begun
So many people trying to be free

Like the way it's meant to be
But our lives are filled with pain
Pain and misery
I'm so sorry it ended up this way
Soon the sun will shine on me

Please take his hand
The time has come to learn
Please take my hand
Let me take you to learn

I just want to take you
To places you haven't been before
I can take you will you let me in
