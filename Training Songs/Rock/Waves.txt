These are things I've thought about silly boy
You're often thought about in waves
The sun is setting on my side it's alright
Unless it's gone away for good

But it's so hard it's so hard
Watching you fade away
And it's too hard, it's too hard
Watching you go away

These are the waves that I've talked about silly boy
Don't you forget about what I have said
These are waves that I talked about silly boy
Don't you forget about what I have said
It's all in your head

The person that I thought I was
Is something I don't think is coming true
And the same things that surround me now
Are the same things
That I seem to see right through

But it's so hard it's so hard
Watching you fade away
And it's too hard it's too hard
Watching you go away

These are the waves that I talked about silly boy
Don't you forget about what I have said
These are waves that I talked about silly boy
Don't you forget about what I have said
It's all in your head
