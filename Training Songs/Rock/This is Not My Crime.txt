Ignoring the best advice at time
You stood applauding as I picked him from the line
This time he'll surely do time
Whilst dreaming a slow motion of the crime in colour

He's laughing as the courtroom fills with cries
Next time he'll surley do time
This is not my crime
But the years have not flown by

And every time I cry
He's inside me
