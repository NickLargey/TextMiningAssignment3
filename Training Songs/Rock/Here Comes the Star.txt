Look at me now
I'm the loneliest guy in the world
People say he's a star
And he's sure to go far
Ain't he pretty?
Look at me now
Do they know for the love of that girl?
I would give all I have for a moment of love, saying

Here comes the star
He's the idol of all the world, step aside
Here comes the star
What he'd give if that girl would come
And share his loneliness

There was a time
We would wander down love's avenue
Sharing moments together
That should last forever
Then came the time
Saw my name up in lights
And you knew
There'd be no time together
Now you're gone, still they say

Here comes the star
He's the idol of all the world, step aside
Here comes the star
What he'd give if that girl would come
And share his loneliness

Now the stage is bare
Knowing you're not there
I'd give it all away
Just to hear you say
I love you

Here comes the star
He's the idol of all the world
Here comes the star
What he'd give if that girl would come

Here comes the star
He's the idol of all the world 
Here comes the star
What he'd give if that girl would come

Here comes the star
He's the idol of all the world, step aside
