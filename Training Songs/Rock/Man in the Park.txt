Hey, talk to the girl cause she's good
she's a little misunderstood
talk to the girl cause she's good
Hey, talk to the man cause he knows,
just how the story goes
talk to the man that knows
And I think you'll find that what he says
doesn't seem that crazy
when you're in his head
and I think you'll see
that what he thinks,
makes a lot of sense
when you're on the brink

Hey, talk to the flower shop girl,
she's all alone in this world
talk to the flower girl
Hey, talk to the man in the park
he'll tell you he's lost the spark
talk to the man in the dark
