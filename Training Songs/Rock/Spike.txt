Oh, we got another one, just like the other ones 
Another bad ass, another troublemaker 
I'm scared, ain't you boys scared? 
I wonder if he's gonna show us what bad is? 
Boys, we got a man with a dog collar on 
You think we oughta' throw ol' Spike a bone? 

Hey Spike what do you like? 
Hey Spike what do you like? 

Here's another misfit, another Jimmy Dean 
Bet he's got a motorbike, 
What do ya'll think? 
Bet if we be good we'll get a ride on it 
If he ain't too mad about the future 
Maybe we oughta help him see 
The future ain't what it used to be 

Hey Spike, you're scarin' my wife 
Hey, Spike what do you like? 
Please Spike, tell us 'bout life?
