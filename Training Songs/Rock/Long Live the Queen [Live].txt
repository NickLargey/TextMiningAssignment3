Everybody's got themselves a plan
Everybody thinks they'll be 
The man including the girls
The musicians who lack the friends to start a band,
The singer song writers
The rest of us are DJ's or official club photographers

And tonight I'm playing another Nambooka show
So I'm going through my phone book texting everyone I know
And quite a few I don't whose numbers found their way onto my phone
But I might come along anyway, you never really know

Because none of this is going anywhere
And pretty soon we'll all be old
And no one left alive will really care
About our glory days when we sold our souls
But if your all about the destination.

Then take a fucking flight
Where going nowhere slowly but seeing all the signs
And we're definitely going to hell

But we'll have all the best stories to tell.
