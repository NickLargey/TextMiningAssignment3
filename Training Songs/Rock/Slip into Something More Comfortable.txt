I said can I buy you a drink
She said said slow down
I don't want to make the wrong impression
I just want to get to know ya
She said no offense I need to calm down
I just got out of some bad shhhh
And I need to meet a gentleman

Soft and slow
Let the mood think for you

Got a little buzz going need some fresh air
I said I'd like the company you want to get out of here 
Let's spark smokes spark some conversation the night is never wrong but we are

I said I got a place not much to look at 
We can take a stroll if you can handle that
You smile and say you can handle anything
Open the door a bottle of wine
Take a glass and we can unwind 
Should I put on some music 
Something...

soft and slow
Let the mood think for you

Got a little buzz going need some fresh air
I said I'd like the company you want to get out of here 
Let's spark smokes spark some conversation the night is never wrong but we are
It's getting hot and we can taste it
But I'm trying so hard not to say it
Girl show me something show me anything
I promise not to tell if you won't

Am I you're only only
Is this just for tonight
Slip into something a little more comfortable
Am I you're only only
Is this just for tonight
Slip into something a little more comfortable

Take me back down
We'll tear through these sheets until morning
This is guilt free
Dripping sweat
Things start to get heavy
Let's make tonight something we could never regret

Am I you're only only
Is this just for tonight
Slip into something a little more comfortable
