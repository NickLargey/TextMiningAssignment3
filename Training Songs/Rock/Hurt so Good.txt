Oh

Seen the light, the birth and you
So kin for it to kill
I've been wounded

Oh I won't begin to cry
Close my eyes and want to die
You had me fooled

And if it hurts so good
Don't let me know
Cause when it hurts so good
Darling you know

Pull the stars down from the sky
Through their beauties are decide
If I am dreaming

Shape the truth from out my hand
Wake the living, wake been dead
Here's the ?

And if it hurts so good
Don't let me know
Cause when it hurts so good
Darling you know

You better stop
What if you are 
Just a memory of this heart of mine.
Just take a look inside

Stop, 
There is nothing left 
To give unless it's all worth while
Have you erased the files

Stop,
I can't afford to keep on running, running
For you
