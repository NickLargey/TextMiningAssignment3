November came down hard this year 
And I saw you standing clear of the rain 
Falling free but I was ready to finally come clean. 

Observe me, in my circus show
On a thin light, as I take the rope and lose my nerve 

But you, you pull me back with 
Your hands in my hand
And our feet all in line

I'm ready, to take you with me 
To take you with me

To take you with me

Your hands in my hand
And our feet all in line

I'm ready, to take you with me
To take you with me
