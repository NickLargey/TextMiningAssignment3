Life is a struggle
Baby you got to choose
Hear the call of the wild wind
What have you got to lose

So take off that coat
And kick off those crazy shoes
I can see by your smile that you're ready
Well, I'm ready too

Oh, life is a puzzle
Baby you've got to try
But don't let it get you
And don't let it pass you by

'cause here and now darling
Here and now you got me
And something inside me
Tells me it's meant to be

Will it be alright
I'm getting a message
From someone
Will it turn out right

It's not just a face in the crowd
It's not just a face in the crowd
Face in the crowd

Will it be alright
I'm getting a message
From someone
Will it turn out right

It's not just a face in the crowd
It's not just a face in the crowd
Face in the crowd

Life is a struggle
Baby you got to choose
Hear the call of the wild wind
What have you got to lose

So take off that coat
And kick off those crazy shoes
I can see by your smile that you're ready
Well, I'm ready too

So just close your eyes
I'm getting a message
From someone
Through a clear blue sky

It's not just a face in the crowd
It's not just a face in the crowd
Face in the crowd
