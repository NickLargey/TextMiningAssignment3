Bangin' his head
Stab in the back
Look her in the eye and Buddy, 
You can tell she's crazy
Smack in the face
Look at 'em go
Take a look around & you can see 
I don't mean maybe

If sex is a weapon
Who's winnin' the war?
My legs are too tired
I can't run anymore

She's mad
She's sore
I'm gettin' out for sure
My time
Is up
I just can't stand this stuff

(Said) look where you're goin'
You don't even know what you're knowin'
Look where you're goin'
You don't even know what you're knowin'

Heaven's above
Look out below
be	-be	-be	-be	-be	-be	---Baby
Fell on his back
Rubbin' his head
Pretty little girl; 
Sure as hell she ain't no lady

I'm mild as a bunny
I'm meek as a lamb
You lead me to slaughter
I'm mud in your hands

I know ? I say
I'm findin' out today
Someway ? somehow
I'm gonna pull you down

Blow me away
Leave me alone
I'm beggin' you
Please come on home

All over the house
All over the town
Bit 'I'm in the hand so 'e turned around and
hit 'er with a hammer
Flippity flop
When does it stop
Here they come again
And that's the way they live together

So ? look where you're goin'
You don't even know what you're knowin'
Look where you're goin'
You don't even know what you're knowin'
