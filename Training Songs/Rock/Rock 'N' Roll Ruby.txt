Well, I took my Ruby jukin' on the out-skirts of town
She took her high heels off and rolled her stockings down
She put a quarter in the jukebox to get a little beat
Everybody started watchin', all the rhythm in her feet

She's my rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
Rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy, it satisfies my soul

Now, Ruby started rockin' 'bout one o'clock
And when she started rockin'
She just couldn't stop, she rocked on the tables
And rolled on the floor, and everybody yelled
"Ruby, rock some more"

She's my rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
Rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy, it satisfies my soul

It was 'round about four, I thought she would stop
She looked at me and then she looked at the clock
She said, "Wait a minute, Daddy
Now don't get sour, all I want to do
Is rock a little bit more"

She's my rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
Rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy, it satisfies my soul

One night, my Ruby left me all alone
I tried to contact her on the telephone
I finally found her about twelve o'clock
She said, "Leave me alone, Daddy
'Cause your Ruby wants to rock"

She's my rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
Rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy, it satisfies my soul

Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy, it satisfies my soul
