Pistol of fire
Pistol of fire
Pistol of fire

Shattered the frame
Go hug your sister
Go love your sister
Go hug your sister
One in the same
Ah, where is it you want to take me?
Ah, where is it you want to go?
Ah, wrapping up the morning's coming
Ah, home before the rooster crows

I feel the water
Out in the cool grass
Down in the meadow
Under the tree
It's gonna tickle
You're gonna giggle
It's gonna tickle
Tickle for free
Ah, where is it you want to take me?
Ah, where is it you want to go?
Ah, wrapping up the morning's coming
Ah, home before the rooster crows
