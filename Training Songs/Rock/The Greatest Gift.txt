Praise the mountain and the rain
All the gifts that still remain
But the greatest gift of all
And the law above all laws

Is to love your friends and lovers
To lay down your life for your brothers
As you abide in peace
So will your delight increase

As the mystery of the cross
Is the love joy lost, I toss
In the fountain in the rain
But my sorrow still remains

So I run to my friends and lovers
I lay down my life for my brothers
As I abide in peace
So will my delight increase
