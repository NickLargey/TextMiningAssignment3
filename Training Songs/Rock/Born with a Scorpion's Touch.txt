Oh, when you’re in the light
You look an animal caged tight, dead life
I feel the end, I feel the one
I feel the hammer crush down on your world
I’m going down, down, down, oh yeah

Killer heart in the wasteland
Diamond eyes, I’m a maelstrom
You’re the only one to love
It’s the only way to know
I’m born with a scorpion’s touch

True danger of females
The jealous whip of a devil’s tail
Emerald’s kiss on a broken heart
She was violent from the start
A hellcat in a mini skirt

Killer heart in the wasteland
Diamond eyes, I’m a maelstrom
You’re the only one to love
It’s the only way to know
I’m born with a scorpion’s touch

I’m born, with an endless love
Killer heart in the wasteland (whoa)
I’m born, with a scorpion (whoa)
Killer heart in the wasteland (whoa)

Killer heart in the wasteland
Diamond eyes, I’m a maelstrom
You’re the only one to love
It’s the only way to know
I’m born with a scorpion’s touch
