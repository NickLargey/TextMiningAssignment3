Welcome

Little explosions shinin' through the sky
Vivid emotions were comin' down into my mind
A little confusion - I thought I should take the chance
For a little illusion and a magical experience

The sky turned red and then she said:
Welcome, she said: welcome

She said: welcome to my little island
The place where your fears are turnin' silent
There is no more need to cry
I take the sadness from your eyes

She said: welcome to my little island
The place where your fears are turnin' silent
No there ain't no need to cry
I take the sadness frome your eyes
She said welcome, she said welcome

A little blue ocean a private hiding place
A little love potion as I watched the sunrise on her face
A little invention it seemed like heaven sent
Another dimension and this magical experience

The sky turned red and then she said:
Welcome to my little island
The place where your fears are turnin' silent
There is no more need to cry

I take the sadness from your eyes
She said: welcome to my little island
The place where your fears are turnin' silent
No there ain't no need to cry
I take the sadness frome your eyes

And now here I am inviting you to come into my life
I hope you have a pleasant flight into my dreams tonight
You are welcome, you're welcome
Welcome, she said welcome

Oh She said: welcome to my little island
The place where your fears are turnin' silent
There is no more need to cry
I take the sadness from your eyes

She said: welcome to my little island
The place where your fears are turnin' silent
There is no more need to cry
I take the sadness frome your eyes
She said welcome, she said welcome
Welcome
