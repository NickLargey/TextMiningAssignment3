I’d like to break down and say that I’m lonely
But something prevents me
That something can only be
When you know you’re giving way
Heavy is the weight, endless is the wait
Hopeless!
And you want somewhere to run
Need somewhere to hide
If you never cried
Whisper!
I’d like to break down and say that I’m lonely
But something prevents me
That something can only be
So when bitterness comes ’round
No one is exempt
Try and look your best
A vain attempt!
After all is said and done
Someone else’s name
Coming from her lips
Screaming!
