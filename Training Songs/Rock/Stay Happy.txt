Stay happy

Slush puppies, foul pavements
Ice cream comes up on their pagers
Break them up with a bucket of water

Kids waving, shake babies
Smile candy through splinters
Squeezed into ill fitting stitches
Squeezed into ill fitting stitches

Stay happy
Stay happy
Stay happy
Stay happy

You're funny, not happy
Self-effacing, self protected
Please save me from the wretched
Please save me from the wretched

Stay happy
Stay happy
Stay happy
Stay happy

Stay happy
Stay happy
Stay happy
Stay happy

Stay happy
Stay happy
Stay happy
Stay happy
Stay happy

Stay happy
Stay happy
Stay happy
Stay happy

Stay happy
Stay happy
Stay happy
Stay happy

Did you get enough sleep?
You look so tired go to the beach
