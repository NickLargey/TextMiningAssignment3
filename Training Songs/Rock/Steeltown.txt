Here I stand with my own kin
At the end of everything
finally the dream has gone 
I've nothing left to hang upon
I came here with all my friends
Leaving behind the wait of years
Leaving alone in a flood of tears
Out on a prospect that never ends
All the landscape was the mill
Grim as the reaper with a heart like hell
With a river of bodies
Flowing with the bell
We built it all with our own hands
But who could know we built on sand
But now it's barren all to soon
There's no miracle in ruin
We set the flame and it burned so blue
With open eyes I watched it grow
A sea of palms in an ocean of snow
Hands with the courage to start anew
Here was a home for the lost and scared
Out of the yards and dry docks
The call of the steel that would never stop
There was a refuge for those who dared
In a steeltown
When the heat's on
I went down
And the heat turned on me
Here I stand with my own kin
At the end of everything
finally the dream has gone
I've nothing left to hang upon
In a steeltown
When the heat's on
I went down
And the heat turned on me
