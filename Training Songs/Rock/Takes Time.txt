I've known girls all around the world
I've met every kind
You say you're something special to me
But honey never mind
Everytime you say you mean it
I whisper something, oh yeah, I can't repeat it
Everytime I'm sorry to say
Baby don'tcha understand
CHORUS:
It takes time baby it takes time
To make time baby it takes time
It takes time to make time with me
You say that you wanna settle down
Yeah I guess we might
But we'll be on the road for 90 days
Yeah we leave tonight
All the time you been schemin'
To try to trick me, oh yeah, you must be dreamin'
Once again I'm sorry to say
Baby don'tcha understand
CHORUS
