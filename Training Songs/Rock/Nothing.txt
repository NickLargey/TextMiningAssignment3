Nothing
And nothing's where you're at
When you ain't got something
You'll never get it back
It's coming on like a drug
The universal power of one
But it don't mean nothing
If it all comes undone

Fly away
If you fly away
You might die today
If you fly
If you fly

Give me some love
Give me some skin
If we ain't got that
Then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing

Give me some love
Give me some skin
If we ain't got that
Then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing

You're left with nothing
And nothing's what you got
When you ain't got no-one, no-one
You could've had the lot
And if it's over today
You'll never get that thing you had together, 
No way
You only get it once

Fly away
If you fly
If you fly

Give me some love
Give me some skin
If we ain't got that
Then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing

Give me some love
Give me some skin
If we ain't got that
Then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing

We ain't got nothing
We ain't got nothing
Our days are numbered
I don't remember how you found it
You will never feel the same
And forever have to take it for granted,
Don't remember our mistake

So give me some love
So give me some skin
If we ain't got that,
Then we ain't got much,
And we ain't got nothing, nothing 

Give me some love
So give me some skin
If we ain't got that
Then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing

Give me some love
So give me some skin
If we ain't got that
Then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing

So give me some love
So give me some skin
If we ain't got that
Then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing

Give me some love
So give me some skin
If we ain't got that
Then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing
