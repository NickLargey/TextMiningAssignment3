With my head against the window
Seal the letter which I did not sign
Should I wait for you for one last time 

There's no end and no beginning
Every word comes like a silent scream
She told all the things I did not see 

How could I know 
That she would lift me up to let me down
How could I know 
That you are all that really matters now
How could I know 
That forever wasn't quite so long 

So where do I go now
Where do I go yeah, now
Where do I go yeah 

She says nothing's everlasting
I'm so confused, I don't know what to do
What to say
I'll forgive you but I can not stay 

How could I know 
I thought you'd wait for me but I was wrong
How could I know 
That you are all that really matters now
How could I know 
That forever wasn't quite so long 

So where do I go now
Where do I go yeah, yeah
Where do I go, yeah

Oh ooh yeah eh yeah

Oh yeah
So where do I go now
Where do I go yeah yeah
Where do I go yeah
I said where do I go yeah go yeah go ooh oh

Where do I go now
I said where do I go yeah baby yeah come on now
Where do I go yeah

Oh She says nothings everlasting 

She says nothing's everlasting
