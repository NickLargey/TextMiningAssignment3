The story goes, the truth is no one knows
A stranger came
A man who lost his name
At night he tells his tale
Prison, women, wail
They took him in, he let them win
Over and over

He said if you don't have good words to say
Don't wake me up until the Judgment Day
'Cause if nothing is the way it seems
Then this life is just a haunted dream
And all this love is just falling
Down through the years
And oh, I'd rather sleep

Wake me up on Judgment Day
Let me hear golden trumpets play
Give me life where nothing fails
Not a dream in a wishing well

A man in tattered clothes, crying all he knows
The darkness grows, that's how it goes
Over and over

He said I think of the beauty I've had
And all it does is make me feel so bad
First they make you think you're riding high
Then they toss you off in the sky
And all this life is just falling
Down through the years
And oh, I'd rather sleep

Wake me up on Judgment Day
Let me hear golden trumpets play
Give me life where nothing fails
Not a dream in a wishing well

Say a prayer for the stranger
Listen to the stranger

Wake me up on Judgment Day
Let me hear golden trumpets play
Give me life where nothing fails
Not a dream in a wishing well

Wake me up on Judgment Day
Let me hear golden trumpets play
Give me life where nothing fails
Not a dream in a wishing well

Wake me up 
Let me hear (let me hear, ooh)
Give me life (give me life, ooh) 
Not a dream in a wishing well

Wake me up on Judgment Day
Let me hear golden trumpets play (give me life)
Give me life where nothing fails (ooh)
Not a dream in a wishing well (woah, woah)

Wake me up on Judgment Day
Give me life 
Give me life where nothing fails (woah) 
Oh
Wake me up on Judgment Day
Give me life, give me life
Give me life, give me life
