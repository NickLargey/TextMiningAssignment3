Our ambition got cast aside
Thrown away when the batterys died
And you start to comprimise
Just to get to the other side

If you forget what your supposed to be

It doesnt seem like you mean it
I dont believe that you believe it
And it feels like running with your eyes closed
If you forget what your supposed to be

(Lets go see Raoul) For all the ones who
(Lets go see Raoul) Used to give a damn
(Lets go see Raoul)working all the time
