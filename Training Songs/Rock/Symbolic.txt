S - is for the sickness 
We create with each other

(Wh) why - is for the time 
That's spent with your brothers

M (e) - I'm contemplating
All the looks in the eyes

be	 (eating) - down the doors
With no place to hide

O (nly) living witness 
To what I fell inside

L (ooking) - past the last laugh
With no reason to cry

When you're from the outside
You've got to stay high
Could it make a difference
That's why you try

Easy come easy go
There's no in between
You're better off realizing
Do your own thing
Do this do that
They wan't you to sing
Gotta hold my own 
Don't live out their dream
Stand up beaten down
Strictly for your soul
You pave the way
They want control
Understand pay the man
It's not what it seems
Before you know it
You lose everything

Have you heard the one about 
The world coming down
I try to make it easy
Try and stay down
What does it mean
Where does it go
Try to make it easy 
Or my mind's going to blow
Do you get lost in reality
You've got to realize
It can't change me

This way that way
How does it go
It's got me thinking
Does it mean anything

Hey!....Is this Symbolic
