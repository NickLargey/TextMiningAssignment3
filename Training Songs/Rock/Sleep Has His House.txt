Have pity for the dead
Sleep has his house
[Repeated ad infinitum]

And so all of your suffering
And all of your pain
All of your pleasures
And all of your gain

All of your losses
All of your pastures
All of your plains
All of your fields
All of your bodies
All of your joys
All of your countries
All of your flags

And all of your waters
All of your tunnels
All of your worlds
All of your seahorses
All of your breasts
All of your beasts
All of your dustmotes
All of your colours
All of your troubles
All of your rains
All of your comets
All of your moons
All of your birds
All of your rents
All of your marvels
All of your winds

And all of your nothings
All of your everythings
All of your gods
All of your angels
All of your masters
All of your slaves
All of your islands
All of your waves
All of your machines
All of your dreams
All of your laws
All of your loves

And all of the dead
Have pity for the dead
And sleep has his house
Sleep has his house
Overwhelm me
Overwhelm me
Forever
Forever
Sleep has his house
