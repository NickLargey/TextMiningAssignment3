Everything happens
Don't look for patterns
You only perceive what you believe
You need only believe to believe

A map of illusion
Of this land of confusion
I saw the boy clad in leather
For ever and ever and ever

What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?

There's no turning back now
I'm under attack now
I don't need a mirror to see
Just what has happened to me

There's no contradiction
Between fact and fiction
I saw the skies open
And I heard the word spoken

What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?

What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?

Everything happens
Don't look for patterns
You only perceive what you believe
You need only believe and you'll believe

A map of illusion
Of this land of confusion
I see a boy clad in leather
For ever and ever and ever

There's no turning back now
I'm under attack now
I see the skies are open
And I hear the word spoken

You only perceive what you believe
You need only believe to believe

What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
