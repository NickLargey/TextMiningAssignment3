Drawn to a flame
She is far away
Out of reach
Will she burn her wings
I can only watch
Out of touch
Out of my mind

I wish I could tell
If she's alright
Feeling fine
It's lucky for me
I'm not a jealous man
Out of hand
Out of my mind

When this party's over
Over
I will loose her
To another

Get yourself someone
And then wave goodbye
Don't you cry
Go ahead break your heart
But don't fall apart
It's like saying goodbye
To friends for the first time
