When will the world 
See that we need Jesus? 
If we open our eyes 
We will all realize 
That He loves us 
When will the world 
See that we need Jesus? 
When our hearts are as one 
And believe that He's the Son of our God 

[Chorus] 
The Lord is our God 
And we shall never want 
The Lord is our God 
And we shall live forever 
When we share the love of Jesus 
See each other as He sees us 
Then His love will see us through 
His love will see us through 

When will the world 
See that we need Jesus? 
When sister and brother 
Love one another as one 
When will the world 
See that we need Jesus? 
Will we ever understand 
Jesus is the Son of man? 
We must live in the shadow of His love 

When will the world 
See that we need Jesus? 
If we open our eyes 
We will all realize 
That He loves us 
When will the world 
See that we need Jesus? 
When our hearts are as one 
And believe that He's the Son of our God 

When will the world 
See that we need Jesus? 
When sister and brother 
Love one another as one 
When will the world 
See that we need Jesus? 
Will we ever understand 
Jesus is the Son of man? 
We must live in the shadow of His love
