I wouldn't kill to win a war
I don't get what they do it for
It's all so terribly vague
I've seen the pictures from a thousand years of battle and I think
It's such a bore
I walk New Orleans with a knife
It might be hidden out of sight
But I'd be useless if they jumped
I'm really not the killing type
I'm not the killing type
I'm not the killing type
I'm not I'm not
I'm not the killing type
I've got a picture of your mom
Before the war when she was young
She's got an etching to the right
I think it's funny that she's looking to the left
And it's a sign
I wouldn't kill to get you back
I've officially been asked
I couldn't kill to save a life
I'd rather die in peace (?)

I'm not the killing type
I'm not the killing type
I'm not I'm not
I'm not the killing type
I'm not
I would kill to make you feel
I don't mean kill someone for real
I couldn't do that, it is wrong
But I can say it in a song
A song a song

And I'm saying it now
And I'm saying it so
Even if you never hear this song, someone else will know
I'm saying it now
I'm saying it so
Even if you never hear this song, someone else will know

I just can't explain how good it feels
