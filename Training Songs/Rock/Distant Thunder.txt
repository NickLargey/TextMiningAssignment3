Every morning I wake up
And I switch the TV on
I like to watch the world go by
From the safety of my home
News is looking bad today
Like it always seems to be
I can't believe I'm so unmoved
By the violence that I see

It's a fact of life
But I can't cry anymore
'Cos it happens all the time

I hear the sound of distant thunder
It's coming closer every day
Soon there'll be lighting crashing to the ground
Feels like the end's not far away

As we race towards the future
We're not learning from the past
From the minefields of excess
You can hear the devil laugh
He can see what's going on
'Cos he knows the signs so well
It won't be long before we meet
On the road that leads to hell

In the wink of an eye
A hundred years will pass
So there's no time left to lie

I hear the sound of distant thunder
It's coming closer every day
Soon there'll be lighting crashing to the ground
Feels like the end's not far away
