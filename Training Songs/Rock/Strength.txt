Baby, baby I really need you
Give me the strength to continue

I woke up on a perfect day but
There's nothing worse than being alone
Thought I must get somebody to save me
With a kick in the brain
And she wants to leave home

The sex and the parties
The way that we act
We wanted to change the world
We can throw away all the rules we despise
Lift up your lonely heart

Because because because 
I get my strength from you
(and it's driving me crazy)
Because because because
I get my strength from you
(and it's driving me crazy)
Yes I do
(come on and help me then, baby)

From the cradle to the grave
My sweetheart and me will exist in between
Send messages in pressed leaves
Dressed up dance dance
We'll set ourselves free

We'll be just like Bonnie and Clyde
With love and hate on our hands
Anyone who knows what love 
Is like will understand

What is this strange feeling
Is it insecurity?
We say we hate each other sometimes
But I'll keep trying if you'll keep trying
And underneath the tears I can see
The way you're looking at me
Yeah, and I can dig that

Walk it on! Yeah, yeah
Doo, doo, doo
Yeah, yeah

Because because because
I get my strength from you
(and it's driving me crazy)
Because because because
Because because because
Because because because
I get my strength from you
Yes, I do

Oh baby I really need you
Give me the strength to continue
Oh baby I really need you
Give me the strength to continue

What's becoming broken hearted
Nothing can stop us until we're parted
What's becoming broken-hearted
Nothing can stop us now
