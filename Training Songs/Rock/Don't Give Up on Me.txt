Don't give up on me tonight
We've come this far
We've made good time
And all the light of the world is somewhere else
The morning light the faded stars
The more I make it better
And everyday I find I'm someone else
Everyday I get closer to myself
You can ride it for forever
The more I find I don't know
Go as far as you can see
But don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
You can drive it to wherever
Do whatever makes you free
Don't give up on me
But don't give up on me
Got around and shot of course
And what I found was here before
And all the time was time, that I just spent
And everyday I get closer to myself
And the more I make it better
You can ride it for forever
Go as far as you can see
The more I find I don't know
But don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
You can drive it to wherever
Don't give up on me
Do whatever makes you free
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
You can drive it to wherever
Go as far as you can see
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
You can ride it to wherever
Do whatever makes you free
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
