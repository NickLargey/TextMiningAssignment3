At last we meet again, dear god
When the angels sing
The funeral's are nicer, when we know you're there
And the angels sing
Sometimes I try so hard to understand the things you do
Who am I to question you when it all comes down
Hear the angels sing

Stand up strong feel the pain
When the angels sing
Love and death don't mean a thing 
Till the angels sing

The prisoners pray when they're on death row
When the angels sing
The junkie cries for love, but its all run out
When the angels sing
The sins of the world, and its cold on the streets and you're all alone
And the tears they start to fall when it all comes down
Hear the angels sing

Stand up strong feel the pain
When the angels sing
Love and death don't mean a thing 
Till the angels sing

Little by little, day by day
Watch the children play
Cause life and death don't mean a thing
Till the angels sing

When the angel of death, comes a looking for me
Hear the angels sing
I hope I was everything I was supposed to be
When the angels sing
There's gotta be a heaven, cause I've already done my time in hell
And a little babies bawl, when it all comes down
Hear the angels sing

Little by little, day by day
Watch the children play
Cause life and death don't mean a thing
Till the angels sing
