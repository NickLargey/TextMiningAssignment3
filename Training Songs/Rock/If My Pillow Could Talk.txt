If my pillow could talk
If my pillow could talk

If my pillow could talk
It would tell you 'bout
My sleepless nights
(My sleepless nights)

Tell you 'bout the rivers I cried
Ever since you said goodbye
(Since you said goodbye)

If we just could have talked it over
Before you ever put me down
(Oh, you put me down)
You know I love you much too much
To think about you running around

If my pillow could talk to you
(Yeah, yeah)
Know how much I miss your kiss
(Yeah, yeah)

It would tell you how much
I toss and I turn
Waiting for you, darling, to return

Yes, my pillow could tell you too
Not one word they said was true
If my pillow could talk to you
(Could talk to you)

If my pillow could talk to you
(Yeah, yeah)
Know how much I miss your kiss
(Yeah, yeah)

It would tell you how much
I toss and I turn
Waiting for you, darling, to return

Yes, my pillow could tell you too
Not one word they said was true
If my pillow could talk to you
(Could talk to you)

If my pillow could talk to you
(Could talk to you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If my pillow could talk to you
(Could talk to you)
If my pillow could talk to you
