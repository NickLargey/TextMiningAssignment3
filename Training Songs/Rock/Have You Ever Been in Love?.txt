In the morning light
Half awake and half asleep
Have you ever lain there thinking
Was it all in a dream?
But you reach out and she`s there
Every moment everywhere
Have you ever been in love?

Have you ever felt how far a heart can fall?
Have you ever stayed up waiting for a telephone call?
Just to hear her say hello
'cause you miss each other so
Have you ever been in love?

Have there been times to laugh
And times you really want to cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'cause you`d die a little if she lied
When in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out?
But still she leaves you wondering what it`s all about

When she`s far away, you ever felt the need to stray?
And tried and then discovered it just doesn`t pay
And with her you can be true
For with her you can be you
Have you ever been in love?

Have there been times to laugh
And times you really want to cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'cause you`d die a little if she lied
When in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out?
But still she leaves you wondering what it`s all about

And When in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out?
And still she leaves you wondering what it`s all about

And when the night comes down
And you call this house a home
Do you dream you`re still together
And wake up alone?
Have you ever been in love the way that I`m in love?
Have you ever been in love?
