My eyes are telling me leave well enough alone
These boots are telling me keep walking
Another voice is saying, "Don't let go"
That's just my heart talking

It's always leading me where I do not belong
To doorways where I shouldn't be knockin'
Trying to pass itself off for a song
That's just my heart talking

It's talking
Sometimes I don't know what to say
Pretend to look the other way
Are you talking, are you talking to me?

It's talking
Sometimes I don't know what to say
Pretend to look the other way
Are you talking, are you talking to me?

Some people tell me eyes are windows of the soul
But eyes can be like empty sockets
Maybe you'd be better off alone
But that's just my heart talking

Still a voice is saying, "Don't let go"
That's just my heart talking
That's just my heart talking
