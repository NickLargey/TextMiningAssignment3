Have a little faith in me
There's no words for what I feel
You'll need a little time to see
Let me prove my love is real

Have a little faith in me
And I'll give it back to you
If I could only make you see
Then every dream would still come true

No matter who's to fight
We gotta hold on tight
I know, there's an answer to my prayer
Gotta feeling like I've never had before
And my love for you can open any door
Have a little faith

I could help you find your way
Cause I know you're not that strong
It isn't just a game we play
Oh, you'll believe before too long

I'll show ya how to love
And to rise above
I'll be every answer to your prayer
If you feel it like you've never felt before
Then all at once you can open any door
Have a little faith

Have a little faith in me
And I'll give it back to you
You'll need a little time to see
We can make the dream come true

No matter who's to fight
We gotta hold on tight
I know, there's an answer to my prayer
Gotta feeling like I've never had before
You know my love for you can open any door
A little faith
