verse 1: 
its not the way you walk., 
its not the way you hold your fork, 
its not the stupid things you say in bed when i come in your face. 
the way you hold a cigarette, 
the way you smile when you're wet, 
the way you make me cups of tea when i stay round at your place. 

chorus: 
its just the shoes you wear, 
its your shoes that turn me on, 
i dont choose to stare, 
so please dont get me wrong 

verse 2: 
i think your shoes can say alot, 
'bout who you are or who you're not 
so much more than gloves or coats or hats or glasses can, 
but when i see you out in heels, 
then i know your not for me. 
but the difference thing is your wearing ???
