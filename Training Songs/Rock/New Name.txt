You’re on the tip of a hungry tongue 
Your new name, a new name, a new name 
A name that I don’t know 
A key locked in the back of your throat 
A new name, a new name, a new name 
A name wanna know 
Go on, say it, then, c’mon, say it, now 
Who wasn’t thinking it all along? 
What a name, a new name, a little name 
A name I wanna know 
You want to hear me say it 
You want to solve a koan 
You want to hear it said aloud
