29 in Highgate, P.R. queen
So socially unattainable
Down the line in Balham Johnny's keen
Pursuing the unobtainable
I said 'Hey, you, up in the clouds
 She's spinning you like a circus wheel.'
By moonlight, scheming all his moves
Detectives at her heels
Sally, what's your game?
What are you trying to do?
Sally, I'm miles away
I can't take my eyes off you
Tea with the Princes, dinner with the stars
She's cool amongst High Society
Johnny takes her to a wimpey bar
And acts with perfect sobriety
I said 'Hey, you, up in the clouds
 She's spinning you like a circus wheel.'
Call the airforce, call the C.I.A.
She won't escape this time
Taking off for ten weeks on the Nile
The nights will be rich with mystery
Johnny's swimming with the crocodiles
But he's gonna teach her some history
I said 'Hey, you, up in the clouds
 She's spinning you like a circus wheel.'
He's in the gym, he's on the driving range
She won't escape this time
