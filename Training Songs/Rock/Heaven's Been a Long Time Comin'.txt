I made a mistake or two
Even played the perfect fool
I know how it feels to lose
Everything you put your heart into
I cried lonely tears in vain
Thought I'd never love again
But all the hurt that I've been through
Has only led me straight to you

[Chorus]
Heaven's been a long time coming
Yes, it has
Oh, but, baby, you were worth the wait
I wanna give you all my loving
For however long it takes

There were times I could not see
The answer right in front of me
Blinded by my selfish needs
Till I finally sang to the
I was lost without a prayer
The day you found me there
But now I'm living proof
Of what an angel's touch can do

Heaven's been a long time coming
Long time coming
Oh, but, baby, you were worth the wait
I finally put an end to all my running
Baby, lead me through that gate

Now listen to this
Look up, look up
Oh, the sky's the limit
With no more life without you in it
You're my love, my heart
My soul, my life; I can't live without you

[Chorus]

Heaven's been a long, long, long time coming
Oh, but, baby, you were worth the wait
I finally put an end to all, to all my running
So, baby, lead me through, lead me through, through that gate
