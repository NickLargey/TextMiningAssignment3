Then when you let it
You asked for nothing
Why don't you share it?
All of the time you live
There's something out there

Just want to know, how far to live on
This one will ever know in this town
And in the red room
At a distance

How would you know it?
You're the same when you're living
I don't know it
It won't be this

Just want to know, how far to live on
Just want to know, how far to I've on

All of the time you wait, there's someone out there
And no one can find all the red

How would you show it?
You can see through the red
I don't know it
It won't be this time
