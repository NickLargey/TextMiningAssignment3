We just want a bit of peace
And relative quiet
Just one batsman at the crease

If we could just buy it
We never wanted interruptions
Never want to run away

We just want some Summer's day
Lazin' in the backyard
All brow beaters go away

It's not much to ask
Never wanted intervention
Never want to run away

All God's children say
What did they say?
They just want heaven on a stick

All God's children say
What did they say?
They just want heaven on a stick

We don't need opinion sways
Nowhere to run
Just wanna see those blue green bays

Stand in the sun
Never wanted mediation
Never want to run away

We just wanted lotus eating
We just want to fish for cray
We never wanted intervention
We never want to run away
