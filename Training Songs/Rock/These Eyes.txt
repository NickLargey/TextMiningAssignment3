Finally
I get the chance to say these words to you
From me
I've got to find a way to live
To love again

Constantly
I get reminded of the pain, the truth
That hurts
Oh, how my heart believes that day
I laid her to rest

The darkest day, the longest night
I can't perceive it'll be all right now
But I've found a way
These eyes can't cry

I've seen it all before
My love is gone
I've got to find an open door

Patiently
I've been waiting for this time to fade
To end, yes
Well could I ever look to you
To fill this empty space

The darkest day, the longest night
I can't perceive it'll be all right now
But I've found a way
These eyes can't cry

I've seen it all before
My love's still gone
I've got to walk the lonely road
These eyes can't cry

I've seen it all before
My soul is gone
I've got to find an open door

We danced the nights away
Face to face and again we played
We thought we had it made but
I can't say, watch the flame
Burn, in turn to fade

These eyes can't cry
I've seen it all before
My love's still gone
I've got to walk that lonely road

These eyes can't cry
I've seen it all before
My soul is still gone
I've got to find an open door

These eyes
These eyes
My love
My love, my love

These eyes
No, they can't cry
I've seen it all before
My soul, my soul

I've got to find an open door
These eyes can't cry
