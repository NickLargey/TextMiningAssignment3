Northern wind
Chimney smoke
Love and pain
Joy and hope

These are the days of Christmas

Colored lights and mistle toe
Cinnamon and Nat King Cole
There's a miracle now
On 34th Street

At the airport families wait on queue
And they shout as the loved one comes in view
Well the kids are just happy
'Cause they're out of school

How wonderful life is, on Christmas

Sleigh bells and sing-a-longs
The snow falls on the lawn
There's a midnight mass
For a birthday

Hearin' tunes an laughter fill the room
You forget all the thoughts that have troubled you
Yeah I know times I hard
Somehow you'll make it through

How wonderful life is on Christmas

All is quiet, Holy night
To awaken, morning light
Let is shine
Let it fill our lives with light

Then as someone says
'Santa Claus was here'
One by one by the tree we all appear
Grandmother saved paper to use next year

How wonderful life is
How wonderful life is
How wonderful life is
On Christmas
On Christmas

Merry Christmas Eve

(At the airport families wait on queue)
Merry Christmas Eve
(As they smile and they cry as you fade from view)
Merry Christmas Eve

(Well, the folks are just happy 'cause they saw you)
Merry Christmas Eve
Merry Christmas Eve
Merry Christmas Eve

(How wonderful life is, how wonderful life is, how wonderful life is)
Merry Christmas Eve
