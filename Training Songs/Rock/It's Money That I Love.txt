I don't love the mountains
I don't love the sea
I don't love Jesus
He never done a thing for me
I ain't pretty like my sister
Or smart like my dad
Or good like my mama

It's money that I love
It's money that I love

They say that's money
Can't buy love in this world
But it'll get you a half-pound of cocaine
And a sixteen-year-old girl
And a great big long limousine
On a hot September night
Now that may not be love but it is all right

One, two
It's money that I love
Want to kiss you three, four (money)
It's money that I love (money)

Used to worry about the poor
But I don't worry anymore
Used to worry about the black man
Now, I don't worry about the black man
Used to worry
'Bout the starving children of India
You know what I say now about the starving children of India
I say, oh mama

It's money that I love (money)
It's money that I love (money)

It's money that I love, it's money that I love
It's money that I love

It's money that I love, it's money that I love
It's money that I love

It's money that I love
