You take a heart, you break a heart
You leave a heart that's true
You're undecided, what are you gonna do
You're undecided, now baby it's up to you
This makin' up, this breakin' up
Has gotten to be your game
You're undecided, what are you gonna do
You're undecided, now what are you gonna do

The faith is dead, you've been misled
And don't know what to do
You're undecided, what are you gonna do
You're undecided, now what are you gonna do
