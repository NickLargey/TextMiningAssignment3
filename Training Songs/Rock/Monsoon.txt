Were caught inside, I feel around you.
There's no more light, to pelt and melt our
Windows.

And I'll never drop the anchor,
If you'll never stop the rain

As she descends, her soldiers try to win
Me over.
I feel the sin, of feet washing my frosted
Windows.

And I'll never drop the anchor,
If you'll never stop the rain,
And we'll never have to feel 
Anything else again.

For once, in this scene, I can dream all the
Flowers in bloom.
This garden will stay here and hold me for
Sister moon.
The higher we fly her to worship the crying 
Monsoon.

Don't let it end.
My sin is just beginning.
I need you here.
I need you to help me.

And I'll never drop the anchor,
If you'll never stop the rain,
And we'll never have to feel, anyone else
Again. 
Now cry down, monsoon
