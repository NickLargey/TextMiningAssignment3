I've all I need and more
You hold the key for sure
If all I have is you
Then darling please be true

There's no time for looking back
Thanks for all your support
Slow down, all things must pass
Take your time, know the score

Tomorrow never knows
The winds of change must blow
I hibernate and sing
While gathering my wings

There's no time for looking back
Thanks for all your support
Slow down, all things must pass
Take your time, know the score

I've all I need and more
You hold the key

It's not goodbye
So dry your eyes
Come rain or shine
I've all I need and more (and more, and more, and more)
