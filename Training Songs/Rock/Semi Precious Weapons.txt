I can't pay my rent, but I'm fucking gorgeous
I got big lungs that could kill your chorus
If you want to try, you better come inside
I can't pay my rent but I'm fucking gorgeous

Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know

You can't
Because you don't.

I don't drink booze, because my heart's explosive
I gave up food because the shit's expensive (oh, oh.)
I know you want to be me, but baby it ain't easy 
I don't drink booze, because my heart's explosive

Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know

You can't
Because you don't.

Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know

I got a diamond in my pocket
And a gun in my purse
Bring semi precious weapons or you might get hurt.

Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know

I can't pay my rent, but I'm fucking gorgeous
