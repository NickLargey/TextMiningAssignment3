I try but I don't believe her
She lies, she's a deceiver
I might, I might just leave her be.
Alone in my apartment
Lights out, I'm in the dark again
I wait for someone to rescue me

To say to me
But if she throws her heart away
I'll be there on garbage day
To sift through what's left I guess
To sort through the loneliness

And I don't mind
No I don't mind
If all the neighbors can see me
I'll take whatever I can get
When I can get it
It's that easy
Oh believe me

I've known so long it's been on my mind
Full blown by now and I'm wasting time
I'll leave it all up to her to decide
She sighs and says she can't feel love
She tries but just can't conceive of
A life without so much pain inside
And if she throws her heart away
I'll be there on garbage day
To sift through what's left I guess
To sort through the loneliness

And I don't, no I don't mind
If all the neighbors can see me
Yeah, I'll take whatever I can get
When I can get it

It's that easy
Oh believe me
It's that easy
So believe me
So easy
Oh believe me

It's so easy
And I know I won't see her here again
