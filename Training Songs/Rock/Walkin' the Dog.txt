Mary Mac, all dressed in black
Silver buttons up and down her back
Hi, Ho from tip to toe
She-a broke the needle now
And she can't sew

Walkin' the dog
Just a-walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog

Ask my mama for a-fifteen cent
To see the elephant jump the fence
It jumped so high, it touched the sky
And Didn't come back till the fourth of July

Walkin' the dog
Just a-walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk your dog

Mary Mary, quite contrary
How does your garden grow
With silver bells and itty bitty bitty white shells
And Pretty maids all in a row

Walkin' the dog
Just a-walkin' the dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
