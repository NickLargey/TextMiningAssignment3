Well, it took years to climb that hill
And now we look up to the mountains
As high as you might climb there still
Something we should not forget

It takes seconds to fall
Seconds to fall

Could happen that you can scratch the clouds
Could happen that you come tumbling down
Could be you find yourself at the top of the stairs
Could be you're just another clown

It takes seconds to fall, yeah
Seconds to fall
Seconds to fall, oh yeah

At the top of the stairs, nobody cares
What has been or what will come
I don't want to preach, no, I'm not the one
But you better hear me call

It takes seconds to fall, yeah
Seconds to fall
Seconds to fall
Seconds to fall
