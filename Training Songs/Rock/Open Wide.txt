Are you hungry?
Or is your conscience full?
Does it make, you, lonely?
To have these shoes to fill

Open Wide and remember
All the shit they feed you
What's the point in believing
All the lies they feed you?
From your thoughts of submission
Blow you into slumber
Sleepy eyes can not see

Are we growing?
Or are we caving in?
With the smoke, your, blowing
Damaging my skin

Sleepy eyes can not see
