I wish I weren’t in New York City
Fly me back home to Canada
In the country
I would trade all of your money
To be free from you, you’re a soul-breaker
And a friend-faker

And when I get to California
My life’s work grows away from my sound
And away from my heart
I would trade all my good fortune
To live off the land as a fruit-reaper
And a gatekeeper

To let in the wind and send in the light
And listen to nature nursing the night
Chanting the law, freeing the dove
Finding the rhythm of peace in a world needing love

When I get back from Arizona
I’ll be ready to open my heart to you
If you want me to
I would trade all of my talents
To get through to you, you’re a last-chancer
And a street-dancer

To let in the wind and send in the light
And listen to nature nursing the night
Chanting the law, freeing the dove
Finding the rhythm of peace in a world needing love
