There's a little old place down south of La Grange 
Where the whiskey flows and the nights go on for days 
My home on the range 
There's a sultry queen set her sights on me 
Was the best damn thing that I ever seen oh ya 
She's Evangeline 

That preacher's daughter  she took off her leather dress 
She pulled me into sin and now I must confess 

She's a  

Sister  sister of pain 
She's a knock down  drag it out, lick it up do it again 

Such a sweet young thing took a bite out of me 
She spread her cards out for all the world to see oh ya 
I went willingly 
She walked me back to a darkened room 
Said this one's on me boy, 
I want to see you howl at the moon and I'm talkin' soon 

That night I saw the light I'd never seen before 
When I thought my time was up she said how 'bout a, a little more 

For the 

(Pre-Chorus) 


(Chorus) 

A sister, sister of pain 

Drop down, spread 'em out, open up it's only a game 


Suck your soul, make a blind man see 

With a touch of her hand, brings a devil out of me 

She held up a sign said have no fear 

We got liquor up front, and poker in the rear 


For the 

(Pre-Chorus)(Chorus) 

Yeah 


(Pre-Chorus) 

Yeah
