In the sky I see angels flying all over town
They've got names in their pockets
Of lovers lost and found
If I send you my angel
Would you send yours to me?
If our angels collide in the sky
You'll say it was meant to be...

...and days blank like they bleached them
And nights outline air like static on the phone
And you say that you feel them
But the words you picked so carefully
Keep coming out all wrong
So I'll write them in light
And I'll carve them in stone;
I was made for loving you
I was put on this sweet earth to
I was made to love you

in the air I hear gunfire
Going off in the hills
Clocks are ticking
The battle is nearing
I'm fending them off with these pills
If you're stuck on the front line
Would you charm your way out?
You might like the idea of the kill
But you don't know what dying's about...

...and days blank like they bleached them
And nights outline air like static on the phone
And you say that you feel them
But the words you picked so carefully
Keep coming out all wrong
So I'll write them in light
And I'll carve them in stone;
I was made for loving you
I was put on this sweet earth to
I was made to love you

in the sky I see angels flying all over town
They've got drugs in their pockets
To keep us on the ground
I won't send you my angel;
Angels only deceive
Spit the pills out
Feed fuel to your fear
And fly away with me

...and days blank like they bleached them
And nights outline air like static on the phone
And you say that you feel them
But the words you picked so carefully
Keep coming out all wrong
So I'll write them in light
And I'll carve them in stone;
I was made for loving you
I was put on this sweet earth to
I was made to love you
