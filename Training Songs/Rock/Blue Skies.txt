Blue skies and children keep you off my mind
Blue skies are stolen from us all
I can't believe how much you want to try
But what you want to try I want to try it all

Everywhere you take me takes me over far away
But only don't move me now
Don't lose me now
If there were no gods at all I know I'd probably fear them still but
Don't lose me now don't use me now 
Instinct oh my instinct I got all I want and all I want is you 

Blue skies and children keep you off my mind
Blue skies are stolen from us all
I can't believe how much you want to try
But what you want to try I want to try it all

To lose you to lose you now 
If that's the way you want it 
To use you to use you now 
Would break it all 'cause I found everything and everything in you 
Newly born 'cause I got all I want and all I want is you 

With the dark as vast as ever leaves you Driven to distraction only 
Don't move me now 
Don't lose me now 
All these pizza pop caresses 
I can loosen my blue collar in this sick descent from boy to man 
I've all I want and all I got is you 

Blue skies and children keep you off my mind
Blue skies are stolen from us all
I can't believe how much you want to try
But what you want to try I want to try it all
