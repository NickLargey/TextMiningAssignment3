It's a long way down from the high horse you're on
When you stumble and then you're thrown
The last time we saw him, he was out in the rain
Watching that train roll down the track
Now he's back in showbiz
Trying to make a comeback

We know that he's desperate
And we know that he's broke
He's the mystery guest we'll puncture
They told a young girl with a clipboard
"Just keep him amused"
"Whatever you do, don't tell him your name"
"Whatever you think, don't let him drink"
Under lime, under lime, under lime

He whistles out of tune
His words don't always rhyme
But we will be right back
We're almost out of time

Down a long corridor, he's trying to impress
He was helping a showgirl fasten up her dress
And the clock on the wall tick-tocked the time away
And the band starts to play

In the violent strip of an undressing room
She loosened his grip and started
Tell me your story if you feel so inclined
He was a mess, almost resigned
Though she could guess, I think you will find
She thought "Oh, you know, I wouldn't mind"

He asked her boyfriend's name
Then her whole family tree
She thought I can't believe
It's happening to me

And upset, said "Hey, Pet, would you kindly pass that pill"
And allow me to just dictate my dying will
And the clock on the wall tick-tocked the time away
And the band starts to play

Jimmie was dreaming as she uncrossed her legs
He shuttered his eyes discreetly
And he thought of a drummer and considered a snare
But the beat of his heart said, "Don't ever start"
His conscience was bare, it said "Don't even dare"
She's completely unaware

She forced a laugh or a sign
At every alibi
Once every crime was confessed
He buttoned up his vest

Said "Hey gal, you're a pal, you've really been a sport"
And you don't get a record if you never get caught
And the clock on the wall tick-tocked the time away
And the band starts to play

It's a long way down from that high horse you're on
It's a long way back, 'less you cover your track
Or you bury your crime
Under lime, under lime, under lime, under lime

It's a long way down from that high horse you're on
It's a long way back, 'less you cover your track
Or you bury your crime
Under lime, under lime, under lime, under lime

It's a long way down from that high horse you're on
It's a long way back, 'less you cover your track
'Cause you bury your crime
Under lime, under lime, under lime
