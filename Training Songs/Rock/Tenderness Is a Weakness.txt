She was always alone
Kept herself under lock and key
Just her sorrows for all to see
She would break up and cry for me
Throw her away
Blow the ash from the ashtray
Leave her alone to play
Leave her alone to pray

And now you wonder why
I put out the flame to die
I'll hold on to my mystery
Secrets that make up me
In what's real and fantasy

Tenderness is a weakness
It tears down your fortresses
Makes you easy access
Tenderness is a weakness
It makes you so vulnerable

He was always alone
Told me he liked it best that way
Just a victim of circumstance
Just a loser who'd lost his chance
Truth, love and lies
They were all and the same to him
But he'd never given in
To the ultimate sin

And now you wonder why
I put out the flame in my eyes
I'll hold on to my mystery
Secrets that make up me
In what's real and fantasy

Tenderness is a weakness
It tears down your fortresses
Makes you easy access (and I guess that)
Tenderness is a weakness
It makes you so vulnerable
To that sick dangerous feeling
We all know as love

I cried for you
I even lied for you
I died a thousand times for you
I committed endless crimes for you
I sold my soul to some Devil
To do with what he will
Now I'll lock up my heart
And throw away the key
Love have no part in my destiny
Love have no part in my destiny

And tenderness is a weakness
And tenderness is a weakness
Turns you into a quivering mess (and I guess that)
Tenderness is a weakness
Is a weakness

Tenderness is a weakness
Turns you into a quivering mess (and I guess that)
Tenderness is a weakness
Oh love stay away 
Stay away from me
