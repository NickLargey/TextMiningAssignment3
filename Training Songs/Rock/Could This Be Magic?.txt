Hey baby
Yea, yea, one, two, one, two, three, four

Out upon the islands on a cool summer night
Buddy, you don't got to hurry, take your time
What you need is on the menu and you get it tonight
Buddy, you got womens on your mind

Could this be magic? 
Or could this be love? 
Could this turn tragic? 
You know that magic often does

And I see lonely ships upon the water
(Better save the women and children first)
Sail away with someone's daughter
(Better save the women and children first)

I hear music on the landin', and there's laughter in the air
Just could be your boat is comin' in
Yea, you're leanin' back and your foot's tappin'
And you got your head right
There's a full moon out tonight, baby, let's begin

An' she said, could this be magic? 
Or could this be love? 
Oh, oh
An' I said, could this turn tragic? 
You know that magic often does

And I see lonely ships upon the water
(Better save the women and children first)
Sail away with someone's daughter
(Better save the women and children first)

(Edward, thank you)

And she says, could this be magic? 
Or could this be love? 
And  I say, could this turn tragic? 
You know that magic often does

And I see lonely ships upon the water
(Better save the women and children first)
Sail away with someone's daughter
(Better save the women and children first, yes)
