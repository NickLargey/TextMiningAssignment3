I'm having trouble sleeping
You're jumping in my bed
Twisting in my head
Leave me

I'm having touble breathing
You're sitting on my chest
I sure could use the rest
Leave me

It's you
Why's it always you and never me
Never dared to let my feelings free
Why's it always you and never me
Never cared too much for honesty

I'm having trouble sleeping
I'm thinking of what you said
Of all the tears being shed
Leave me

It's you
Why's it always you and never me
Never dared to let my feelings free
Why's it always you and never me
Never cared too much for honesty

It's you
Now and always you but never me
Never dared to let my feelings free
Why's it always you and never me
Never cared too much for honesty
