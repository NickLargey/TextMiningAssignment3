Do kittens die on Christmas?
Do monkeys like the zoo? 
Oh Ohh, I haven't got a clue, Oh whoa
Oh no, I haven't got a clue
Are salesman really tricky? 
Is gossip really true? 
Oh Ohh, I haven't got a clue
Oh no, I haven't got a clue
Whoao-hao
Take me high on your silent wings
And I swear I'll do anything for you
There's crack in Kansas City
And back in Katmandu
Oh Ohh, they haven't got a clue
Oh no, they haven't got a clue
Do they wear plaid in China? 
Or leather in Bombay? 
Oh Ohh, I really couldn't say
Oh no, I really couldn't say
Whoao-hao
Take me high on your silent wings
And I swear I'll do anything for you 
Make you smile, give you words to say
And I swear I'll give everything to you
There's 7 in the bedroom
And 20 in the hall
Who haven't got at all
Oh no, they haven't got at all
They're tearing up Virginia
And tearing down the mall
Ohh, they haven't got it all
Oh no, they haven't got it all
Whoao-hao
Take me high on your silent wings
And I swear I'll do everything for you
Make you shine give you diamond rings
Yea I swear I'd do anything for you
