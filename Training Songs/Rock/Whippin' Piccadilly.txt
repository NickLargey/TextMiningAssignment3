Once upon a time, not too long ago, we took a day out in manchester
We all fall down, there's not enough hours in our day
Played a bit of football, fell in to the union, barged our way to the toilet
With the kung fu king, there's not enough hours in our day

I remember seeing someone dressed in a suit looking like a lunatic
And we all fall down, there's not enough hours in our trip
Well, academy cartwheel's breakin' your hands
We got lovely posters for sale
And we all fall down, there's not enough hours in our day

We like lovin yeah, and the wine we share
We like lovin yeah, and the wine we share

Finally made our way back to the train, rolling in to sheffield tonight
And we all fall down, there's not enough hours in our life
So try and guess my weight and wait at the station
We're whippin picadilly tonight
And it all falls down, there not enought hours in our life

We like lovin yeah, and the wine we share
We like lovin yeah, and the wine we share
