What do you want from life 
To kidnap an heiress 
or threaten her with a knife 
What do you want from life 
To get cable TV 
and watch it every night 

There you sit 
a lump in your chair 
Where do you sleep 
and what do you wear 
when you're sleeping 

What do you want from life 
An Indian guru 
to show you the inner light 
What do you want from life 
a meaningless love affair 
with a girl that you met tonight 

How can you tell when you're doin' alright 
Does your bank account swell 
While you're dreaming at night 
How do know when you're really in love 
Do violins play when you're touching the one 
That you're loving 

What do you want from life 
Someone to love 
and somebody that you can trust 
What do you want from life 
To try and be happy 
while you do the nasty things 
you must 

Well, you can't have that, but if you're an American citizen you are entitled to: 
a heated kidney shaped pool, 
a microwave oven--don't watch the food cook, 
a Dyna-Gym--I'll personally demonstrate it in the privacy of your own home, 
a kingsize Titanic unsinkable Molly Brown waterbed with polybendum, 
a foolproof plan and an airtight alibi, 
real simulated Indian jewelry, 
a Gucci shoetree, 
a year's supply of antibiotics, 
a personally autographed picture of Randy Mantooth 
and Bob Dylan's new unlisted phone number, 
a beautifully restored 3rd Reich swizzle stick, 
Rosemary's baby, 
a dream date in kneepads with Paul Williams, 
a new Matador, 
a new mastadon, 
a Maverick, 
a Mustang, 
a Montego, 
a Merc Montclair, 
a Mark IV, 
a meteor, 
a Mercedes, 
an MG, 
or a Malibu, 
a Mort Moriarty, 
a Maserati, 
a Mac truck, 
a Mazda, 
a new Monza, 
or a moped, 
a Winnebago--Hell, a herd of Winnebago's we're giving 'em away, 
or how about a McCulloch chainsaw, 
a Las Vegas wedding, 
a Mexican divorce, 
a solid gold Kama Sutra coffee pot, 
or a baby's arm holding an apple?
