Graduated fool,that is what I am
For every time failed you
You're so beautiful
I just turned and walked away

I jingle with words tangle my tongue
Stammering stutters
So I wrote you this song to finally tell
What you've known all along
I love you

It was true devotion
Now these mixed emotions
Oh I did it again
I want you to forgive me
When the pain has faded we'll be laughing again
Believe in me

Graduated fool,I'm better than I am
For that is what you made me
Please hold back your tears
I didn't deserve you anyway
Believe in me
I still care for you
Believe me
Just believe in me
Believe me

When I kiss you face again
All these mixed emotions of pleasure and pain
I want you to forgive me
When the pain has faded
We'll be laughing again

Believe in me
You're so beautiful
Believe
Just believe in me
Believe me
