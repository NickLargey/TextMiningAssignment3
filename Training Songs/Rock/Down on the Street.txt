Uh
Aah
Ooh
Down on the street where the faces shine
Floatin' around, I'm a real low mind
See a pretty thing
Ain't no wall
See a pretty thing
It ain't no wall
No wall
No wall
No wall

Ooh

Yeah deep in the night, I'm lost in love
Yeah deep in the night, I'm lost in love
A thousand lighs
Look at you
A thousand lights
Look at you
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost, yeah
I'm lost
Lost, lost, lost

Ooh
Yeah
Yeah
Ooh, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low
Faces shine, real low mind
Real low mind
I'm a real low mind
Real low mind
