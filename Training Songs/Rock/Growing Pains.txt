I got tired of my present situation 
So I tried rollin' over the stone. 
Even tried to make a change of occupation 
But, my conscience wouldn't leave me alone
. 
You know, even the rich have their problems. 
I mean, you never quite get enough. 
So you drink it away, take it out on the kids. 
And all that funky stuff 

You got growing pains 
You gotta rearrange 
Got them growing pains, yeah. 
And lately my friends have been tellin' me that 
I'm changing way to fast. 

If there's one thing I don't want to do 
It's rely on my broken-down past. 
Because I hear the call of the wild 
And opportunity is leanin' on me 
And stuck in this town for the rest of my life 

Is one place I don't want to be. 
I got growing pains 
I gotta rearrange 
Got them growing pains, yeah. 
Growing pains, oh, yeah. 
Growing pains. 

Oh, how long do you gotta grow? 
Yeah, I don't want to grow any more. 
Got them nasty old growing pains! 
 
Picked her up at seven 
Feeling pretty good by nine. 
We cruise the local hang-outs 
It's the same places every time 

Just head for the nearest party 
Or the darkest back street 
And I'm makin' love peepin' over my shoulder 
My pants down around my feet 

Gives me growing pains. 
I gotta rearrange 
Got them growing pains. 
Got them growing pains. 
Yeah, yeah, ow! 

Got them growing pains. 
Yeah! Uh! 
Growing pains 
Growing pains 
Growing pains 
Got them growing pains, yeah, ow! 
Growing pains 
Growing pains 
Growing pains.
