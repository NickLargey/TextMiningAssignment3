We came across the west sea
We didn't have much idea of the
Kind of climate waiting
We used our hands for guidance
Like the children of a preacher
Like a dry tree seeking water
Or a daughter
Nice 'n' sleazy
Nice 'n' sleazy does it

Nice 'n' sleazy
Nice 'n' sleazy
Does it does it
Does it every time
Nice 'n' sleazy
Nice 'n' sleazy
Does it does it
Does it every time
Nice 'n' sleazy does it

Nice 'n' sleazy
Nice 'n' sleazy
Does it does it
Does it every time
Nice 'n' sleazy
Nice 'n' sleazy
Does it does it
Does it every time
Nice 'n' sleazy does it

An angel came from outside
Had no halo had no father
With a coat of many colours
He spoke of brothers many
Wine and women song a plenty
He began to write a chapter
In history
Nice 'n' sleazy
Nice 'n' sleazy does it
Nice 'n' sleazy does it
Nice 'n' sleazy does it
Does it every time
