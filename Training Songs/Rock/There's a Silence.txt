I sit on the edge 
Always scared to look down 
I look away for a second 
I see we've shut ourselves in 
And I am aware 
There's a rift between us 
I can't think what it means 
I only you so why is it there 
And there's a silence when you walk into the room 
And i don't feel I'm in control, oh no... 
I sit on the edge, always scared to look down 
I look away for a second 
See we've shut ourselves in 
and I am aware of this rift between us 
Yeah, I can't think what it means 
I only ask you so why is it there? 
And there's a silence when you walk into the room 
And i don't feel I'm in control, oh no...(3x)
