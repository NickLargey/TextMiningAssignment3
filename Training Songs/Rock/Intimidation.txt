Can't you see there's fear on my face
But I won't run from you
That's right these are all my friends
Now what are you gonna do?
Go ahead and try to push us around
And we'll beat you, black & blue
Because we don't talk any shit
Especially from the likes of you, yeah you
Intimidation is your game
Well 2 can also play
From here on in the battle line's drawn
It's you who's gonna pay
You think you're right you think we're wrong?
Well time will surely tell
We'll never give in we'll keep on fighting
Gonna shove you back down your well, your well
