The writing's on the subway wall
I'm sorry that I never called
I, I never phoned
or wrote to you
It's silly 'cause
I wanted to

Oh yes, the subway wall
sadly seems to say it all
It's my mistake, I know that now
a bit too late to cry...

You're somewhere else
with someone else
and here am I, all by myself
An empty wall, and empty me
I write the things that should've been

I tell the world how much I care
and miss the one 
that isn't there
OH - The writing on the wall
OH - The writing on the wall 
OH - The writing on the wall 
OH - The writing on the wall....

The writing's on the subway wall 
and give or take a year or so
someone will come 
and rub it out
delete the words
that hurt my heart

Oh yes, there will remain
a little hurt, a little stain
the memory can still be read
upon the wall 
inside my head

OH - The writing on the wall
(right on)
Oh - The writing on the wall
OH - The writing on the wall 
(write on)
Oh - The writing on the wall 
OH - The writing on the wall....
