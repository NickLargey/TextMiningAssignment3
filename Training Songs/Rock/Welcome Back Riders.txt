I've seen my fair share of ghosts
But what scares me the most
Is seeing what's coming.
Growing older and giving up,
And I won't believe it. I won't believe it.
With sit-down strikes and gutters tonight,
There's nothing left in this town.
We've all been sold, it's not rock and roll.
Don't beat us when we're down.

It's OK.
You didn't even listen in the first place.
Welcome back riders, it's another rat race.
All of your words are safe until the show,
And soon the world's gonna know.

An empty promise, so here's a toast.
From your empty office, no lawyer will take it.
This case is as good as closed
And I can't believe it, I can't believe it.
Away for years, and now you're here,
So tell them where you've been.
Wait in line, enjoy the ride.
It's coming back again.

It's OK.
You didn't even listen in the first place.
Welcome back riders, it's another rat race.
All of your words are safe until the show,
And soon the world's gonna know.

These streets are the same to me.
These songs won't mean anything without a place to call our home.
A place to call our own.
I'm staying tonight.
