Nothing looks quiet the same
I see people and places in a new light again
There's a grace ascendant to a broken sky
Now I know, there's a reason why
I feel so alive

Cause tonight,there's a new love in town
Waking emotion, I thought I'd never find
Yes tonight how you turned it around
I wanna tell the whole world
There's a new love in town

It's been a strange kind of low
Always held my head up high
Little did I know
That my rose-tinted reality
Would soon fall apart
Just by holding you gently
There's a hope in my heart
I'm out of the dark

So tonight there's a new love in town
Waking emotion, I thought I'd never find
Yes tonight, how you turn it around
I want to tell the whole world
There's a new love in town

And everyone I met has made me what I am today
And every choice I made has led me here today
And every time I see your face
I find my way

Yes tonight there's a new love in town
It's waking emotions thought lord I never thought I'd find
Yes tonight how you turned it around
I wanna tell the whole world
There's a new love in town
There's a new love in town
