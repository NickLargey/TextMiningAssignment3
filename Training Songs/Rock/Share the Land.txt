Have you been around
Have you done your share o' comin' down
On different things that people do
Have you been aware
You got brothers and sisters who care
About what's gonna happen to you in a year from now

[Chorus:]
Maybe I'll be there to shake your hand
Maybe I'll be there to share the land
That they'll be givin' away
When we all live together
I'm talkin' 'bout together now

[Chorus]

Did you pay your dues
Did you read the news
This mornin' when the paper landed in your yard
Do you know their names
Can you play their games
Without losin' track and comin' down a bit too hard
Oh

[Chorus x3]

Maybe I'll be there to shake your hand
Maybe I'll be there to share the land
That they'll be givin' away
When we all live together
Together, together

(Shake your hand, share the land)
You know I'll be standin' by to help you if you're worried
(Shake your hand, share the land)
No more sadness, no more sorrow, and no more bad times
(Shake your hand, share the land)
Every day comin' sunshine, every day everybody laughin'
(Shake your hand, share the land)
Walkin' together by the river, walkin' together and laughin'
(Shake your hand, share the land)
Everybody singin' together, everybody singin' and laughin'
(Shake your hand, share the land)
Good times, good times, everybody walkin' by the river now
(Shake your hand, share the land)
Walkin', singin', talkin', smilin', laughin', diggin' each other
(Shake your hand, share the land)
Everybody happy together, I'll be there, don't worry, if you're needin' me
(Shake your hand, share the land)
Call on me, call on me, call my name, I'll be runnin' to help you
(Shake your hand, share the land)
Everybody walkin' by the river now, everybody, everybody laughin'
(Shake your hand, share the land)
Everybody singin' and talkin', smilin', laughin', diggin' each other
(Shake your hand, share the land)
