I'd burn for you
I'd burn for you 
You're like a lost freight train 
A 747 with no pilot at the reign 
Stay with me
And you can keep your fame
Jam it up a gear as I got to get away 
What do I know?
A six foot nun 
You got your silver bullets raise your god dam gun

Girl I can see your pain 
Standing on the corner trying to shelter from the rain 
Looking like you're interested so that the people think you're sane
I think I know your name 
Shit we think the same
This is not a game I play discreetly 
Even though if it does sound kind of creepy 
I'm ? when to leave you
So no one else, could get to you

Like a drunk Mark Twain 
Spitting out your venom with no fire in the flames
Stay with me
What do I know about pain? 
Did you stop to think this might be driving me insane?
Looking like you're innocent so that the people think you're playing

Get the early train 
Shit we think the same
This is not a game, this is not a game
This is not a game I play discreetly 
Even though if it does sound kind of creepy
I'm ? when to leave you
So no one else can get to you 

We can hear the rain come down secretly
Your looks got me kind of weak in the knees
I'd burn for you
I'd burn for you 
And you can keep your change
I wouldn't spend it anyway 
I wouldn't know where to start 

Girl I can see your pain 
Girl I can see your pain 
Think I know your name 
Shit we think the same
This is not a game I play discreetly
Even if it does sound kind of creepy 
I'm ? when to leave you 
So no one else can get to you

We can hear the rain come down secretly 
Your looks got me kind of weak in the knees
I'd burn for you
I'd burn for you
I'd burn for you
I'd burn for you
