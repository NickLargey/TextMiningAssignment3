Discos don't make much sense,
Maybe its me but I can't dance,
But that's allowed - 
'Cause I'm in time
And make sure, you leave a little space,
Maybe i`ll try to use some grace,
But that's allowed
'Cause I'm in time
Could you leave it?
I'm an imposter but I still try
Just to see all the disco lights
Better to tell before the attitudes change
And I'm there cause I can't
Dance alone,
'Cause I've tuned my radio,
And I choose to let it go
But I don't care.
Dance alone,
'Cause I'm lost when I am found
Lost when I've been found
But I don't care.
Now, its up to me
Everything is pumping can't you see?
I've been around - but that's ok.
Distance without any space,
Maybe I'm listening but I'm too late
But that's allowed - 
'Cause I can't wait.
(and I'm there cause I can't)
Dance alone,
'Cause I've tuned my radio,
And I choose to let it go
But I don't care.
Dance alone,
'Cause I'm lost when I am found
Lost when I've been found
But I don't care.
Discos don't make much sense,
