Live and un-drugged six years and countin'
Believer in Christ, yes, yes, the blessed fountain
Apologetic warrior, chalk one up for the visitors
Casting fierce some light into the shadows of midnight

To the underground we descend
With our whole generation to defend
Got a whole army on my case, got the devil in my face
'Cause that punk knows when is the end

Unite, ignite and spark a light to burn so bright
The sight will blind the blind of this our modern time

Oh yeah, I got a beef with the fence sitters
Tiers among the wheat, the cop outs, the quitters
Cut from the branch fruitless, no good
Only one use and that's firewood

Pay no mind to the generation line
Forsake your sect and be color blind
The problem's not Hollywood, the problem's not Washington
The problem's a weak divided church of schizoids Christians

Never going back the the darkness I was damned in
Now I turn my back on the place that I was found in
Flick a match on Babylon, burn baby burn
Raised my mind for all this time and now it's your turn

Got enough gasoline and plenty ol' matches
Finally I'm free and I shake off the ashes
From the city of refuse, I refuse to pay dues
To you, not me, and none of the free and the few
