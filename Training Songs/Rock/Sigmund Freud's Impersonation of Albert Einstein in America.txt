The world of science is my game
And Albert Einstein is my name
I was born in Germany
And I'm happy yo be
Here in the land of the brave and the free

In the year of nineteen five
Merely trying to survive
Took my knapsack in my hand
Caught a train for Switzerland

America America
God shed his grace on Thee
You have whipped the Filipino
Now you rule the Western Sea

Americans dream of gypsies, I have found
And gypsy knives and gypsy thighs
That pound and pound and pound and pound
And African appendages that almost reach the ground
And little boys playing baseball in the rain

America, America
Step out into the light
You're the best dream man has ever dreamed
And may all your Christmases be white
