Love you baby with all my might
God knows I tried to treat you right
Begging you baby let me be your slave
But please don't send me to an early grave

Well I can't understand, why did you let me go?
I've done all I could, I can't do much more

There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you
You want my life, you can have that too!
Please use my blood to mark my grave
Let the whole word know that I died your slave

Well I can't understand, why did you let me go?
I've done all I could, I can't do much more
Play brothers

I thought you loved you baby, I changed my life
Wanted you to be my woman and wife
Now bloodshot tears have blinded my eyes
I'm too weak to live, I'm too strong to die

Well I can't understand, why did you let me go?
I've done all I could, I can't do much more

I've done all I could, I can't do much more
I've done all I could, I can't do no more

Can't understand, you let me go, baby?
