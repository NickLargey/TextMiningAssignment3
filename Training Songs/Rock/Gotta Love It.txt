I know somewhere I'm there and on the mind
Somebody must have really hurt you bad
You do to others what's been done to you 
If you think that's right you must be mad
What ever happened to the innocence
You gotta tell me why

You get this look that I don't recognize
God only knows what you've become
What ever happened to the innocence
You gotta tell me why

You gotta love it, gotta leave it
You gotta have it but you really don't need it
Won't be happy 'til you think you know it all
You gotta love it, gotta leave it
Gotta have it but you really don't need it
One day the sky will fall

Night falls your off to finding company
Must really hate to be alone
You used to be so damn emotional
So what was it that turned your heart to stone?
What ever happened to the innocence
You gotta tell me why

You gotta love it, gotta leave it
You gotta have it but you really don't need it
Won't be happy 'til you think you know it all
You gotta love it, gotta leave it
Gotta have it but you really don't need it
One day the sky will fall

You gotta love it, gotta leave it
You gotta have it but you really don't need it
Won't be happy 'til you think you know it all
You gotta love it, gotta leave it
Gotta have it but you really don't need it
One day the sky will fall

You gotta love it, gotta leave it
You gotta have it but you really don't need it
Won't be happy 'til you think you know it all
You gotta love it, gotta leave it
Gotta have it but you really don't need it
Don't you think you might be heading for a fall
