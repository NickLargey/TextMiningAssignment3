There's a girl I know, she's the one I dream of
Look into her eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Yes I lose control, I can't seem to get enough whoa
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love?

Tell me how will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know if she really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
Falling in love is so bittersweet
I'm asking you 'cos you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy, can't speak
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, I wish I had you near me now whoa
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love

Ooh how will I know
Don't trust your feelings, how will I know?
How will I know?
Those things they can be deceiving
How will I know?
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
