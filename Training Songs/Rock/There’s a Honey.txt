Live in my heart if you want to
I know you hate it when I'm drunk
But, it's not easy
I wanna feel something different for once

I know my heart is killing you, killing you
I can't help it
'Cause I'm feeling you, feeling you
Oh, honey, please don't say you're gonna leave me
Honey, please don't say you're gonna leave me

I would give you my body
But I'm not sure that you want me
I'm not sure that you want me
I would give you my body
But I'm not sure that you want me
I'm not sure that you want me

I would give you my body
But I'm not sure that you want me
I'm not sure that you want me
I would give you my body
But I'm not sure that you want me
I'm not sure that you want me

Oh and you're not alright
'Cause I ruined your night
Well honey, that's what I'm good at
Now you're not in sight
'Cause I ruined your mind
Well honey, you knew I'd do that

I would give you my body
But I'm not sure that you want me
I'm not sure that you want me
I would give you my body
But I'm not sure that you want me
I'm not sure that you want me

And there's somebody that I know I'm bad for
And you see, I'd like to keep your heart for me
And there's somebody that I know I'm bad for
And I can't look away
I'm addicted to your face, you know

I would give you my body
But I'm not sure that you want me
I'm not sure that you want me
I would give you my body
But I'm not sure that you want me
I'm not sure that you want me
I would give you my body (There's somebody)
But I'm not sure that you want me (That I know I'm bad for)
I'm not sure that you want me (Bad for)
I would give you my body (There's somebody)
But I'm not sure that you want me (That I know I'm bad for)
I'm not sure that you want me (Bad for)
