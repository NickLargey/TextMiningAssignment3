What will they say to change our ways
When all we see, skies crying down
What do they say when the rain pours down
They see no sense at all
Oh waiting for the fall
Oh waiting for the fall
What will they say when you hide away
In their shelter
What will they say when they're left to pray 
All alone in the storm
Oooh waiting for the fall
Oooh waiting for the fall
See the change from day to night
Then you wanted to come back in
They never blessed you with everything that we know
It's when we'll need you back in through a door
Oh waiting for the fall
Oh waiting for the fall
