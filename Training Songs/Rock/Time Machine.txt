Baby baby, maybe we should get a way tonight
Baby baby, stayin' here so long, didn't feel right
I am so glad the space still owns the midnight flight

In the time machine
In the time machine

Long ago when we did decide to live our lives
We were young and blind
Did we know, searching through the years
What we found behind our lives

In the time machine
In the time machine

Can you take me where I want to go?
Can you show me what I want to know?

You and I cross the universe, behind the stars fly
We've changed our lives
Another show, another scene to play
Another truth to find between the lights of our lives

In the time machine
In the time machine
In the time machine
