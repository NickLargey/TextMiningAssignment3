You never close your eyes any more when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
Mmm, you're trying hard not to show it, baby
But baby, baby, I know it

You've lost that loving feeling
Ohh, that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, ooh, ahh, ohh, ohh

Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
Baby, you've started to criticize every, every, every little thing that I do
It makes me just feel like crying, baby
'Cause baby, something beautiful is dying

You've lost that loving feeling
Ohh, that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, ooh, ahh, ohh, ohh

Baby, baby, I'd get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me, love me like you used to do
You know that we had a love, a love
A love you don't find every day
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
So don't, don't, don't, don't, baby, don't throw it away

Na, na, don't throw it away, don't throw it away
Now baby, oh baby, I beg you, baby, oh baby
I beg you please, I need your love
So bring it on back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it, bring it, bring it back

Bring back that loving feeling, ooh, that loving feeling
Bring back that loving feeling
'Cause it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on no more

Oh baby, yeah baby, oh, bring it on back now, hey baby
I beg you baby, oh baby , bring it on back, bring it on back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back, bring back that loving feeling
Ohh, that loving feeling
