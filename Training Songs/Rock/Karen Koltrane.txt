Karen's moving out 
Out into the sky 
Karen trips on a cloud 
Sets down w stars in her eyes 
She's alone in a room 
She's deep inside of her mind 
Karen's leaving for the snow 
Somewhere to somewhere... blind 
She cut the silver lining in my soul 
I was tethered to her for a time 
Are we still together? 
Will she stay forever? 
(will she stay?... beside... 
Flashlight... Karen stay... etc.) 
A Love Supreme 
Karen, yr hanging on the line 
Wraps yr coat tight around 
Karen, yr eyes are on the prize 
I'll catch you on my way down
