Luke you wanna
Hey you wanna
Go out for a drive

Teen romance
In sonic
Hyperdrive

Tees and blues and
Bad tattoos
And nothing much to do

Drunken lips
Pronouncing
I love you

It was down by the river
That they laid her down
It was down by the river
That they laid her body down

Casanova
Oh king cobra
Down there by the sand

Luke was mad
And could not
Be a man

Yeah she's gone
Well she's gone
Ah she's gone
Gone gone gone gone

Junior high was
Not surprised
Why (you in?) lies the bones

Life goes on but
Luke hangs
All alone
