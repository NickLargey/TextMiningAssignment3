Oh here I am, looking back again, at the road that led to you
Oh the time's alright, tryin' to save myself from looking out at you
I walk alone, while you are waiting, but somehow you saw through me
And now I'm standing at your door, you're the only one I need

It takes two, two hearts that beat together, to make it feel like one
Body and soul surrender, when love has just begun
It takes two, it takes two

I've been blinded by this fear inside that love is just a game
You distract yourself with someone else, and both havin' travelled in pain
Bow now I see the road I've taken, will lead me to nothing more
Than empty rooms without your love, girl, I'm standing at your door

It takes two, two hearts that beat together, to make it feel like one
Body and soul surrender, when love has just begun
It takes two, it takes two
Oho

[Instrumental]

I walk alone while you are waiting, I know where I'm wanting to be
So now I'm standing at your door, you're the only one I need
It takes two, two hearts that beat together, to make it feel like one
Oh one life with you, one life with you

It takes two, two hearts that beat together, to make it feel like one
Body and soul surrender, when love has just begun
It takes two, it takes two
