What's on your head this time
What's under your door
Speak to me slowly
Why don't you swim back to the shore

He needs to run, he needs to run
He needs to run and stumble home
It's bound on, It's bound on
It's bound to be something he said when we were young again

I know, I know, I know it's ending

Once in awhile I can see the stars
Once in a day I can't fight the land
I could never hope to find it

I said my goodbyes to you
I saw you were red
Curse like a sailor
Why don't you stay in bed

He needs to run, he needs to run
He needs to run and stumble home
It's bound on, it's bound on
It's bound to be something he said when we were young again

I know, I know, I know it's ending

Smile all the way
Need a hand to muscle through
Smile all the way
Need a hand to muscle through
Needed more hands to make things right
Needed more hands to make things right
I sing your praises now, I know you are gone
Voice like an angel, maybe it's time to move along

He needs to run, he needs to run
He needs to run and stumble home
It's bound on, it's bound on
It's bound to be something he said when we were young again

I know, I know, I know it's ending
