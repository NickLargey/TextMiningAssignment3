Well you keep
Coming back
Like a cat you find
Your way back in
Tell me how
Help me out
Wanna make you go

Away again
This is the end it’s
Over over
How many ways can I
Say no more
I say goodbye
And you say see you tomorrow
I shut the door

And you find yourself a window
You wanna be the last
Man standing
How do you keep on
Landing
On your feet
Just when I think

I’m alone you’re
Sneaking up on me
Well I can’t shake you
Off
Cause you got your
Claws in way too deep
You’re out of lives
It’s over over
Used up your nine and
Now there’s no more
I say goodbye
And you say see you
Tomorrow

I shut the door
And you find yourself a window
You wanna be the last
Man standing
How do you keep on
Landing
(Landing)
So you’re the hunter
I’m the prey
And you think I won’t
Get away
But one day I’ll be
Gone and you’ll be
Stray
Well you keep
Coming back
Like a cat you find
Your way back in
I say goodbye
And you say see you
Tomorrow

I shut the door
And you find yourself a window
You wanna be the last
Man standing
How do you keep on
Landing
(Landing)
I say goodbye
And you say see you
Tomorrow

I shut the door
And you find yourself a window
You wanna be the last
Man standing
How do you keep on
Landing
(Landing)
I say goodbye
Last man standing
Last man standing
Last man standing
I say goodbye
And you say see you
Tomorrow

I shut the door
And you find yourself a window
You wanna be the last
Man standing
How do you keep on
Landing
On your feet
