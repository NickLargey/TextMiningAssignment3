Goin' away baby
Won't be back no more
Goin' back down south, child
Don't you want to go?
Woman I'm troubled, worried all in my mind
I can't be satisfied
But I just can't keep from cryin'

I feel like snappin'
Pistol in your face
Stone cold graveyard
Gonna be your resting place
Woman I'm troubled, worried all in my mind
I can't never be satisfied
But I just can't keep from cryin'

All in my sleep
Hear my doorbell ring
Looking for my baby
Ain't seen a  doggone thing
Woman I was troubled, worried all in my mind
I can't never be satisfied
But I just can't keep from cryin'

Well I know my baby
She gonna jump and shout
That old train be late man,
And I come walking out
Woman I'm troubled, worried all in my mind
I can't never be satisfied
But I just can't keep from cryin'
