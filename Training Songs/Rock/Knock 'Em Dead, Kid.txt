I know where you been lately
Standin' all alone on the line
Don't worry, it doesn't pay to worry
You're gonna knock 'em dead this time

Knock 'em dead, kid
Go ahead, kid
Take a shot, kid
Take a shot with all you got, kid
Knock 'em dead

I can see you've been shaken
And I know you must be afraid
Take it easy, you've earned your right to "easy"
Look at all the dues you've paid

Knock 'em dead, kid
Go ahead, kid
Take a shot, kid
Take a shot with all you got, kid

tombstoneI know what you've bin' thinkin'
There's nothin' in the world that you can't do
Don't worry, it doesn't pay to worry
Let that heart of yours shine through

Knock 'em dead, kid
Go ahead, kid
Take a shot, kid
Take a shot with all you got, kid
