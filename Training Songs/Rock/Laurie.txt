Once I saw the most beautiful girl
Sitting next to me
I asked her what was her name
She said it was 'Laurie'

She worked at the store and I opened that door
Just to see her face
She always made me feel at home
I never felt out of place

 

But she already had a boyfriend

An undertaker was he

And they got married

And had a little baby

 

I became obsessed with death, my friend

Certain that it would happen to me

And I would be in the hands

Of my dear Laurie

 

I can't explain such love aflame

I overcame victorious

Filled my heart with such desire

So grand and so glorious

 

Laurie, sweet, an angel dear

Is here with me today

Not a person, but a memory

With me will always stay.
