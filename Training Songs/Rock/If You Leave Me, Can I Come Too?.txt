Words were exchanged last night
You could call it a fight
It's such a shame I never thought we would,
Wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't so good
I've had enough of that,
Other loves in days gone by.
It wasn't much I know,
Just enough, enough to make me cry

Chorus

If you leave me, can I come too?
We can always stay
But if you leave me, can I come too?
And if you go, can I come too?

Don't let it happen again
'cause that I couldn't take, once was quite enough
It's easy to forgive, harder to forget

Chorus
