Somewhere in the night
Fell in love with you
Wandered through my dreams
And you stole away my blues
All of a sudden a random feeling
Opened up inside
And I don't know where jump through the
Or make my darling cry

Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day
Am I still dreaming
Is it supposed to feel this way
Running around with a foolish grin
Painted all over my face
Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day

Used to run around
In no particular direction
I ran across a lot of pretty women
But I couldn't make a connection
Light night when you held me tight
You turned my life around
And I opened up my eyes this morning
Said, "look what I found"

Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day
Am I still dreaming
Is it supposed to feel this way
Running around with a foolish grin
Painted all over my face
Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day

Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day
Am I still dreaming
Is it supposed to feel this way
Running around with a foolish grin
Painted all over my face
Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day

Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day
Am I still dreaming
Is it supposed to feel this way
Running around with a foolish grin
Painted all over my face
Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day
