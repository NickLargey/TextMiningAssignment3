She don't know where I came from
I'm feeling like I'm half-alive
She don't know and I don't care
Two of us are scared to laugh

What a waste of Saturday
My eyes shut tight
I lie awake all night

We both know the flashing lights
The neon flicker and buzz
We both know the night's swirling blurs
I just can't place the face
