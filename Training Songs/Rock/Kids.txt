We're the ones that'll rule the world
That's how it will be!
Yea that's us! we're the kids
The damn kids of USA

Yea kids
Our time is alive still you don't seem to recognize
You can't be telling to us what to do
What you seem to do again
We're sick of all your bullet plans
Your wake it hasn't broken through

You don't even know yourself
Don't you go judge me
You don't even know yourself
Your eyes are blind now can't you see that

To those telling us how to live our lives
Seem to forget we're swarming flies
And we're here living
On the so called land of the free!

You don't even know yourself
Don't you go judge me
You don't even know yourself
Your eyes are blind now can't you see that

Kids!!
