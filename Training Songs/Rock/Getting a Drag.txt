Could it be? Is it true? 
Was it me? Was it you? 
Because I thought you were a brother 
But you turned out like my mother 
And it's getting a drag 

I was sure, I was wrong 
But before very long 
I found that I had kissed a mister 
Just as pretty as my sister 
And it's getting a drag 

Bye bye, don't cry 
My, my, have I been had 
So sad, too bad 
It's getting a drag 

Who am I? Who are you? 
What am I gonna do? 
Most people make up when they break up 
But we break up ''cause you make up 
And it's getting a drag 

Bye bye, don't cry 
My, my have I been had 
So sad, too bad 
It's getting a drag 

Could it be? Is it true? 
Was it me? Was it you? 
Because I thought you were a brother 
But you turned out like my mother 
And it's getting a drag 

So sad, but it's getting a drag 
So sad, but it's getting a drag 
You let the cat out the bag 
Heh, heh, heh, heh 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
