I work my fingers to the bone
And you know I'm slippin' down so low
Getting' down on my knees
Prayin' for release
Lord, won't you help me

And I feel the weight
Draggin' down on me
There's redemption commin'
That I seek
I can't close my eyes
Close my eyes to see
This is what it means to bleed
For what you love
So let me bleed

So I lay my burden down
