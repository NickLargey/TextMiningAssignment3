And voices louder now
Not loud enough
The world around you crawls
And sleeps in other beds
And never mind
I see no time 
And there's not time enough
To burn it all away
I see no hands to hold
No faith to praise
No celebration no parade
Should god forget you
And all their faces say
There's nothing owed
There's nothing owed you
It gets too dark
It gets much darker now
Your lies around you fall
On all your plans
On all your wasted time
You watching second hands
Make second hand
And faith's for those who pray
But all your tears are gone
And thrown away
And there's no cause to take his place
Should god forget you
And all their faces say
There's nothing owed
There's nothing owed you
I see no time 
And there's not time enough
To burn it all away
I see no hands to hold
No faith to praise
And voices louder now
Not loud enough
The world around you crawls
And sleeps in other beds
And never mind
No celebration no parade
Should god forget you
And all their faces say
There's nothing owed
There's nothing owed you
And there's no cause to take his place
Should god forget you
And all their faces say
There's nothing owed
There's nothing owed you
