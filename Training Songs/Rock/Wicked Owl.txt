I think i'm gonna be sad
'Cause all I show you
Is a man thats only going bad
Come on stay by my side
See the wicked in me
Tell me will it make you say
Who is this at my door?
I dont know what your looking for
Please remain by my side
Tell me tell me absolutely anything you like

I dont want to cause a fuss
Look whats eating me

Its just the person I am 
Its just the person I am 
Its just the person I am 
Its just the person I am 

Look what you tell me

But oh i know who you are
And if I ever get through this
I'll never stop watching from afar
Why dont you come see me owl?
You turn my insides out
You turn my insides out
You wicked owl

Oh i dont want to cause a fuss
But I already have

Look what you tell me

Its just the person I am (x9)

Look what you tell me
Look what you tell me
Look what you tell me
