Fare you well on the morrow I must leave
And I'm bound for a far and distant land
A tale would tell of my poor heart and how it grieves
So for you my love this sorrowful Pavan

(Chorus:)
I was born in Lincoln country
And the son of a country wife am I
Out of all the flowers growing wild in yon forest
You're the fairest rose on which I've laid an eye

Love me hard with the dawn I'll be gone
And I don't know if I'll be back again
God as my guard I'm the champion of the wronged

Off to holy wars to fight the Saracen

I was born in Lincoln country
And the son of a country wife am I
Out of all the flowers growing wild in yon forest
You're the fairest rose on which I've laid an eye

While you're away does your spouse turn a whore
Or a chastity belt maiden while crusader's at war
I'm tired of my chain mail
My armour makes me sore
And it all seems so futile

Weep you will but my love I cannot stay
Dry your eyes and we'll share a parting kiss
Wait until the advent of that day
When I'm home and gone is sadness as this

I was born in Lincoln country
And the son of a country wife am I
Out of all the flowers growing wild in yon forest
You're the fairest rose on which I've laid an eye
