Woke up in my head
Good times never end
With bad back to bend
Close my eyes just in time
Hands that I won't shake
Bones that I can't break
It takes time to change
Fall in line, one more time

Louise, it's me
I'm a dead man walking down your street
Louise, it's me
I'm a dead man walking down your street

Climbing up your walls (I'm not your acrobat)
Diggin' in your holes (I'm not your sewer rat)
Falling down your stairs
Pull my light one more time

Louise, it's me
I'm a dead man walking down your street
Louise, it's me
I'm a dead man walking down your street

Louise, it's me
I'm a dead man walking down your street
Louise, it's me
I'm a dead man walking down your street
Louise, it's me
I'm a dead man walking down your street
Louise, it's me
I'm a dead man walking down your street

It takes time to change
