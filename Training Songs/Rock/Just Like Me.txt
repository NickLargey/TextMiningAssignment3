Future's now
Here today
Man has gone and found a way
Now knows how to replicate
Double helix DNA

Clone me once, clone me twice
Make me over, damn the price
Build another from my seed
Build another just like me

In my image...Just Like Me
In my image...Just Like Me

Frankenstein set the pace
Hitler's dream - master race
Gene mutation, sacrifice
Test-tube babies pay the price

Science lives to serve mankind
Unlock secrets in our time
Is it right? Is it wrong?
Who's to tell us what goes on?

In my image...Just Like Me
