Oww
Cat's droolin' on the bar stool
Shake your hips and crack your whips
Cheap seventeen and trashed out
You went too far, been a bitch you are

Your reputation's in the bathroom
It's on the wall and down the hall
I hear you're cheatin' with my teacher
After school, tell me what you do?

When you know
You always get the boys you like
Play nice then stick them with your knife
Take off your insecure disguise

Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs?
Is that you?
(Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs?)
Is that you, lookin' half way dead?

Write on the mirror with your lipstick
Much too vain, got scattered brains
You used me just enough to get off
Act your age, get off your stage

When you know
You always get the boys you like
Play nice then stick them with your knife
Take off your insecure disguise

Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs?
Is that you?
(Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs?)
Is that you, lookin' half way dead?
Is that you?
(Is that you, lookin' half way dead?)
Is that you, with your long black hair?
Oww

You always get the boys you like
Play nice then stick them with your knife
You always get the boys you like
Play nice then stick them with your knife
Take off your insecure disguise

Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs?
Is that you?
(Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs?)
Is that you, lookin' half way dead?
Is that you?
(Is that you, lookin' half way dead?)
Is that you with your long black hair ?
(Is that you?)

Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs?
(Is that you?)
Is that you?
(Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs?)
Oh Baby
Is that you, lookin' half way dead?
(Is that you?)
Is that you?
(Is that you, lookin' half way dead?)
Oh Baby
Is that you with your long black hair ?
(Is that you?)
Is that you?
(Is that you with your long black hair ?)
Oh Baby, is that you?
(Is that you crawlin' up my stairs?)
Oh Baby, is that you?
(Is that you baby half way dead?)
Oh Baby, is that you?
