Running with my head down
Tripping on your straight-wire
It's time I took a look around
All my idols on fire

You don't talk about it
You don't talk about it
They don't talk about it

Crash like a speeding limousine
Twisted white metal and chrome
Hate is the bride of jealousy
And it means so much to me
'Cause it makes this home "Sweet Home"

You don't talk about it
You don't talk about it
They don't talk about it

Hope- like blood on velvet
Lost in transit
Open up your eyes, open up yourâ€¦

We don't talk about it
They don't talk about it
You don't talk about it
You don't talk about it
We don't talk about it
We don't talk about it
