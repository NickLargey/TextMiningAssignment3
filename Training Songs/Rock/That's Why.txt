This guys
Complaining from the pages of his life
He's making me believe he'd done alright
He's making me believe his was a lifetime
Then out of open spaces in my head
Creepy from the book that id just read
Did anybody hear what I just said?
Oh my
He's shy shy
Guess that's why
He's bye bye
The sigh
Escaping from the phrasing of each line
Is making me believe I've done it right
Its making me believe this is my lifetime chance
Then up from open pages still unread
Keep your empty chapter of regret
Did anybody hear what I just said?
