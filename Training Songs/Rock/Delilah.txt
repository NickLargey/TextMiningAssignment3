I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window
I saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind

She was my woman
As then she betrayed me, I watched and went out of my mind

My, my, my, Delilah
Why, why, why, Delilah
I could see that girl was no good to me
And just like a slave I was lost, and no man could free

And the next day when that man drove away, I was waiting
I crossed the street to her house, she opened the door

She stood there laughing
And I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more

My, my, my Delilah
Why, why, why Delilah
So before they come to break down the door
Forgive me Delilah I just couldn't take any more

She stood there laughing
And I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more

My, my, my, Delilah
Why, why, why, Delilah
So before they come to break down the door
Forgive me Delilah I just couldn't take any more

My, my, my, Delilah
Why, why, why, Delilah
So before they come to break down the door
Forgive me Delilah I just couldn't take any more
Forgive me Delilah I just couldn't take any more
