I just stood there watching you
As you took off my ring
Then you gently put it in my hand
I guess I knew there's someone else
You rather spend your life with
And you hoped that I would understand

So you put the ring in your pocket
I slowly turned to walk out the door
You were so much stronger
Than you've ever been before

[Chorus]
You put on the greatest show on earth
It was the greatest show on earth
But then I stopped dead in my tracks
And begged you to take me back

The next time that I saw you
You were waiting for a bus
I just happened to be passing by
When I said hello and every little thing
You said you'd be married and you lied

I guess you know that I've been keeping busy
I've been going out most every night
You were very happy
That my future looked so bright

[Chorus]

Yesterday I called to see
If we could meet somewhere
I've been thinking about you for some time
But soon as I walked in that place
Where we used to go
You knew just what I had on my mind

You thought it could be just like old times
Honey it could never be the same
I got up from the table walked away
While you remained

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
