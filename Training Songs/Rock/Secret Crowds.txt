If I had my own world
I'd fill it with love and desire
I wanted the glorious past you admire
And voices of kids out walking dogs,
Birds, planes, trees and cars

If I had my own world
I'd love it for all that's inside it
There'd be no more wars, death or riots,
There'd be no more faiths, packed parking lots,
Guns, bombs sounding off,

If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire
From here to the farlands
To spread love like violence

If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire
From here to the farmlands
To spread love like violence

Let me feel you, carry you higher
Watch our words spread hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and gather
Hear your voices sing back louder

If I had my own world
I'd show you the life that's inside it
The way that it glows when you find it
The way it survives with it's families,
Friends or it's enemies

Let's make this a new world

I swear you can go if you want to
I know that you have it within you
Inventing the first clean musical,
God's greatest miracle

If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire
From here to the farmlands
To spread love like violence

If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire
From here to the far lands
To spread love like violence

Let me feel you, carry you higher
Watch our words spread hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and gather
Hear your voices sing back louder

Let me feel you carry you higher
Watch our words spread hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and gather
Hear your voices sing back louder

Let me feel you carry you higher
Watch our words spread hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and gather
Hear your voices sing back louder

Let me feel you carry you higher
Watch our words spread hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and gather
Hear your voices sing back louder
