Weary boots seem Much too heavy So again do I Filled the boots with Stones and concrete So that I could fly Soothe the burn that burns so free Sting the thing inside that stings me Weary boots is eating me alive My big hero Say goodbye My big hero Was a lie My big hero Had to die Told me lies So once more we say goodbye There I sat upon his head Cool water at my feet Drowned his face and Crushed his neck and Loving every scream Felt the dream that's driven me Smashed the thing inside That smashed me Weary boots is trying not to die My big hero Say goodbye My big hero Was a lie My big hero Had to die My big hero Say goodbye My big hero Was a lie Smash my dreams and Kill my ideals Poke me in the eye Tear my seems and kill the part of me that wants to cry My big hero Say goodbye Say goodbye Say goodbye
