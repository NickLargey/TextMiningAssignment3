From the top of the bus
She thought she saw him wave
She's all Tuesdays and forgetfulness
And a little money saved
Does she know, I don't know
But from here I can tell

That it would try the patience of angels
It would try the patience of angels, angels

And you know something's wrong
When the morning hurts your eyes
And the baby won't stop crying
You'll be waiting till you die
Would I be any good
And if I was would I find

That it would try the patience of angels
It would try the patience of angels

There's a door in a wall in a house in a street
In a town where no-one knows her name
She's the patience of angels
Does she know, I don't know
But from here I can tell
There's a door in a wall in a house in a street
In a town where no-one knows her name
(There's a door) theres a door (in a wall) in a wall
(in a house) in a house (in a street) in a street
(in a town) where no-one knows her name
She's the patience of angels
The patience of angels

It would try the patience of angels
It would try the patience of angels
It would try the patience of angels
It would try the patience of angels, oh angels
Ooh angels, oh angels, angels.
