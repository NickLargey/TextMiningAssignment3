Who can fly my heart like a bamboo kite
Make it twirl and gyrate just like a gyro delight
Only you can oh ho only you
Who can see as far as an eagle bird
See right thru my head thru my every word
Only you can oh ho only you
Only you have a right to me
you ohh
Only you come home every night every night eh hey yeah
Who can strum a tune by the light of the moon
Make me love like you do in the afternoon
Only you can oh ho only you
Only you can . . .
Only you have a right to me
you ohh . . .
Who can strum a tune by the light of the moon . . .
