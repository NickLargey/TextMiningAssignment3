I ride in on a train
Everyday is the same old thing
It's nine to five
Don't know if I'm dead or alive

I'm looking for a Halilujah
I need a little something Special
(Something special)

My walls are gray,
Makes me feel like I live in a cave
I'm wearing a fear
When tomorrow comes I'll do it all again, again, again.

I'm looking for a Halilujah (yeah,yeah)
I need a little something Special
Yeah
I'm looking for a Halilujah
Looking for something Special 
To get me off this sun cone

Let me out
Let me out

I dream of my escape
Through the eyes of burn up, fly away

I'm looking for a Halilujah 
I need a little something Special
Yeah
I'm looking for a Halilujah
I need a little something Special

I need a little something Special

Halilujah
