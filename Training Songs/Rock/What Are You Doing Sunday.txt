I hear some people get married in the park on Sunday afternoon
And all their friends bring pretty flowers while the band plays a happy
Tune Now do you want me, do you need me, Do you love me like I love you?
Ooo

 What are you doing Sunday baby? Would you like to marry me?
 What do you say now? If it's a nice day now
 What are you doing Sunday baby? Gee, I want to marry you
 Oh, what are you doing Sunday afternoon?

Maybe we should wait 'til night to join hands 'neath the stars above
And we'll be kissing our first kiss by moonlight as we vow eternal love
Now do you want me, do you need me, Do you love me like I love you? Ooo

 What are you doing Sunday baby? Would you like to marry me?
 What do you say now? If it's a nice day now
 What are you doing Sunday baby? Gee, I want to marry you
 Oh, what are you doing Sunday afternoon?

Now do you want me, do you need me, baby
Love me like I love you?

 What are you doing Sunday baby? Would you like to marry me?
 What do you say now? If it's a nice day now
 What are you doing Sunday baby? Gee, I want to marry you
