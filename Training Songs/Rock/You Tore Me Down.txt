Everybody knows
That you've been untrue
You've gone and broke my heart
And made me blue
Turned my head around
Then you tore me down
If I had a choice
I'd not be sad
'Cause when I hear your voice
It makes me mad
Baby's not around
But she's leaving town
Baby, baby
Don't run away
I want you to stay
I'm sorry
So sorry
I made you blue
And now you should be sorry too
Should be sorry too
Now I'm so alone
You're far away
I sit here at home
No words to say
To anyone around
'Cause you tore me down
You tore me down
Tore me down
Tore me down
