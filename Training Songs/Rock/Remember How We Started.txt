Remember how we started on a summer's night
To drunk to care abut what might
You turned my head to kiss your lips
Time stood still as my heart skipped a beat
And if I could I'd take your hand
And lead you off back to the past
I know a trail, a secret mile
An' better to cry than never smile
The moonlight shining through your flowered curtains
I think we knew it was us for certain
An' just the thing that we hoped for
Was building up into something more

Oh I've been searching, searching
Trying to find the words to say
Oh I've been searching, searching
Trying to get back to the love we made, yesterday

Remember how we started on a summer's night
Too young to know about what might
And just as well
As we might not
Of ever started on this course at all
