A burning flame goes by and by
Visible love stands side by side
It comprehends
Beginnings never end

Into the cycle of the here and now
We take our fears and disappear somehow
As we ascend
Beginnings never end

Twin flames in our hearts
As we turn towards our very start
Twin flames in our minds
When we move emotions multiply

Twin flames in our hearts
As we move you can't tell us apart
Twin flames in our minds
When we move together

A sea of flames
Before tonight
Conducted love
Brought us alight
The fire blends
Beginning never end

Double halves of wholeness
Find the missing equal sign
Double halves of wholeness
Now return to intertwine

Spirals turn the fire in us
Instants synchronise
Joining us a second love
We harmonise in time
