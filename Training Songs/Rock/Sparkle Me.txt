Suzy was a winner
At every end of year dinner
Drinking the sea and then laughing loudly
Her eyes were made of sequins
They lined up just like penguins
To flap their wings and then kiss her feet

But you, fall on me, and watch TV
Pass me the phone, I need a conversation
You're feeling down, just like this town
Your eyes they always sparkle me with love

Alice was a poser
The kind who'd take her clothes off
And sit in a room full of frozen faces
I heard she went to find God
In the Indian sub-continent
It's mad she had to go so far

But you, fall on me, and watch TV
Pass me the phone, I need a conversation
You're feeling down, just like this town
Your eyes they always sparkle me with love

Now I'm no Jackanory
But this is allegory
We run to the world but we creep indoors
And I know I need you more now
To run and never turn around
Sparkle the world with what Alice found

And you, fall on me, and smash the TV
Rip out the stupid phone, we need a conversation
You feel this time, to be just mine is
To shake the world alive
