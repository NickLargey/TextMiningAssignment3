I've got no roots baby
There's wind in my blood
Ain't nothing new
Like after the flood

The clouds I'm reading
My spirit is working
Long way go go baby
Long way to go

Long way to go honey
Got a long way to go now
A sight to inspire
Like steel through the fire

Can't stop wonderin'
Can't stop dreamin'
There's a key to this door
On a distant shore

Long way to go baby, happy to be
Long way to go, can't disagree
Long way to go sugar, happy to see
Got a long way to go now

You are the flower
I am the bee
You are the brook
I am the sea

Long way to go baby, happy to be
Long way to go, can't disagree
Long way to go honey, happy to see
Got a long way to go now
