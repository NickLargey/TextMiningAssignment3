Security my friends did say
Could make your love a stronger one
Jealousy came into play
And solid ties dissolved away
So there we were, on that day
Waiting for the other's fall

And it seems so sad
Seems so sad to me
What we had so bad
It occurs to me that

She got the radio
(She got the radio)
And left me here, standing so lonely
She got the radio
(She got the radio)
The tragedy is all so moving
She got the radio
(She got the radio)
And I can't carry on that way
I can't carry on that way no more

She looked at me with enraged despair
I could not breathe the hostile air
What became of the love we shared?
Cut dry left standing there
Let it be said for the record though
We performed with style you know

And it seems so sad
Seems so sad to me
What we had so bad
It amuses me that

She got the radio
(She got the radio)
And left me here, standing so lonely
She got the radio
(She got the radio)
The tragedy is all so moving
She got the radio
(She got the radio)
Imagine that, left me just crying
She got the radio
(She got the radio)
And I can't carry on that way
I can't carry on that way no more

(She got the radio)
Left me here, standing so lonely
(She got the radio)
Imagine that, left me just crying
She got the radio
(She got the radio)
The tragedy is all so moving
(She got the radio)
She got the radio
(She got the radio)
Imagine that, left me just crying
(She got the radio)
She got the radio
She got the radio
(She got the radio)
Oh, I'm supposed to love her.
