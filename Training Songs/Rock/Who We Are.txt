I don't wanna put on my make up 
Just like every girl in a magazine 
That's not who I am when I wake up 
That's not who I wanna be 

There's so much more to me than 
Meets the eye 
In this life 
I know one thing 

It doesn't really matter what you wear 
Let the people stare 
'cause we are who we are who we are who we are 
It doesn't really matter what car you drive 
It's good to be alive 
Yeah we are who we are who we are who we are 
Who we are 

Tell me baby do I look like the real thing 
Or would you change the color of my eyes 
Tell me why my television's filling me with lies 

It doesn't really matter what you wear 
Let the people stare 
'cause we are who we are who we are who we are 
It doesn't really matter what car you drive 
It's good to be alive 
Yeah we are who we are who we are who we are 

There is beauty on the inside 
Yeah you're beautiful 
All right! 

Though it doesn't really matter what you wear 
Let the people stare 
'cause we are who we are who we are who we are 
It doesn't really matter what car you drive 
It's good to be alive 
Yeah we are who we are who we are who we are 

It doesn't really matter what you wear 
Let the people stare (it's good to be alive good to be alive) 
Doesn't really matter what car you drive 
It's good to be alive (who we are) 
Yeah we are who we are who we are who we are 
Who we are (it's good to be alive good to be alive) 

When we are who we are
