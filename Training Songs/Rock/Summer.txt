Just in time for summer, the war is over
No fighting overseas, teenage sex Amelia, marijuana
I can hardly breathe
Under built communities are overcoming responsibility
In the sun with a heavy heart, a heavy heart

Just in time for summer, the war is over
No fighting overseas, bushes in the pavement keep on growing
Coming into trees
Positivity in communities is overcoming negativity
In the sun with a heavy heart, with a heavy heart

Just in time for summer, the war is over
No fighting overseas, sex can't stop the people
Deny the pleasure of reading 'War and Peace'
Keep on changing leads, changing leads, changing leads
In the sun with a heavy heart, a heavy heart

Just in time for summer, the war is over
No fighting overseas
In the sun with a heavy heart, a heavy heart, a heavy heart

Just in time for summer, the war is over
No fighting overseas, teenage sex Amelia, marijuana
I can hardly breathe
Under built communities are overcoming responsibility
In the sun with a heavy heart, a heavy heart

A heavy heart, a heavy heart
A heavy heart, a heavy heart
A heavy heart, a heavy heart
A heavy heart
