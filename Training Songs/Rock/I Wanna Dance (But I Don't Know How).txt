I wanna dance, but I don't know how 
I wanna dance, but I don't know how 
Little feet, on the floor 
I know I've seen you here before 
It don't come, every day 
I don't wanna let it slip away 

I don't know what to do 
I don't know what to do 
I don't know what to do 
To prove I've got this thing for you 

I don't know what to do 
I don't know what to do 
I don't know what to do 
To prove I've got this thing for you 

I wanna dance, but I don't know how 
I wanna dance, but I don't know how 
But I'll try 

Little girl 
What's your name? 
Will I ever see you here again? 
Pirouette, what a show 
You know something I'll never know 

I don't know what to do 
I don't know what to do 
I don't know what to do 

I wanna dance, but I don't know how 
I wanna dance, but I don't know how 
I wanna dance, but I don't know how 
I wanna dance, but I don't know how
