Wind blows through this empty room
Like blood from an open wound
Shut my eyes, I don't wanna see

And outside there's a big parade
Some girl, she's got it made
Things change in the time it takes to breathe

But I can't stand to see her hands on you
'Cause you were my religion too
You don't have to remind me

I don't need you to bring it home, no
You don't have to remind me, oh no, no, no
'Cause every night, I sleep alone

My friends all say I got nothin' to lose
So what if I can pick and choose
Those substitutes, they're just a waste of my time

So here I sit in this lonely room
Just me and a lover's moon
Ain't it funny how love is so unkind, ooh yeah

Sometimes I wish, I could forget the past
'Cause I can't stand to see it last
You don't have to remind me

I don't need you to bring it home, oh
You don't have to remind me, oh no, no, no
'Cause every night, I sleep alone

I know there's people who can walk upon the water
So how come I'm sinking like a storm?
You part the sea, and then you walk away from me
I don't know how much longer I can breathe

You don't have to remind me
I don't need you to bring it home
You don't have to remind me, oh no, no, no

You don't have to remind me
You don't to bring it home
You don't have to remind me, oh no, no, no
'Cause every night, I sleep alone
