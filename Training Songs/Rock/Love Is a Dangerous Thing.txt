You take your chances with modern romances
Remember everything that you've learned
If you give into desire you're playing with fire
And you could be so easily burned

If you want to be a lover you'd better take cover
It's too late to forgive if you forget
When you roll the dice you'd better think twice
'Cause what you see ain't always what you get

[Chorus:]
You take the risk right from the start
'Cause love is a dangerous thing
It's like a loaded gun pointed straight at your heart
Love is a dangerous thing

If your first reaction is for satisfaction
Don't forget that you've got plenty of time
Before you give into it you'd better think trough it
Remember it's your life on the line

If you're lookin' for a lover you'd better take cover
It's too late to forgive if you forget
When you roll the dice you'd better think twice
'Cause what you see ain't always what you get

[Chorus]
Gotta get love, god I need love, gotta have it
Lookin' for love, want it but I'd better not
Give into your love, 'cause it's a dangerous thing
Gotta get love, god I need love, gotta have it
Lookin' for love, want it but I'd better not
Give into your love, 'cause love is a dangerous thing

[Chorus]
