If you want to die
Or if you want to chill
Even if you want to get high
Whatever happens take a pill
The first I take against depression
The second is pure energy
The green one for my self-agression
Than the red one - extasy
Extasy, -sy, -sy, -sy

All the left is right
All the black is white
All the fast walk slow
All the loose is tight
All the heat is snow
All the high was low
All the grief is fun
All in all, the rain is sun

Skills in pills

If the jake gets really strong
The pink one goes with boobs and blow
I keep fucking all night long
The orange one is for... I don't know
Grey one for my perfect sleep
Yellow for my need for pure
The blue one keeps my boner steep
I take two, just to be sure

All the left is right
All the black is white
All the fast walk slow
All the loose is tight
All the heat is snow
All the high was low
All the grief is fun
All in all, the rain is sun

Skills in pills
Skills in pills
Skills in pills
Skills in pills

All the left is right
All the black is white
All the fast walk slow
All the loose is tight
All the heat is snow
All the high was low
All the grief is fun
All in all, the rain is sun

The white one
For my, whatever pain
In the end I start to cry
So I take the first again
I have a last one
And I hope to die
