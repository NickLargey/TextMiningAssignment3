Now this world holds it's sorrows
It stands without a doubt
But where there is no woman
You can count me out
Because I got a woman
She's nobody's woman but mine, all mine
She's nobody's woman, nobody's woman but mine, all mine

I gave her all my money
And let her make me blue
But I am hardly fool enough
To give her up to you
And she ain't nobody's woman, nobody's woman but mine, all mine
Yes she's nobody's woman, nobody's woman but mine, all mine

Now I like 'em plain or fancy
I like 'em short or tall
But when they dig my lovin'
I like 'em best of all
And she ain't nobody's woman, nobody's woman but mine, all mine
Yes she's nobody's woman, nobody's woman but mine, all mine
Nobody's woman, nobody's woman but mine, all mine
All mine, all mine, all mine
