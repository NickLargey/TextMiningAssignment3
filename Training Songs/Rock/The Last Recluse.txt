We rode hard
For the boat, hard as we could
No tears you said, understood, understood
I said alright
A crowd will be born
Only born dying
I want to watch for a sign
In the night
I watch a bomb go off in a young girl's life

Who are you?
The last recluse
Who are you
The last Canada goose

Who are you?
What is it with you?
Who are you?
Who are you?

When the wind comes up
Surface of
The water scalds
Enough enough, the whistle cries
Just ride you said
Ride and shut up

I jumped on board, turned around
To wave goodbye
You were already on your bike
Riding with my bike by your side

Who are you?
The black canoe
Who are you?
The last of the immune
Who are you?
You rode out of view
As far as I know
it was you

You broke my heart, from the start
Made me work, work so hard
To get where I am
To where I'd let you do it all again

Who are you?
Who are you?
What do I do
Without you?

Who are you?
The last recluse
Who are you?
The last of the immune?

The last canoe
The last Canada goose
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
