We've got to push it away.
I walk alone among my enemies.
We've got to push it away.
I am alone, no regrets, no shame.
Hate is surrounding me, my addictions killing me.
So much shit forced in my head.
Still this world won't see me dead.
I walk alone among the abused and deceived,
Lost in this wasteland, killing for our lusts and greeds.
I am alone, no regrets, no shame.
So stay the f*ck away from me.
Nothing but enemies.
