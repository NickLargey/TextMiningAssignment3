I run a comb through my hair and step out in the street
And the city's the color of flame in the mid-summer heat, oh yeah
Jennifer's got her daddy's car, she's playing "Uptown" on the stereo
We go cruisin' so close, the way they did long ago

My darlin'

Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
(Keep) Keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control
Baby, baby
(When) When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) Take me over the edge
Make me lose control

We put the top down and park with the moon in the sky
And the wind is so hot in our hair, like a fire in July, oh yeah
Jennifer's singin' "Stand by Me" and she knows every single word by heart
Was love always this good, or could this be just the start?

Oh darlin'

Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
(Keep) Keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control
Baby, baby
(When) When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) Take me over the edge
Make me lose control

Keep my baby clothes on, and were movin' in time
And the heat from your touch, makes me feel like I'm losing my mind, oh yeah
(And then they played) Back in my arms again 
(We close our eyes) We start rememberin' when
(We start to kiss) And all the feelings return
And we just pray that this night never ends

Oh, my darlin'
(Turn) Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive make me lose control
Baby
When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) Take me over the edge
Make me lose control

Baby, baby

Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
(Keep) Keep this feelin' alive make me lose control

When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) Take me over the edge make me lose control

Baby, baby 

Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
(Keep) Keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control
