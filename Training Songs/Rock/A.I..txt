Burning
I step into the sun
And it stings me
But traces of your love
What have I become?

Lost inside a memory
Buried deep inside of me
Never breaking
I'm escaping
Lost inside a memory
Can't erase the end of me
Never breaking
No forsaking
No

Learning
The meaning of life
And it haunts me
Would you run into my mind?
Left my heart so blind

Lost inside a memory
Buried deep inside of me
Never breaking
I'm escaping
Lost inside a memory
Can't erase the end of me
Never breaking
No forsaking

No
You're forsaking me

Lost inside a memory
Buried deep inside of me
Never breaking
I'm escaping
Lost inside a memory
Can't erase the end of me
Never breaking
No forsaking
No
