Let's walk down to the water
There's hyacinth in bloom
I spend my days
Lovin' you
I left these fields
Because I never knew
To be a horse
To be a train
I wouldn't have the heart
And next to the tracks
You find an apple cart
Maybe we'll stay at home
And be together no more to move alone
Together no more to move alone
See the water It's mixed with light
For you I've been shaken
Regarding the fields
Humbly mistaken
