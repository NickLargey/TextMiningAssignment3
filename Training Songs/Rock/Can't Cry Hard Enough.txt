I'm gonna live my life
Like everyday's the last
Without a simple goodbye
It all goes by so fast

And now that you're gone
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
Can I open my eyes
And see for the first time
I've let go of you like
A child letting go of his kite

There it goes
Up in the sky
There it goes
Beyond the clouds
For no reason why
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now

Can I look back in vain
And see you standing there
With all that remains
It's just an empty chair

And now that you're gone
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now

There it goes
Up in the sky
There it goes
Beyond the clouds
For no reason why
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
