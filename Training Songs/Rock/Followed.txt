There was sunshine and now there's only rain
And blue skies you turned them into pain
Words were so fine I wanted everyone to know
What other people hold back
I loved the way you showed
I never noticed blood on you before
But everytime you pull another in
I see a little more
You control things
You tell them you're a friend
But if they ever try to get away
You crush them in your hands

[CHORUS]
Now I see with my own eyes
And not through someone else's lies
Yes, I followed
But with a knife I call the truth
I sever ties and cut me loose
I won't follow
