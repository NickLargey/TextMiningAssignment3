Dancing close feeling restless
It`s a slow and sultry night
It`ll take a lifetime till sunrise if you won`t stay with me tonight
Feel your breath caress my shoulder as your heart reads my mind

You don`t have to tell me anything
I can see everything in your eyes
It`s so easy with you
I don`t need an excuse to be the woman in me
It`s so hard to believe that I`m feeling so free to be the woman in me
Baby there`s so much no man has ever touched of the woman in me

I might be trembling but I`m not scared
Just my desire breaking free
I`ve never had a chance like this before to unlock all the doors to be the woman in me
It`s so hard to believe that I`m feeling so free to be the woman in me
Baby there`s so much no man has even touched of the woman in me

Like the dark side of the full moon
I`ve never shown what I`m showing to you
It`s so easy with you I don`t need an excuse to be the woman in me
It`s so hard to believe that I`m feeling so free to be the woman in me
It`s so easy with you. I don`t need an excuse to be the woman in me
It`s so hard to believe that I`m felling so free to be the woman in me
