Broke down at a truck stop
Got wet sweat under a hard top
Wrong directions are shown
Threw up in the men's room

Shotguns freckle the road signs
Wind burns cross the white line
So much nothing is grown
Finished our fifth six pack
This is not the way home

Left early without payin' the bill

Hitch-hiked back to Broken Hill
Left my wallet somewhere
Wrong directions are shown
This is not the way home

Broke down at a truck stop
Got wet sweat under a hard top
Wrong directions are shown again
Threw up in the men's shithouse
This is not the way home
