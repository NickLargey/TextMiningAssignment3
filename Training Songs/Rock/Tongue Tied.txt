My boy is mad hot
One touch I’m shell-shocked
Makes my heart foxtrot, non-stop
Could’ve been a one night stand, oh man
Could’ve been a passing thing
Just a little boom boom bang
But we keep going again, and going again, oh!

This heat it won’t stop
He makes me jackpot
My eyes are blood-shot, dumb-struck
Think we’ve got a perfect ten, oh man
And every bit of luck we can
'Cause I got my ace in hand
Can we go round again, and round again?

This must be love
‘Cause every night our words are tongue-tied up
Pillow talk just sounds like double dutch
Like we drank too much
Yeah once we touch oh-woah-oh-oh!
Words come out like

I scoop that ice cream
He licks the plate clean
No time just more please, striptease
Wanna another helping hand, oh man
Polish every room we can
Yeah we gotta do the damn thing
Keep ya mama coming again, oh, coming again

This must be love
‘Cause every night our words are tongue-tied up
Pillow talk just sounds like double dutch
Like we drank too much
Yeah once we touch oh-woah-oh-oh!
Words come out like

Oh dang, money in the bank
Every time I walk I'm on my way yeah 
That fame standing in the rain
Drivin' every woman insane yeah
My fingers followin' a tattoo of the angel wings
This devil starts to grin 'cause I'm his favorite kind of sin

This must be love
‘Cause every night our words are tongue-tied up
Pillow talk just sounds like double dutch
Like we drank too much
Yeah once we touch oh-woah-oh-oh!
Words come out like
