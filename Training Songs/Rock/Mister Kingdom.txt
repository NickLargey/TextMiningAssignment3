Daylight comes to those who live,
But those who die - they never see the sun come.
Shining through their window pane,
They pass away.
Silly girl to be a fool;
You didn't play the golden rule.
'Cause once you're done with one world,
There's another waiting there.

[Chorus]
Help me.  Such a lonely soul,
In dreams,
To leave behind the world.
Mr. Kingdom, help me please,
To find the rainbow's end.
Looking from this empty room;
The corridors of endless gloom
Go crawling through the night,
To meet the dawn that's on the way.
Oh, to sleep, perchance to dream,
To live again those joyous scenes.
The laughter, and the follies
That are locked inside my head

[Chorus x 2]

I can dream of flying high
Above the city's cares, and never be afraid of anyone,
'Cause there ain't no one there.

[Chorus x 3]
