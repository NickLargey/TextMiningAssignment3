Silent to the dark 
Small talk on the radio
It seems I am going nowhere today

Small talk gets you nowhere choose
Between a curtain or a star
And I'm silent to the dark
'cause when I needed someone to talk to
You were the only one around
Small cost, it pays to be alone

Small talk on the radio
It seems I am going nowhere today
(not today)
Small talk gets you nowhere
I'm silent to the dark and tepid
Only when you ask
'cause when I needed someone to talk to
You were the only one around
Small cost, it pays to be alone

When I needed someone to talk to
You were the only one around
Small cost, it pays to be alone

And you can do anything you want
Yeah you can anything you want
You can do anything you want
It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter

'Cause when I needed someone to talk to
You were the only one around
Small cost, it pays to be alone
When I needed someone to talk to
You were the only one around
Small cost, it pays to be alone

When I needed someone
To talk to
To talk to
To talk to

'Cause when I needed someone to talk to
You were the only one around
Small cost, it pays to be alone
