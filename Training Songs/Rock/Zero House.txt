You took my pride and I want it back
No more loving on the torture rack
No more running when you call my name
The things we've done, baby make me feel ashamed 

Minus me, minus you
Smoke out, ghost lovers, burn down the zero house 

Seven rooms for seven long years
Till only dead people livin' here
Maybe I should mutter this under my breath
But honey I think love scared us to death 

Opposites subtract
Smoke out, ghost lovers, burn down the zero house 

We're so stupid that it makes me want to scream
Baby I think dogs have better dreams
Would you look at what we try to live up to
Baby I don't want this memory of you 

Bad boy, bad girl
Smoke out, ghost lovers, burn down the zero house 

We both came here perfectly tempted
And now we're leaving it perfectly empty
Nobody lived here, no woman, no man
Just a couple of flies circling a garbage can
Think about it, buzz a while 

Smoke out, ghost lovers, burn down the zero house
Burn it down
Burn down the zero house
Burn, burn
