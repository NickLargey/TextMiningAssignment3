I wanted perfection from every song I've ever sung
But that was wrong
And I wanted something from every person I've ever loved
But that was wrong

[Chorus]
And I've changed, I've changed
I've reconsidered everything
I'm fine now, I'm fine now
I laid the barrel in my mouth
And everything I thought before
I won't think anymore
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed

I wanted to be the greatest at everything
But I can't be
And I wanted to be exempt from temptation
But I can't be

[Chorus]

And I wanted your love to be ever lasting
But it isn't
I wanted life to be an easier proposition
But it isn't

[Chorus]
