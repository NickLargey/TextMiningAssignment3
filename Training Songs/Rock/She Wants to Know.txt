Send back the message
Open the taxi door
Stand away from the window
Think that it's getting cold

You're always leading her in and out
You start but you never begin somehow
And oh

[Chorus]
She Wants To Know
Where she stands
She Wants To Know
Now it's in your hands 'cause
She Wants To Know

Sealing the letter
She's drinking yesterday's wine
It makes her feel better
Makes her forget the time

You're always leading her in and out
You start but you never begin somehow

[Chorus]

You're always bringing her up and down
You finish, but you never stop, around
