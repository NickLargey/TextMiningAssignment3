Her name is Wena 
Hey, have you seen-a? 
Everyone says she's amazing 
She gets so jealous
She sticks her head up 
When I'm checkin' out the ladies 
And she needs so much attention 
She's always hangin' around

My Wena is lonely tonight 
(My Wena)
She cries when I turn out the light 
(My Wena) 
She's only happy when I'm holdin' her tight 
Oh, my Wena 
Take a look at my Wena

My little Wena
Queen of the scene 
And all the girls wanna be around her 
Her skin is so soft
I can't keep my hands off 
Ever since the day I found her 
And she'll make your heart beat faster 
With the wink of an eye

My Wena is lonely tonight 
(My Wena) 
She cries when I turn out the light 
(My Wena) 
She's only happy when I'm holdin' her tight 
Oh, my Wena 
Have you seen my Wena? 
Get a load o' my

Sometimes she can't sleep at night 
And I wake up and she's just a-lookin' at me 
And she snuggles up tight when it's cold outside 
She likes to show off when we're walkin' the beach 
And she's always up for goin' extra innings 
She's a sucker for a happy ending 
And we may not always agree
But she's always here with me

My Wena is lonely tonight 
She cries when I turn out the light 
She's only happy when I'm holdin' her tight 
My Wena 
(Take a look at my Wena)

My Wena is lonely tonight 
(My wonderful Wena)
She cries when I turn out the light 
(She wants to get between ya)
She's only happy when I'm holdin' her tight 
Oh, my Wena 
My wonderful Wena
