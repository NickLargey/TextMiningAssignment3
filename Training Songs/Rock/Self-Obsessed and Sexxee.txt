I remember when you first arrived
Magic marker on yr belly button all right (all right)
I read what you said you said drop dead oh no (oh no)
I need you now 'cause I know you got nowhere to go

Schizo action baby create a scene
I'm the type of guy to boost yr self esteem
We party all night 'cause it's you you you everyday
Self-obsessed and sexy all the way

I remember yr bloody trail to the top (the top)
Took it all too far now you just can't stop (don't stop)
I'll help collect yr soul from the lost & found (it's around)
And I will build you up while they tear you down

Schizo action baby create a scene
I'm the type of guy to boost yr self esteem
We party all night 'cause it's you you you everyday
Self-obsessed and sexy all the way (all the way)
Party party party party all the time
Party party party party all the time
Party party party party all the time
Party party party party all the time
