Ooh ooh

When the day is done
And I lay me down
I sit alone in my lonely bed
And I think about
The day we had
And it makes me sad 'cause you're gone

When the day is done
And I lay me down
This sheet's so cold
And your space is dark
And I hear you whispering something sweet
And it doesn't move me and it knows me

When the day is done
And I lay me down
I sit alone in my lonely bed
And I think about
The day we had
And it makes me sad 'cause you're gone

After all I'm married to the wandering star
I kissed his moon
It was full and I fell in love with thee
But now, the world turns around me
Turns around me
Turns around me
Turns around me

When the day is done
And I lay me down
This sheet's so cold
And your place is dark
And I hear you whispering something sweet
And it doesn't move and it knows me

After all, I'm married to the wandering star
I kissed his moon
It was full and I fell in love with thee
But now the world turns around me

After all, I'm married to the wandering star
I kissed his moon
It was full and I fell in love with thee
But now the world turns around me

When the day is done
And I lay me down
This sheet's so cold
And your space is dark
And I hear you whispering something sweet
And it doesn't move and it knows me

Ooh
