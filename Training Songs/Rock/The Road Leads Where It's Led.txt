Cultivating sounds
For all the mothers who come near
To find out
Calling pulse bombs a response

With cotton in their ears
And goodbye kisses
For the ones
In the ground

Collecting fallout from the blast

The road leads where it's led
While all the darlings cover Earth
With bare hands

They're blowing all the other kids away

Angels stole the show
The roaring seraph, singing thunder called
The mother's children home

Blowing all the other kids away
Blowing all the other kids away
Blowing all the other kids away
With all of your charm
Blowing all the other kids away
Blowing all the other kids away
Blowing all the other kids away

We communicate by semaphore
No language, we've got flags of our own

The road leads where it's led
And all the darlings cover Earth
With bare hands

They're blowing all the other kids away
They're blowing all the other kids away

Angels stole the show
The roaring seraph, singing thunder called
The mother's children home

Blowing all the other kids away
Blowing all the other kids away
Blowing all the other kids away
We won't be fooled
Blowing all the other kids away
By all of your charm
Blowing all the other kids away
Uncertainty fails as heaven surrounds you
Blowing all the other kids away
(Blowing all the other kids away)
Blowing all the other kids away
