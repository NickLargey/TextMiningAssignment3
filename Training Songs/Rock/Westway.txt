We tip-toed through the sky building castles
And nothing ever bothered us at all
We got dizzy on a staircase and chose to fall
Only to find a lonesome Newtown
How you gonna sleep with your head so high?
You should come with me to the dress up party
Freaks is the theme, and yeah, that’s my nature
Come, let’s indulge in outlandish behavior
I wanna save you

I’m home when you're there
Alone, don’t compare
I feel, she comes
The westway, the glitter, and the slums
The westway, the glitter, and the slums

I started all the world wars
The hole up in the sky
Sucked the liquid out the ground
'Spose I'm darker in the light
Now I’m getting down
Because I’m always feeling fine
The cobblestone streets
Paved my way through the night
I'm not normal

I’m home when you're there
Alone, don’t compare
I feel she calls
The westway, the glitter, and the slums
The westway, the glitter, and the slums
I’m here but I'm lost
Wide awake as I stare at the sun
The westway, the glitter, and the slums
The westway, the glitter, and the slums

How do you gonna sleep with your head so high
How do you gonna sleep with your head so high
