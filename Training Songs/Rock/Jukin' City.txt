I think I was about seventeen when my pappy said to me,
Come on now with me, Son,
Goin' to take you to Jukin' City.
You can stomp your foots around,
To a pickin' country band.
I'm gonna buy you all the Jack Black,
That you can surely stand.

Jukin' City, Jukin' City,
I'm going there with my old man.
Jukin' City, Jukin' City,
I'm going there with a friend.

Jukin' City is a little place down around Macon Town,
Sawdust floors, cold draft beer and women all around.
We started with two fat mamas,
They promised us a real good time.
The there fellas came into the place,
We had to fight to stay alive.

Jukin' City, Jukin' City,
I'm going there with my old man.
Jukin' City, Jukin City,
I'm going there with a friend.
Yes, I was about seventeen when my pappy said to me,
Come on with me, Son, Gonna take you to Jukin' City.
You can stomp your foots around,
To pickin' country band. I'm gonna buy you all that Jack Black,
That you can surely stand.

Jukin' City, Jukin' City,
I'm going there with my old man.
Jukin' City, Jukin' City
I'm going there with a friend.
