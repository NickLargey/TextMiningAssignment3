Me I'm just a poor boy, from across the far southland, 
And I've traveled many days to reach this place to mke my stand, 
I fell in with a merry band, and drank away the hours.

Rollin' on, I've been rollin' on, 
And my head is high, from the battle won, 
Laid down my life for the Greenwood

The city boys, and the country boys, they come from miles around, 
To defy their king and country, save the poor folks from the hand, 
Of the thieving dukes and abbotts, and the gentry of the land.

Rollin' on, I've been rollin' on, 
And my head is high, from the battle won, 
Laid down my life for the Greenwood

Sweet Maid Marion, don't you do me no wrong, 
Stay on the right side, the Greenwood is your home, 
The dancing girls and the open fires, the wine that flows like water.

Rollin' on, I've been rollin' on, 
And my head is high, from the battle won, 
Laid down my life for the Greenwood
