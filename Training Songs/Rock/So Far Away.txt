Each night I feel the distance that has grown between us
Open up as lonely as the space between the stars
I wish that I could find a way
To smash my fist right through these walls
Of ugliness and emptiness
And gently touch your face

But every time that I touch you
You feel so far away
And every time that you need me
I feel so far away

As you lie silently beside me choking back your tears
I wonder if you recognize
That silence now defines us
Desperately I try to fight this overwhelming sense
That I may never find
The strength to change
How hopeless we've become

But every time that I touch you
You feel so far away
And every time that you need me
I feel so far away
Can I feel so far away?
(Feel so far away
I feel so far, far away)

We need to find a way to break this silence (x3)
that's between us 
So I scream your name 
I scream your name (x3)

But every time that I touch you
You feel so far away
And every time that you need me
You feel so far away
And every time that you reach out
You feel me pull away
And every time that I touch you, I touch you, I touch you
You feel so far away
