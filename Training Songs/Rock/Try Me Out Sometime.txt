Look me up sometime
Look me up sometime
When you're trying to get off
But can't just hit the bit

Look me over when you're done
Look me over when you're done
When you're trying to get off
Trying to get fit

Won't you try me out sometime
Won't you try me out some
Time time time time

Look me over when you're done
Look me over when you're done
Gotta straighten me up
Gotta get me straight

Show me off sometime
Show me off sometime
When I'm getting it off
You gotta shut your mouth

Won't you try me out sometime
Won't you try me out some
Time time time time

Hook me up sometime
Hook me up
Got you enough 
Gotta get you out
Get me up when you're done
Get me up when you're done
Gotta get gone
Get you off of my head

Won't you try me out sometime
Won't you try me out some
Time time time time
