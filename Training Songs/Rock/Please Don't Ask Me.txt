Please don't ask me what am I thinking, it's about you
And please don't ask me, I never can see you, What can I do
My first impulse is to run to your side
My heart's not free, and so I must hide

Please don't ask me what I'm gonna say to you
I toss and turn, can't sleep at night, It's worrying me,
I go to bed, turn out the light, but your face I see
It only hurts the more I pretend  that we could ever be more than friends
Please don't ask me, why I'm so in love with you

You could easily make me happy that I know
But I try my best to never tell you so
I will sing to you my love songs
And pretend but I'll keep my secret right down to the end

Please don't ask me why I'm not talking, I just can't explain
And please don't ask me, why I go walking out in the rain
I could not live the lie it would take  to have you here would be a mistake
Please don't ask me, why I'm so in love with you
No please don't ask me
