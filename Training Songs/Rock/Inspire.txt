A vase of wilted flowers, for those who've lost their powers
No use in treading water, when there's no air to breathe in

Help me find a way to move on, standing in the way of the sun
Help me find you, you, you, help you find me
Now who inspires you?

The moods are so abrasive, the sound is too persuasive
Curve of the earth has gone straight, shall we go on one last date?

Help me find a way to move on, standing in the way of the sun
Help me find you, you, you, help you find me
Who inspires you?

I'm sorry to inform you, sometimes love can deform you
No time for hesitating, the rifle's cocked and waiting (aimed at me)

Help me find a way to move on, standing in the way of the sun
Help me find you, you, you, help you find me
Now who inspires you?
