Every time I go to speak my mind you just ignore me
Every time I try to have my say you have it for me
They say there's freedom of speech
But when I try to make free you say

Don't you talk back to me
Don't you talk back to me
Don't you talk back to me
Every time

Every time I ask you to lend an ear I get both together
Everything I say just goes in one and out the other
They say there's freedom of thought
But when I think out aloud you say

Don't you talk back to me
Don't you talk back to me
Don't you talk back to me

Now you must see reason
See that I'm a person
Shut your face and listen .... ain't it time
And if you open your mouth
I'll jump straight down your throat and say

Don't you talk back to me
Don't you talk back to me
Don't you talk back to me
Don't you talk back to me
Don't you talk back to me
Don't you talk back to me
Anytime
