Styles and opinions change faster than the world
For plastic punks seeking teenage pleasure
You don't know what it is to earn your pay
What do you know about the scene today

I see you're living in a mob mentality

Wanna be a working class old school
You're A deadhead around the block
Thinking you're one of the mob
You've only been around since '92
Nirvana, Offspring, Green Day too

I see you're living in a mob mentality
What do you fucking know
You best get ready for a forced reality
Can you stand on your own

Skinheads on the web page punks on the net
You know what it's about well I think you forget
Chocking on your greed is the price you pay
What do you know about the scene today

I see you're living in a mob mentality
I see you're living in a mob mentality
What do you fucking know
You best get ready for a forced reality
Can you stand on your own
