Panic
When you hear the music stop
Never let the silence win
Turn the record on again

Panic
When you hear the music stop
Never let them turn you down
Volume up and record round
Yeah, yeah, yeah, rock and roll

We love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, turn the music up
We love you
So don't panic
Turn it up
Don't panic 

Panic
When you hear the music stop
If they get under your skin
Give the disc another spin

Panic
If they try to shut you up
Never let them shout you down
Volume up and record round
Yeah, yeah, yeah, rock and roll

We love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, turn the music up
We love you
So don't panic
Turn it up

Panic
When you hear the music fade
Raise your hands up to the sky
Never let the volume die

Panic
When you hear the rhythm slow
Stamp your feet upon the ground
Volume up and record round
Yeah, yeah, yeah, rock and roll

We love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, turn the music up
We love you
So don't panic
Turn it up
