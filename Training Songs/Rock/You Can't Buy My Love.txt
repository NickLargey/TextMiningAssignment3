You could give me money
Diamonds and pearls
But you can't buy my love for no money in the world.

You can't buy my love.
No you can't buy my love.
For no money in the world.
You can't buy my love.

Now you so blue.
Baby I'm so glad.
'Cause you done lost the best thing you ever had.

Oh you can't buy my love.
No you can't buy my love.
For no money in the world.
You can't buy my love.

Now you so blue.
Baby I'm so glad.
'Cause you done lost the best thing you ever had.

Oh you can't buy my love.
No you can't buy my love.
For no money in the world.
You can't buy my love.

Oh you can't buy my love.
No you can't buy my love.
For no money in the world.
You can't buy my love.

Oh you can't buy my love.
No you can't buy my love.
All the money in the world.
You can't buy my love.

Oh you can't buy my love.
No you can't buy my love.
All the money in the world.
You can't buy my love.

Oh you can't buy my love.
No you can't buy my love.
Oh no.
