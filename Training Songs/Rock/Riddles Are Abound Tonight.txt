2, 3, 4... Aw, what the hell was that? 2, 3,4...

Riddles are abound tonight,
Since the wizard's taken flight.
By the shroud of mystery,
Go to be serenity.

Open hearts are numb to pain
While open minds fill up of strain
If they cut this pie in two,
I'd still give both halves to you.

Huh Aww Yeah!

Take the man that fills the throne,
Contemplate his time alone.
Add a dash of little boys,
And watch the buzzards tear away.

Huh Aww Yeah!

Riddles are abound tonight,
Riddles are abound tonight,
Riddles are abound tonight,
Riddles are abound tonight.

Huh Aww Yeah!
