1:35, she calls me up
And I can hear it in her voice
A little wasted when she says
?Can I come over for a little while?

And I reply, of course you can?
I'm just sitting here wasting time
Going nowhere, going no place
Just pretending everything is fine
And everything is fine

And with a fake and dreamy look
She melts into my arms
And I know I'm gonna lose in the end
But for now everything is fine

Oh, baby, fools like us will always fall
Always fall in love and fall in love with
Fools like us will never change
And never get enough
Now I need her like a drug

And in the morning when she leaves
I keep her precious smile
By my side on the pillow
Where she let her hair come down

And when the sunlight hits my eyes
Oh, I can picture her on a train
Going somewhere, going someplace
Still pretending everything is fine

Oh, baby, fools like us will always fall
Always fall in love and fall in love with
Fools like us will never change
And never get enough of fools like us

Fools like us will always fall
Always fall in love and fall in love with
Fools like us will never change
And never get enough
Of fools just like you and me
Fools like us will always fall
