Get ready, get set, go
Now it’s time for you to start the show 
The lights are bright and the crowd is loud 
Time to show the world what you’re all about 
There’s a fire in your heart that puts all to shame 
And there’s no competition when you got the game to

Shut it down shut it down 
It’s your time to shine
Shut it down shut it down 
It’s just a matter of time 
Close the show and take the win 
Take a stand and begin to
Shut it down, shut it down

You know your strength it isn’t just a line 
And the stage is where you continue to shine 
So when those who hate try to bring you down 
You’ll make your break and turn it around 
And fight for the things worth fighting for 
Like the glory of the crowd wanting more so

Shut it down shut it down 
It’s your time to shine
Shut it down shut it down 
It’s just a matter of time 
Close the show and take the win 
Take a stand and begin to
Shut it down, shut it down

Stay on your toes, roll with the blows 
And take it one show at a time 
The cream of the crop rises to the top 
Every single time
So just step up and grab that mic and

Shut it down shut it down 
It’s your time to shine
 Shut it down shut it down 
It’s just a matter of time 
Close the show and take the win 
Take a stand and begin to
Shut it down, shut it down
