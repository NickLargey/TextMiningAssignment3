eI've been gone for so long, don't it feel good to get back home
To the friends and the people that you'd love to see
There's a twinkle that's in her eye both smiling as you go by
They know what you what you really wanna feel

Chorus:
Don't it make you wanna dance, don't it make you wanna smile
When you're down, down, down in the country they can sing a while
Don't it make you wanna dance, don't it make you wanna smile
When you're down, down, down out in the country they can sing a while

Don't it feel just right tonight, gettin' lose 'neath the old moonlight
Gettin' down, gettin' funky, gettin' hot, gettin' real
Everyone has found a grin, so when the chorus comes around join in
Come on people won't you tell me how you really feel
