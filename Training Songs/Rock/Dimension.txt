I fell down in the desert, baby
I had nothing but a piece of paper, yeah
I had to write something down
And I found myself alone
And then I let go of everything
Into another dimension

Lightning crash on the hill tonight (yeah) 
I got a feeling everything's gonna be all right 
Then a horse came running to me 
Said we're gonna go to the sanctuary 
Then a storm began to blow
Into another dimension

Purple haze is in the sky
See the angels--we die
All these things we bow astride 
Till we see the reasons why, oh yeah

I fell in the desert, baby, yeah 
I had nothing but a piece of paper, why? 
I had to write something down 
But then I found myself alone 
Then I let go of everything 
Into another dimension
