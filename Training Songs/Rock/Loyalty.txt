It's just a reason to deny
All the limits that border
On the thinnest frailties
That makes a sudden change

I'll pay my soul into sleep
I'll make up words that I keep
Letting nothing go to anyone at all

Where is your loyalty now
When all the cards have been left on the table?
Where is your loyalty now
When all the cards have been left on the table?

All of them
Bleed at the nerves
That take so long
To wear down

I'll pay my soul into sleep
I'll make up words that I keep
Letting nothing go to anyone at all

Where is your loyalty now
When all the cards have been left on the table?
Where is your loyalty now
When all the cards have been left on the table?

(This time I let go)
This time I have made enough mistakes
For you to bear against me in direct break
Our original ideals, you let us down
And betrayed our trust with all your promises

I see a piece of shit alive in you
Cast them near enough to be a truth

This time I have made enough mistakes
For you to bear against me in direct break
Our original ideals, you let us down
And betrayed our trust with all your promises

Where is your loyalty now
When all the cards have been left on the table?
Where is your loyalty now
When all the cards have been left on the table?
