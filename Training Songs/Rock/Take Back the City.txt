Take back the city for yourself tonight
Or I'll take back the city for me
Take back the city for yourself tonight
Whoa

God knows you put your life into it's hands
And it's both cradled you and crushed
But now it's time to make your own demands
Whoa

All these years later and it's killing me
Your broken records in words
Ten thousand craters where it all should be
Whoa

No need to put your words into my mouth
Don't need convincing at all
I love this place enough to know I have no doubts
Whoa

It's a mess, it's a start
It's a flawed work of art
Your city, your a call
Every crack, every wall
Pick a side, pick a fight
Get your epitaph right
You can sing, 'til you drop
Cause the fun just never stops

I love this city tonight
I love this city always
It bears it's teeth like a light
And spits me out after day's
But we're all gluttons for it
We know what's wrong and it's right
For every time it's been hit
Take back the city tonight

Tell me you never wanted more than this
And I will stop talking now
One perfect partner, one eternal kiss
Whoa

Take back the city for yourself tonight
Or I'll take back the city for me
Take back the city for yourself tonight
Whoa

It's a mess, it's a start
It's a flawed work of art
Your city, your call
Every crack, every wall
Pick a side, pick a fight
Get your epitaph right
You can sing, 'til you drop
Cause the fun just never stops

I love this city tonight
I love this city always
It bears it's teeth like a light
And spits me out after day's
But we're all gluttons for it
We know what's wrong and it's right
For every time it's been hit
Take back the city tonight

I love this city tonight
I love this city always
It bears it's teeth like a light
And spits me out after day's
But we're all gluttons for it
We know what's wrong and it's right
For every time it's been hit
Take back the city tonight

I love this city tonight
I love this city always
