Fools, never learn
You play with fire
You gonna get burned

You, and I are fools 
We play with love
Oh, we're gonna get burned

Fools that's what we are 
Fools we've gone too far, I know 

But then love
You come to me
Your eyes on fire
You're tempting me

Love, knows no bounds
Beggar or king
It'll bring you down

Fools find love somehow
Fools we can't stop now, I know

But then love
This I know
Fool I may be
I can't let go

Love, this I know
Fool I may be
I can't let go

Fools, fools
Fools, fools
