When everything's going down
And nothing seems to feel the same
no one seems to know my name
no one seems to go my way

Who knows if I'll see you again
Who knows if I'll see you again

One for the soul may dreamers
One for the wicked man
One for the peaceful protests
That keeps the war in demand

Who knows if I'll see you again
Who knows if I'll see you again

Time gonna save our souls
Time gonna save my soul
Time gonna save our souls
Time gonna save my soul

I never thought I'd see it coming
I never thought I'd ever know
Nothing seems to take me over
Nothing seems to let me go

Who knows if I'll see you again
Who knows if I'll see you again
