I see it all before me:
The days of love and torment;
The nights of rock-and-roll.
I see it all before me.
Sometimes my spirit`s empty;
Don`t have the will to go on.
I wish someone would send me
Energy.

Give me something.
Give me something to give.
Oh, God, give me something:
A reason to live.
My body is aching.
Don`t want sympathy.
Come on. Come and love me.
Come on. Set me free.
Set me free.

The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me through the path of righteousness for His name`s sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.

Hey, Lord, I`m waitin` for you.
Oh, God, I`m waitin` for you;
Waitin` to open Your ninety-eight wounds 
And be Thee, be Thee.
Lead me, oh, lead me.

Leave me something.
Leave me something to live.
Oh, God, give me something:
A reason to live.
I don`t want no handout;
No, not sympathy.
Come on. Come and love me.
Come on. Set me free.
Set me free.
Come on. Set me free
Set me free . . . 

Oh, I`m so young, so goddamn young.
Oh, I`m so young, so goddamn young.
Oh, I`m so young, so goddamn.
Set me free.

In the presence of my enemies,
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days of my life.
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

Ah, damn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn.
Here I am.
