Tomorrow's just another day
If you can make it through the night
'cause you're on your own
It's getting darker every minute
Just keep looking for the light
'cause you're on your own
Sometimes I think it's kinda funny
I just hope it turns out right
'cause you're on your own

I find it hard to recognize
All these feelings that you try to disguise

I want to tell you not to worry
There's so much that we can do
But you're on your own
There's no use in us pretending
All our alibies have fallen through
You're on your own

I find it hard to recognize
All those feelings that you tried to disguise

Life's a disaster with a heart of stone
You need some affection but you're all alone

You're on your own
You're in control
You come from nowhere
You can't go back there

You're on your own
You're on your own

Do you wake up in the middle of a dream and scream out 'loud?

Life's a disaster with a heart of stone
You need some affection but you're all alone

You're on your own
You're in control
You come from nowhere
You can't go back there

You're on your own
You're in control
You're on your own
Complete control
