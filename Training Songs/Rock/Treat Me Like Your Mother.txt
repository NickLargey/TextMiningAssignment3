Don't act like you can't act
I always think you do it
You better learn to shake hands
Treat me like your mother

Don't act like you can't act
Stand up like a man
You better learn to shake hands
And treat me like your mother

You came up, too late
You came up, too late now
You came up, too late
To do a thing

Come on look me in the eye
You wanna try to tell a lie
I'll bet you can't and you know why?
I'm just like your mother

Look me in the eye now
You wanna try to tell a lie
You can't and you know why?
I'm just like your mother

You came up, too late
You came up, too late now
You came up, too late
Play dumb, play dead, play straight

Who's got it figured out?
(Play dumb, play dead, play straight)
Who's got it figured out? play straight
Time to manipulate
