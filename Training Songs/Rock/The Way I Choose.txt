Live my life the way that I choose
I'm satisfied nothing to lose
I don't ask no favor I don't know the reason why
If I don't ask no questions I don't get no lies

Now you give your love tenderly
Every way that you move is closer to me
I don't need nobody to tell me the reason why
If I love only you baby oh no

I'll be satisfied
Baby answer my questions
If you want say hell oh
Baby don't say goodbye
