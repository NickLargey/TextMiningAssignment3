And the slow parade 
Dredges on 
A big wheel dancer says the neon lights 
Illuminate the sky

And your hand and mine
Dragging my arm well and feed on to the stage
Where the others wait

And here come the drums
And the beat
The dancing toe to toe and I can feel a breath
Holding close to me

And your sun could die
The moon could fall
The stars could rip apart it doesn't matter now
All time has stopped
Consigned to memory
All the joy that's in my heart

Don't give up
Don't concede on your only heart ache
Don't give up
Don't concede on your only heart ache

And the slow parade
Dredges on
A kaleidoscope of memories she stays with me
Till the music stops
