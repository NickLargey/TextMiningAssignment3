As they done wrong and we done wrong
Now what makes you so certain
All their finger pointing's done
As they don't know what they been told

They say it best
They're already there
And it's not
The way it seems at all

So come on now
Now shake things down tell me
How everyone's gone way to soft
'Cause they don't know what it might take

They say it best
They're already there
And it's not
The way it seems at all

Everybody stay where you are
'Cause they don't know what they've been told
They say it best, I'm already there
And it's not what I thought it would amount to

They ain't calling us now
Now let's just make a time of it
Why you shouldn't tell me now
How everyone's gone way to soft

'Cause they don't know what they've been told
They say it best, they're already there
And its not the end of the line for you
I'm already there when it stops like it's supposed to

I'll be coming around, enough's enough
I just want to get down to it, no, no, no
Why you shouldn't tell me now
How everyone's gone way to soft

'Cause they don't know what they've been told
They say it best, they're already there
And its not the end of the line for you
I'm already there when it stops like it's supposed to

I'll be coming around, enough's enough
I just want to get down to it, no, no, no
