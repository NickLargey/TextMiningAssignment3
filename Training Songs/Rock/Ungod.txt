You don't understand this 
I think you never did 
Silently I search for a reason to exist 
I've found a way to feel you, I feel so fucking old 
You're burning up inside me, but I feel so fucking cold 
You are clutched tight in my fingers 
You caress my skin so light 
You are welling up inside me 
You have finally freed yourself 
You are flowing 'cross my pale skin 
You are running down my arm 
You are salty as I taste you 
I have finally made you warm 
I have finally made you warm 

You stare at me so silent, you stare at me so cold 
I think you stare right through me, that stare has made me old 
I've found a way to fell you, I feel so fucking old 
You're burning up inside me, I feel so fucking cold 

You are clutched tight in my fingers 
You caress my skin so light 
You are welling up inside me 
You have finally freed yourself 
You are flowing 'cross my pale skin 
You are running down my arm 
You are salty as I taste you 
I have finally made you warm 

Take this as an offering 
Take this as a sign 
Take this as an offering 
How much can you take from? 
How much can you take from me? 

I sink into this darkness, I sink into this cold 
This emptiness is calling, I've nothing left to lose 
I've found a way to kill you, I feel so fucking cold 
You're burning up inside me, I feel so fucking old 

You are clutched tight in my fingers 
You caress my skin so light 
You are welling up inside me 
You have finally freed yourself 
You are flowing 'cross my pale skin 
You are running down my arm 
You are salty as I taste you 
I have finally made you warm 

Take this as an offering 
Take this as a sign 
Take this as an offering 
How much can you take from? 
How much can you take from? 
Take this as an offering 
Take this as a sign 
Take this as an offering 
How much can you take from? 
How much can you take from me?
