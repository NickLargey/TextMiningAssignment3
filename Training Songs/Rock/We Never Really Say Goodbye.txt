Keep a song of joy inside your heart
And even though the time has come for us to part
We'll be together soon and time will fly
'Cause we never really say goodbye

Don't forget the love we share today
Sweet memories to keep us warm along the way
I'll hold you in my heart so don't you cry
'Cause we never really say goodbye

Time may come between us
But it doesn't mean a thing
You know we'll be together in our dreams
And so tonight, my friend, sleep tight

And keep a song of joy inside your heart
And even though the time has come for us to part
We'll be together soon and time will fly
'Cause we never really say goodbye
We never really say goodbye
