There's a dim light off the pier
And I've been watching it for years
'through the crashing waves there's a distant bell
It won't stop ringing in my head
All I do is stare and wait
For her to come and take me far away

When my ship comes in I'll be happenin'
After all these years I'll be happy
When my ship comes in

You'll finally love me
Then I can leave you when my ship comes in
There's a bitter old man on the shore
An albatross tied 'round his throat
And he tells me to forget that boat
He rambles on I just get bored
I hear the laughter of the crew
They know the ropes they'll see me through
To truth and brighter days
When my ship comes in I won't be lonely
I'll have lots of friends and they'll all want me
When my ship comes in you might be sorry
And I'll be something when my ship comes in
When my ship comes in
I'll be standing at the rail
Waving you goodbye
You'll never be standing on the beach
You'll be wondering why

When my ship comes in I might take you
You could swab the decks if you're nice today
When my ship comes in we'll be something
Won't that be something when my ship comes in

When my ship comes in I'll be happenin'
After all these years I'll be happy
When my ship comes in you'll finally love me
Then I can have you when my ship comes in
Ship comes in
