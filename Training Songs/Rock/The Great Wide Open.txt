Spitting from the bridges, like a bird perched on a branch
I'm wilting like a tree that will never let me breathe

Soul soldier with your gun held high, where does the crow fly
Soul soldier with your gun held high, will you follow it home

For the road that we walk has more miles left to talk
Stories on and on we go, into the great wide open

No it never came back to break me, the way it broke it down
Spitting from the bridges, while the trees give a sigh to the ground

Soul sailor with your flag held high, where does the crow fly
Soul sailor with your flag held high, will you follow it home

For the road that we walk has more miles left to talk
Stories on and on we go, into the great wide open
For the road that we walk has more miles left to talk
Stories on and on we go, into the great wide open, into the great wide open

The rush of the flood, sends the blood, to my head
The rush of the flood, sends the blood, to my head

Soul soldier with your gun held high, where does the crow fly
Soul soldier with your gun held high, will you follow it home

The rush of the flood, sends the blood, to my head,
The rush of the flood, sends the blood, to my head. 

Climb out, climb out (woah), climb out, climb out (Woah) 
Climb out, climb out (woah), over me
Climb out, climb out (woah), climb out, climb out (Woah)
Climb out, climb out (woah), over me

Into the great wide open
