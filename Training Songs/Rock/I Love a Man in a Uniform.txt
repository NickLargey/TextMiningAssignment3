Time with my girl I spent it well
I had to be strong for my woman
(You must be joking, o man you must be joking)
She needed to be protected

The good life was so elusive
Handouts, they got me down
I had to regain my self-respect
So I got into camouflage

The girls they love to see you shoot

I love a man in a uniform [Repeat: x4]

To have ambitions was my ambition
But I had nothing to show for my dreams
Time with my girl I spent it well
(you must be joking, o man you must be joking)

The good life was so elusive
Handouts, they got me down
I had to regain my confidence
So I got into camouflage

The girls they love to see you shoot

I love a man in a uniform [Repeat: x4]

I need an order
(shoot, shoot)
I need an order
(shoot, shoot)
I need an order
(shoot, shoot)
I need an order
(shoot, shoot)

To have ambition
Was my ambition
Time with my girl I spent it well
(you must be joking, o man you must be joking)

The girls they love to see you shoot
The girls they love to see you shoot

I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform
(they love to see you shoot)
I love a man in a uniform

The girls they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform
(they love to see you shoot)

The girls they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform
(they love a, they love a, they love a)
(they love to see you shoot)

The girls they love to see you shoot

I love a man in a uniform
(they love a they love a they love a bang bang)
