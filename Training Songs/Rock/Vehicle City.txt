Uncovered hands are freezing 
I swear its colder than its ever been 
And I miss the feeling 
There's cars along this shit street 
I don't recognize 
I'll stay outside and watch the walls fall harder than the last time 

In the morning when you wake up 
If you change your mind, I'll understand 
Just try to let me know 
I'll still keep the motor running 

With all these bodies empty, 
I'm sickened I can't see through some 
My home away from home 
The faces change but all the songs remain the same 
It hurts sometimes to know what we once loved was left behind 

In the morning when you wake up, 
If you change your mind, I'll understand 
Just try to let me know 
I'll still keep the motor running 

Uncovered hands are still freezing 
I know its colder than its ever been 
And nothing radiates 
The arches glow but they will never shine the same 
At least to me 
So comes the exodus. My family 

In the morning when you wake up, 
If you change your mind, I'll understand 
But I know who I am 
I'll still keep the motor running 

In the morning when you wake up 
In the morning when you wake up 
In the morning when you wake up
