Knock down the doors and break through the walls 
Tear out the phone run from it all 
I'm here to tell ya babe 
It's been one of those days 
I get a feelin' when I'm feelin' like this 
My heart's a target you never miss 
You got a way of puttin' everything in its place 
Takin' your time 
It's all that you're sayin' just how you say it 
A serious game you start to playin' 
You never cease to amaze me. 

[Chorus]
It's your voice I hear drivin' me wild 
Whispering in my ear 
It's your voice I hear dangerous child 
You're sayin' what I want to hear 
If I had my choice I'd run for cover 

But I think It'll be OK 
'Cause all I needed to hear 
Was the sound of your voice 

Curl your words up into the air run your poetry through my hair 
Call me that name you call me when there's no one around 
Take your time take all your precious time 
It's all that ya sayin' just how you say it 
Serious game you start to playin' you never fail to amaze. 

[Chorus]

Bye baby bye bye 
I can tell ya that I miss the sound of your voice already 
Bye baby bye bye 
It doesn't matter where I go 
It's your voice I hear 
If I had my choice I'd run for cover 

But I think I'll be OK 
I can't say I'm going crazy 
But you make a pretty good case 
And you never fail to amaze 

It's your voice I hear drivin' me wild 
Whispering in my ear 
It's your voice I hear dangerous child 
You're sayin' what I want to hear 
It's your voice I hear drivin' me wild 
Whispering in my ear 
It's your voice I hear dangerous child 

You're sayin' what I want to hear 
It's your voice It's your voice 
It's your voice
