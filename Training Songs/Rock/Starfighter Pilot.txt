Andrew's a star fighter pilot
He can get high in his jet
Tells me about all his women
He can get any I'll bet
Andrew's a star fighter pilot
He knows all the girls in the world
He's better than James Kirk or Tweeky
I cradle his picture at night
You know I'll think of you
Your picture on the wall
I would raise my drink to you
But I'll stay sober just for you
Andrew's a star fighter pilot
I watch him on TV each day
I've got all the toys from his program
And all of his past shows on tape
