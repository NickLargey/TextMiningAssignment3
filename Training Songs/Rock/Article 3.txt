You wanna lock me away cuz I hurt
I was a sad and lonely child
You’re embarrassed of me because I’m ugly
I’m burdened by fads and fashion
Curses to the cultures of hair
The devil comes calling in the form of despair
“Cuz I lied, you think you’re better than me?”
We’re all patriots of a lying scheming regime
I’m the offspring of an obsolete machine
And now you want to lock me away
Because I praise Creation

You wanna lock me away, lock me away
You wanna lock me away, lock me away
The devil comes calling in the form of despair

I praise Creation
