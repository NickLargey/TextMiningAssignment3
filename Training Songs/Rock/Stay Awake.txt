Well I know that we are dead,
And my only regret
Is I gave you all I have,
And you just left

now all that's left
Are the memories and the pain
Because now I sleep on blades
Just to stay awake

I think it's time you listen to what I say;
I don't care if it takes a million days
Toget this through
Another year is almost over
But I'm the one that's coming to an end

what did you want me to do ?
I'll never wake this far from you
And if I never sleep again
It will be too soon!
