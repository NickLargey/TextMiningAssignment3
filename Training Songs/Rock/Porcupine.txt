There is no comparison 
Between things about to have been 
Missing the point of our mission 
Will we become misshapen? 
A change of heart 
Will force the nail 
Nailed to the door 
To all avail 
There are no divisions 
Between things about to collide 
Hitting the floor with our vision 
A focus at some point arrives 
A change of mind 
Will force the nail 
To hit the head 
And set the sail 
A change of skin 
Will shed the tail 
Hung on the wall 
For use again 
A change of heart 
Will force the nail... 
(There is no comparison 
Between things about to have been)
Smash the pig 
This pork is mine 
I'm pining for the pork 
Of the porcupine 
I'd best be on my best behavior 
Best behave yourself you hear 
There are silent ways of wishing now
Wish I had what's turning round 
Round the corridor 
There are people there 
Through the peephole I can see me down 
Very nice 
Some pressure feelings 
You know how you hope 
For something to hope for 
There 
What is that paper there 
Paper is a colander
Colander's picking holes in me 
He's ____ the holy water there 
Water's paper like an impure____
A strange moment as your ________
