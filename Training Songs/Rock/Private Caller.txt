What a surprise I found you here
What a surprise you came to me
What a surprise I held within, oh
What a great mess we're in
You always covered your ears when I confessed
How I like you, I like you, I like you

So is it true what the saying says? Whatever, whatever

You didn't need a private caller, I didn't need another friend
You never picked up the receiver till you grabbed me by the hand
You didn't need a private caller, you didn't need another man
Till I was on the other end, till I was on the other end

What a surprise you drank some wine
What a surprise you're drunk and fly
What a surprise you understand I'm
Figuring out where to land
You always covered my eyes when you undress
But I see you, I see you, I see you

So is it true what the saying says? Well whatever, whatever

You didn't need a private caller, I didn't need another friend
You never picked up the receiver till you grabbed me by the hand
You didn't need a private caller, you didn't need another man
Till I was on the other end, till I was on the other end
You're calling me a private caller

You didn't need a private caller, you didn't need another friend
You never picked up the receiver till you grabbed me by the hand
You didn't need a private caller, you didn't need another man
And never ever had his powers, never ever had a plan
You didn't need a private caller, till I was on the other end
Till I was on the other end, till I was on the other end
You're calling me a private caller
