Hey hey hey I heard her breathe
I hear a moan while I sleep
It's the rickety-racking of some bones on their back legs
Sweat drips.

Hey hey hey I heard a lowly moan
Of a womankind left on her own,
In an empty hole and the empty room

And hey I hear the water break
I hear the noise that babies make
Have you felt the shake? 
Can you feel the shake?
When you lays you down,
She throws you down?

It's the love sound
It's the love sound
It's that love sound
It's the love sound
It's the love sound
It's that love sound

Hey hey hey can you tell me how to kill this shame?
How to box it up, how to numb this pain?
Can you make me clean?
Can you make it so it no longer hurts me when

The water breaks
I hear the noise that babies make
Have you felt the shake? 
Can you feel the shake?
When he lays you down,
When she throws you down?

It's the love sound
It's the love sound
It's that love sound
It's the love sound
It's the love sound
It's that love sound

You hear him moaning in your bed
You hear him moan, you hear him moan,

It's the love sound
It's the love sound
It's that love sound.
