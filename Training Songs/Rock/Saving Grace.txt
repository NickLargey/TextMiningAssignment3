So we drive and we've driven 10,000 miles
In our hometown
Sink back into the driveway
Which is Zen 

The head in the stairs
Or the body in the chair?
A Saving Grace at odds with technology 
A Saving Grace

18 with a bottle of water 
Cold jeans and the face of Gibraltar
How many trunks of your goods?
How many goods do you give away?

I'm spellbound when I can't move 
I stand in front of you
I'm flipping back through the pages of 
Your calandar and your books
And your childhood and your looks

I try to move in your direction 
Against the grain of time
I'm hoping to recollect my thoughts and motions
I pray to science and history 
Like cancer doesn't grow

I worship and forget you 
Bye
Worship and forget you
A Saving Grace 

And holding on to what we've made
As it drags us by the legs 
Across the living room
Put the children to bed
For a good night For tomorrow
