You're the epitome of innocence
You're only my destination
And all I think about is yesterday
I need you here in the now

In my heart, in my soul, in the now
In my heart, in my soul, in the now

I said it, baby
All my life was so wrapped up in you
And I could only wish
That you could feel the way I do

I found a love and I can't get enough
To have you suddenly
Standing right in front of me

I may be lonely but I'm not alone
And we don't need conversation
I'm only happy when I hear you moan
You speak the pleasure within

In my heart, in my soul, in the now
In my heart, in my soul, in the now

We claimed last summer darlin'
You began to slowly bend my way
Love is like it, we got no shame
And time is standing still

All my life, I never felt this way before
Learnin' what I never
You were what I'm searching for

In my heart, in my soul, in the now
In my heart, in my soul, in the now

This is the story of what might have been
It's just my imagination
I made it up instead of givin' in 
In the now

I may be crazy but I'm not alone
I call it intoxication
They say tomorrow is another day
I'm only here in the now

In my heart, in my soul, in the now
In my heart, in my soul, in the now

I may be lonely but I'm not alone
And we don't need conversation
I'm only happy when I hear you moan
You speak the pleasure within

You're the epitome of innocence
You're only my destination
And all I think about is yesterday
I need you here in the now

I may be lonely but I'm not alone
And we don't need conversation
I'm only happy when I hear you moan
You speak the pleasure within

You're the epitome of innocence
You're only my destination
