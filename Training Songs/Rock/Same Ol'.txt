I believe
If a man could fly
I'd be just like a bird
Trying to escape from your lies
And the truth
Would never die
It would be just like I remembered
When you
Swallowed my pride

When you were talking that
Same ol'
And kept making that
Same ol
And kept working that
Same ol', ol'
Fool out of me
All that same ol'
Everyday it's that same ol'
You keep making the same ol'
Ol'
Fool out of me, yeah

But you know that I can sleep
I don't know just how you do it
Must be counting more than sheep
And it's time
For you and me
To leave this fairy tale we fucked
'Cause we, both need to breathe, yeah

And I know it's not enough
But your love is like a drug
I know it's not enough
But your love is like a drug

I know it's not enough
Your love is like a drug
Your love is like a, like a
But you just keep talking that

Same ol'
And keep working that
Same ol'
And keep making that
Same ol', ol'
Fool out of me
All that same ol'
You keep making the same ol'
You keep making the same ol'
Fool out of me

But you just keep talkin' about
Same ol'
And keep making that
Same ol'
And keep making that
Same ol', ol'
Fool out of me
All that same ol'
Everyday it's that same ol'
You keep making the same ol'
Ol'
Fool out of me
