My goal was fame and fortune at the start,
I played and sang to make my dreams come true.
But darling, listen carefully with your heart,
'Cause tonight I'm singing just for you,
Yes, tonight I'm singing just for you.

I hear my records on the radio.
I hope tonight my dear you hear them, too.
For though they're dedicated to Ann and Jane and Sue,
Tonight I'm singing just for you,
Tonight I'm singing just for you.

Each girl feels I'm singing for her and only her,
For each girl knows that what I sing is true.
But darling, the real reason they believe in me
Is because I'm so in love with you
And they can feel that love light shining through.
