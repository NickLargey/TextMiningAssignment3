I THINK A LOT ABOUT YOU

Words & Music by Margo Guryan

Somewhere it is sunny
And people may be happy
And somewhere there are people
Making money by the week
But I can't think about that
All I can think about is you

You walked into my life
Smiling on a cold and windy day
If I hadn't been careful
You would've stole my heart away

But I think once
And I think twice 
About everything I do
And what I do
I think a lot about you

Somewhere it is raining
And people are unhappy
And people are complaining
That the world has gone to pot 
But I don't worry a lot
I think a lot about you

You walked into my life 
Looking like a lion to be tamed 
If I hadn't controlled me 
You know I might have been ashamed
(In the morning)

But I think once 
And I think twice 
About everything I do
And what I do
I think a lot about you
