It's ok In a way
I just can not see it
If you take What I have
I just can't belive it
Try to sort it all out
It's a way of dreaming

You will keep In my way
As a case of sorrow
Try to feel Not a thing
At least until tomorrow
Give me your medicine
If you go, I'll follow

What's that about

What is that All about
Leaving me defenceless
Leaving me With a sight
That I just can't let go
It's a thing on my mind
If I go, will you follow

If you go I'll Follow
