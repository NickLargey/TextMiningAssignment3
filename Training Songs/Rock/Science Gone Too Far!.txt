Hark! Listen he
I've been locked in this laboratory fifteen years
I had a thirst and desire
Till you came along and it all back fired
It held the key to understand
All of the secrets stored in man
Now it will ravage all in its path
As it grows! as it grows!
As it grows and grows and grows and grows

Science gone too far!
Science gone too far!
How did you ever break the jar?
Science gone too far
Science gone too far!
Maybe it hasn't crawled too far?

Don't let it die
Its molecular structure is one of a kind
It's a world gone haywire
Radiation only added the fuel to the fire

Now there's a creature on the loose
Mammoth proportions it has induced
Innocent people have to die
As it grows! as it grows!
As it grows and grows and grows and grows

Science gone too far!
Science gone too far!
How did you ever break the jar?
Science gone too far!
Science gone too far!
Maybe it hasn't crawled too far?
