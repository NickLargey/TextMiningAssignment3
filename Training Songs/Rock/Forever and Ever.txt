As it was in the beginning then so should it end
Don't let a lover become just a friend
Oh no.
I made you a promise I vowed I would keep
The candle 's still burning the river runs deep

My love
Didn't you know
Didn't you feel
Couldn't you tell that it was real
Couldn't you tell that it was real.
I'll dedicate to you all my love my whole life through

I'll love you forever and ever ev'ry day ev'ry hour we share
I'll treasure you I swear I'll love you forever and ever.
What we joined together
Let none tear apart
We give one another our hand and our heart
My love
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Will love last forever I know that it must

My love
Now you can see
Now you can feel
Now you can tell that it was real
Now you can tell that it was real.
I'll dedicate to you all my love my whole life through
