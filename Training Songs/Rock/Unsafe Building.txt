Declare yourself an unsafe building
Suffer the indignation of your world,

To climb the ladders you've gotta suss out the snakes
Remember your height remember to never look down.
'Cause now you've made your choice you've gotta take your chance
Find a way out now you're
Unsafe unsafe

Come out of the cupboard and into the real world
Open the window and let some light into your life
It's dark in the tunnel but keep on coming through
Straight down the line and sure enough you'll see the lights that shine

'Cause now you're young you've got to run you've got to take your chance

Get out you can.

I
I have declared myself unsafe
I have declared myself unsafe
Unsound, unknown, unwanted, unnecessary
I've been condemned
I'm unsafe

Behind the wardrobe there lies a better life
Burn all your old clothes start again make yourself something new
And the bed you've made no you need not sleep in it
Throw back the covers and make all of your dreams come true
Rebuild your life rebuild your home rethink your values
Rethink yourself right through

I
I have declared myself unsafe
I have declared myself unsafe
Unsound, unknown, unwanted, unnecessary
I've been condemned
I'm unsafe

And leave behind your bridges burning
Take to hills your time will soon come

Because you're here for a purpose but you'll have to search for it
Whatever it is you have got to decide

'Cause now you're young you've got to run
Don't waste your life don't waste your life.

I
I have declared myself unsafe
I have declared myself unsafe
Unsound, unknown, unwanted, unnecessary
I've been condemned

Who cares
