Everybody knows,
Everybody knows,
That you cradle the sun, sun
Living in remorse,
Sky is over,

Don't you want to hold me baby,
Disappointed, going crazy,

Even though we cant afford
The sky is over,
Even though we cant afford
The sky is over,
I don't want to see you go,
The sky is over
Even though we cant afford
The sky is over,

Behind closes eyes lie
The minds ready to awaken you,
Are you at war with land
And all of its creatures,
Your not-so-gentle persuasion
Has been known to wreck economies
Of countries, of empires, the sky is over,

Don't you want to hold me baby,
Disappointed, going crazy,

Not even from the sun,
Not even from the sun
Not even from the sun,
Don't you want me to run,

Even though you cant afford
The sky is over,
Even though we cant afford
The sky is over,
I don't want to see you go,
The sky is over
Even though we cant afford
The sky is over,
I don't want to see you go,
The sky is over
Even though we cant afford
The sky is over,
I don't want to see you go,
The sky is over
Even though we cant afford
The sky is over,
The sky is over us.
