Beyond blind sight, I walk behind and let love lead the way
It's deep inside, where my faith lies, it never fades away
All that I lost and left behind, I won't forget the tears I've cried
Don't mind the cost for my own fight, lean towards the light

Still waiting, not fading, my hunger is still alive
Not give in, not stumble, the wonder is in my eyes
Not lost in translation, because I'm facing the truth inside
Reach for the light in me

So unresolved, I go alone, I'm searching for a home
I picture me in worlds I've seen, my dreams they have all shore
I know my name, but who's the same when everything you knew is lost
I'm filled with hope that echo's loud, inside of forgotten mind

Still waiting, not fading, my hunger it's still alive
Not give in, not stumble, the wonder is in my eyes
Not lost in translation, because I'm facing the truth inside
Reach for the light

Silent wind, hold my sky, lift me from the ground
Follow you, trust in you

Still waiting, not fading, my hunger is still alive
Not give in, not stumble, the wonder is in my eyes
Not lost in translation, because I'm facing the truth inside
Reach for the light

Still craving, safe haven, a mirror that I can hide
Belong and stay strong and rely on all that I find
These faces, they haunt me I see them deep in the night
Reach for the light

Still waiting, not fading, my hunger is still alive
Not give in, not stumble, the wonder is in my eyes
Not lost in translation, because I'm facing the truth inside
Reach for the light in me

In me, in me
Reach for the light
Reach for the light
