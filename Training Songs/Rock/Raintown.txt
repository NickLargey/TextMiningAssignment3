It`s a rain dirt town job hurts but it don`t pay
All these calls they`re making me and driving you insane
Don`t you see
Don`t you understand
Waiting for the phone to ring to make me all I am.
You`re in the suburbs waiting for somewhere to go
I`m down here working on some dumb show
In a raintown
Raintown
Rain down
On all those tired eyes and tears and frowns
In a raintown
Raintown
Rain down
On all those days you`re not around
It takes a big hearted girl from the North Country you can tell
How you payed those bills and went through
Heaven and hell
And you
You cried and you traveled and you spat but you never asked
Well how long how long how long is this pain
You`re on for three minutes trying hard to say hello
I`m down here working on some dumb show
In a Raintown
Raintown
Rain down
On all those tired eyes and tears and frowns
In a Raintown
Raintown
Rain down
On all those days you`re not around
Sitting at home listening to your radio
Listening for your old friend talking on some dumb show
What`s he saying
What`s he saying
What`s he saying
In a Raintown
Raintown
Rain down
On all those tired eyes and tears and frowns
In a Raintown
Raintown
Rain down
On all those days you`re not around
Raintown
Rain down
On all those tired eyes and tears and frowns
Raintown
Rain down
On all those days you`re not around
You`re not around
You`re not around
