I got a six-pack
And nothing to do!
I've got a six-pack
And I don't need you

Thrity-five dollards and a six pack to my name (six-pack!) 
Spent the rest on beer so who's to blame? (six-pack!) 
They say I'm fucked up all the time (six-pack!) 
"Well, the dude's a waste of time" (six-pack!) 

I know it'll be okay
I get a six pack in me, all right 
My girlfriend asked me which one do I like better? (sixpack!)
I hope the answer don't upset her (six-pack!)
I was born with a bottle in my mouth (six-pack!)  
Now I've got six so I'll never run out (six-pack!) 

I know it'll be okay
When I get a six pack in me, well, all right!

Aah, thrity-five dollars and a six pack to my name six pack! 
Spent the rest on beer so who's to blame six pack! 
They say I'm fucked up all the time six pack! 
But I know they're a waste of time six pack! 

Six-pack
Six-pack
Six-pack

What do they know about partying
Or anything else?
