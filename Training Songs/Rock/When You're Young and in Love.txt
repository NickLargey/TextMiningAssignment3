(la la la la la la la....)
Spring in the air (filled with love), 
there's magic everywhere,
when you're young and in love. 

Life seems to be (just a dream),
a world of fantasy, 
when you're young and in love. 

Each night seems just like the 4th of july, 
with stars that spangle the sky.  

The moon at night (shines so bright),
seems to shine twice as bright, 
when you're young and in love. 

Dreams can come true (cry a dream), 
if you believe they do,  
when you're young and in love. 

chorus:
So many teardrops about to fall. 
True love can conquer all, 
when you're, 
when you're young and in love.  

Trust and you'll find (ooo),
there's no mountain you can't climb, 
when you're young and in love.  

chorus:
So many teardrops about to fall.  
True love can conquer all.

 young and in love, 
(young and in love),
yound and in love, 
(young and in love),
young and in love,
(young and in love),
young and in love,
(young and in love),
young and in love.
