I've been dreaming of a red bird
And the peace of its gentle wings
It's an omen of better things
I've been waking with the same pain
That makes me want to sleep
And dream of a red bird
So build us a nest, for I've chosen to leave
For I am so so heavy here
Come to me tonight and I'll be waiting
With my wings
I will of left the weight behind me that
The blood of men brings
Where there once was despair
Tonight I will be free
And the slings and the stones that uncovered
My bones will have flown my memory
I've been dreaming of a red bird
It sings of a way out, it sings of release
It's been tapping on my window
To remind me it's waiting
And that I have a choice
So build us a nest, for I've chosen to leave
For I am so heavy here
Take me away from here
I am not equipped for such strain
Take away the fear
How do you prepare for the pain
Now I'm leaving with the red bird
And as my arms leak again
I am so happy here
