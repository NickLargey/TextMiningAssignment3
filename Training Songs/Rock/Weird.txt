I've been thinking all day, but I've got nothing good to say
There's a war on my mind, let me leave it all behind
Things we'll never share are hangin' heavy in the air
With all the weird on the way, let me have a perfect day
But paranoia's contagious; I'm coming down with it, too
You better throw your trust on the fire first
Before I do
It's a world of demand, it doesn't stop to understand
And it's of world in demands, doesn't stop to understand you
If you're waitin' on me to tie you up, set you free
You'll be waitin' all day, all I want to do is play
But paranoia's contagious; I'm coming down with it, too
Better throw your trust on the fire first
Before I do
Before I do
And if we want to be happy, it's all here to be used
But settin' the world on fire burns, I thought you knew
You thought I knew
We never knew
We never ever knew
We never knew
We never knew
