Shot through the heart it's all part of the game we call love

Would you be content to see me crying
After all those little games you put me through?
After all I've done for you you're lying
Wouldn't it be nice to tell the truth?

Didn't somebody somewhere say
You're gonna take a fall?
I gave you everything
Now here's the curtain call

Shot through the heart as I lay there alone in the dark
Through the heart it's all part of the game we call love

Now you've come back here to say you're sorry
But I just don't know who you're talking to
It could be the man I used to be, girl
But I've grown up and now I'm over you

Standing there just a livewire
With nowhere left to turn
You were gonna set the world on fire
When will you ever learn?

Shot through the heart as I lay there alone in the dark
Through the heart it's all part of the game we call love

Didn't somebody somewhere say
You're heading for a fall?
I gave you everything
Now here's the curtain call
And I'm shot

Baby does what baby please
And baby must have what she sees
But not this time the tables turned
Baby, you just got burned

Shot through the heart as I lay there alone in the dark
Through the heart it's all part of the game we call love
