The moon hangs high when the clock strike two
The night drags by while I think of you
I cry and cry till the dawn breaks through
Gee, but I'm lonesome

I light the flame beneath my coffee pot
Repeat your name till the coffee is hot
It's all the same if it's good or not
Gee, but I'm lonesome

I wait for the mail
But I know that the mailman ain't gonna bring any word from you
I weaken and then start weepin' again
'Coz I can't think of anything else to do

I try so hard not to feel so low
'Coz by and by you'd be back, I know
So why baby why must I worry so?
Gee, but I'm lonesome

Well, baby darling, it's hard to do
Anything else with anybody but you
And gee, gee, but I'm lonesome
