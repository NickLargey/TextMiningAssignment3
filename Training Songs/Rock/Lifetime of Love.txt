There is a girl
She really is fine, so fine
I know one day
She's gonna be mine, be mine

She is so fine
I'll make her mine
Her name is Caroline, Caroline

She is the fairest of them all
And I'll come running when she calls

She is the girl
The girl of my dreams, my dreams
She's on my mind
Forever it seems, it seems

With her forever
We'll dream together
Just me and Caroline, Caroline
