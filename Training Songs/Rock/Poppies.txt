Long long ago in China I'm told 
To England was traded some tea 
And so sealed the fate 
In pieces of eight 
All England and all of the world 
Yeah, poppies 
When soon his majesty sent soldiers and thieves 
To India searching for gold 
Instead from the ground 
Some magic they found 
Something far better I'm told 
Yeah, poppies 
Yeah, poppies 
And now this story told from days of our own 
When gossamer doggies ran ran 
They'd patiently wait 
With pieces of eight 
So everybody could smile one more time 
Yeah, poppies 
Yeah, poppies
