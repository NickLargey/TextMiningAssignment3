You don't know how much I love you 
You don't know how much I care 
You don't know how much I need you 
Without you life I can't bear 
You don't know 
You don't know baby 
You don't know how much I love you 
And you can't know just how I feel 

The flame that you lit is still burnin' 
Burnin' deep down in my soul 
When I think of your lovin' and kissin'
It makes my blood run cold 
You don't know baby 
You don't know baby 
Yes you don't know how much I love you 
And you can't know just how I feel 

All my friends call me crazy 
For acting the way that I do 
But I just can't help myself 
'Cause I'm so in love with you 
You don't know 
Yes baby you don't know 
You don't know how much I love you 
And you can't know just how I feel 

You don't know 
You don't know 
You don't know baby 
You don't know 
You don't know 
You don't know baby 
You don't know 

Yes you don't know how much I love you 
And you can't know just how I feel
