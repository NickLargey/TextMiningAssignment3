I'm gonna get stabbed
The Baltic Fleeto are up my ass
No cavalry could ever save me
I'm gonna get stabbed.

You don't want to stab me,
You don't want to stab me,
Cause you don't know my family
And our capabilities.
You don't want to stab me.

I had my choice, I took my choice
That was to stand and fight the Fleeto Boys
But now I find myself running for my life
I seen their swords and their knives
And I changed my mind.

It's time to go,
It's time to run.
Run rabbit run.
Run rabbit run.
