Sister, visit us while you still can,
Sister, don't you forget my number, on the door.
You've got something and it's so good to see,
Something wonderful that I could not be.
Everybody hanging on for their lives,
But you can't help them 'cause you don't have the time.

I know, everyone goes any damn place they like.
I hope this goes over well, on the toxic radio. 
Yeah.

You get taken all the time for a fool.
I don't know why.
You're so gullible but I don't mind.
That's not the problem.
And I don't need anyone with me right now.
Monday, Tuesday is my weekend.
You get taken for a fool all the time.
I don't know why.

The ? are putting it on me
I can't let you 'cause I see what it means,
It's so early I don't want to wake up.
I wish I left you 'cause we never grew up.
Mama, it feels like just yesterday.
Mama, don't you forget my number
I don't want to be the one at the door.

I know, everyone goes any damn place they choose.
And I hope everyone well on the toxic radio.
A tourist, in the ghetto, not afraid of anything.
Except death, and anything else, that could maybe hurt the most. Yeah.
