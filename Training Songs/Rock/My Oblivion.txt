She's my oblivion, 
It's to her I run
Out on the balcony, 
She waits for me
Out on the boundary, 
She smiles

She's my oblivion, 
Which way to turn?
The edges of our love,
Are in the stars.
And on the balcony,
She waits for me.
Out on the boundary,
She smiles.

Make this alive
Good days are back
Open your eyes when it falls
Come back to the air

I can't tell you what you already know
I can't make you feel what you already feel
I can't show you what's in front of you
I can't heal those scars

She's my oblivion
And my skin burns
Her hands all over me
She whispers:
The edges of our love, are in the stars"

Good days are alive
Good days are back
Open your eyes when it falls
Come back to the air

So look down to the street below
Don't look up to the stars above
You look around
See what's in front of you
Don't look down, don't look down

Can you see the light?
It shines onto us tonight
Can you see the light?
It's all around you
