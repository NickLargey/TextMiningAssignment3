Dreams that I can't trace
Pull my heart away
From love I long to taste
Why do I run away
When I come face to face with anything I need

I am so afraid
If I keep hoping
That there will come a day
When my heart is open
That you will walk away
Like you were never there

And I don't know all the truth
From the lying
But I know that I need you
Because I am dying
From being held by hell
In a cell of blinding fear

Libera, libera, libera me
From this dark dream
To the life stream
Libera, libera, libera me
From this bruised soul
Living half-whole
Libera, libera, libera me

I know there is a place
Free from no borders
Before I turn this grace
Into disorder
I've got to find a way
Out of this chaos
