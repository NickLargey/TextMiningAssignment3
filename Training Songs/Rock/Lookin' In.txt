Suddenly, it came to me
A potent dosage of reality
I saw myself in the broad daylight
And it made me think
About life

I'm not the kinda guy
Who nods his head
With closed eyes
I scoff at labels
I defy censuses

And despise group mentality
All along I through
That this was only human
But I know now that
I'm in the minority

I'm lookin' in
Now I think in relation to
My fellow man
And what strives to do we fail to see

There's no compromise
Our evolution
Is our demise
One day you may find
That you are also one of me

A microcosm
Of the human race
Observing those around us
Desiring to belong
Behind the guise of salvation
We suffer along the way
We're lookin' in
