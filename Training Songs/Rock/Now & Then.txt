Across the world, as far as I could be.
I think of you, and what you want to take from me,
But now I'm not waiting on sunrise to come again.
And though my eyes are opening,
It's only now and then,
But I'll never know when.
Time is not the only one to wait,
It's just enough to dream of yesterday,
And now it's slipping away.
You know that 
I'm not waiting on sunrise to come again,
And though my eyes are opening,
It's only now and then,
And I'm not believing.
All that I've been needing
To take me to another day.
The way to a second
Life, where I was beckoned
Back again, someday.
But now I'm not waiting on sunrise to come again,
And though my eyes are opening,
It's only now and then.
But I'll never know when.
I'll never, I'll never know when.
I'll never, I'll never know when.
I'll never, I'll never know when.
I'll never, I'll never know when.
I'll never, I'll never know when.
