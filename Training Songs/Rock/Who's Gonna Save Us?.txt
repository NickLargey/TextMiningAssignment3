It's all around me and I just don't understand
Seems all out of place now
And I know it's late
But you know what they say now

We're under attack now
Our work is all cut out
Whatever happened to your rights?
And I know it's late
But you know what they say now

So where's the writing on the wall
Who's gonna save us?
Who's gonna provide us?
Who's gonna divide us?
Who's gonna save us

We're under powered now
Trial devoured now
Step aside and make way for the new leader
And it's getting late
But you know what the say now

[Chorus]
It's all around me and I just don't understand
Seems all out of place now
And I know it's late
But you know what they say now

[Chorus]

Looking for the writing on the wall
Who's gonna save us?
Who's gonna provide us?
Who's gonna divide us?
Who's gonna save us?
