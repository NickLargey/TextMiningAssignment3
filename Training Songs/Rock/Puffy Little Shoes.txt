Little puffy cloud with a tongue
Floatin' over a cheese puff rug, a lug
If I had a choice between those two
You know I'd obviously choose the one with the puffy little shoes

Shoe oo oo oo oo oo oo oos... my puffy little
Shoe oo oo oo oo oo oo oos...

Little skinny chicken on my plate
Big skinny skinhead he's up to here with hate
If I had a choice between those two
You know I'd obviously choose the one with the puffy little shoes

[Chorus:]
Shoe oo oo oo oo oo oo oos... my puffy little
Shoe oo oo oo oo oo oo oos...
My puffy little shoes
My puffy little shoes
My puffy little
Shoe oo oo oo oo oo oo oos...

Puffy little shoes
Puffy little shoes
Yeah, Urge overkill
I got puffy little...

Take a ride inside my eye
And this is what you will likely find

Big hammer mud ball breakin' my bones
Soft shoulder salamander's up close and alone
And if I had a choice between those two
I'd absolutely have to choose the one with the shoes
Little monkey clawin' at my face
And people pack into the Rock and Roll Place!
If I had a choice between those two
You know I'd obviously choose the one with the puffy little shoes

[Chorus]

Puffy little shoes
Puffy little shoes
Yeah
