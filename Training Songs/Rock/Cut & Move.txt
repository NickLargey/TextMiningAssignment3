Noticed the way you cut and move kind of reminds me
Of back in the day caught in my room running from myself
Digging for lights inside the hole of my heartache
Lost in the way I shouldn't go, waiting for someone else to

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, show me the way out of this
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, show me the way out of this hole
Show me the way out of this

Startled to wake up in the cold of denial
Scratching to gain back some control of this twisted dream
I hid from the light inside the home of my darkness
The voice through the door said, "I alone hold the key to your peace"

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, show me the way out of this
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, show me the way out of this
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, show me the way out of this hole
Show me the way out of this hole
Show me the way out of this hole

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, show me the way out of this
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, show me the way out of this
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, show me the way out of this hole
Show me the way out of this hole
Show me the way out of this hole
Show me the way out of this
