and i looked 
away from you 
and i found 
a better way to do it 
and i've seen 
some younger people happy 
as can be 
but not as especially happier than me. 
happier than me. 
you may run 
like a bitch in heat 
but it's fun 
to sometimes try to retreat from the sun 
cause it's awful lonely where i'm coming from 
where i'm coming from. 

retreat from the sun 
retreat from the sun 
retreat from the sun 
retreat from the sun
