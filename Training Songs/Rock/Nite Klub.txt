Is this the in place to be?
What am I doing here?
Watching the girls go by, spending money on

Sleep all day
It's the only way
I'm a parasite
I creep about at night

(Nite klub) is this the in place to be?
(Nite klub) what am I doing here?
(Nite klub) watching the girls go by, spending money on

Hey, hey, I don't work
'Cause I don't have to
I don't have to work
There's no work to do

(Nite klub) I'm a member of the nite klub, oh, oh
(Nite klub) a fully paid-up member of the nite klub

I won't dance in a club like this
All the girls are slags
And the beer tastes just like piss

I'm a parasite (nite klub)
I creep about at night (nite klub)
Yes, I'm a member of the Nite Klub
A fully paid-up member of the Nite Klub

(Nite klub) is this the in place to be?
(Nite klub) what am I doing here?
(Nite klub) watching the girls go by spending money on beer
