The way out
Is the way in
The way out
Is the way ay ay ay
The way out
Is the way in
The way out
Is the way ay ay ay

Out of touch
With the weather and the wind direction
With the sunrise
And the phases of the moon
Out of touch
With life in the land of the loving
With the living night
And the darkness at high noon

You can never break the chain
There is never love without pain
A gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart
A gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart

The way out
Is the way in
The way out
Is the way ay ay ay

The way out
Is the way in
The way out
Is the way ay ay ay

Out of sync
With the rhythm of my own reactions
With the things that last
And the things that come apart
Out of sync
With love in the land of the living
A gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart

You can never break the chain
There is never love without pain
A gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart
A healing hand, a secret touch on the heart

Way out and way in
Way out and way ay ay ay

Way out and way in
Way out and way ay ay ay

You can never break the chain
There is never love without pain
A gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart

You can never break the chain
(You can never break the chain)
Life is a power that remains
(Life is a power that remains)

A healing hand, a secret touch on the heart
A gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart

The way out
Is the way in
The way out
Is the way ay ay ay

The way out
Is the way in
The way out
Is the way ay ay ay
