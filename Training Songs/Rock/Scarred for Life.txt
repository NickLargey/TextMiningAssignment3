I grew up fast on a working class street 
First thing I learned was life don't come cheap 
Technical school it was a waste of time 
Makin' robots for some factory line 

Got my first tattoo when I was 16 
The rebel had lost his teenage queen 
I'd taken a stand for an outlaw's life 
My ma's words kept ringin', your scarred for life 

She said you're scarred, you've been scarred 

Scarred for life Scarred for life 
I fought my way through the trouble and strife 
I was scarred Scarred for life 
My reputation it cuts like a knife 

I spent some time a guest of the state 
I got out and wanted to go straight 
People don't forgive, the police force don't forget 
I was jailed for crimes I did not commit 
I was scarred, I was scarred 

Scarred for life Scarred for life 
I fought my way through the trouble and strife 
I was scarred Scarred for life 
My reputation it cuts like a knife 
I was scarred Scarred for life 
Been knocked around had a hell of a life 
I was scarred Scarred for life 
I fought my way through the trouble and strife 

I fought tooth and nail, every inch of the way 
I got scars...to prove it 
I was in love for keeps that time 
But rock'n'roll was still on my mind 
She was young and true and so full of life 
And the pain went deep, I was scarred for life 
I was scarred, I was scarred, scarred, scarred 
Scarred for life 

My reputation it cuts like a knife 
I was scarred Scarred for life 
Been knocked around I had a hell of a life 
I was scarred, scarred for life, scarred for life 
Yes I've been scarred, scarred for life, scarred for life 

Yes I've been scarred...I've been scarred 
Scarred for life
