Take me out of this state I'm in
Go somewhere I've never been
Got something trapped inside
Still alive, where's that paradise?

I thought by now I'd find
Rough justice is a long lifeline
Back and forth between the desert and the sea
Who I was and I will always be

Oh yeah, woo hoo
Too bad, woo hoo
So sad, woo hoo

Get me out of this state I'm in
When I spiral down, it's a vile spin
Got something I can't hide
Still alive, it's an overwhelming drive

To prevail and get out of this jail
Dust in my eyes and a tear in my sail
Back and forth between the desert and the sea
Who I was and I will always be

Oh yeah, woo hoo
Too bad, woo hoo
So sad, woo hoo

Take me out 'cause I'm all alone
Hair undone, despair unknown
Got something trapped inside
Still alive, it's a momentary ride

I've been on a thousand years too long
A thousand years too late for everything that's wrong
Back and forth between the desert and the sea
Who I was and I will always be

Oh yeah, woo hoo
Too bad, woo hoo
So sad, woo hoo

Oh yeah, woo hoo
Oh yeah, woo hoo
Oh yeah, woo hoo
