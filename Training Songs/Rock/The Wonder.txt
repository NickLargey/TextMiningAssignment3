I see flashing eyes
And they're flashing across to me
And burnin' up the sky
And sun shinin' into me

And your locus crown
And cop-killin' heartbeat
Head's lookin' down
And bowin' out to the street

I'm just walking around
Your city is a wonder town

Lips red to white
Lips green in blacked night
Your spirit flares
And flarin' up leonine

I'm just walking around
Your city is a wonder town

The transmitter rhyme
The transmitter all the time
Lookin' up to the sky
I'm seeing ghosts flyin'

I'm just walkin' around
Your city is a wonder town

I think I been there once before
Something tells me there's so much more
She's back in town to even the score
It's time to go

See flashing eyes
And they're flashing 'cross to me
And burnin' up the sky
Sun shining into me

Your locus crown
And cop-killin' heartbeat
Head's lookin' down
Bowin' out to the street

I'm just walkin' around
Your city is a wonder town
