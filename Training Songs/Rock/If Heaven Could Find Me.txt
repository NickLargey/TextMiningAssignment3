If heaven could find me somebody
Someone to hold me when I sleep
If heaven could find me somebody
Someone to show me what I need
I need someone to love me
I need someone to care
Watching each day pass so slowly
Gets to me more than I can bear
I've been waiting here for so long
You're not even near
Yeah, yeah
You shattered my illusions
When you left me
Had me down, crawling on my knees
Hoping each day you'd come and find me
Hoping you'd see my misery
I need someone to love me
I need someone to care
Watching each day pass so slowly
Gettin' me more than I can bear
I've been waiting here for so long
You're not even near
You're not even near
If heaven could find me somebody
Someone to hold me when I sleep
If heaven could find me somebody
Someone to show me what I need
I need someone to love me
I need someone to care
Watching each day pass so slowly
Gets to me more than I can bear
I've been waiting here for so long
And you're not even near
You're not even near
You're not even near
