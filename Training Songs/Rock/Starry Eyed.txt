I have just closed my eyes again
Climbed aboard the dream weaver train
Driver take away my worries of today
And leave tomorrow behind

Dream weaver I believe
You can get me through the night
Dream weaver I believe
We can reach the morning light

Fly me high through the starry skies
Maybe to an astral plane
Cross the highways of fantasy
Help me to forget today's pain

Dream weaver I believe
You can get me through the night
Dream weaver I believe
We can reach the morning light

Though the dawn may be coming soon
There still may be some time
Fly me away to the bright side of the moon
And meet me on the other side

Dream weaver I believe
You can get me through the night
Dream weaver I believe
We can reach the morning light
