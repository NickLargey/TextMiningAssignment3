Ha! Ha! Said the clown, has the king lost his crown
Is the night being tight on romance
Ha! Ha! Said the clown, is it bringing you down
That you've lost your chance

Feeling low, gotta go, see a show in town
Hear the jokes, have a smoke, and a laugh at the clown
In a whirl, see a girl with a smile in her eyes
Never thought I'd be brought right down by her lies

In a trance, watch her dance to the beat of the drums
Faster now, sweating brow, I'm all the fingers and thumbs
Wonder why I hit the sky when she blows me a kiss
In a while, run a mile, I'm regretting all this

Ha! Ha! Said the clown, has the king lost his crown
Is the night being tight on romance
Ha! Ha! Said the clown, is it bringing you down
That you've lost your chance

Time to go, close the show, wave the people goodbye
Grab my coat, grab my hat, look that girl in the eye
Where's your home, what's your phone number, stop fooling 'round
Could have died, she replied, "I'm the wife of the clown"

Ha! Ha! Said the clown, has the king lost his crown
Is the night being tight on romance
Ha! Ha! Said the clown, is it bringing you down
That you've lost your chance

Ha! Ha! Said the clown, has the king lost his crown
Is the night being tight on romance
Ha! Ha! Said the clown, is it bringing you down
