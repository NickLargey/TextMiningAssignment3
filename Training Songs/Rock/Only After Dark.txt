I feel my spirit fly, only after dark 
I kiss the world goodbye, only after dark 
Nights with the city lights, only after dark 
Run like the wonder way, only after dark 

[Chorus]
Won't you disappear into midnight again 
Why don't you come, why won't you come 
Why won't you fly, fly, fly with me 
Sweet elusive fate will be our company 

Ring out the vamp in me, only after dark 
Moon sinful as can be, only after dark 
It's wrong to feel so free, only after dark 
Only you do it to me, only after dark 

[Chorus]
