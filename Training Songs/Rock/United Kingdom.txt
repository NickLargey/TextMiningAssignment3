Child keeps its toys hidden away
Till it wants to break them
Take your share and go away
Make sure you get the last word
Sit back out of harm's reach
Watch the little cup of poison
Chasing its own tail around and around
Until it's exhausted at its wits end

I try my best I wait for you to nail me
Now I try and never do
Anything they tell me
'Cause waiting about an inch
Under human nature
Tragedies and comedies
And a touching sense of failure

United Kingdom
When you held me in your arms
At the limits of your patience
I knew I'd always lose
Every scene of violence
When you held me in your arms
Why didn't you want me
When you held me in your arms
Why didn't you touch me

Well I used to know how
To slip through your blind spot
And now I just watch myself
Set the alarms off
I'm happier now in my shame
And don't look to you for anything
