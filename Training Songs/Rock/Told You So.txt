You said "Forget about Francesca, you'll always reign supreme."
You've just been spending time to pimp your self-esteem
What is it with you, silly silly man?
Once you've had a sweetheart that would have done all she can

Now you're fucking her
Lie around in her bed
But I'm the sweetest gone mama
You ever gonna get

So don't say I didn't
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
You keep wishing I was her
I'm afraid we don't compare

And don't say I didn't
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
What am I supposed to play?
Gotta mean just what you say

Memories keep calling
But I refuse to fall
Back to where we started
You never knew me at all
Never met a man that 
Could lie as good as you
I just wonder how she got you
And what she'll put you through

Now you're fucking her
And I hope you're satisfied
You've been busy for a while now
Watch my senses die

Don't say I didn't
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
You keep wishing I was her
I'm afraid we don't compare

And don't say I didn't
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
What am I supposed to play?
Gotta mean just what you say

Now you're fucking her
Lie around in her bed
But I'm the sweetest gone mama
You ever gonna get

Now you're fucking her
And I hope you're satisfied
You've been busy for a while now
Watch my senses die

So don't say I didn't
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
You keep wishing I was her
I'm afraid we don't compare

And don't say I didn't
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
What am I supposed to play?
Gotta mean just what you say
