I'm out in the streets
I'm feeling pretty save
I don't know
Where to go

I miss the warm sheets
Of my narrow city cave
I am drivin' slow
Stop and go

She said her love is deeper than I know
Is it so, that's what I'm aking myself

It's ten past ten
I stop for some gas
A pack of cigarettes
And a chat with the moon

The city disappears
I am counting my miles
It's cold outside
Tonight

She said her love is deeper than I know
Is it so, that's what I'm asking
She said her love is stronger than herself
Is that so, or am I just riding on a dead horse

Riding on a dead horse
