Somehow I lost my way
And now it's clear to me
All that I fought so hard to keep
Is all I had to leave

I know you can't hear me
And you won't believe me
But there is something I must say
Before I fade away

(This is the way the world ends again)

Forever we will be hollow
Forever we will be
Forever we will be hollow
Hollow again

So I'm left here waiting
So long I'm contemplating
And now I know how it is
But now it's far too late

How will we open up the eyes of the dead
When we are hollow, hollow

And all along here I was told
By fallen men in their charade
That we could find a hope inside
The safety of this empty place
