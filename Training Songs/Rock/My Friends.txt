My friends are so depressed
I feel the question
Of your loneliness
Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will

Ex girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate
On the prison phone
They want, to give her seven years
For being sad

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

My friends are so distressed
And standing on
The brink of emptiness
No words, I know of to express
This emptiness

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

Imagine me taught by tragedy
Release is peace
I heard a little girl
And what she said
Was something beautiful
To give, your love
No matter what
Yeah, what she said

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
