Waiting on the runway, rain falling down 
I always crawl by, can't get above the ground, 
I looked out at the window at the black clouds in the sky 
So lonesome I could die 
Well, we were on the lookout for adventure and fun 
Then we told each other it was over and done 
But here I go doing something I can't explain

Hey now little wild one, say why don't you 
take anything you, anything you want from me 
Hey now baby, don't you know I've been missing you 
Yes we were on the lookout for adventure and fun 
I shouldn't have told her it was over and done 
But I know i
