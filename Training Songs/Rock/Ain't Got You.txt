I say Blue - you say what
Blue - what - Blue - what

If you think I got it all,
By the way that I'm living,
Fast money on a roll,
Then I think you be mistaken.

If you think I have enough,
Got more that I'm needing,
It's not like that at all,
You don't have to believe me.

If I'm not what you're looking for,
Please tell me and I will go,
I'm not gonna waste your time,
Please tell me if you want to be mine.

[Chorus]
Got a shelf full of books  so?
Got a room full of clothes  so?
Got a house that I stay  so?
I ainÂ´t got you.

Got a box full of shoes  so?
Got a brand new phone  so?
Got the studio booked  so?
I ainÂ´t got you. 

Now you know what I'm about,
And the streets that I come from,
Unreasonable doubt,
Don't tell me that you have none.

On top of the world,
Like nothing's missing,
Never thought I need a girl,
But then I found myself wishing,

If I'm not what your looking for,
Please tell me and I will go,
I'm not gonna waste your time,
Please tell me if you want to be mine.

[Chorus]

I say Blue - You say what
Blue - what - Blue - what.

I try every single day too,
Get by every night I pray too,
Survive everything I say and do.

[Chorus]

I say Blue  You say what
Blue  what  Blue  what.
