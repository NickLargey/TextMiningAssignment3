Same old lines, hope on my street
People pace, just like a broken beat
Seven steps take me to your door
Seven steps each on a broken beat

And there's one more hour in my day and that's alright 
And there's one more hour in my day and that's alright

We step in I see another door
This old room feels like an overcoat
Feels like an overcoat
Window down to people on my street
See there smiles some wear an overcoat
Some wear an overcoat

And there's one more hour in my day and that's alright
And there's one more hour in my day and that's alright

One more hour, one more hour
