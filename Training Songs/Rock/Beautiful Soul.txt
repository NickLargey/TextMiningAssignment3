Rolled the stone like Sisyphus
You said "why me?" is not the question here
"Why not me?" was your answer
Walking with your head high
Facing the challenge gave you consciousness
A light that shows where true freedom is
It's hidden in the shadows
I wish I would have told you
In case I never showed you
I just wanna tell you

Beautiful soul
Beautiful soul
Don't
Don't
Don't you know?
You're a beautiful soul

Beautiful soul
Don't
Don't
Don't you know?
You're a beautiful soul

Oh, don't you know?
You're a beautiful soul
Oh roll your stone
You're a beautiful soul
Don't you know?
You're a beautiful soul

Oh roll your stone!
Roll your stone!

(Beautiful soul) you turn your bitter, make it so sweet
With laughter and serenity
I treasure every memory
Don't you know
(Beautiful soul) from the cradle to the grave
(Beautiful soul) your breath of life will remain
You see the world outside the cave
Don't you know?
You're a beautiful soul
