I found love, didn't even know I needed it 
But I found love, never even crossed my mind 
I found love, had a garden never weeded it 
But I found love, took an apple just in time 

I found love in the fall and it did not hurt at all 
I found sunlight and flowers, soft summer showers 
I can feel my heart touch my Adams apple 
I can feel the feather in my head 
There is a lightness, politeness, fingers tingle, tootsies tap 
till dawn comes and finds me never in my bed 

I found love, didn't even know I needed it 
But I found love, never even crossed my mind 

I found love in the spring and I did not lose a thing 
I found love in the fall and it did not hurt at all 
I found sunlight and flowers, soft summer showers. 
I can feel my heart touch my Adams apple 
I can feel the feather in my head 
There is a lightness, politeness, fingers tingle, tootsies tap 
till dawn comes and finds me never in my bed 

Had a garden never weeded it 
But I found love 
Took an apple just in time 

I found love in this world and my heart strings just unfurled 
I found love in the spring and I did not lose a thing 
I found love in the fall and it did not hurt at all 
I found love in this world and my heart strings just unfurled 
I found love in the spring and I did not lose a thing.
