Baby, am I what you're contemplating
Are you gonna tell me or keep me waiting
I gotta know what you're intending to do

You'll never get to heaven walkin' out on me
I know that things ain't what they used to be
You'll never get to heaven walking out on me
Oh no, I'll never let you go

I used to run my hands through your pockets
You used to feel my changes but now you've stopped it
I'm counting on you, I think you should understand

You'll never get to heaven walkin' out on me
I know that things ain't what they used to be
You'll never get to heaven walking out on me
Oh no, I'll never let you go

Down on your knees, the Devil's in his glory
Zero degrees, too cold to not be sorry
I'm begging you for heaven's sake
It's criminal to make the same mistake
Such drastic measures.

You'll never get to heaven walkin' out on me
I know that things ain't what they used to be
You'll never get to heaven walking out on me
Oh no, I'll never let you go
