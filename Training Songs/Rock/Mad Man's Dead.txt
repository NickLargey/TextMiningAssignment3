Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't upset me
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't upset me

Gotta tell it to you mom
Gotta tell it to you pa
Gotta tell it to the teacher
Gotta tell it to the preacher

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't upset me

Say it to the cops
Say it to the company
Everything is red
Buzzin' in my head
Everything is red
(Don't bother me)

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't upset me

I got on a black cat bone
This B.C bone weighs 16 ton
I got on a big black gun
This big black gun, I'm gonna use it son

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't upset me

Here comes my 19th
Nervous breakdown
I'm goin' downtown
