Fall advice!
Fall advice!
Fall advice!
Fall advice!

The Year Number 1
Has gone and turned 
Into Year of Bomb
TV wars 24 hours
But it happens
Fall advice!

Shaking my bones down the M14
Passenger seat gripped tight
And seriously
I cannot sleep
But I'm happy
I cannot eat
So what about it?

It happens
It happens
It happens
Fall advice!

The works down the drain
And interest never wanes
So what about it?

Fall advice!
Yak! Yak! Yak!
Some are born to life
Some are born depressed

About it
Fall advice!
To parties underground
You're driving around in lake districts

You're stepping around
It doesn't matter to me
'Cause it happens
It's magic
So what about it?
