That big eight wheeler rolling down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't coming back
I'm movin' on I'll soon be gone
You were flying too high for my little old sky so I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the Southland we're coming to you
We're movin' on oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me so I've set you free and I'm movin' on
[ banjo ]
Mister fireman won't you please listen to me
I've got a pretty woman in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal let the black smoke roll keep rollin' me on
[ fiddle ]
I warned you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
I'm movin' on I'm rollin' on
You broken your vow and it's all over now so I'm movin' on

But some day baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on stayed away too long
I'm through with you too bad you're blue so keep movin' on
