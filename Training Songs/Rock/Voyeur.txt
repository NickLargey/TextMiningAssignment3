There's a pill on my tongue
You wanna dance?

Come on brother, I know you're dying to lose your senses
Set your soul free
You're the ether, man I ain't lying
It's so expensive, all this beauty yeah alright

See the moon in my eye
So you think I'm a spy
But I'm just a voyeur
You wanna fly?

Come on sister, you should be flying to lose your senses
Set your soul free
You're the ether, man I ain't lying
It's so expensive, all this beauty yeah alright

Nothin' goes deeper than my love
Nothin' goes deeper than my love
Nothin' goes deeper than my love
Nothin' goes deeper baby
