I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
I thought you'd go then come back home
I thought the cold would leave by summer
But my quiet nights will be spent alone

You said then you'd be warmed up in springtime
Oh, you said that is when you started to be cold
No, no
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find myself all alone

You said then you'd be alive in autumn
Then you said you'd be the one to see the way
No, no, no, no, no
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer, oh
But now I find my love has gone away
Why didn't you stay?

I want to know why didn't you stay
Ah babe
Why didn't you, why didn't you
Why, I think I should know why didn't you stay
I think I should know why, why
Why didn't you stay?
