I like your bother, I like your mother
I like you and you like me too
We'll get a preacher, I'll buy a ring
We'll hire a band with an accordion, violin
And a tenor who can sing

You and me, you and me, baby
You and me, you and me, you and me, baby
You and me, you and me, you and me, baby
You and me, you and me, you and me, baby

We'll have a kid or maybe we'll rent one
He's got to be straight, we don't want a bent one
He'll drink his baby brew from a big brass cup
Someday he may be President if things loosen up

You and me, you and me, baby
You and me, you and me, you and me, baby
You and me, you and me, you and me, baby
You and me, you and me, you and me, baby

I'll take the train into the city ev'ry mornin'
You may be plain, I think you're pretty in the mornin'
And some nights we'll go out dancin' if I'm not too tired
Some nights we'll sit romancin'
Watchin' the late show by the fire

When our kids are grown with kids of their own
They'll send us away to a little home in Florida
We'll play checkers all day 'til we pass away
