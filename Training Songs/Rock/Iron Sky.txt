You would think that you've seen it all
And you’d understand
What is down and above of us
And in between
But there's a whole lot left of the world
That you haven't scanned
And the king and the queen you obey
Aren’t what they seem

You're a danger to yourself
And to me and all my friends
If you underestimate them
'Cause they're savage to the bone
And they'll never leave you alone
Until they have taken your head, so

War's on us, its time to begin
We're the bravest ones, we'll never give in
No promises, I don’t know how this will end
But the iron sky comes crumbling down tonight

Waiting here in the dark, trying to breathe
It’s all all silent
But you're the light and the voice in my head
That calms me down
We’ve got a whole lot left of the world
To save from violence
So I dream of a night with you
Before it gets loud

You're a danger to yourself
And to me and all my friends
If you underestimate them
'Cause they're savage to the bone
And they’ll never leave you alone
Until they have taken your head, so

War's on us, its time to begin
We're the bravest ones, we'll never give in
No promises, I don't know how this will end
But the iron sky comes crumbling down tonight

War's on us, its time to begin
We're the bravest ones, we'll never give in
No promises, I don't know how this will end
But the iron sky comes crumbling down tonight

(Tonight)
The iron sky comes crumbling down tonight
