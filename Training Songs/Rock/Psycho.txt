Here she comes
There she goes
What she wants
God only knows

Bad is good
Good is worse
Honestly
She's my kind of curse

Kisses and lies
Hellos and godbyes
Takes me through pleasure npain
She drives me insane but

I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I'm caught in the middle
My life is a riddle
They say she's a psycho, hey if its true
Does that mean I'm psycho too

She's always on the tip of my tongue
Radical
Liberal
Beautiful
I come undone

Kisses and lies
Hellos and godbyes
Takes me through pleasure npain
Still I won't complain cause

She's so cool so kind so reckless
Kisses and lies
Takes me through pleasure and pain
She's driving me insane

She's so cool so kind so reckless
Kisses and lies
Takes me through pleasure and pain
She's driving me insane
