You wait up for me I don't wake up for you
Would you like the company or are you sick of me
When your love lets you go you only want love more
Even when love wasn't what you were looking for

Speak slow, tell me love where do we go... ah ah
Where do we go...ah ah, where do we go
Break down plead your case I don't know what to say
I leave my heart all this pain and now I'm at it all again

On these streets that I leave for weeks on end who's to blame
When you want love doesn't matter what you're looking for
Speak slow, tell me love where do we go... ah ah
Where do we go... ah ah, where do we go

So far away and I just can't see you I'm
So far along and I just don't need you
I am so ah-alone, so ah-alone
When your love lets you go you only want love more

Even when love wasn't what you were looking for
