Does your appetite for novelty still burn?
And do you pick a fight just to feel the heat of his concern?
Do you still misbehave, then beg for his reprieve?
And do you love to feel his needy hands pulling at your sleeve?

Don't you always fall in love again just before you leave?

Do you still storm away, do you slap him just to see
Is he hits you back or backs away or panics, just like me?

Don't you always fall in love again just before you leave?

Don't you cry, 'cause you know that's the one thing he hates
Don't you try to bend him until he breaks
Like you broke me

Do you still turn for a second into stone?
And do you pepper him with petty threats of letting him alone?

Don't you always fall in love again just before you leave?
