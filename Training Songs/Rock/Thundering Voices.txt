Oh the pain of letting you know
Under my skin so I cut you out
Oh I wanna know everything that I know
They were just your words coming out of my mouth

Thundering voices loud and clear
(Oh oh oh)
Speaking the truth for all to hear
(Oh oh oh)
Thundering voices loud and clear

Heartache and a wounded knee
Killing and haunting and tormenting me
Oh my god, I wouldn't do this
Pulling my strings just to please yourself

Thundering voices loud and clear
(Oh oh oh)
Speaking the truth for all to hear
(Oh oh oh)
Thundering voices loud and clear

Love knows no boundaries
No walls
No fence
We are landing
No lies
No death

Thundering voices loud and clear
(Oh oh oh)
Speaking the truth for all to hear
(Oh oh oh)
Thundering voices loud and clear
(Oh oh oh)
Speaking the truth for all to hear
(Oh oh oh)
Thundering voices loud and clear
(Oh oh oh)
Speaking the truth for all to hear
