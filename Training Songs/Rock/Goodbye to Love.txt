Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye to love
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye to love

Goodbye to love
Goodbye to kissing
Love is a school 
That taught this fool
We weren't true

Goodbye to love
Something is missing
Each time you're here
You make it clear
That we're through

Your calls on the telephone
You're busy each night
The lips that were once soft
No longer invite

Goodbye to love
I feel like crying
Someday there'll be
Someone for me
Somewhere it's true
But I love only you

Goodbye to love
Goodbye to kissing
Love is a school
That taught this fool
You weren't true

Goodbye to love (Goodbye to love)
Something is missing
Each time you're here
You make it clear
That we're through

Your calls on the telephone
You're busy each night
The lips that were once soft
No longer invite

Goodbye to love
I feel like crying
Someday there'll be
Someone for me
Somewhere it's true
But I love only you
But I love only you

Goodbye to love
Goodbye to love
