I am so
sad now that
my tears
my tears
MY TEARS
won't stop
since we broke up
I cannot see anything
my eyes
MY EYES
see all black

I should've known you were
that kinda man who will
change his mind all the time
but I believed that you
liked me and only me
that summer day
after we kissed
under the burning sun
and you held me in your arms
all that was just a game mon amour

alone and having nowhere to go
I wander in the streets
so many tears that I can't
see anything

you are unforgettable
that's why my heart is broken
although I must say that
the end of our love, I saw it coming
that summer day
under shooting stars
you whispered
sweet words of love to me
I won't forget mon amour

alone and having nowhere to go
I wander in the streets
so many tears that I can't
see anything

I shoulda known you were that kinda man
who changes his mind all the time
all those beautiful memories
fade out
that summer day
in your arms
I shivered as I dreamt
sweet dreams
adieu mon amour

alone and having nowhere to go
I wander in the streets
so many tears that I can't
see anything

mon amour
mon amour
mon amour tokyo
