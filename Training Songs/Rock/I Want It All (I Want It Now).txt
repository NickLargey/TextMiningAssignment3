I think about wasted time
Hours on end, losin' my mind for you, oh yeah
I think about a love that's lost, take my money
What does it cost to lose you, oh, yeah honey

I think about a rocket ship
Tie you on, send you on a trip it's true, oh yeah
'Cause I think about all my time
Spent on tryin' to make you mine
I'm through, I'm through, oh yeah

Day in, day out
Gotta let go, gotta let it out
I want it all
(I want it all)
And I want it now
(I want it now)

All day, all night
Gotta fill up my appetite
'Cause I want it all
(I want it all)
And I want it now
(I want it now)

I think about pleasure and pain
Tryin' to keep my brain from tearin' in two, oh yeah
I think about wasted time
Hours on end, losin' my mind for you, for you, oh yeah

Day in, day out
Gotta let go, gotta let it out
I want it all
(I want it all)
And I want it now
(I want it now)

All day, all night
Gotta fill up my appetite
'Cause I want it all
(I want it all)
And I want it now, yeah
(I want it now)

Day in, day out
Gotta let go, gotta let it out
I want it all
(I want it all)
And I want it now
(I want it now)

All day, all night
Gotta fill up my appetite
'Cause I want it all
(I want it all)
And I want it now, yeah
(I want it now)

I want it all, I want it now
I want it all, I want it now
