Okay, I gotta go
Maybe I don't want to know
There's too much truth in this room
Locked door, hospital food 

Do you even know what you're doing? 
Laugh in the face of the truly ill
Rehab reject
Who pays the bill?
Tragic flaw
Human nature kills 

Do you even hear what you're saying? 
The system never failed you
You failed yourself and your mother, too
After all she's done for you
Did she raise you to be a fool? 

How do you get up in the morning?
Another wasted life - it's so boring
The system never failed you
You failed yourself and all of your friends
Now your heart is failing, too
A total system failure they pronounce you
