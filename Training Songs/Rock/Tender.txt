There is a light switch 
In the dark
Where a conscience
Can't be one

And you know that
The simplest things 
They're so perfectly placed
And I can tell you now
That I can reach you every night

Because I got a tender thing
In my mind
Oh I got a tender thing
In my mind

?
Have never age
And I have faith that this
Will never change
Cause I know that
When I touch you I feel
Something pushing my blood
Deeper into my heart
And I can tell you now
That you will never be alone

You know I gotta tender thing
In my mind
Oh I've got a tender thing in my mind

Oh I got a tender thing
In my mind
Oh I've got a tender thing
In my mind
Oh I've got a tender thing
Oh I've got a tender thing
