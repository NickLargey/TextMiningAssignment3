Don't go getting yourself in a knot
Looking for a story but you have no plot
Communication lines are starting to rot
And I can't give you what I haven't got
If I could make the world stop still for you
I wouldn't waste another moment thinking it through
But the capabilities I have not
And I can't give you what I haven't got

You're wanting me to be something that I can't see
You're wanting me to do something I can't do

And it's always just the same
And I'm still playin' in this endless game
I wonder if you even know my name?
And I can't give you what I haven't got

You're wanting me to be something that I can't see
You're wanting me to do something I can't do so

Don't go getting yourself in a knot
Looking for a story but you have no plot
Communication lines are starting to rot
And I can't give you what I haven't got

Take the car, the house, the dog, the boat the whole fuckin' lot
But I can't give you what I haven't got
