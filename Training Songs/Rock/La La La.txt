Now I'm gonna try & find a girl 
Who will make me feel so good 
& when I do, I'll sing this song 
& I know I'll love her like I should 
I'll sing: 

CHORUS: 
La la la la, la la la la la la la la 
La la la la, la la la la la la la 

Whenever I am lonely, girl 
& I got no place to go 
I don't sit around & mope all day 
I get up & here's what I say 
I say: 

(chorus) 

You get no fun out of hangin' around 
Or moanin' every day & night 
It's so much better if you take it off 
You cannot sit & fuss & fight 
Well let me hear you now: 

(chorus) 

If you got your troubles just like all the other guys 
Don't be a jerk like them, my friend 
Just shout this & your mouse & hide 
Let's shout: 

(chorus) 

La la la la la
