How many homes must you break to feel good 
 How many men does it take to burn wood 
 You just call and say they're needed 
 Face the jury, guilty pleaded 
 War games, and I want nothing to do with war games 
 I want nothing to do with war games 
 You say you're working so hard for peace talks 
 You say that in my back yard a little rain falls 
 I go backward, you go forward 
 I'm not listening to your war words 
 War games, and I want nothing to do with war games 
 I want nothing to do with war games 
 You know what it takes to turn a good man's head 
 You know what it takes to make a good man see red 
 I'm not listening to what you're saying 
 'Cause I know what you've been playing - war games 
 War games, and I want nothing to do with war games 
 I want nothing to do with war games 
 I want nothing to do with war games 
 I want nothing to do with war games
