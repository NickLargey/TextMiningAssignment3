Since I know how low to go
I won't let it show
Won't you touch me/touch me
I won't let it go
And now I stand and I peel for more
Won't you touch me/touch me
I won't let it go

Yes, I've finally found a reason
I won't need an excuse
I've got this time on my hands
You are the one to abuse
Yes, I've finally found a reason
I won't need an excuse
I've got this time on my hands
You are the one to abuse
The one to abuse

Never bothered you before
Now I stand and I peel for more
Won't you touch me/touch me
I won't let it go

You are the one to abuse
The one to abuse
