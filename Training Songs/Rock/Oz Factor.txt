Look to the sky at night and dream\
In my mind you'll find the fiend
I don't think I can hold on much longer
The pressure gives in
And that's just a aprt of me well
I can't make much difference in this world
Where I am crazy

My mind starts wearing thin 
Reality sets in
That's what I'm brought here for

What you can't see the oz will bring
By yourself you'll find the key
Only then you'll make the connection
A fine line between
What's known and what's unseen well
I can't make much difference in this world
Where I am crazy

My feet are on the ground
My head's up in the clouds
That's what I'm brought here for
The oz factor

That's what we're here
That's what we're here for

The world comes to an end
Reality sets in
That's what I'm brought here for
