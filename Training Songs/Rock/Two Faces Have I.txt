I don't want the world to know
I don't want my heart to show

Two faces have I (yayayayaya, yayayayayay)

I pretend that I'm happy (sha-la-lee)
But I'm Mr. Blue (sha-la-loo)
I pretend that I'm happy (sha-la-lee)
Since I lost you (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

Two faces have I (na na na)
One to laugh and one to cry (a ha ha hay)
Two faces have I
One to laugh and one to cry (a ha ha hay)
One to laugh and one to cry (a ha ha hay)

Will I laugh or love again
She'll never see me cry
Will I walk with a smile on my face 
Knowing I live a lie (yayayayaya, yayayayayay)

I pretend that I'm carefree (sha-la-lee)
My heart and I (sha-la-loo)
I pretend that I'm carefree (sha-la-lee)
But I'm living a lie (yayayayaya, yayayayayay)

Two faces have I (na na na)
One to laugh and one to cry (a ha ha hay)
Two faces have I
One to laugh and one to cry (a ha ha hay)
One to laugh and one to cry
