Say goodbye to tomorrow
And hello to today
Take a look at your world
In a brand new way

The masters of convention
Count on you to never change
But the laws of reinvention
Know nothing stays the same

Rock n' roll is free if you want it
Rock n' roll is free so come and get it
Rock n' roll is free if you want it
Free if you want it
Free if you want it

They're crying in the alleys
Screaming in the streets
With a dignity amongst thieves

You don't have to answer
If the question isn't clear
May not know where I am
But I'm glad it's here

Rock n' roll is free if you want it
Rock n' roll is free so come and get it
Rock n' roll is free if you want it
Free if you want it
Free if you want it
Free if you want it
Free if you want it

Say goodbye to tomorrow
And hello to today
Take a look at your world
In a brand new way

Pick the price you want to pay
If you think you should
But I have heard the news
And the news is good

Rock n' roll is free if you want it
Rock n' roll is free so come and get it
Rock n' roll is free if you want it
Free if you want it
Free if you want it

Rock n' roll is free if you want it
Rock n' roll is free so come and get it
Rock n' roll is free if you want it
Free if you want it
Free if you want it
