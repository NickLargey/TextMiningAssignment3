Coming around my senses torn
Its no illusion its here everyday I bleed
As long as you see it as long as you know
As long as you fake it nobody knows

Break down again I'm suffering
My heads out of sync and I can't hide the pain

Is this the end or is this the start
All that we sever
All that we are
Communication connected apart
Promises given the cross of a heart

Break down again I'm suffering
My heads out of sync
And I can't find the way I'll defend
I can't find a way out

Break down again I'm suffering
My heads out of sync
And I can't find the way I'll defend
I can't find a way out
Break Out
