No need analyze this kind of emotion
'Cause it comes naturally
A simple case of feeling love and devotion
So tell me tenderly

I want to give my life to you
I want to feel my blood run through you
And oh I want to touch you
Over and over and over again

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea
Running free

I feel there's no need for compromising my reputation
When you lead me astray
I'm proud to be a part of this fascination
When I hear you say

I want to be there to guide you
I'm going to feel my love inside you
And oh oh I want to touch you
Over and over and over again

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea
Running free

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea

We've got two strong hearts
We stick together like the honey and the bee
You and me
We've got two strong hearts
Reaching out forever like a river to the sea
Running free
