When they catch all they wanted from you
And they find that's all you knew
Pack your bags from another town
It's time to move

I bet you were far to find
Electrified in all this life
Now you find that you're almost dying
And all alone

How could they be so cruel
Pointing a finger, throw the book at you
And who would want to dance with you
Say it's true, I know it's true
I know it's true

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
It's nobody's fault,
Nobody's fault
But my own

When the moon is a counterfeit
Better find the one that fits,
Better find the one that lights
The way for you

When the road is full of nails
Darkened jails and garbage pails
And the paper's full of heartless tales
Of faceless clowns

Who would ever be so cruel
Fall into the residue
Who would ever dance with you
Say it's true, I know it's true
I know it's true

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
