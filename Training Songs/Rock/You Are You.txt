You're every dream I've ever dreamt
You are by far the only apartment
That I'd ever care to rent
You're like Doctor Kissenger
On a peace trip or two
But most important of all
You are you
You're like a painting by Cozanne
A tin of soup by Andy Warhol
A sonata by Chopin
You're like the Queen of England
Not forgetting the Duke
But most important of all
You are you
I'm no genius when it comes to world affairs
On the other hand when I am with you who cares
As you can see
You're my priority

[Break]
But most important of all
You are you
I don't suppose that there_s the slightest little chance
You might allow me to consummate our romance
Your know what, you're a supersonic flight
A song by Lennon and McCartney
A Mohammed Ali fight
You're like Brigitte Bardot
No way Danny La Rue...
But most important of all
You are you
Yes most important of all
You are, you are, you are you
