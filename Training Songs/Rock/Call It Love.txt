Take it slow, don't rush it
Memories can't touch it
Holding on for something more
I'm caught in an unending phase
Do you relate?
Kissing you was okay
Boys and girls, so clich√©
When we talk, I listen
For your subtleties and hidden phrase
Tell it to me straight

If I were to call you up
Would you leave me hanging?
And say, "we're only having fun
Why would you be waiting?"
If we were to call it love
Would it change anything?
Start and then we have to stop
Was it worth creating?

If it's real
How will we know?
Forever letting go
Of what we had
And wonder how long can you burn an old flame?
And watch it fade
Tell me before it's too late

If I were to call you up
Would you leave me hanging?
And say, "we're only having fun
Why would you be waiting?"
If we were to call it love
Would it change anything?
Start and then we have to stop
Was it worth creating?

If all we are is worth it then I'm in whatever sickness love is
I've caught it
When it was hard, I let go of my sight
This way you are not holding back my life
Won't give you up, I've got luck on my side
If it's enough, believe in what is undefined

If I were to call you up
Would you leave me hanging?
And say, "we're only having fun
Why would you be waiting?"
If we were to call it love
Would it change anything?
Start and then we have to stop
Was it worth creating

If I were to call you up
Would you leave me hanging?
And say, "we're only having fun
Why would you be waiting?"
If we were to call it love
Would it change anything?
Start and then we have to stop
Was it worth creating?
