Plastic scars
The pig dictifies who you are
The wrong addiction in the silent scenes
You run easy in the skin you change

You couldn't last so long
There's no soul to claim
You never been, not a single thing
You're talking on the dirt that drives you on

So reach down far below
And see yourself explode
Let's destroy this common threat
You better believe I'm gonna dance with the dead

Constant threats
You dig deeper in the filthy broil
The door shuts and then the angel sleeps
We all know that that's a damn wrong raid
You're talking on the book that drives you on

So reach down far below
And see yourself explode
Let's destroy this common threat
You better believe I'm gonna dance with the dead

So reach down far below
And see yourself explode
Let's destroy this common threat
You better believe I'm gonna dance with the dead

So reach down far below
And see yourself explode
Let's destroy this common threat
You better believe I'm gonna dance with the dead

So reach down far below
And see yourself explode
Let's destroy this common threat
You better believe I'm gonna dance with the dead
