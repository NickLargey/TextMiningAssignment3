She bends right through me.
Run wicked ramble way.
Come eve, come May, come in, I shovel pain with liquid shades.

If I can lift this head melting hand, 
If I can death remans the same.
If I can lift this head melting hand,
If you cry, if you cry, death remains the same.
Gi gi go gi ga ga gi ga go
Gi gi ga gi ga ga ga gaw
Slip slide melthing

The flame tames honer.
Where dancing heroes play.
The dawn delivers me life.
New skins in which to hide.
My hands reach daily, 
New life in me remain.
Let me be let me be, let me be, let me be
Yeah, hey. Let me be!

If I can lift this head melting hand,
If I can death remains the same.
If I can lift this head melting hand,
If I, if I, if I, if I,
Gi gi go gi ga ga gi ga go,
Gi gi ga gi ga ga gi gay.
Slipe slide melting.
Gi gi ga gi ga ga gi go,
Gi gi ga gi ga ga gi gay.

Lord, I would die for you,
Take this heart away,
Find some space in the sunshine.
Lord, I would try for you,
Take this part away,
Fade it away

Lord, I would die for you,
Take this heart away,
Find some space in the sunshine.
Lord I would try for you,
Take this part away, away, away.
Oh
Give me something to believe in me, yeah, me, yeah me yeah Yeah
Ooh
