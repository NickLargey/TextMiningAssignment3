She doesn't speak much English
But she tells me all her favorite bands 
There's not too much to talk about
Wonder if she understands 

I know she likes L7 
And I think that she likes me 
When she rolls her stockings past the knee
We're talking rock and roll... 

And now it seems like yesterday 
I met her in a smoky club 
If you get drunk and fall behind 
You know that I will put you up 

And if I learned the language 
She could tell me all her dreams 
I know exactly what she means 

And I could fall so easily 
Because her hair is colored red 
I asked her if she'll dye mine too 
She tells me it's already dead 

And I knew that if I stayed with her 
I'd lose track of all time 
Till I light a candle to the shrine 
Call it rock and roll
