Crossing this country, I'm stalling
I'm coming down
Over my head, I'm falling
Will I be found?
I've had to be a million places at once
That's not me

I'm a stranger
On the outside
When I'm not right next to you
I remember
How to get there
Will you be there when I'm coming through

Crossing this room to my lovely
My saving grace
Promise that time hasn't lost me
And don't turn away
I've had to be a million faces at once
That's not me
That's not me

I'm a stranger
On the outside
When I'm not right next to you
I remember
How to get there
Will you be there when I'm coming through

Take me back into your arms where I belong
There I'm no stranger to you

The mirror has broken
What do you see?
A million of you and a million me
The future's unspoken
Who do you see?
The one on the outside
That's not me

I'm a stranger
On the outside
When I'm not right next to you
I remember
How to get there
Will you be there when I'm coming through?

I'm a stranger (I'm a stranger)
On the outside (On the outside)
When I'm not right (When I'm not right)
Next to you
I'm a stranger (I'm a stranger)
On the outside (On the outside)
When I'm not right (When I'm not right)
Next to you

I'm a lonely man walking
Searching for my home
Been a thousand year
And here I am, I'm all alone
I'm out looking for my lovely
One to save the day
Here I come, I'm no stranger today
