We are all shapeshifters
We are all lonely drifters
In forgotten hours when we escape
Through the winking eyes and the secret handshakes
Disposable me, expendable you
Just take what you need and do what you do

You've taken me under, this heart has seen better days
You've got my number, girl there's no changing my ways
Over and over you're on your own

Shapeshifters, shapeshifters
Shapeshifters, shapeshifters

I'm running from me
I'm hiding from you
There goes my alter-ego
You know everyone that I know
A bend in the stream, a bend in the truth
There goes my alter-ego
You know all the people I know
Oh, you blew my cover
You're that kind of lover
You're that kind of lover

You've taken me under, this heart has seen better days
You got my number, girl there's no changing my ways
Over and over you're on your own

Shapeshifters, shapeshifters
There goes my alter-ego
You know everyone that I know
Shapeshifters, shapeshifters, shapeshifters
Sometimes I feel I'm slipping away
I feel I'm slipping away

Woah, it'll be alright in the morning
Woah, try to keep them fires burning
Woah, open up your eyes
â€˜Cause the man and the devil are in cahoots
But down here everybody has twisted roots

Woah, it'll be alright in the morning
Woah, try to keep them fires burning
Woah, when the sun did rise
Everybody was gone, you were far from home
You were on your own...

Shapeshifters, shapeshifters
There goes my alter-ego
You know everyone that I know
Shapeshifters, shapeshifters
There goes my alter-ego
You know all the people I know

And we are all shapeshifters
There goes my alter-ego
You know everyone that I know
We are all lonely drifters
There goes my alter-ego
Sometimes I feel I'm slipping away
Sometimes I feel I'm slipping away
Sometimes you're on your own
