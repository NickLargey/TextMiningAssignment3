Ahhhhh, Ahhhhh

Running around fell into a fountain
Monty and me tripped over a log
Lay on my back and laugh 'til it hurt me
Beautiful day for walking the dog

All pretty little mothers were pushing their prams
She ran from a bald headed man with a bag in his hand
Would you like to come with me
We shall see what we shall see
I could see she was afraid
So we stepped in right away
Sic em boy

Monty and me go walking each Sunday
Saturday night found me in a pub
Put in the Beautiful day for walking the dog

All pretty little mothers were pushing their prams
She ran from a bald headed man with a bag in his hand
Would you like to come with me
We shall see what we shall see
I could see she was afraid
So we stepped in right away
Sic em boy

Running along fell into a fountain
Monty and me tripped over a log
Lay on my back and laughed 'til it hurt me
Beautiful day for walking the dog
