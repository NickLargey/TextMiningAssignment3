Maybe you got religion
You talk about higher laws
Maybe you want a TV
You say you wanna be a star

Maybe you got the doctor
Hey man, why?know me?
Where you gonna be tomorrow
With all the pretty drugs you need?

Baby, reading your magazines
See you wanna go to India
Read philosophies
Everyone?s on the poison

Looking for guarantees
Where you gonna go tomorrow
With all the pretty drugs you need?
My name is kid and I feel alive

Drugs, drugs
Baby, if I told you
Drugs, drugs
Baby, if I told you

Round and round they mold you
Only to control you
Baby, if I told you
How round and round they mold you?
Only to control you

Maybe you got religion
You talk about higher laws
Maybe you wanna TV
You say you wanna be a star

Maybe you got the poison
Looking for guarantees
Where you gonna go tomorrow
With all the pretty drugs you need
