I return home with special food for my spirit
My presence will pass into eternity

We'll never be younger than today
Tomorrow's yesterday, it's never too late

You write your pretty songs
Just to discover what you wrote
You did something when you were younger...

We'll never be younger than today
Tomorrow's yesterday, it's never too late

Everything is over now
Everything is over now

We'll never be younger than today
(And today's left us so fast)
Tomorrow's yesterday, it's never too late
