Morons all around me
Not one of them can tell me
What I should say or do
I don't know where I'm going
But I gotta get there soon
I say you've gotta help me
But they don't wanna know me
I don't know what to do
My mum's gonna go cranky
And me dad'll beat me black and blue

They're saying that's life
But I'm taking the blame
They're saying that's life
But I'm taking the blame

When I go to football I get into trouble
Everywhere's the same
And when I go to work
I'm in trouble again

They're saying that's life
But I'm taking the blame
They're saying that's life
But I'm taking the blame

Kid's are fighting kid's
And no one gives a damn
We're eating a clockwork orange
But I'm spitting out the pips

They're saying that's life
But I'm taking the blame
They're saying that's life
But I'm taking the blame
