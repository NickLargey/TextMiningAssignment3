Look at what the wind's
Blowin' up the road
Shining like a northern star
Actin' like the answers
To all my prayers
But, baby, I know what you really are

[Chorus]
So don't you knock on my door
I won't be home anymore
You can find me out walking in the sun
Oh, you hide it so well
It isn't easy to tell
But I know a heartache
When I see one

There was a time
I was a true believer
Your love was the only way
Well you can save all your sweet talkin'
For some other fool
Only a fool would believe what you say

[Chorus]

Time is a teacher
Oh, and it's taught me well
The loser is the one who cries
And when you've cried like a baby
And you've hurt like hell
You know the devil
By the look in his eyes

[Chorus: x2]

I know a heartache when I see one
