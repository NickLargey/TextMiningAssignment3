If you want to be in my gang
Stand up with me
We'll start a revolution
We'll make the streets free
We'll never weaken
We'll give it our best
Can't be defeated
We're better than the rest

Shoulder to shoulder we're gonna stand
We're gonna fight to the very last man
Can't be defeated don't know the word
Shoulder to shoulder we'll fight the world

We can't be beaten
What do we tell 'em boys
We can't be beaten

There comes a time when every man must fight
What he believes in just isn't right
He'll take so much til he'll take no more
They'll hear us coming when they hear the mighty roar

Shoulder to shoulder we're gonna stand
We're gonna fight to the very last man
Can't be defeated don't know the word
Shoulder to shoulder we'll fight the world

We can't be beaten
Let me hear ya
We can't be beaten
Sing it out loud
We can't be beaten
We'll tell the world
We can't be beaten

Now listen everybody out there
We can't be beaten
You gotta realize you're the real thing
We can't be beaten
We can rule the streets
We can't be beaten
It's just up to you and me
We can't be beaten

Can't be defeated don't know the word
Shoulder to shoulder we'll fight the world
'Cause We can't be beaten
Hey hey
We can't be beaten
You better believe it
We can't be beaten
They'll soon find out
We can't be beaten
Now
We can't be beaten
We can't be beaten
We can't be beaten
We can't be beaten
