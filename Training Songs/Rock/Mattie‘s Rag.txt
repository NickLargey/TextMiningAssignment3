Oh Mattie open up the door, that's right I'm home again
You've got a big surprise in store, turn â??round and count to ten
Wait â??til you see what I got you, well you'll say it's a magic thing
It's like an old mandolin man, you just wind him up and he'll start to sing.

I've been away for quite a while, and I want to hear all your news
Speak to me, let me see you smile, cause I've had those homesick blues
When I go down to that city I just don't know wrong from right
When I go back to you Mattie, well you make me see the light.

Love is a singular thing, it can take you up or bring you down
Yes love is a song that I sing, so come on now Mattie listen to the sound
When you grow up we'll sit and talk of how things used to be
I'll be a grand old man of rock with all these memories.
