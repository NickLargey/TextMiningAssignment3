Life gets tough, and times get hard
It’s hard to find the truth in all the lies

If you’re tired of wondering why
Your heart isn’t healing
And nothing feels like home
Cause your lost and alone just screaming at the sky

When you don’t know what to say
Just Say Jesus
There is power in the name
The Name of Jesus
If the words wont come
Cause you’re to afraid to pray
Just Say Jesus

Whisper it now, or shout it out
However it comes out, He hears your cry
Out of nowhere He will come-you got to believe it
He will rescue you
Just call out to the Way, The Truth, The Life

When you don’t know what to say
Just Say Jesus
There is power in the name
The Name of Jesus
If the words won’t come
Cause you’re to afraid to pray
There is just One name
Strong enough to save
There is just One name
There is just One name

Jesus

When you don’t know what to say
Just Say Jesus
There’s still power in the name
The Name of Jesus
If the words wont come
Cause you’re to afraid to pray
If the words wont come
And you don’t know what to say

Just Say Jesus
