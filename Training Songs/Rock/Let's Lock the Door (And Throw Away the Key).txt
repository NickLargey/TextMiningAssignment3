(Door squeaks and slams)

(Let's lock the door and throw away the key now)
(shom-dooby-dom, dooby-dom-dom)
(I can't wait to kiss you)
Oh, no!
(One little minute more)

We met at a party last week
And the moment your eyes looked into mine
Right then, my lips forgot how to speak
And the soda started tastin' like wine

(How I wish everyone would go home)
(So I could say when I got you alo-o-o-one)

C'mon now!
(Let's lock the door and throw away the key now)
(shom-dooby-dom, dooby-dom-dom)
(I can't wait to kiss you)
Oh, no!
(One little minute more)

We started to talk and you smiled
Sorta like you knew the way that I felt
You moved a little closer in a while
And I knew my heart was startin' to melt

(There was-a so much I wanted to say)
(But all the words came out this wa-a-a-ay)

C'mon now!
(Let's lock the door and throw away the key now)
(shom-dooby-dom, dooby-dom-dom)
(I can't wait to kiss you)
Oh, no!
(One little minute more)

(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh-NO!)
(Oh, yeah  NO!)
(Oh, yeah  AHH!)

(I'll kiss your lips like a kiss oughta be)
(And then I know you'll be sayin' to me-e-e-e)

C'mon now!
(Let's lock the door and throw away the key now)
(shom-dooby-dom, dooby-dom-dom)
(I can't wait to kiss you)
Oh, no!
(One little minute more)
