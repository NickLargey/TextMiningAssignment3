Love, you've been hesitating
You've been hanging on for that sign too long
And love, you've been leaving me waiting
And I don't know why or what it is I've done

And love, don't leave me guessing
Oh, love, don't keep me
Show yourself to me

And time, you've been erasing
You've been running out on me
And tongues, you've been a talking
You've been saying what you really mean

And love, don't leave me waiting
Oh, love, don't keep me
And love, don't leave me guessing
Oh, love, don't keep me
Show yourself, show yourself

And love, don't leave me waiting
Oh, love, don't keep me
And love, don't leave me guessing
Oh, love, don't keep me
Show yourself to me
