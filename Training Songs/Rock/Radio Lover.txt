Ooh yeah! Radio!
Give it up! Whoa!

I've got a radio lover
I'm really rockin' in style
A high voltage lover
Together we'll go far
In the evening when I'm lonely
And sitting all alone
Wrap your headphones 'round
And now let me take you home
You're like no other lover
You come up on demand
In the morning when it's over
You're gone with a twist of my hand
Whoa!

I've got a radio lover
She's my rock 'n' roll queen
I found you at this number
I love it when you talk to me

You're gone with a twist of my hand

That's my rock 'n' roll star
A high voltage number
Together we'll go far
Sweet Jesus!
Guitar!

You know I wanna touch you
The way that you touch me
My radio's a-blasting
For all the world to see
Oh, take it to my bedroom
Baby love still has to mean
You can never walk away
You'll never leave here clean

I've got a radio lover
She's my rock 'n' roll star

She can slay your pain
She found me at this number
I love it when she talks to me

I've got a radio lover
I've got a radio lover

I've got a radio lover
Sweet Jesus!
