You say love
I say killing time
What's mine is yours
And yours is mine
You make me lose
I make you cry
I guess that rhymes

You're contained
By flourescent walls
I'm contained
By your control
You're overthrown
But underworn
I told you so

We're singing for the stingin' belle
She's clearly lost her way
Craving all the simple times
Inside her tragic day

Grow some balls
And speak your mind
You think you're cool
Like a porcupine
You're more like doves
That are taking flight
The sky is mine

We're singing for the stingin' belle
She's clearly lost her way
Craving all the simple times
Inside her tragic day

We're singing for the stingin' belle
She's clearly lost her way
Craving all the simple times
Inside her tragic day
