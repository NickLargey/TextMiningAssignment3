Every time you fall in love
That's the best time of all.
It's holding sunlight in your hand,
It's heaven come to call;
And you wonder: will it last forever?
And you try to keep tomorrow locked away,
'Cause tomorrow is forever
And love's enough for anyone today.

Every time you fall in love,
That's the only time it's read;
And that girl is the only girl
Who shares the way you feel.
And you wonder how you lived without her,
And you tell yourself she'll never go away,
'Cause tomorrow is forever 
And love's enough for anyone today.

Love's enough to find your heart and lose it
To see the doubt and choose it over knowing how or when;
Love's enough to know if she'd refuse it,
You'd take what's left and try your luck again.

'Cause every time you fall in love
That's the one and only time.
It's living through the final verse
Of a one and lonely rhyme.
'Cause you know this one will last forever,
And you turn and watch tomorrow drift away,
'Cause tomorrow is forever
And love's enough for anyone today.
