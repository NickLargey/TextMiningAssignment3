Walk along with me
Walk along with me
Won't you walk with me 
Walkin' home honey

Sittin' on a park bench
Not a penny in our pocket
But that's alright now
Strummin' on the guitar
All the girls sayin' we rockin'
And I'm feelin' hot now

Workin' on a sun tan
We don't even try and block it
And its hot as hell
But we don't care
Cause we don't have to go nowhere
We're just chillin' day by day 

Walk along with me
Walk along with me
Won't you walk with me 
Walkin' home honey
Walk along with me
Walk along with me
Won't you walk with me 
Walkin home honey

Chillin' in the sunshine
Hangin' by the fester fountain 
Watch the puppet show
And slowly gettin' stoned
While the highway cribs is dancin'
And I start To zone
Until I hear a baby cry
Bringin' up my daydream
Happins all the time 
But that's alright
You know its just a part of life
We gotta take it day by day

Walk along with me
Walk along with me
Won't you walk with me 
Walkin' home honey
Walk along with me
Walk along with me
Won't you walk with me 
Walkin' home honey

I still believe
I can fly
I get higher and higher
I will be free
I will fly higher and higher

Higher and higher

She out havin' fun
Drippin' on the good time
Haggin' with the girls
Out in the sunshine
Strummin' on the guitar
Rockin' like a rockstar
Mama always said her baby gonna go real far
Crazy vibe
I catch a ride
Want to go around the world
And see the flip side
You and me
Can't you see
Everything we need to be now

Walk along with me
Walk along with me
Won't you walk with me 
Walkin' home honey
Walk along with me
Walk along with me
Won't you walk with me 
Walkin' home honey
Walk along with me (I still believe) 
Walk along with me (i can fly)
Won't you walk with me(I get higher and higher
Walkin' home honey (i will be free)
Walk along with me ( I will fly)
Walk along with me (i get higher and higher)
Won't you walk with me 
Walkin' home honey
