My horse is kicking dust up off the trail,
I'm just getting back from a trip to Hell.
My six-gun she's strapped by my side,
Thunder is the horse I ride.
And it seems to me this is one hell of a way
For a man like me to earn that pay.

Outlaws on the loose,
Running, running from the noose.

Blue steel flashing, hot lead flying
I wonder what they feel like when they're dying.
Someday soon it might be my turn
Is it worth the money I earn?
And it seems to me this is one hell of a way
For a man like me to earn that pay.

Outlaws on the loose,
Running, running from the noose.
I'm a bounty hunter, I'll hunt you down, yeah, I will.

Did you know that $500 will get your head blown off?
It will... ha, ha, ha.

Blue steeling flashing, hot lead flying
I wonder what they feel like when they're dying.
Someday soon it might be my turn
Is it worth the money I earn?
And it seems to me this is one hell of a way
For a man like me to earn that pay.

Outlaws on the loose,
Running, running from the noose.
(repeat)
I'm a bounty hunter, gonna hunt you down.
