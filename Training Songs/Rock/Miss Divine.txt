Hey yeah
Hey yeah
I was spellbound by Miss Divine

Hey yeah
Hey yeah
I was spellbound by Miss Divine

You were always the one who would dance
on a sheet of thin ice
Always one step ahead
Always holding the winning ace
Thinking no-one could reach you
Way up in the sky,
you just looked out of place

You were playing the part
in the perfect disguise
And I was spellbound by Miss Divine
You were planning the crime
for the ultimate prize
And I was spellbound by Miss Divine
When you spoke like a poet
you were reading the lines
And I was spellbound by Miss Divine
I believed every word
of a pack of lies
I was spellbound by Miss Divine

You were always the one
who would lead in the big town parade
With the jokers and clowns
as they followed your masquerade
Thinking no-one could reach you
Way up on the wire,
you just made one mistake

You were fixing your gaze
on a new sacrifice
And I was spellbound by Miss Divine
And you looked so detached
as you twisted the knife
And I was spellbound by Miss Divine
And you questioned your conscience
by throwing the dice
And I was spellbound by Miss Divine
And you gave it away
and you never thought twice
And I was spellbound by Miss Divine
And you gave it away
You gave it away
You gave it away
You gave it away
You gave it away

You were playing the part
in the perfect disguise
You were planning the crime
for the ultimate prize
When you spoke like a poet
you were reading the lines
And I believed every word
of a pack of lies
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
I was spellbound by Miss Divine
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
I was spellbound by Miss Divine

You were fixing your gaze
on a new sacrifice
And you looked so detached
as you twisted the knife
And you questioned your conscience
by throwing the dice
You gave it away
Yeah, you gave it away
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
I was spellbound by Miss Divine

I was tongue-tied, tantalized, mystified
I was so surprised
I was compromised
And you know you gave it away
And you know you gave it away
And you know you gave it away
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
I was spellbound by Miss Divine
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
I was spellbound by Miss Divine
