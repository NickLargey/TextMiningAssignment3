Can you guess what I'm thinking of
Where's someone that I can love?
I just don't know where to start
I'm the king of broken hearts

I was waiting for the bells to ring
My love for her keeps lingering
Praying that she'd wear my ring
Waiting for the crowd to sing

I'm the king of broken hearts
I've lost before I ever start to love again
I'm the king of broken hearts
I'd give it all away to find a friend again
Again

Where's the dream I had before?
She just walked right out the door
I want her back and nothing more
Her note fell on the bedroom floor

I'm the king of broken hearts
I've lost before I ever start to love again
I'm the king of broken hearts
I'd give it all away to find a friend again

A heart's no good when it's been broken
Words of love are often spoken
My tears fall like jewels from a crown

Look how fast the tide can turn
Some people live but never learn
I can make a brand new start
Living in a land of broken hearts (broken hearts)

Yeah, I'm the king of broken hearts
I've lost before I ever start to love again
I'm the king of broken hearts
I'd give it all away to find a friend again
I'm the king of broken hearts
I've lost before I ever start to love again
Again
