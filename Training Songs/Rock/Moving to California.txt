If we get dropped I will sail out the window.
Clutching the artwork to my debut single.
We'll fly past the helicopter high over St. Pauls.
Head for the ocean I will live with the seagulls.

I don't want to talk about it I'm just glad we've failed.
I'm living the highlife for you.
I'd burn down the highrise for you yeah.
I'm moving to California.
Well that's what I'm telling my friends.

If we get dropped I will bail out the window.
Absail to safety on a master tape spindle.
We'll live off the driftwood and the cash from the social.
We'll join hands together we'll go walk in the ocean.

I don't want to talk about it I'm just glad we've failed.
I'm living the highlife for you yeah.
I'd burn down the highrise for you yeah.
I'm moving to California.
