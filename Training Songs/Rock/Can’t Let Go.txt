Don't speak just listen
You don't know what you've been missing
Don't cry, stop running
Don't move when I'm coming

You don't hear what I hear when you talk to me
You don't feel what I feel when you touch me
You don't see what I see when you loving me
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one for me

Can't let go,
Would you run around if I let you go
Ooh, ooh
Am I crazy, crazy, let me know
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
Can't let go

Lay back, no hurry, it's all fine, don't worry
I see you, you're so pretty, I always knew you were made for me
Well I know how you feel, cause I feel it too
I know by your tears that you want me too
I know that you know that I'd kill for you
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man for you

Can't let go,
Would you run around if I let you go?
Ooh, ooh
Am I crazy, crazy, let me know
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

You've seen the side of me that I don't ever show
Now do you know that I can't let you go? let you go... 

Can't let go,
Would you run around if I let you go?
Ooh, ooh
Am I crazy, crazy, let me know
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
Let you go.
Let, let, let you go 
Let, let, let you go
Let, let, let you go
Let, let, let you go
