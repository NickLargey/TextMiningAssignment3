(Ah hey!)
(Oh oh oh)

Does she see me
When I'm waiting around?
In the background
Fade out to black now
Does she hear me
When I'm calling her out
Or did I ever really never really open my mouth

I never get what I want when I want to
I never do what I need when I need to
I never say what I mean when I see you
I guess you're never gonna know so never mind
(Oh oh oh)
I guess you're never gonna know so never mind)

It doesn't make sense this hesitation
I want it now but I'm patiently waiting
I want to taste it I want to make it
Make it give it to me or go and take it now

I never get what I want when I want to (when I want to)
I never do what I need when I need to (when I need to)
I never say what I mean when I see you (when I see you)
I guess you're never gonna know so never mind
(Oh oh oh)

I'd take you to the end of anywhere
And I'd say about anything just to get you there

(Hey yo)

I guess you're never gonna know SO

I never get what I want when I want to
I never do what I need when I need to
I never say what I mean when I see you
I guess you're never gonna know so never mind
I guess you're never gonna know so never mind
I guess you're never gonna know so never mind
