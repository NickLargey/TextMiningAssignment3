Ethereally mine
Magic trees
They really used to shine
My silver leaves

[Chorus: x4]
Bet you're wondering how

Scissors in the sand
Rubberized
Washes of a hand
Ventriloquist

[Chorus: x4]

Something on the roof
I'm in The Wall
My silver fishing youth
Swim don't crawl

[Chorus: x4]
