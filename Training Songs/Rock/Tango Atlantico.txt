It's Xmas time again
Has it really been a year
And a soldier sighs again
And thinks about his kids and English beer

Pulls on his boots again
And steps into the pissing rain
And the clouds look just like dirty sheep
But at least he's got a job

And he knows he can't complain
And you may think that this song comes too late
But lest we forget
This tango Atlantico isn't over yet

Can you imagine this
The general and the lady dance
She flashes victory signs and smokes cigars
He shines his medals up for one last chance

They make a pretty pair
But no one understands their game
Because they can't agree about the stakes
They can't agree on anything

They can't even agree on the name
And you may think that this song comes too late
But lest we forget
This tango Atlantico isn't over yet

Sorry Tommy . . . Lost a foot? . . . Bloody land mines . . . No more soccer for you . . . 
And you may think that this song comes too late
But lest we forget
This tango Atlantico isn't over yet
