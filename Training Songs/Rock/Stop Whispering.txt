And the wise man said I don't want to hear your voice 
And the thin man said I don't want to hear your voice
And they're cursing me 
And they won't let me be 
There's nothing to say 
And there's nothing to do 
Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting 

And my mother say we don't't love you son some more
And the buildings say let me spit on your face some more
And the feeling is 
That there's something wrong 
'Cause I can't find the words 
And I can't find the song 

Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting 

Dear sir, I have a complaint 
Dear sir, I have a complaint 
Can't remember what it is 
Doesn't matter anyway
Doesn't matter anyway

Stop whispering, stop whispering
Stop whispering, stop whispering, start shouting
