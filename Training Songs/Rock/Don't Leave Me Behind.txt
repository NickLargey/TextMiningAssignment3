You will be a star
And I will be so jealous when you are
But you'll always be a fool
So I will catch you when the world is cruel
And though dizzy heights are on your mind
Oh honey please don't leave me behind
You think it's so easy
But listen, oh they once said the same to me
And you'll be loved for sure
But I think I will always deserve it more
And when you fall I think you'll find
That you never really left me behind
Don't leave me behind
While you're down here I will be kind
Tell everyone that to my mind
You should be being wined and dined
So don't forget me and don't leave me behind
