She's a loaded gun
In my shakin' hands
Am I in hell
Or the promised land

(What's your name)
She said I'll tell you my name when I'm on your skin
You can be the King and I'll be the Queen
I was born to echo and I'll never repeat, not 4 anyone, anyone

She said
I'll show you what I got
When you tell me what you need
So put your money where your mouth is

When the beat goes on
She knows that nothing's wrong
She goes down
Like the midnight sun

(What's your name)
I said I'll tell you my name, you got to let me in
You can be the sinner and I'll be the sin
I'll take what I want and its easy to see I got everything
Everything

I'll show you what I got
When you tell me what you need
So put ya money where ya mouth is
I'll show you what I got
When you tell me what you need
So put your money where your mouth is

Come on, yeah
Show me
I'll show you what I got
When you tell me what you need
So put your money where your mouth is
Watch out, watch out

I said yeah
