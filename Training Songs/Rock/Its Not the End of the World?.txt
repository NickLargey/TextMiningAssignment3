Why?
When you fall asleep
Before the end of the day
You start to worry

Like when the taxi comes 
To take you away
When you're in no hurry

Yet as our hair turns white
All the stars still shine so bright, above
At least

It's not the end of the world
Why?
We could live it large
Because we're only old once
Let's make a difference

Turn all the hate in the world
Into a mockingbird
Make it fly away

Yet as our hair turns grey
Everything is far from A ok

At least it's not the end of the world
No, at least it's not the end of the world

Why?
