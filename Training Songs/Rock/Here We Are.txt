Here we are
So tired of all the games we`ve played
I guess I`m really trying to say
To say hello and not goodbye

Here we are
All together
I`m sorry for the things said and done
I want to stay close to you

Here we are
Hope forever girl
My life has took a change for the best
I need to stay close to you

Here we are
Can make our lives and all our
Dreams come true
But only if you want them to
So say hello and not goodbye

Here we are
Tied together
I know it`s been so hard on you girl
So I intend to comfort you

Love we have
For each other
The love we have is all from the heart
And it`s tearing me apart
Not to be a part of you

Here we are
Can make our lives and all our
Dreams come true
But only if you want them to
So say hello
Say hello
And not goodbye
Say hello
Say hello

Here we are
So tired of all the games we play
You know it`s time to lose pretence
Because our lives just don`t make sense
We need each other constantly

Here we are
Can make our lives and all our dreams
Come true
But only if you want them to
So say hello
Say hello
And not goodbye
Say hello
Just say hello
Say hello
And please don`t cry
Say hello
Hello
Oh babe don`t cry

Here we are
So tired of all the games we play
I guess I`m really trying to say
To say hello and not goodbye
