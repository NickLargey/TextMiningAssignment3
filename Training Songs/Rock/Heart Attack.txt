I just needed a reminder
So I wrote it over every single thing that I own
I made it far enough to find her
But will I ever be a big enough man to take her home
I cut her off for the weekend
Cause I can't even handle you and me when I'm home
And if she doesn't feel complete then
I can go ahead and wish I'm someone she's never known
You see the regret in my weary eyes

I'm sick from lies
You live in pieces in your second life
You miss your mind
It's time for me to leave
I'm now feeling diseased
Cause in the next few weeks I will be fighting through all my troubles
It's hard for me to just pick up and leave
Cause in the next few weeks I will be fighting through all my troubles
Moving on to a new life, and I forgot about every single person I know
It's so sad

We won't think twice
Just call it off, fold, pack a bad, and head on home
You miss your mind
You miss yourself
You miss your family and your mental health
The kids are getting older
The family has grown
You look at your life now and your mind is blown

Don't play with forever
You did it from the start
I once was so strong
Attacked by my own heart
You miss your mind
You miss yourself now
You miss your family
You miss your mind
