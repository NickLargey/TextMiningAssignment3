On the north where the cold wind's always blow
People's faces are hard, you see no one that you know
And on the south side of town the bad guys are carrying guns
They're always screaming and swearing, they even got the cops on a run

This city is full of lonely hearts
And all the gutters are filled with broken parts
We gotta get away and make a brand new start
We gotta get away before it falls apart

You and me
You and me
We can still make it
We've got to leave

On the north side of town they say the streets are lined with gold
But all the people's tongues are turned black from the lies they told
On the east side of town you can hear someone's baby cry
And when that kid grows up, he's gonna turn into a mean old guy

This city is full of lonely hearts
And all the gutters are filled with broken parts
We gotta get away and make a brand new start
We gotta get away before it falls apart

You and me
You and me
We can still make it
We've got to leave

You and me
You and me
We can still make it
We've got to leave

This city is full of lonely hearts
And all the gutters are filled with broken parts
We gotta get away and make a brand new start
We gotta get away before it falls apart

This city is full of lonely hearts
And all the gutters are filled with broken parts
We gotta get away and make a brand new start
We gotta get away before it falls apart

You and me
You and me
We can still make it
We've got to leave
