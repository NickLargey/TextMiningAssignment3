Hey, open the door
I want a new life
Hey, and here’s what’s more
I want a new life, a new life
Babe, let’s get one thing clear
There’s much more star dust when you’re near
I think I’m really being sincere
I want a new life, um, a new life
With you 

Hey, open the door
I want a new life
Hey, and here’s what’s more
I want a new life, a new life
Babe, let’s get one thing clear
There’s much more star dust when you’re near
I think I’m really being sincere
I want a new life, um, a new life
With you

Can’t you see a perfect picture
You and me
But you know, it won’t come easy
And what’s more
It’s worth looking for 
Babe, open the door
And start you new life
Oh, your new life
Babe, on the shore
And start your new life
Your new life, once more
