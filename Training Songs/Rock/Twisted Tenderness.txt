You must think that I'm a fool this twisted tenderness just leaves me cool You've got me in a mess you know it's true out in the wilderness here without you 
Right outside it's a cruel world something happening it's distracting you're just bad news girl
l Never let that feeling die all you've got to do is tell a little lie don't you know it's true I will never let you down spread this message all around that I hope and that I pray you can turn my life around 
Take a look out there we're under house arrest and you don't care We could always be friends but you were careless right till the end I feel guilty oh it's such a shame it's frustrating it's a sad thing and there's no one else to blame Never let that feeling die all you've got to do is tell a little lie don't you know it's true
 I won't ever let you down spread this message all around that I hope and that I pray you won't take my love to town Tell a little lie tell a little lie that's all you have to do is tell a little lie tell a little lie tell a little lie Don't you know it's true Right outside It's a cruel world something happening it's distracting you're just bad news girl Never let that feeling die all you've got to do is tell a little lie don't you know it's true I will never let you down spread this message all around That I hope and that I pray you won't take my love to town Tell a little lie tell a little lie that's all you have to do is tell a little lie tell a little lie tell a little lie don't you know it's true don't you know it's true don't you it's true don't you know it's true.
