Forever is a mountain we've yet to climb
Tears are a part of what is yet to leave behind
Strength in numbers, all you need is two
Everyone's a winner, while still so many lose

We are finding who we are 
We can see forever
We are finding who we are 
We can see forever

The volume of emotion erupting in our souls
A quiet revelation quickly takes a hold
Patience is a virtue, but she won't always wait
Dissension is the tension, it's what we've learned to hate

We are finding who we are 
We can see forever
We are finding who we are 
We can see forever

It was late September, I remember well
Memories of living the old man told the tale
Of rising and falling, of cruelty and kind
The thing the old man told me truly blew my mind

We are finding who we are
'Cause we can see forever
We are finding who we are
We can see forever

We are finding who we are 
We can see forever
We are finding who we are 
We can see forever
We are finding
We can see
We are finding
We can see

I know it?s been said so many times before
I once was blind, but now I see
And sometimes it just don't make much sense
But I believe, yeah

Forever is a mountain we've yet to climb

A quiet revelation quickly takes a hold
Patience is a virtue, but she won't always wait
