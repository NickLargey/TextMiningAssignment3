What's the matter with you?
Look down on everything we do
I really wonder if you see today like I do
What's the matter with you?

What's the matter with you?
You don't look cool in shades of blue
I really wonder if you see today like I do
What's the matter with you?

When I got up today I felt so much brighter
My head was swimming with delight and I told her
But she said "What's so good about today?"
And she walked away
She's down in the dumps without a reason why

What's the matter with you?
Look down on everything we do
I really wonder if you see today like I do
What's the matter with you?

Gonna keep an eye on you, I'll be your dictator
So you better buck up or I'll deal with you later
So beat the drum and let the trumpet blow
You gotta let go
In the heat of the moment you reap what you sow

What's the matter with you?
Look down on everything we do
I really wonder if you see today like I do
What's the matter with you?

The worried look that's on your face makes you older
You realise that things have never been better
Yes sir, the weathers clear
There's Eskimos, in summer clothes
I don't suppose you'd like to laugh with me

What's the matter with you?
You look down on everything we do
I really wonder if you see today like I do
What's the matter with you?
