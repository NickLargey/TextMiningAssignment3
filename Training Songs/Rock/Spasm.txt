My mind, out of my mind, in my mind's eye
You've got mirrors in front of your eyes
You can't see truth for self-obsession
Compromise, why don't you live your life

Are you so scared you'll be forgotten
As you stare into the sun?
Are you scared, you'll be forgotten
As you stare into the water?

In time you will arrive with a clear mind
You'll be sure, you're not afraid of a freefall
Words can't say all the things that you feel
No faith that they'll outlive you anyway

Down and out but no one's writing a book
Altruistic or just trying to shine bright
Are you scared you'll be forgotten
As you stare into the sun, as you stare into the water?
