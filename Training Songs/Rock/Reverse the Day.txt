This song was meant to hurt 
Was meant to be 
About the broken world 
In a broken girl 
These words 
I found written on my window 
By the L the lipstick dead 
I thought I've seen her crying 
I thought she ran too fast 
I thought I'd make her stop 
But I just stood there, 
Watched her fight 
If I could live it one more time 
Reverse the day 
Back to where I begun 
Leaving my memories behind 
I'd draw a brand new history 
A brand new me 
I breathe slower 
As the fever comes 
And takes away the stream of useless words 
(No need to explain) 
I dive deeper 
Though I cannot swim 
Air and water seems the same 
Everything makes perfect sense 
Lips against the heart 
Heart against the will 
Toes beyond the sky 
Hand beyond the reach 
If I could live it one more time 
Reverse the day 
Back to where I begun 
Leaving my memories behind 
I say it standing seconds away from the edge 
And the rock seems hard
