Use me I’m down here on the floor
I don’t know which way to go
I only know I’m yours
And I feel so self assured

I’ll get to you in time
It may be a long hard climb
But I’ve made up my mind

I’m never gonna give you up
Until I get you
Never gonna give you up
Until I get you

So confused when your words tell me to go
But your eyes say something more
They give your love to me
I can’t the mystery

You might as well decide
It’s useless to run and hide

Cause I’ve made up my mind
Baby it’s been way too long
Since I’ve held you close
Now that I’ve got you in my arms again
I ain’t never gonna let you go

I’m never gonna give you up
Until I get you
Never gonna give you up
Until I get you
