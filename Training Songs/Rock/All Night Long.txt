Katie's got a new dress she wears too tight
Her daddy said no, but her momma said it's alright
Let 'em fuss and fight

She don't care what they say's right or wrong
She's gonna stay out all night long
All night long

She don't care about books or school
No, she just wants to rock and roll baby 
She's no fool
You're so cool

Well I know the way you feel now baby can't you see
Well I know the way you want your little tangled web to weave

Black lipstick she got a fake I.D.
You know the one that says Ms. Jones is turning 23
Oh baby take a look and see
