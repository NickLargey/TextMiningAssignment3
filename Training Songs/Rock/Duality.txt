Some days, I get crazed
I don't know why it's all relevant
I'll take deep breaths
And keep control, go on

I've tried brave and you've tried to save
I'm proud to keep it bottled up
I think I past my prime
Lost my mind and I'm torn

No telling what tomorrow holds

Who let, who let this feeling die
When all I did was try?
Who let you let this feeling die
I can't get you out of my head, my head
You're the flame that burns me so I know that I'm still alive

Some say it's all fate
But I say we control our lives
And if my destiny should out best me
Then that's fine

I may believe thrill and apathy
Don't exist in me fairly equally
The truth is doubts are all I've got
To call mine

No telling what tomorrow holds
No telling what voice takes control

Who let, who let this feeling die
When all I did was try?
Who let you let this feeling die
I can't get you out of my head, my head
You're the flame that burns me so I know that I'm still alive

Is there anybody out there? Is anybody calling?
Woah, if what I say is really wrong
Is there anybody out there? Is anybody calling?
Woah, if what you say is really wrong

I'm not in control, think I'm out of control

Who let, who let this feeling die
When all I did was try?
Who let you let this feeling die
I can't get you out of my head, my head
You're the flame that burns me so I know that I'm still alive
