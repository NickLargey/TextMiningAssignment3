Oh, I'm the lucky one
Born in a white tux, live like a king does, summer sun
Oh, I'm the buried seed
White on the tight rope, pain is a cycle
Don't you see how it repeats?

Bombs a mess
Sometimes the devil got the sweetest kiss

Oh, will you ever make it out, son?
Will you ever make it out, son?
Are you a sucker or a lucky one?
Are you a sucker or a lucky one?
A lucky one

Oh, I'm a piece of dirt
Caught in a spiral, dead on arrival, make it hurt
Oh, I'm a tragic man
Love is a card game, head filled with heartache
It's all a part of the plan

Guns they stall
Sometimes the devil got the sweetest call

Oh, will you ever make it out, son?
Will you ever make it out, son?
Are you a sucker or a lucky one?
Are you a sucker or a lucky one?
A lucky one

I want a million bucks, I wanna fly to mars
I wanna die for love, I wanna touch the stars
I wanna finish first, I wanna make my place
I wanna move the earth, I wanna make it shake
I wanna be your boss, don't wanna sell my soul
I wanna take it off, I wanna have control
I wanna have control, control
I wanna be the lucky one

Bombs a mess
Sometimes the devil got the sweetest kiss

Oh, will you ever make it out, son?
Will you ever make it out, son?
Are you a sucker or a lucky one?
Are you a sucker or a lucky one?
A lucky one
