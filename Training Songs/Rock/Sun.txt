Here you come again
With the wind at your heels
The brightest thing I've seen
For years and years

[Chorus]
You are the sun
It's where you're from
And where I'm going to
The light you shine
Can always change
My gray skies into blue

You walk with the heat turned up
And a fire in your eyes
Could feel you coming
For miles and miles

[Chorus: x3]
