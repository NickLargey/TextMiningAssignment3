Don't go jumping to conclusions
Draw me into your confusion
Don't you know that you're intruding
so back off for a while

It's never been up for debating
We got something worth the waiting
I can tell your heart is aching
And you want to make me smile

[Chorus]
Some girls surrender
But that's not my way
All I can say
Is,
Give it time
you've gotta try
If you wanna get
Inside my world
It's no lie
Just give it time
Cause I ain't no ordinary girl,yeah
Ordinary girl

Baby these are my conditions
I'll admit by free admission
If you make the right decision
You're the one I want

Will you surrender
Don't go away
Oh, I hope you stay
And give it time

[Chorus]

It's not that I'm special
Or think that I'm fine
But these are my boundaries
If you want to cross my line
No, oh

[Chorus]
