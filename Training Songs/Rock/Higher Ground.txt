You say that you need a holiday
But its Saturday anyway
You say that you need more money
A Playboy Bunny 
Couldn't spend more money, honey

Its such a crime to bring each other down
Its time for me to head for higher ground
Above the water line

You say that you're feeling restless
Edgy, even helpless
I can't help your feelings
Its so revealing
What you say with your feelings

Its such a crime to bring each other down
Its time for me to head for higher ground
Above the water line

I'm gonna head for the mountains
Set my sights higher
I'm gonna be over the horizon
Before you look for me

You say that you need more time
To turn it over in your mind
You've had time enough
Ain't got to cry
Don't cause a fuss

Its such a crime to bring each other down
Its time for me to head for higher ground
Above the water line
