(Better have a good night)
(Better have a good night)

Making your way in the world today
Takes everything you got
Taking a break from all your worries
It sure would help a lot
Wouldn't you like to get away?

Sometimes you want to go
Where everybody knows your name
And they're always glad you came
You want to be where you can see
The troubles are all the same
You want to be where everybody knows your name

(Better have a good night)
You want to go where people know
The people are all the same
You want to go where everybody knows your name

(Better have a good night)
