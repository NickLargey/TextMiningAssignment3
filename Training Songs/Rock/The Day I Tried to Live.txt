I woke the same as any other day
Except a voice was in my head
It said seize the day, pull the trigger, drop the blade
And watch the rolling heads

The day I tried to live
I stole a thousand beggar's change
And gave it to the rich

The day I tried to win
I dangled from the power lines
And let the martyrs stretch yeah

Singing, one more time around
Might do it 
One more time around
Might make it
One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
The day I tried to live

Words would you say 
Never seem to live up to the ones inside your head
The lives we make
Never seem to ever get us anywhere but dead

The day I tried to live
I wallowed in the blood and mud with all the other pigs

Singing, one more time around
Might do it 
One more time around
Might make it
One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
The day I tried to live, live

I tried

I woke the same as any other day you know
I should have stayed in bed

The day I tried to win
I walled in the blood and mud with all the other pigs
And I learned that I was a liar (one more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (one more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (one more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (one more time around)

Singing one more time around
(Might do it)
One more time around
(Might make it)

One more time around
(Might do it)
One more time around (might make it)
The day I tried to live, live

Just like you
Just like you
One more time around
One more time around
