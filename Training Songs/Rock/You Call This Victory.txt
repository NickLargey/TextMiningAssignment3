You call this victory you say the battle's won
You call this justice when without her there's no sun
You call this freedom, well you make up your own mind
I call this madness looking from the other side

When this thing started
It was more than just a dream, that kept us warm
Through every crazy moment we pushed on
Searching for the perfect sky
To be as one again
As one together we would fly

You call this victory you say the battle's won
You call this justice when without her there's no sun
You call this freedom, well you make up your own mind
I call this madness looking from the other side

Now I must get ready
To face up to what I see now is the truth
I need to see your eyes again on fire
And hear the beating of your heart
We had so little time
So little time for turning back
I know it's oh so easy to forget
And I know it's oh so easy to regret
And maybe time can take this fear away
Reminding me you were so sure
You had the key and you had found the door
Hey lady

You call this victory you say the battle's won
You call this justice when without her there's no sun
You call this freedom, well you make up your own mind
I call this madness looking from the other side

You call this victory
