It's April 21st and everybody knows today is Earth Day
Merry Christmas, Happy Birthday to whoever's being born
And now I'm trying hard to think of something
meaningful and worthy, kind of earthy
to make everybody ask themselves just

What are we doing here?
and what are we doing to her?

I don't know
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

2041, the world is gonna end, I've got the message
from a tiny little man who only said that he'd been sent
I'm not a protest singer, I can't write a song to send a message
but it seems to me that this message needed to be sent

What are we doing here?
and what are we doing to her?

I don't know
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
