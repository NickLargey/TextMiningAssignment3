Give me the keys, now you're too drunk to drive
You say it's all because of me
Tilting your head so you can catch my eye
Promising things I can't believe

Why can't you recognize the need?
I don't wanna be the one who's always left behind you
Some people live on memories
I don't wanna be the one who's always left to find you, find you

If I could make everything work out right
I'd bring my photographs to life
It's hard to figure out reality
When you're consumed by compromise

Why can't you recognize the need?
I don't wanna be the one who's always left behind you
Some people live on memories
I don't wanna be the one who's always left to find you, find you

And now I can't believe you won my sympathy
I told you I'm not coming back
The lies that fall between the cracks
And now I can't believe you won my sympathy
I told you I'm not coming back
The lies that fall between the cracks

Why can't you recognize the need?
I don't wanna be the one who's always left behind you
Some people live on memories
I don't wanna be the one who's always left to find you, find you

Be the one who's always left behind
Be the one who's always left
Be the one who's always left
Be the one who's always left
