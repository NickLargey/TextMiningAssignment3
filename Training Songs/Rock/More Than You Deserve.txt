What about those songs you sang my love
Were they meant for her
And all those words you never said before

What about those kisses in my sleep
Were they meant for her
Tomorrow will be fine
Yeah just a little while
Oh no this ain't no way to live
'Cause I will be

Watching every step, scared I won't find you again
'Cause if I leave you by yourself then you can hide away
I'll be watching every step, scared I won't find you again
'Cause if I leave you by yourself, yeah

What about that bracelet in your car
Was it meant for her
I am more than you deserve
Tomorrow will be fine
Oh no this ain't no way to live
'Cause I will be

Watching every step, scared I won't find you again
'Cause if I leave you by yourself then you can hide away
I'll be watching every step, scared I won't find you again
'Cause if I leave you by yourself, yeah
'Cause if I leave you by yourself, yeah

Why couldn't you just lie, suicide
Why couldn't you just lie

Watching every step, scared I won't find you again
'Cause if I leave you by yourself then you can hide away
I'll be watching every step, scared I won't find you again
'Cause if I leave you by yourself

Don't you waste my time, suicide, suicide
Don't you waste my time, suicide yeah
I am more than you deserve
I am more than you deserve
I am more than you deserve
