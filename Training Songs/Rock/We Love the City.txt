This is London, not Antarctica, so why don't the tubes run all night,
You are my Girlfriend, not Molly Ringwald, so why won't you stay here tonight,
This is sixth form poetry not Keats or Yeats, and now we find the part that we both hate.

We love the city because it lets us down, We love the city not the suburbs that surround.
We love all the dirty things, that lead us to think, that maybe true love could be found.
We love the city because its how we live, We love the city cause it never loves us back.
We love it all because sometimes, even though they're hard to find, 
It contains all the virtues we lack.

I am intrigued, not merely curious as to why it takes so long to change your mind.
I am competent, not merely adequate, its impossible for me to be unkind.
This is embarrassing, not merely awkward and I have ignored much greater feelings

We can hold those aspirations down with bad luck and half hearted frowns,
But fear alone will never bring us down, that can only happen in the small towns,

And if you don't love me now, if you don't love me now, if you don't love me, 
Then you can't have me, you can't have me now.
