Got a picture of your house and you're standing by the door
It's black and white and faded and it's looking pretty worn
I see the factory that I worked silhouetted in the back
The memories are gray but, man, they're really coming back
I don't need to be the king of the world 
As long as I'm the hero of this little girl
 
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
 
How I love the way you move and the sparkle in your eyes
There's a color deep inside them like a blue suburban sky
When I come home late at night and you're in bed asleep
I wrap my arms around you so I can feel you breath
I don't need to be a superman 
As long as you will always be my biggest fan
 
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
We'll find our way, yeah
 
Now the lights are going out, along the boulevard
Memories come rushing back and it makes it pretty hard
I've got nowhere left to go, no one really cares
I don't know what to do but I'm never giving up on you
 
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends say
I know we're gonna find a way

Heaven, oh, oh, oh 
Heaven, oh, oh, oh 
Heaven, it's not too far away
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
