I've been in this town, I guess too long
Too many parties and too many songs
Ain't got no job ain't got no gold
The sheriff's coming so I better go. 

He let me out of jail just yesterday
Said get a job or be on my way
Working never did agree with me
It tires you down and you can't be free 

So I'm gonna move on (I'm moving on)
I'm gonna move on (I'm moving on)
It's been fun but I've gotta run
I'm gonna move on

We had a big party one Saturday night
Someone got drunk and it started a fight
I got thirty days in the county jail
I didn't have money couldn't post my bail 
So I'm gonna move on (I'm moving on)
I'm gonna move on (I'm moving on)
It's been fun but I've gotta run
I'm gonna move on 

Maybe some day I'll settle down
Find a wife and quit bumming around
But not until I'll do I'll be on the run
Going to parties and-a having fun

I'm gonna move on (I'm moving on)
I'm gonna move on (I'm moving on)
It's been fun but I've gotta run
I'm gonna move on 
I'm gonna move on (I'm moving on)
I'm gonna move on (I'm moving on)
I'm gonna move on (I'm moving on)
I'm gonna move on (I'm moving on)
