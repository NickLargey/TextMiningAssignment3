I've been trying to call you tonight
No one home, guess I lose
And I've been dying to see you again
Don't know where, can't say when

And in the moment that it takes
To come between us
Time lifts a hand to wave good-bye
And in the moment that it takes
I realize just what we had
That's the moment that it takes
To pass us by

I've been crying to sleep every night
Reaching out, you're not there
And I've been dying to hold you again
As a lover, as a friend

And in the moment that it takes
To come between us
Time lifts a hand to wave good-bye
And in the moment that it takes
To realize just what we had
That's the moment that it takes
To pass us by

And in the moment that it takes
To come between us
Time lifts a hand to wave good-bye
And in the moment that it takes
To realize just what we had
That's the moment that it takes
To pass us by

I've been dying to see you again
