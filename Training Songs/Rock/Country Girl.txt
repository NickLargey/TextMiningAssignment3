No deposit, no deposit
No return, no, no return
Knew I had, knew I had to learn
So I fell for a country girl

Running away from the city lights
I'm gonna get out of the smog
Going down in the countryside
I might even get me a job

I'm moving out of this neighborhood
If I have to walk through the wall
Rocking and rolling down the country lanes
Getting away from it all

No deposit, no deposit
No return, no, no return
Knew I had, knew I had to learn
'cause I knew I had

No deposit, no return
Knew I had to learn
Knew I had, knew I had to learn
So I fell for a country girl

And I'm running away from the city lights
I'm gonna get out of the smog
Going down in the countryside
I might even get me a job

Moving out of this neighborhood
Doing a daylight flit
Rocking and rolling down the country lanes
'cause Mother Nature told me to quit

I fell in love on a cool, clear night
Where the grass was green
And the moon was bright

And you wouldn't believe
But I swear I was there
And we tasted the dew
On the clean night air

No deposit, no return
Knew I had, knew I had to learn

No deposit, no deposit
No return, no, no return
Knew I had, knew I had to learn
So I fell for a country girl

And now I'm running away from the city lights
I'm gonna get out of the smog
I'm going down in the countryside
I might even get me a job

Moving out of this neighborhood
If I have to walk through the wall
Rocking and rolling down the country lanes
Getting away from it all

Now I'm running away from the city lights
I'm gonna get out of the smog
Going down in the countryside
I might even get me a job

I'm moving out of this neighborhood
Doing a daylight flit
Rocking and rolling down the country lanes
'cause Mother Nature told me to quit
