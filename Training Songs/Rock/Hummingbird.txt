Hummingbird is singing
I can hear her through the trees
Singing of her days gone by
In perfect melody
Do I take the task
Of telling her the truth
Or do I let the world around her
Be the window she sees through

Tell me that you'll break away
Say that it's all gone
Go ahead and count the days
Come on, come on, come on

Pure white lace and silk is
Brushed up against your skin
Reminds me of your childhood
You can't lose but you'll never win
Do I take the task of telling you the truth
Or do I let the world around you
Be the window you see through

Tell me that you'll break away
Say that it's all gone
Go ahead and count the days
Come on, come on, come on

Sent a message out to you
When will you respond
Follow me, I swear it's true
Come on, come on, come on

Some might take a holiday to escape from what they see
Why don't waste away, waste away, waste away with me

Tell me that you'll break away
Say that it's all gone
Go ahead and count the days
Come on, come on, come on

Sent a message out to you
When will you respond
Follow me, I swear it's true
Come on, come on, come on

Oh oh oh...
