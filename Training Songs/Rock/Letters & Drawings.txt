Goodbye angel hands in your pockets
Maybe tomorrow maybe you'll come back sometime
She boards a Greyhound, a ticket to Jersey
A grey-colored backpack full of all her belongings

There's a kiss from the window, tells me she loves me
And how she's sending letters and drawings
But the letters never came

So I waited by the phone to hear it ring

Goodbye angel hands in your pockets
Maybe tomorrow maybe you'll call me sometime
Small time still city she one day calls me
Tells me she's married, I took it badly

Moments of silence, sounds of her laughing
When are you sending letters and drawings
But the letters never came

So I waited by the phone to hear it ring

Goodbye angel hear you're successfull
Maybe tomorrow, well maybe you'll come back sometime
Hands in your pockets here's where you left me
Only with memories when we were just sixteen
But the letters never came

So I waited by the phone to hear it ring
