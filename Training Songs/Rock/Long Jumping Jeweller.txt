LONG JUMPING JEWELLER
WRITER GRAHAM GOBLE

Everybody can't be heros, but some can still try, to make their lives a little different before the time it goes by, now I live up around the north shore in a room with no view, every morning on that ferry, my view is filled with you. I'm gonna let my heart take me away, I'm gonna jump a little further everyday, I'm gonna let my heart take me away, I'm the long jumping jeweler of Lavender Bay. She's there every single morning with about a hundred more, they watch as I come a-runnin', they all know the score, I always like to be the last one so I jump as she pulls away, the gap gets a little bit wider the longer I delay ... I'm gonna let my heart take me away, I'm gonna jump a little further everyday, I'm gonna let my heart take me away, I'm the long jumping jeweler of Lavender Bay. I handle gemstones in the city, in a little lane off Australia square, I got one picked out for you that looks so pretty, but I got to make you notice that I'm there. Well I started to make the papers and people began to bet, would I end up with the lady or would I just end up getting wet, now I'm not gonna give you the answer, in oh so many words, but swimming in Sydney Harbour, you know is strictly for the birds. Tweet, tweet, for the birds ... I'm gonna let my heart take me away, I'm gonna jump a little further everyday, I'm gonna let my heart take me away, 'cause I'm the long jumping jeweler of Lavender Bay, I'm the long jumping jeweler of Lavender Bay. Long jump, long jumping jeweler, I live in Lavender Bay, hear what I say, I'm the long jumping jeweler of Lavender Bay, long jumping jeweler ... (repeat) I live in Lavender Bay, long jumping jeweler.
