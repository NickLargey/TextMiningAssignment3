knew from the beginning, what you had in mind,
But I said to myself baby, don't be wastin' your time.
But somehow into the night, things got out of hand,
Before I knew it baby, I was giving my love away again.
Well, I slipped, tripped, fell on your love, you slipped your love on me.
I slipped, tripped, fell on your love, you slipped your love on me, yeah.
Getting hooked on you baby, was the last thing on my mind,
Now you got me wanting you baby, I want you all the time.
When you touch me, I lose control,
And I found myself, baby wantin' more, and more.
Well I slipped, tripped, fell on your love, you slipped your love on me.
I slipped, tripped, fell on your love, you slipped your love on me.
Oh yeah.

Well I slipped, tripped, fell in love,
I slipped, tripped, I fell in love,
Oh yeah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, mmm, yea
