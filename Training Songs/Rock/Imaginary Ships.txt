Same wind that blew your house down 
Was the breath of life to me. 
Cruel words brought your galaxy to the ground. 
Made a universe for me. 
You can't get what you're asking for now lady. 
You only get what you pay for now baby. 

Your crazy love will never make it in the end. 
As your imaginary ships they come crashing in. 
And they'll never fly again.

Long distance makes the heart grow cold. 
Burns me up inside. 
Slave emotions once were bought and sold. 
I set free to shine. 
So you don't know what you need these days, 
Only what can't be yours for taking. 

Your crazy love will never make it in the end. 
As your imaginary ships they come crashing in. 
And they'll never fly again.

All your cities on the land will dissolve into the sea. 
Maybe you and I will never understand why we were never meant to be. 
So you don't know what the days are for. 
You're lost in what you had before. 

Your crazy love will never make it in the end. 
As your imaginary ships they come crashing in. 
And they'll never fly again.
