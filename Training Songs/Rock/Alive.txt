She found she was walking on the ground of a one way street
And she cried when she looked in the eye of the people she met
There was no blood there was no secret power
When she counted the cost of all she'd lost
From her ivory tower

She said, "I have courage and I have grace
A kind of wisdom and a certain faith
But it's all I can manage
To keep this place of mine
Alive, alive

She kept all the tears she wept in a small container
So when they asked for proof of what she called her truth she said,
"It couldn't be plainer". She told them, "You give me this name
I carry your pain , I do your dying for you
But there's a chance I'll bleed or dare to need
A thread of life to cling to".

She said, "I have courage and I have grace
A kind of wisdom and a certain faith
But it's all I can manage
To keep this place of mine
Alive, alive
All I do is pray
