Take a picture if it helps you sleep
Then expose me as your royal creep
For now I’ve torn it we are not the same
There’s a sun that’s breaking through my window pane
It’s burning up my face yes it’s doing it again

No cover up
No room for hiding
No cover up
My faith is sliding
No cover up 
Just sharp reminding of the fake I was

There are faces that we should not know
There are places we’re not meant to go
If you try to find me you will never win
For behind each layer lies another skin
I’d love to let you near me if you find a way in

No cover up
Just so much trouble
No cover up
I’m bent in double
No cover up
Just wreck and rubble of the person I was

I am broken and I stand accused
Is there someone who can let me loose
If you find the answer make a careful note
I could use you pardon and a lot of hope
I’m getting to that part at the end of the rope

No cover up
I feel the burning
No cover up
Nor time for turning
No cover up
I hope I’m learning some honesty
Some honesty
