Yeah, in an ambient domain
Inside a galaxy of pain
Emit a haunting type refrain
But, beware
She's coming from way out
She's coming from way out
She's coming from way out
Coming from way out
Yeah, like Andromeda had strain
And like Apollo had 13
Like Martin Luther had his dream
Her dreams a freak scene, yeah
She's coming from way out
She's coming from way out
She's coming from way out
Coming from way out, yeah
She's coming from way out

She's coming from way out 
She's coming from way out 
She's coming from way out 
She's coming from way out 
She's coming from way out 
She's coming from way out  

She's coming from way way out 
She's coming from way way out 
She's coming from way way out
