I'd like to see you
In two pieces
You won't be walking
Barely breathing
I'd like to see you
At my door
We're together
Like before

I could miss you more right now
or I could slit your throat
Sometimes I get so down
You're not around and
I'd rather see you dead

See you dead

Tonight you're sleeping
By his side
I tried to see you
But you let him decide
I'm a threat now
Are you scared
It's just murder
least you know I care

I could miss you more right now
or I could slit your throat
Sometimes I get so down
You're not around and
I'd rather see you dead
Sometimes I get lonely
And all I need is
Just to see you dead

See you dead [Repeat: x2]
Dead
See you [Repeat: x1]
See you dead
Dead [Repeat: x7]

Sometimes I get so down
You're not around and...
I'd rather see you dead

Sometimes I get lonely
And all I need is...
Just to see you dead

Sometimes I get so down
You're not around and...
I'd rather see you dead

see you dead, dead [Repeat: x3]
