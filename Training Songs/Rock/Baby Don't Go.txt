I can't believe I told you if you'd ever go through
With walking out that open door
I would be okay but I must have been insane
I won't be saying that no more

Baby don't go
Baby don't go

I miss the little chances to do some more romancing
And make you feel like a million bucks
I've taken you for granted, granted I've been blind
But my eyes have opened up

Baby don't go
Baby don't go

Don't you walk, walk, walk away
Baby don't, don't you leave
Please stay baby come back, you know I want you now
I was wrong, baby don't go

I wanna hold, hold, hold you tight
Do whatever it takes, make, make it right
Give me a second chance you know I love you so
Baby don't go

The clouds are overhead, a storm is moving in
What a bad time to be on the road
It's a poor idea with the fuel prices high
And your gas tank is really low

So baby don't go
Baby don't go

Don't you walk, walk, walk away
Baby don't, don't you leave
Please stay, baby come back, you know I want you now
I was wrong, baby don't go

I wanna hold, hold, hold you tight
Do whatever it takes, make, make it right
Give me a second chance you know I love you so
Baby don't go

Don't you walk, walk, walk away
Baby don't, don't you leave
Please stay, baby come back

I wanna hold, hold hold you tight
Do whatever it takes, make, make it right
Give me a second chance you know I love you so
Baby don't go

Baby don't go
Baby don't go
