Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you true?
Didn't I say the words that meant so much to me?
Didn't I love you, just like you wanted me to?
Didn't I say right then everything was going to be alright?

Didn't I, didn't I, now didn't I?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I?

When I was way down, taking the long way 'round
There were times when you told me we'd never make the other side
I asked you to understand, lend me a helping hand
Didn't I tell you we could make it as long as you believed in me?

Didn't I, didn't I, now didn't I?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, now didn't I?

Didn't I, didn't I, now didn't I?
Didn't I, didn't I, now didn't I?

Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you true?
Didn't I say the words that meant so much to me?
Didn't I love you, just like you wanted me to?
Didn't I say right then everything was going to be alright?

Didn't I, didn't I, now didn't I?
Didn't I, didn't I, now didn't I?
