(Pick it up)

Pick up the pieces before they blow away
(Pick it up)
Pick it up, pick up the pieces put them together again

Whatever happens to us on the way

Pick it up, pick up the pieces don't let it get away
Pick it up pick up the pieces and get them together again

Birds of a feather still fly away

Pick it up pick up the pieces before they're blown away
Pick it up pick up the pieces put them together again

Pick it up pick up the pieces don't let it get away
Pick it up pick up the pieces and get them together again

Pick it up pick up the pieces don't let it get away
Pick it up pick up the pieces and get them together again

Pick it up

Whatever shatters (pick it up)
Whatever happens pick it up
Whatever matters pick it up, pick it up
