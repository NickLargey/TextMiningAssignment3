Ah,
The last Picasso
The last Picasso
Was just acquired by some old museum
And Don Quixote
Well, Don Quixote
The old man's rhyme has lost its reason
Which only reminds me
Have I remembered to say
That without you this life of plenty
Would seem so empty
Ah, The last Picasso

Oh, me and you
Me oh me, oh me, oh me, oh me and you
We, we can sigh
Me, oh me, oh me, oh me we can sigh

Hey
Ah,
The last Picasso
The last Picasso
May gather dust amid the ruins
And Don Quixote
Well, Don Quixote may no longer

Make his wishful tunes
But I still have you
And I will have you
When everything else is done and gone with
We'll be like one with, the last Picasso

Oh, me and you
Me oh me, oh me, oh me, oh me and you
We, we can sigh
Me oh me, oh me oh me, oh we can sigh
Oh, me and you
Me oh me, oh me, oh me, oh me and you
We, we can sigh
Me oh me, oh me, oh me, oh we can sigh
Oh, me and you
We, we can sigh
Me oh me, oh me, oh we can sigh
Oh, me and you
