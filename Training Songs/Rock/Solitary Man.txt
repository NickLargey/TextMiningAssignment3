Never sleep by myself, these nights are too long, for a single man
No connections, no times, hello and goodbye, that's the way I am
I can't satisfy your dream, don't you hang your heart on me
I love you hard, I love you long, leave before you know I'm gone

I was born a solitary man, solitaire was always my game
And I never got the fear of pain, playing solitaire, solitary man

I've been lonely so long, I couldn't tell, if she came my way
And I wouldn't say no, if only I knew, love too many the same
If you satisfy my dream, you could make a man of me
I love you hard, I love you long, and I never walk alone

I was born a solitary man, solitaire was always my game
And I never got the fear of pain, playing solitaire, solitary man
