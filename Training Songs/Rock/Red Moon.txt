Sometimes just letting go is easier
Dead friends can't come back
They're gone and life goes on

If you try, you'll be alright
If you try, you'll be alright

I'm hanging around with you
We're catching the starlight
Underneath a red moon
Leaving the city tonight
We're finding our freedom
Underneath a red moon
Oh no, no, no, nooo

Leave your woes behind
Start the car and drive
Deserts bring you home
The only roads you've known

If you try, you'll be alright
If you try, you'll be alright

I'm hanging around with you
We're catching the starlight
Underneath a red moon
Leaving the city tonight
We're finding our freedom
Underneath a red moon
Oh no, no, no, nooo

Here it comes, you might as well
Here it comes, you might as well
You might as well

If you try, you'll be alright

I'm hanging around with you
We're catching the starlight
Underneath a red moon
Leaving the city tonight
We're finding our freedom
Underneath a red moon
Oh no, no, no, nooo
