All the time you were
Waiting outside,
I said to myself maybe you lied.
See it was my turn to

Learn not to burn.
What the hell I was there anyway.
And bad luck it's got this
Thing for you,

It waits outside your room.
You're so polite,
You're always home,
Hello I've been on the telephone.

Come back. All is forgiven.
I don't want to dance anymore.
I want to get off the dance floor.
Come back. All is forgiven.

Sometimes I get a little out of line,
Sometimes I lose it.
Come back. All is forgiven.
You don't know what your missing.
