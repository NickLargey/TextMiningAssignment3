Ole
Bouncing souls no one can beat us 
We drink beer and wear Adidas 
Anywhere we get the itch 
We're off to find a proper pitch 
Lace your sambas get on out 
Off we go to kick it about 
Win or lose we're having fun 
We won't quit until we're done 
We got heart when we play 
Take you on any day!
