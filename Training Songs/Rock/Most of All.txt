Hello darlin', my it's good to hear you 
I'm at the railroad station in St. Paul 
How are all the folks, I'd love to see 'em 
But, girl, I'd love to see you most of all 

Well I've been starin' at the rain 
And I've been thinking 
Ever since the train left Montreal, 
You know I thought I'd always love 
This life I'm living 
But now I know I love you most of all 

Many times before 
I know I swore 
That I'd come home to stay

But it always seems 
That the foolish dreams 
And trains got in my way 

Tomorrow there'll be snow in Minnesota 
But I won't be around to watch it fall 
Oh I'll be heading for an old familiar station 
Just hopin' you still love me...most of all 

And girl, you know I love you 
Most of all 

I miss ya baby, most of all 
Mm
Mm
Oh I miss ya baby, 
I miss ya most of all 
Mm
Mm
Oh I miss ya baby
I miss ya most of all
Mm
Mm
Mm
Oh I miss ya baby
I miss ya most of all
Mm
