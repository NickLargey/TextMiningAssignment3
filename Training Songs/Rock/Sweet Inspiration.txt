Ahh, yeah, baby
Just a-listen to me now
You may not bring me your love
But you bring me your 
Sweet inspiration
Yeah, you do
Sweet new creation
Flows from my fingertips
Each time I kiss your lips
 
You may not give me your heart
But you give me such
Sweet thoughts and music
Please don't refuse it
All that I offer you 
Is all that's due to
Someone who could make the stormy skies
Forever blue
Who can turn the snow to summer sun
The wake-up frost to morning dew
 
You may not bring me your love
But you bring me your sweet inspiration
Stay around a little while
Let me see you laugh
Let me see you smile
Turn me onto everything you might be
Oh, baby, to me
 
Sweet inspiration
Oh, yeah
Sweet inspiration, ooh
Mmmm
 
You may not realise everything you mean to me
Two children playing in the sun
Learning to be free
Oh, oh 
 
You may not bring me your love
But you bring me your 
Sweet thoughts and music
Come on
Please don't refuse it
All that offer you
Is all that's due to
Someone who could make the stormy skies 
Forever blue
Who can turn the snow to summer sun
The wake-up frost to morning dew, oh, oh, oh, baby
 
You may not bring me your love
But you bring me your 
Sweet inspiration
Yeah, you do
Sweet new creations
Fall from my fingertips
The time I kiss your lips
 
Sweet inspiration
Come on baby, can't you see now?
Come on baby, oh yes
Sweet inspiration
Give me your sweet inspiration
