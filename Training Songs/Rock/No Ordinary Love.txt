This could have been just another day 
But instead we're standing here 
No need for words  it's all been said 
in the way you hold me near 
I was alone on this journey 
You came along to comfort me 
Everything I want in life is right here 

Chorus: 


cause 

This is not your ordinary 

no ordinary love 

I was not prepared enough 

to fall so deep in love 

This is not your ordinary 

no ordinary love 

You were the first to touch my heart 

Made everything right again 

with your extraordinary love 


Chorus 


I get so weak 

when you look at me 

I get lost inside your eyes 

sometimes the magic is hard to believe 

but you're here before my weary eyes 

you brought joy to my world 

set me so free 

I want you to understand 

you are every breath that I breathe 


Chorus: 


From the very first time that we kissed 

I knew that I just couldn't let you go at all 

From this day on, remember this: 

That you're the only one that I adore 

Can't we make this last forever 

This can't be a dream 

cause it feels so good to me
