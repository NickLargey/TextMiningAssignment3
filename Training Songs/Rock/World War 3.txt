WW III, WW III, WW III, don't you bloody see? WW III
It doesn't matter what you say, you won't make it no bleedin way
You haven't got any choice, you really haven't got any voice
Preventive measures have been taken, it'll really help against

Nuclear rapin
No streets, no people, left on the land, the policy ran out on our
plan
That's right

World war, lotsa fun
People in a panic, on the run
World war, lotsa fun
White House is aimin the gun

World war, lotsa fun
People in a panic on the run
World war, lotsa fun
The kremlin's aimin the gun

We're pawns in the middle, sittin ducks with no acquittal
They're gonna make us fight, protectin oil is our right
Unlock them now on the flag deck, Soviet bombers you're gonna net
It's breakin up the Richter scale, bombs away, they're gonna sail

No human lives stand in the way, cause we're on our way to a new
clear day
That's right

I really don't want to die, World War III
With A-bombs droppin from the sky, World War III
Don't give me your reasons why, World War III
Just know I don't want to die, World War III

Give'em any chance they're gonna take it, give'em any rules they're
gonna
Break it
It really ain't no riddle, I just know it ain't gonna be little

We haven't got a clue on what we're gonna do
So we're just pawns in the middle, sittin ducks with no acquittal
End up dead, end up dead, end up dead
End up dead, end up dead

World War III, World War III, World War III, World War III
Give'em any chance they're gonna take it, give'em any rules they're
break it
It doesn't matter what flag you hoist, you really haven't got any

Choice
No human lives stand in the way, cause we're on our way to a new
clear day
We're just pawns in the middle, sittin ducks with no acquittal

World war, world war
World war, I don't want it
World war, I don't need it
World war, I won't take it

World war, world war, world war
