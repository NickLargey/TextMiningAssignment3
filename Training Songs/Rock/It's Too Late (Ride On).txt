Monday morning: Hesitate, I can't get out of bed
I'd rather go back to the dreams I'm living in my head
Tuesday evening: Pack my bags, I'm heading out the door
I left a box of memories lying on the floor

Ride on, ride till early morning sun
Ride on, like the dawning of the day
It's too late, to let all your feelings show
Go on, 'til the night is swept away

I'm running from the city lights
I'm running from this empty life
I'm running out of time tonight
I'm screaming out for "Help! Help!"

"Slow down, your moving too fast
Go home, you'll feel better for it
Oh boy, you better stop dreaming
It's all in your head!"

'Cause it's too late now...

Ride on, ride till early morning sun
Ride on, like the dawning of the day
It's too late, to let all your feelings show
Go on, 'til the night is swept away...

Ride on, ride till early morning sun
Ride on, like the morning of the day
It's too late, to let all your feelings show
Ride on, til the night is swept away...
