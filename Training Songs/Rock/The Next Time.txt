They say, I'll love again, someday
A true love will come my way, the next time
But after you, there'll be, never be, a next time for me

They say that, I'll find happiness in someone
Else, warm caress, the next time
I'll soon forget, your kiss and heartaches, such as this will

Just be ancient history
They say that, I'm a fool to weep
That, I won't go on losing sleep, the next time

And someone else will mend the heart you've broken in two
But how can I fall in love the next time?
When I'm still, so much in love with you
When I'm still, so much in love with you
