I got news from my brother yesterday
I got news from my brother, hey, hey, hey
When they grind you down into the ground
And there's really no one to be found

I got news from my brother yesterday
He said, he had seen you, seen you with her
When you grind me down into the ground
I won't ask for help, you're not around

No one knows where the summer goes
You wait all year when the summer comes
The summer comes, summer comes

No one knows where the summer goes
Wait all year when the summer comes
Oh, the summer come, summer come

I got news from my brother just today
He said, he's really sorry, he made a mistake
When it grinds you down into the ground
And you feel like sinking in the ground

I got news, I got news
I got news, I got news
