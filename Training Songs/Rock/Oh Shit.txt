Oh shit, I thought you and I were friends
Oh shit, I guess this is where our love ends
Oh shit, I thought things were goin' well
But it hasn't turned out so swell

Has it
Oh shit

Oh shit, pride comes before a fall
Oh shit, and once you lose one you've lost them all
Oh shit, I guess this time's the time
And it seem you're no longer mine

Don't it
Oh shit
Oh shit

Oh shit, I wish I'd known before now
Oh shit, that you were such a cow
Oh shit, I wouldn't have wasted my time
Oh shit, chasin' somethin' which wasn't mine

Face it
You're shit
You're shit

Oh shit, I wish I'd known before now
Oh shit, that you were such a fuckin' cow
Oh shit, I wouldn't have wasted my time
Oh shit, chasin' somethin' which could never be mine

Admit
You're shit
You're shit
You're shit

Admit
Admit
You're shit
You're shit

You're shit
You're shit
You're shit
