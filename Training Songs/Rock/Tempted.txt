I bought a toothbrush and toothpaste
A flannel for my face
Pajamas, a hairbrush, new shoes and a case
I said to my reflection, "You'll be out of this place"

Past the church and the steeple
The laundry on the hill
Billboards and the buildings, memories of it still
Keep calling and calling but forget it all I know I will

Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on
Since you've been gone, there's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered

I'm at the car park at the airport
The baggage carousel
The people keep on crowding, wishing I was well
I said it's no occasion, no story I could tell

At my bedside empty pocket
A foot without a sock
Your body gets much closer, I fumble for the clock
Alarmed by the seduction and I wish that it would stop

Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on
Now that you have gone, there's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered

Bought a novel, some perfume
A fortune all for you
But though it's not my conscience that hates to be untrue
I asked of my reflection, "What is there to do?"

Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on
Now that you have gone, there's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered

Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
[Incomprehensible]
Tempted by the fruit of another

Tempted but the truth is discovered
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
