What do you want, what do you want for Christmas
Whatever it is I'll get it for you
What do you want, what do you want for your birthday
All I want, I want, want, want is you

If you want a diamond ring to shine, shine, shine
Or a fancy little watch to tell the time, time, time
Every morning all I want to find, find, find is you, I said you

What do you want, whatever it is I'll get it for you
What do you want, all I want, I want, want, want is you

If you want a diamond ring to shine, shine, shine
Or a fancy little watch to tell the time, time, time
Every morning all I want to find, find, find is you, I said you

What do you want, what do you want for Christmas
Whatever it is I'll get it for you
What do you want, what do you want for your birthday
All I want, I want, want, want is...
What do you want, what do you want for Christmas
Whatever it is I'll get it for you
What do you want, what do you want for your birthday
All I want, I want, want, want is...
What do you want, what do you want for Christmas
Whatever it is I'll get it for you
What do you want, what do you want for your birthday
All I want, I want, want, want is...
