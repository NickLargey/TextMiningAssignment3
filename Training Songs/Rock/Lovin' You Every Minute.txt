Oh the world has got its problems, they're comin' into view
And girl I know that we will surely do what we can do
But while we're in the midst of changing darkness into light
Gonna be beside you, to keep you warm at night.

And I'll be lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day
Oh, now recently it's clear to me, what makes the world uptight
Is the lack of joy we have, for the love of what feels right
But you and I are makin' the change, along with all our friends
And it feels so good to let you know, for me it all begins.

When I'm lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day.
I'll be lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day.

Oh, jobs are gettin' fewer, and the rents are on the rise
When I look at what it costs to live, I can't believe my eyes
But you and I are not alone, the whole world is feelin' it too
And I'm gonna do the best I can, and while I'm here with you.

I'll be lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day.
I'll be lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day.

Yeah, lovin' you, I'll be lovin' you baby,
I'll be lovin' you every minute.
