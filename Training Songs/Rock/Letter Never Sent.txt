I know you don't think too often about our ways,
Now I can see what's up,
Taking time from our hands,
Do you know how you stand?
Changed our views,
Hoping we can pull through,
Still I need to know what we need to satisfy.
It's not like friends to ever say goodbye.
This letter never sent,
Is all I have,
Is all I need to say,
This letter never sent,
It represents,
One thought of sense today.
It's said a young heart never mends,
I'll dispute it,
Shits hit more than once,
Do I see through blind eyes,
Can you ace that disguise.
Don't presume I have regret,
I'm glad we met,
'cause now I know what we have isn't wrong or right,
We can't change that,
I've realised this tonight.
This letter never sent,
Is all I have,
Is all I need to say,
This letter never sent,
It represents,
One thought of sense today.
I've been hoping for some way to tell you and?
I've got letters in my head not sent too.
Last chance to tell you.
Can't think up the words to write to you.
Last chance to tell you.
Can't think up the words to write to you.
Last chance to tell you (x3).
Can't think up the words to write to you.
