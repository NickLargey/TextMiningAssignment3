Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?

Have you ever felt that it's someone else living your life?
The image of you only better, it's true at the outside

Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?

Is there nothing I've done that was truly begun by the real me?
Have I stood to the side aware of the tide that drags me out to the sea

Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?

Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
