The wine beneath the bed,
The things we've done and said
And all the memories that come glancing back to me
In my loneliness
You're standing in the breach
Beyond that stretch, but our love reach
Unconsciousness that find me sometimes wondering
Where you're at

Hmm, take me back again,
Take me back one more time, Spanish rose
The way you pulled the gate
Behind you when you said, "It ain't too late,
Come on, let's swing the town and have a ball tonight."
And hoping you'd come through
And many others, too,
And all the friends we used to have in days gone by,
I'm wondering
If you'll take me back again,
Take me back one more time, Spanish rose

And when the lights went out
And no one was abandoning the country in full bloom,
In the room we danced
And many hearts were torn
And when the word went around that everything was wrong
And just couldn't be put right
It tore me up, it tore me up

The way you held a note
The trembling in your throat,
That just beginning of your wondrous smile
The rising of the water
The winter winds of days gone by
I often ask myself and wonder why
It's gone
Oh take me back again
Take me back one more time, Spanish Rose.

In slumber you did sleep,
The window I did creep
And touch your raven hair and sang that song
Again to you
You did not even wince,
You thought I was the Prince
To come and take you from your misery
And lonely castle walls
Ah, take me back again,
Take me back one more time, Spanish rose

Ah ah, ah ah,
Mm, mm,
Da da da da da da da
