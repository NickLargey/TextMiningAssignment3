Don’t make me dead again
Cause I’m not the one to blame
Mind sins I stood nothing to gain
The sun will make me dead again

What is up in this town?
Glad I’m not hanging on
Just to watch all you cats get yourselves down
Don’t want to be a devil’s advocate

Don’t you want to get out?
Don’t you want to get out?
Don’t you want to get out?
I just don’t know how
Don’t know how

I don’t care who’s your souls to hand
Cause you know it aint that kind of fight
If we packed up my car
We could be out of here tonight
Don’t mind, don’t that sound alright?

Don’t you want to get out?
Don’t you want to get out?
Don’t you want to get out?
Of this nowhere town
