I can't seem to find out what I feel
Burned out dreams of others which I can steal
Take or leave this way I seem to you
It eats right through you
You ripped up parts of things I should do
I'll run around and tell you screaming

Oh I live a lie
Oh I live a lie
Oh why even try
I've been leaving thoughts below
Still I feel I should know

Still don't see much of me giving in
Much too strong to live outside of these sins
Feeling like I'm taken lightly
Think you see right through me
Words of those that still despise me
Think it's eating me
You're dreaming

Oh I live a lie
Oh I live a lie
Oh why even try
I've been leaving thoughts below
Still I feel I should know

When I seem to believe
All that I've done wrong
You can take all that's right
I will still move on
Taken all I can give
It seems that I don't belong
Push me further from this
Go on

Oh I live a lie
Oh I live a lie
Oh why even try
I've been leaving thoughts below
Still I feel I should know
