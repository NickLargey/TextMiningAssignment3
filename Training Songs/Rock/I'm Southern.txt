Boots and buckles, red clay and sand. 
My point ain't subtle here, I'm a southern man. 
Where the beer seems colder and the women seem hotter, 
Where the world don't seem so damn modern, 
Where a good ole boy like me still has a chance (that's right). 

Oh this is where I was born and this is where I'll die. 
Yeah this is where I was born and this is where I will die.

It's all about the south, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina. 
Don't you wanna get down and dirty? 'Cause Florida I'm thirsty. 
Well hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud. 
Lay back, crazy old-timer, sweet magnolia, dock bars and dollars oh yeah. 
Oh, even if you're up north, come on down, come on down. 
Oh, it's all about the south. All about the south.

From daddy's Don Williams to momma's Patsy Cline. 
Oh, we're walking after midnight, singing Tulsa Time. 
Where the beer seems colder and the women seem hotter, 
Where the world don't seem so damn modern. 
Hell, this is where I was born and this is where I'll die, oh that's right.

It's all about the south, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina. 
Don't you wanna get down and dirty? Cause Florida I'm thirsty. 
Well hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud. 
Lay back, crazy old-timer, sweet magnolia, dock bars and dollars oh yeah. 
Oh, even if you're up north, come on down, come on down. 
Oh, it's all about the south. Come on.

This is where I was born and this is where I'll die.
This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
