Ever time it rains Lord, I run to my window
All I do is wring my hands and moan
Listen to that thunder roar,
And I can hear that lonesome wind blow
Tel me why baby, why ya been gone so long

Tell me baby, why ya been gone so long,
Ya been gone so long
Tell me baby, why ya been gone so long
Who'll be scratching at my door
And I can hear that lonesome wind blow
Tell me baby, why ya been gone so long

Someone said they thought they saw ya roaring down to Reno
With another girl from San Antoine
They tell me I'm a fool to pine for you but what do they know
Tell me baby, why ya been gone so long

Tell me baby, why ya been gone so long,
Ya been gone so long
Tell me baby, why ya been gone so long
Who'll be scratching at my door
And I can hear that lonesome wind blow
Tel me baby, why ya been gone so long

Tell me baby, why ya been gone so long,
Ya been gone so long
Tell me baby, why ya been gone so long
Who'll be scratching at my door
And I can hear that lonesome wind blow
Tel me baby, why ya been gone so long
Tel me baby, why ya been gone so long
