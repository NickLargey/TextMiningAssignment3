You've got to give it to me
You've got to give it to me
You've got to give it to me
You've got to give it to me

You're so slick now, know every trick now
You know I want it, I want it so bad
You know I need it, I can't believe it
So come on baby, Please relieve it

Now you've been bugging me, Every night now
You say you want it, You want it right now
I can't get to it, I can't get through it
So come on baby, Please

You've got to get it up (give it up)
You've got to get it up (give it up)
You've got to get it up (give it up)
You've got to get it up (give it up)

Why keep me cold
When it's so warm inside
Come on baby
Your love is too good to hide
