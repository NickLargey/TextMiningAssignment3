Everybody's wearin' blue jeans
Everybody's got their own scenes
Everybody's lost in daydreams
But everybody's wearin' blue jeans

Everybody's wearin' blue jeans
Everybody's got their own schemes
Everybody cheers their own teams
But everybody's wearin'' blue jeans

We're all reading the same books
We're all getting the same looks
Everybody's got their own views
But we're all reading the same news

Everybody's wearin' blue jeans
Everybody's got their own scenes
Everybody's lost in daydreams
But everybody's wearin' blue jeans

I'm singin' in my own band
I'm tryin' to play the right hand
I'm livin' by my own means
And I'm wearing my blue jeans

Everybody's wearin' blue jeans
Everybody's got their own scenes
Everybody's lost in daydreams
But everybody's wearin' blue jeans
