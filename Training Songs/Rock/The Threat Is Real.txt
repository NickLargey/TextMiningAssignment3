Justified obliteration, no one cares anymore
The Messiah part mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door
A culture made have covered us
Where leprosy touch their flesh
Fall back with meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest
The clock runs out, the weakest link
A deadly strike, the threat is real

Seen the bird as a machism
A crest fallen nation see
Violent conditioning, cause the nature of the enemy
You're terminal lack of vision
Blinded, I see no light
A quiet lack of perspective
Their cancer now eats us alive
A fatal shot, a lust for blood
The final act, the threat is real
