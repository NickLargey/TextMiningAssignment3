I'm wearin' a
Fur Pyjamas
I ride a
Hot Potata'
It's tickling my fancy
Speak up, I can't hear you

Here on this mountaintop oh oh oh
I got some wild, wild life
I got some news to tell ya oh oh
About some wild, wild life
Here come the doctor in charge oh oh oh
She's got some wild, wild life
Ain't that the way you like it oh oh
Living wild, wild life

I wrestle, with your conscience
You wrestle, with your partner
Sittin' on a window sill
But he spends his time behind closed doors

Check out Mister Businessman oh oh oh
He bought some wild, wild life
On the way to the stock exchange oh oh oh
He got some wild, wild life
Break it up when he opens the door oh oh oh
He's doin' wild, wild life
I know that's the way you like it oh oh
Living wild, wild life

Peace of mind?
Piece of cake!
Thought control!
You get on board anytime you like

Like sittin' on pins and needles
Things fall apart, it's scientific

Sleeping on the interstate oh oh oh
Getting wild, wild life
Checkin' in, checkin' out! Uh, huh!
I got a wild, wild life
Spending all of my money and time oh oh oh
Done too much wild, wild
We want to go, where we go, where we go oh oh oh
I doing wild, wild life
I know it, that's how we start oh oh oh
Got some wild, wild life
Take a picture, here in the daylight oh oh
They got some wild, wild life
You've grown so tall, you've grown so fast oh oh oh
Wild, wild
And I know that's the way you like it oh, ho!
Living wild wild wild wild, life
