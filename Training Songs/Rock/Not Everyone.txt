Hey
You're not the first
You're not the last
To hold me back

Yeah
It's such a shame
It's such a waste
To hesitate

Now
I've seen the light
I've heard the sound
Of bringing others down

Not everyone deserves the sun
Not everyone lives for too long
Not everyone can turn you on
Yeah

Strange
What people say
About your face
The way it changed

It's hard
To fall behind
They bleed you dry
And blow your mind

Now
You've lost control
You've let it show
And now no-one knows

Not everyone deserves the sun
Not everyone lives for too long
Not everyone can turn you on
Yeah

Just say my name
Just say my name
Just say my name
Just say..

Not everyone deserves a song
Not everyone lives for too long
Not everyone can turn you on
Yeah

Not everyone deserves a lie
Not everyone deserves to die
Not everyone can bleed you dry
Yeah
