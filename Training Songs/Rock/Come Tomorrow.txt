If the song of the songbird 
Could replace my wrong word 
Then my dear, that's the song I would borrow 

& tonight you would hear 
The saddest song of the year 
& you'd be mine once again come tomorrow 

If the song of the swallow 
Could reveal my sorrow 
Then my dear, he would sing just for you 

Just tonight, while in flight, on your windowsill daylight 
To tell you all of my tears 

Sing sing sing sing sing, Mr. Songbird 
Come on & sing just once, little swallow 
& make her mine once again 
...& fade
