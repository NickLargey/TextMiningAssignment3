You are yeah, you are yeah
If he tells you tonight he thinks of you, in a really special way
If he tells you tonight that he loves you, more and more everyday
Then you must say to him you love him too

But if he tells you you're through, well then I'm asking you, please come back again
Back to me again
If he tells you you're through and he's lonely, feel his love by your side
If he tells you he cares for you only, and you feel satisfied

Then you must say to him you love me too
And if he tells you good-bye and he you think you could cry
Come to me my love, cry to me my love
So long till I'm away from you, a stronger man there seems to be

Must I cry the whole night through, each day you're away from me
If he tells you at night he can't sleep dear, just keeps thinking of you
And if he tells you his love is for keeps dear, and he'll always be true
Then you must say to him you love him too

But if he happens to say, that he's going away, I'll be here for you
Waiting here my love, I'll be here my love, waiting here
