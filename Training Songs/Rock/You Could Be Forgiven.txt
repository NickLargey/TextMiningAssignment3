Beneath the lights, the sleaze, the mayhem
Handsome ads, and cool seduction.
Everything is impossible and everything's so easy,
Invasion of invented needs,
Between the carrot and the stick.
They fix you with their beastly eyes and smile

And if they darken your sweet soul,
And if they ever let you go.

Is your love, is it, strong enough, is it
Like a feast, is it, sweet or wild, is it,
All of these things:...?
You could be forgiven

Into anchor-tattooed arms
Go sad-eyed dreamers bound for elsewhere
Lovers cling like the Pieta in style
Myth and sham, believe, believe
Your tears will end,
You've got to feel this love
Please...

And if they darken your sweet soul,
And if they ever let you go.

Is your love, is it, strong enough, is it
Like a feast, is it, sweet or wild, is it,
All of these things:...?
You could be forgiven
