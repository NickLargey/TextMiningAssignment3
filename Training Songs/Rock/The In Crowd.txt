I'm in with the in crowd
I go where the in crowd goes 
I'm in with the in crowd
And I know what the in crowd knows
Any time of the year, don't you hear? 
Dressin' fine, makin' time 
We breeze up and down the street
We get respect from the people we meet
They make way day or night
They know the in crowd is out of sight
I'm in with the in crowd
I know every latest dance
When you're in with the in crowd
It's so easy to find romance! 
Any time of the year, don't you hear? 
If it's square, we ain't there
We make every minute count
Our share is always the biggest amount
Other guys imitate us, 
But the original is still the greatest
In crowd! 

Any time of the year, don't you hear?
Spendin' cash, talkin' trash
I'll show you a real good time
Come on with me and leave your troubles behind 
I don't care where you've been, 
You ain't been no where 'til you been in...
With the in crowd
With the in crowd
In crowd! 
In crowd!
