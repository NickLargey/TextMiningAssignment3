By George Harrison

WRACK MY BRAIN, WRACK MY BRAIN,
TILL MY HEAD'S FILLED WITH PAIN,
WRACK MY BRAIN.

ALL DRIED UP, I'M ALL DRIED UP,
ALL I HAVE'S THIS EMPTY CUP,
ALL DRIED UP.

WHAT I HAVE, YOU DON'T WANT,
WHAT YOU WANT, I CAN'T GIVE.
I GOT OUT OF TOUCH WITH YOU AND YOURS,
THE WAY THAT YOU LIVE.

I TRY TO DO MY BEST FOR YOU,
WHILE THE SKY POURS DOWN THE RAIN,
WRACK MY BRAIN.

WITH A WILL THERE'S A WAY,
BUT THERE'S NO WAY I CAN SEE,
COMING UP WITH SOMETHING YOU'D ENJOY
AS MUCH AS TV

ALL THE SAME, I PLAY THE GAME,
UP AND DOWN OLD MEMORY LANE,
WRACK MY BRAIN, (wrack my brain)
TILL MY HEAD IS FILLED WITH PAIN,
WRACK MY BRAIN, (wrack my brain)
WHILE I SLOWLY GO INSANE,
WRACK MY BRAIN. (wrack my brain)
