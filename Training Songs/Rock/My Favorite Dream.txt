Each time I call you up, you're always free 
You break the dates you've got just to be with me 
Gee whiz, that's not the way it is 
But that's my favorite dream 

You tell me I'm the type you can't resist 
Your lips are always there, ready to be kissed 
Gee whiz, that's not the way it is 
But that's my favorite dream 

We spend each night together 
But you don't even know 
'Cause in spite of all my dreams 
Somehow it seems 
I'd never even dare to say hello 
But I believe my dreams may still come true 
Someday you're gonna show that you want me too 
Gee whiz, that's not the way it is 
But that's my favorite dream 

Gee whiz, that's not the way it is 
But that's my favorite dream
