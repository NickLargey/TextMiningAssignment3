He be the count of Monte Cristo

Could be a quake any day
Maybe somebody from Siam
Begin the era of a new rage
Keeps lickin' all the honey
Chewin' up the fat he rakes
Instead of sending to the lions
They cover him with praise

All hail Caesar,
Hail! Hail!

Down at the Epicenter
Things started heatin' up
Rockin' up the richter scale
Swingin' in the chariot
Around and around we go
The senators rehearse the tale
Starring in the coliseum
Tied upon the rack
Up comes the thumb of Caesar
To stab you in the back

All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!
All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!

Down at the Epicenter
Things started heatin' up
Rockin' up the richter scale
Swingin' on the chariot
Around and around we go
The senators rehearse the tale

Watch out Caesar, watch out Caesar
