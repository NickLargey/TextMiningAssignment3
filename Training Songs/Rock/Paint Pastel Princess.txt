It's only self rejection 
With a mean left 
Cold carbon copied coping 
And it's mean theft 
That's been left behind 

Paint pastel princess 
Bo and arapax the shelves when they're broken 
I'll beg you  beg you 

Waste life when youth is sweeter 
Neater content with contents 
Cultures cringing at accents 
And it's too tense  camp out 

She tastes the candy sugarless cancerous 
Crave cocaine cop shows 
I'll beg you, beg you 

But it's all the same to me 
But it's all the same to me 
But it's all the same to me 
But it's all the same to me 

But it's all the same to me 
But it's all the same to me 
But it's all the same to me 
But it's all the same 

Paint pastel princess 
Bo and arapax the shelves when they're broken 
I'll beg you, beg you
