I can't find myself when you go away
Makes me wonder where you are
Is there someone else I just need to know
This charade has gone to far

For the first time in my life
I feel I'm losing control
I can't keep pretending, it's my soul that you own
I need you

My hearts in your world tonight, possession
And you hold the key to my life, possession
I've got to be with you
I want to dream with you
You're my obsession, I want possession of you

Oh yeah
I can't play this game, am I in too deep
Cause my world is where you are
You're always on my mind
The little things you say
I can feel you everywhere
The trace of your lipstick
I can taste your perfume
The note that you left me 
Leaves a space in this room

I need you
My hearts in your world tonight, possession
And you hold the key to my life, possession
I've got to be with you, I want to dream with you
You're my obsession, I want possession of you

Oh yeah, of you, oh baby
I can't live without you
Can't you see that you're mine, I need you

Your hearts in my world, possession
In your world, In your world
Your hearts in my world tonight, possession
And you hold the key to my life, possession

I want possession of you
Every night, possession
I want possession of you
For all my life, possession
I want to walk with you

Possession
I want to dream
Possession
Possession
