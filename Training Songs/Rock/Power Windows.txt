Charlie drives a brand new Mercedes Benz
He's got another one just like it
Just like all his friends
His wife is playing tennis
And his kids are off at school
He drives home to his empty house
Sits by his empty swimming pool
But he's got power windows
He's got power brakes
He's got a power bed
Push a button and it shakes
He's got no one to talk to
And tears rolling down his face
He ain't got the power of love
The power of love
Lewis drives a beat up '69 Dart
Swears it's the statue of Mary
Keeps the car from falling apart
With Gracie right beside him
Sitting closer than a smile
She got her hand on his shoulder
He loves to drive and hold her
He's got no power windows
Got no power brakes
He ain't got no power nothing
But he got what it takes
He's got Gracie's arm around him
And a smile upon his face
He's got the power of love
He's got the power of love
Ain't that the power of love
He's got the power
The power of love
No air condition
No cellular telephone
He goes rumblin' down the highway
Listening to his AM radio
One arm out the window
And a smile upon his face
Makes you wonder how it got there
Till you see him look at Grace
He's got the power
Ain't that the power of love
