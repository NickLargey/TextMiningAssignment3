I woke up to the sound
Of a man who's always been
But never been around and he told me
How to change my ways
And stop with the childish games
So I told the man no
I'm never ever going to change
This's who I am
Going to feel my own pain
Haven't been here in years
And it's not your choice
Going to do what I want
Cuz I'm not a little boy

I get higher, I get higher
I'm going to set this house on fire
Shut off the lights I hear your sound
I'm locking the door as you fall to the ground
I get higher, I get higher
The sun is shining I'm on fire
I walk the streets I hear no sounds
My shiny blue eyes turn to painful brown

In the park where I sat down
Saw the payphones ringing
So I answered the sound
I need another quarter
Man keeps on talking
Don't know where it went
Must of lost it in my pocket

I get higher, I get higher
I'm going to set this house on fire
Shut off the lights I hear your sound
I'm locking the door as you fall to the ground

And I get higher, oh
And I get higher, alirght
I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
And I can't take it all

Alright
Come on now
Yeah, oh
Here we go

I get higher, I get higher
I'm going to set this house on fire
Shut off the lights and I hear your sound
I'm locking the door as you fall to the ground
I get higher, I get higher
I'm going to set this house on fire
I walk the streets I hear no sounds
My shiny blue eyes turn to painful brown

Oh, oh yeah
Oh, alright

I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
And I can't take it all
