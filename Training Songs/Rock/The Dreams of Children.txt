I sat alone with the dreams of children
Weeping willows and tall dark building, and
I've caught a fashion from the dreams of children
But woke up sweating to this modern nightmare, and
I was alone, no one was there
I was alone, no one was there

I caught a glimpse from the dreams of children
I got a feeling of optimism
But woke up to a grey and lonely picture
The streets below left me feeling dirty, and
I was alone, no one was there
I was alone, no one was there

Something's gonna crack on your dreams tonight
You will crack on your dreams tonight
You are going to crack on your dreams tonight
You will crack on your dreams tonight
Something's going to crack up your dreams tonight
You will crack on your dreams tonight

I fell in love with the dreams of children
I saw a vision of all the happy days
I've caught a fashion from the dreams of children
But woke up sweating from this modern nightmare, and
I was alone, no one was there
I was alone, no one was there

Something's gonna crack on your dreams tonight
You will crack on your dreams tonight
Something's going to crack on your dreams tonight
You will crack on your dreams tonight
Something's going to crack up your dreams tonight
You will choke on your dreams tonight
Something's going to crack on your dreams tonight
You will crack on your dreams tonight
Something's going to crack on your dreams tonight
You will crack on your dreams tonight
You will crack on your dreams tonight
You will crack on your dreams tonight
You will crack on your dreams tonight
You will crack on your dreams tonight
