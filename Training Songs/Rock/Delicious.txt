Delicious...
Delicious

You're so old and we're so young,
We're gonna have some fun,
'Cause we want to! we don't wanna
'Cause no fuss,
You wanna be with us,
We don't want to!

Come on, come on, come on we're not done
Or down on our knees!
(Down on our knees!)
Come on, come on, come on it's just begun,
We can do what we please!

[Chorus:]

Delicious...
Running wild in the city late at night!
Delicious...
Powder pink don't you think we're out ofsite...
Feels so right...

What the hell is here for us,
We're getting on that bus,
'Cause we got to!
No one's under twenty-one,
So we just can't go wrong,
Does that haunt you?

Yeah! yeah!

Feels so right...
Delicious...
Feels so right...
