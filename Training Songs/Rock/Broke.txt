A spirit for a smile
A doubt for a dream
You're saving my falling
You're shooting my star

A spirit for a smile
A doubt for a dream
You're saving my falling
You're shooting my star

And I don't care
Whenever you stall, I'll stand there
Oh, and I don't care
Whenever you stall, I'll stand there

Oh, oh

You're the beat of my heart
The door to my home
If I lose my voice
Then I'm left alone

You're the way that I can see
You're the best champagne
Yes, you cure my loathes
And joy steals my pain

And I don't care
Whenever you stall, I'll stand there
Oh, and I don't care
Whenever you stall, I'll stand there
Whenever you stall, I'll stand there

Built this island out of frustration
There's no point teaching a girl who can never learn
And just when I feel like Robinson Crusoe
My intentions strobe to light, a beacon out in the sea
I caught your eye and you're staring back at me
Great minds coming to the same idea

'Cause when it keeps on whispering in your ear
Keeps on whispering in your ear
Keeps on whispering in your ear
Wait for something and it never appears

Oh, no
And I don't care
Whenever you stall, I'm standing there
Oh, and I don't care
Whenever you stall, I'm standing there
Whenever you stall, I'm standing there

So why don't I just take your strain until the sun dies
You're staring at the ocean, not afraid to bring it to life
We're not afraid to bring it to life

You're the beat of my heart
I said oh oh oh oh oh
You're the beat of my heart
I said oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're the beat of my heart
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're the beat of my heart
