Standing here your arms open wide
Asking me if our love is dying
Now you show me, a different side
All you gotta do is show it

Baby don't you know we
That you're lost if you hide
What you feel inside
If you believe me

Every word I say
If a picture told a thousand words
Would you still walk away
If you believe me

Every word I say
If a picture told a thousand words
Here I am again by your side
I wish we could laugh

But we always cry
Don't say goodbye
Baby give it one more try
If you believe me

Every word I say
If a picture told a thousand words
Would you still walk away
If you believe me

Every word I say
If a picture told a thousand words
Stay baby
Listen baby listen to all you've been saying

Don't you see it's just a trick that your mind had been
Playing
Listen to your heart
Listen to my heart

It's your heart and mine
We're two of a kind
One heart is so hard alone
If you believe me

Every word I say
If a picture told a thousand words
Would you still walk away
If you believe me

Every word I say
If a picture told a thousand words
Would you still walk away
