There's a line, for every lover 
In the makeup on your face 
There's a look in your eye, says you realize your fate 
And you've a mind, to rediscover, tho we're half way through the race 
And the neon lights keep calling you, to this place 

{Chorus} 
Run for your life, girl 
The band has packed away 
You better run for your life, girl 
Get away 
Run for your life, girl 
The band has moved on, you'll be runnin', for your life 
From now on 
Well your nights were filled with laughter 
Now your days are fallin' rain 
And your wondering when those stars are gonna shine again 
You've got photographs to remind you, of all the faces that you knew 
But I'm sure they've got no time, to think of you 

{Chorus} 
Hey Little Miss Lonely, tho your world is falling apart 
You've got a feeling inside you, and loving in your heart 
Hey, Little Miss Lonely, don't you waste your life away 
You put the bad times behind you, tomorrow's a brand new day 
(Yeah!) 

{Chorus} 
......... Miss Lonely, There'll be better days, and you can find the way 
Ohhhhhh, Miss Lonely, there'll be better ways, and you can find them, someday 

{Chorus to fade}
