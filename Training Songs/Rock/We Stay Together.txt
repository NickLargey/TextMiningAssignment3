If it's coming then we'll take it as it comes
And if it's going, then we'll wave it goodbye
Waiting for a train that never comes
You're waiting for a brain that never numbs

We break it down, into its parts
We toured around, and break our hearts
We laughed along with all of the jokes, ha-ha
We raced along and stayed so close

But through it all, yeah
We stay together
We stay together

I know that my love got no other love
My love got no other love, she got
She got a lot

My love got no other love
My love got no other love, she got a home

And there's a light on that will never go out
And when the night's gone not a shadow of doubt about you, about you
And there's a time bomb and it's gonna go off
Then we'll disarm it 'cause I'm so better off with you, here with you, yeah

We break it down, into its parts
We risk it all through prison bars
We laid it down there to rest
And hold it down until it's drowned

But more than that
We stay together (we stay together)
We stay together (we stay, we stay)

I know that my love got no other love
My love got no other love, she got
She got a lot

My love got no other love
My love got no other love, she got a home

And there's a light on that will never go out
And when the night's gone not a shadow of doubt about you, about you
And there's a time bomb and it's gonna go off
Then we'll disarm it 'cause I'm so better off with you, here with you

And there's a light on that will never go out
And when the night's gone not a shadow of doubt about you, about you
And there's a time bomb and it's gonna go off
Then we'll disarm it 'cause I'm so better off with you, here with you, yeah

(We stay together) we stay together
(We stay together) we stay together
(Stay, stay, stay, we stay) we stay together 
(We stay, we stay, we stay) we stay together
