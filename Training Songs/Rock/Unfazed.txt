I don't think You had in mind
When You set my city on a hill
For it's walls to be built up to keep the light in
Brick on brick I'm building still
But the moon still shines
The stars seem brighter
I see You through the haze
So I remain unfazed

I don't think You were intending
When You pitched this tent You call Your home
For it to be a place always in need of mending
With a bed as cold as stone

My roof caved in, the weight of unbelief and
My eyes half closed, my vision getting weak and
Still I see You
I know You'll never fade
So I am not afraid
