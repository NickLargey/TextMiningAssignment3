When I was a young boy
And time was passing by
Real slow
And all around was wonder
And all around the great unknown
With eyes that slowly opened
I set about the wisdom for it to know
And living out of language
Before one word I spoke
I heard the call

There is somebody there I know
There is somebody there I know it so
There is somebody there I know
There is somebody there I know it so

Now high upon the mountain
Where green has turned to golden
Shine on so
Below the world's unfolding
Unraveled and exploding, it was always so
I'm rolling and I'm tumbling
Through all your fields of plenty, here I go
Come walk a mile beside me
Come love me and come guide me
Hear the call

There is somebody there I know
There is somebody there I know it so
There is somebody there I know
There is somebody there I know

The road calls to my heart
And love will warm my blood
The sun will shine down evermore
And wine is in the cup

'Cause there is somebody there I know
There is somebody there I know it so
There is somebody there I know
There is somebody there I know it so
