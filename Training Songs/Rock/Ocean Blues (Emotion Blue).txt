Ask any stranger
Out on the boulevard
Who is alone
They'll say it's me
In any country
This road leads everywhere
A road that leads down to the sea
CHORUS

Colour me blue
When the lights are bare
Sing me the tune
That won the war
Sing me the song
I'll go anywhere
And I'm blue. I'm ocean blue

I read your letter
It must have been a hundred times
Before the words fell from the page
It's almost D-Day
The crowd gathers in the street
But still I have no flag to wave

CHORUS
CHORUS

I read your letter
Then I threw it in the sea
Said-there is no flag to wave

I'm blue, blue, I'm ocean blue
Yes, I'm blue, blue, I'm ocean blue
Yes, I'm blue, blue, emotion blue (repeat)
