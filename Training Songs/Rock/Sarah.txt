Sarah 
Won't you tell me your name 
I've been waiting here for hours 
In the garden by the flowers 
You're so shy 
So just open your eyes 
The boys all form a line to be written out in time 
A long, long, long, long time ago 

Emergency 
I think I am falling apart 
Emergency 
I think I am losing the fight 
And I don't know if I can do it 
I don't know if I can try 
I don't know if anyone asked me the reason I lied 
She sighed 

Sarah 
Is she your new best friend 
One day it will end, you know it will 
You're so shy 
So just let it fall apart 
Let it stumble in the dark 
With the razors in your heart 
A long, long, long, long time ago 

Emergency 
I think I am falling apart 
Emergency 
I think I am losing the fight 
And I don't know if I can do it 
I don't know if I can try 
I don't know if anyone asked me the reason I lied 
She sighed 
She sighed 

Emergency 
I think I am falling apart 
Emergency 
I think I am losing the fight 
And I don't know if I can do it 
I don't know if I can try 
I don't know if anyone asked me the reason I lied 
She sighed 
She sighed
