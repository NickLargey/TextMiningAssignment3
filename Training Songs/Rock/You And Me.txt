Take a look at what I got
I can't promise you a lot
But you and me
And the road ahead

I can't save you from yourself
You gotta want it
All that's left is you and me
And the road ahead

Wherever that wind might blow
Wherever that river rolls
You know I will go with you

Lookin' over the mountain's crown
The water roars and tumbles down
Like you and me
And the road ahead

Wherever that wind might blow
Wherever that river rolls
You know I will go with you, ooh, oh

Just you and me
And the road ahead
Just you and me
And the road ahead
