Baby, I'm off the wall
Up the creek
Goin' down the wrong way
On a one-way street

I ain't got the sense
That the good Lord gave a goose
But I sure got one thing
That I'd like to give to you

I got love, super love
Super duper love for you

I ain't no doctor, ain't got no PhD
When you talk about love
You better talk to me

I got love, super duper love

I ain't too good lookin',
Won't be no movie king
Won't be no Elvis
Up on the silver screen

Can't be no teacher
No nuclear scientist
If you ain't been kissed by me, baby
You ain't been kissed

I got love, super love
Super duper love for you

I ain't no doctor, ain't got no PhD
When you talk about love
You better talk to me

I got love, super duper love

I ain't no doctor, ain't got no PhD
When you talk about love
You better talk to me

I got love for you
I got super duper love for you
