Have you still got the illusion
Of what's lying ahead?
Then you'd still have your innocence
And days wouldn't seem so bad
But I've always wondered
Why you've never grown?
But now I know
You gotta take a little time for yourself
You gotta live a little life on your own
You gotta take a little time for yourself
It's just what you're needing
Storms always make you happy
But they hide everything inside
Make believe that they're soft to touch
Then they blind you with their light
That has always made me wonder
Why you've never grown?
But now, I know
You gotta take a little time for yourself
You gotta live a little life on your own
Yes you gotta take a little time for yourself
It's just what you're needing
I know what you're needing
Yes I do
But I've always wondered
Why you've never grown?
And now I know
You gotta take a little time for yourself
You gotta live a little life on your own
Yes, you gotta take a little time for yourself
It's just what you're needing
Oh, that's what you're needing, yeah
(take a little time for yourself)
Oh, take a little time
(live a little life on your own)
Oh, live a little life
(take a little time for yourself)
Oh, that's what you're needing
Oh, that's what you're needing
You gotta take a little time, yeah
Oh, live a little life
That's what you're needing
