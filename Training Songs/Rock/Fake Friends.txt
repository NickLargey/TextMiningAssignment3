Fake Friends Joan Jett & The Blackhearts (Jett-Laguna) When you were down they were never there All the sycophants they love to make romance When you're all alone you really get to learn If you get back up they gonna come around To the ugly sound of 'em tellin' you what you 'cause they all agree you're supposed to have a better life Wanna hear an' you pretend But you're feelin' worse An' they build you up till you fool yourself that you're Something else an' it's like a curse cause An' they tell you that you're losin' friends You can't live up to what they made of you Losin' friends, losin' friends Ya don't lose when you lose fake friends Ya got nothin to lose Ya go an tell 'em you were king of the hill Ya see 'em laugh while you're on your knees An' ya can't believe that ya hit the gound an' When ya need a hand - that was yesterday An' it breaks your heart 'cause ya gave so much Ya notice ya been losin' friends Losin' friends, losin' friends Ya don't lose when you lose fake friends Ya got nothin to lose From: Oscar Hernando Rodriguez
