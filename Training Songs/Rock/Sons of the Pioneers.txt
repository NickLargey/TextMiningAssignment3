Reachin' for a space in time, layin' our fate on the line
Starting out a life anew, after we've come so far
Won't you look and see now, here we are

You were the ones, there is no doubt
You ate it up and spit it out
You were the ones, you made it clear, you could take it
We are the sons of the pioneers (we are the sons of pioneers)
The day has come, our fate is clear
We're the sons of the pioneers
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
We're not afraid to try (we're not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid of fear

What's the point of going on, if you feel that it couldn't be done
Cause I just wanna understand, freedom's the soul of a man
Won't you look and see now, and show me how

We have the chance, there is no doubt
We'll pick it up, and see it out
We are the ones, you made it clear, we can take it
We are the sons of the pioneers (we are the sons of pioneers)
The day has come, the way is clear
For the sons of the pioneers
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid to try (men not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid of fear......................fear

When you think of how far we've come, and to know that we've only begun
Leaving us a legacy, makes sense to me
That now our time has come, for we have to move on

You were the ones, there is no doubt
You ate it up and spit it out
You were the ones, you made it clear, you could take it
And now it's time, our fate is surely here now
There is no doubt about it, it's time we thought about it
We are the ones, the way is clear, for the sons of the pioneers
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid to try (men not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afriad of fear

Is there any doubt, none at all, they heard the call of the
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid to try (men not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid to try (men not afraid to try)
Sons of the pioneers (sons of the pioneers)
Men not afraid of fear
