Walking the line that 
Takes you between your eyes
Showing a place where
Nobody has to hide
Keeping it straight is
Only not living a lie

Drifting on life and
Nobody missing you
Look for a while and see
What Skid Row can do
Tom Fool fell for a 
Back Street point of view

All my life I've tried
Oh how I've tried
Suddenly I'm there
There's a feeling in the air
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it
All my life I've tried
Oh how I've tried
Suddenly I'm there
There's a feeling in the air
Here on Natural Avenue

Living on air you take
From the Earth for free
Money you make to pay
For this liberty
Tenement dreams are
Missing reality

Walking the line that
Takes you between your eyes
Showing a place where
Nobody has to hide
I'm walking the line down
Natural Avenue

(Natural Avenue, a Natural Avenue, a Natural Avenue,
A Natural Avenue, a Natural Avenue, a Natural Avenue)
I'm doin' fine (Natural Avenue, a Natural Avenue)
