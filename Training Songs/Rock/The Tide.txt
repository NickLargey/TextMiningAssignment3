You look so cool
Standing there
With your baggy jeans
And silky hair
We can live for nothing
Baby, I don't care

Lose me like the ocean
Feel the motion

I'll be the sea, honey
Always, always
And you'll be the tide
I'll be the sea, honey
Always, always
And you'll be the tide

I'll float with you
Through the clouds
Take me on your dream
Don't ever leave me
I can't ever see myself with somebody else
Except you

I'll be the sea, honey
Always, always
And you'll be the tide
I'll be the sea, honey
Always, always
And you'll be the tide

You look so cool
Standing there
With your baggy jeans
And silky hair
We can live for nothing
Baby, I don't care

Lose me like the ocean
Feel the motion

I'll be the sea, honey
Always, always
And you'll be the tide
I'll be the sea, honey
Always, always
And you'll be the tide

I'll be the sea
I'll be the sea
And you be the tide
You be the tide
I'll be the sea
I'll be the sea
And you be the tide
You be the tide
