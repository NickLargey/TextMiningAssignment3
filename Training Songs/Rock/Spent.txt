I went out walking yesterday
Upon a beach that came my way
And every time it seemed the same
And everywhere I looked the sun was dying
Walked back down the avenue
I left a girl that I knew was true
But every time I get one
Well, I choke up - I don't know what I'm doing
Tried to clear my empty head
Of thoughts and words that were never said
Sat alone and heard my drone
And wondered when the wind would change direction
It answered me so pleasantly
The vision that I tried to see
Walked away, felt my sway
And prayed to God for a little bit of salvation
Spent a long time breaking the rules
Spent a long time getting over you
Spent a long time getting kicked in the ass
Like a punk city boy who's got no class
Never, ever thought I'd get out of school
But I never, ever thought I'd get over you
Never, ever thought I'd figure it out
How to get out, how to get out now
How to get out, how to get out now
How to get out, gotta get out
