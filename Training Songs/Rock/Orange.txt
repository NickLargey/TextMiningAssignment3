Orange can be hard, sometimes she knows
Orange is the way the summer blows
Orange can be hard, orange can be hard, sometimes she knows
Transty can also love alone
Oranges can be hard, orange can be smart
Orange is the way the summer blows

Other fruits say oranges are blind
Still they get to slip into your mind
Orange are smart, orange can be hard, sometimes she knows
Transty can also love a lost
Orange can be hard, orange can be smart
Orange is the way the summer blows

Oranges are green
Have you seen, have you seen them climbing up the trees
Drifting, smiling, raving and still laughing, told the buzzinghoneybees
In the trees they get your tv, years and different torrensfactories, not me
Trapped into the garden they get caught up watching football ontv, tv

Orange can be hard, sometimes she knows
Transty can also love alone
Orange can be hard, orange can be smart
Orange is the way the summer blows
