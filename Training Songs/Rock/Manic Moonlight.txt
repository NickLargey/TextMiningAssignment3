Help me let me tell you
What you mean to me
I don't want to scare you
Make you run from me

Or let's pretend it's tomorrow
And we borrowed
The life of a perfect spinning circus
In a manic moonlight

Shy on taking chances
High on giving up
Sliding down the mountain
Drowning in the mud

Gone or moving faster
Run or walking after
Some kind of fountain of truth

Or let's pretend it's tomorrow
And we borrowed
The life of a perfect spinning circus
In a manic moonlight
