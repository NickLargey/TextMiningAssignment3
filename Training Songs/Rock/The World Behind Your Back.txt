Does it follow me
Or follow you
Does it push you down
Or pull you through
Can you feel
Can you see
The world behind your back
Can you feel
Can you see
The world behind your back
Does it build you up
Or burn you down
Do you feel lost
Do you feel found
Does it touch your face
Or slap it hard
Does it stop too soon
Or go too far
Where will you go
When the gravity stops pulling
And what should you know
As you're floating skyward, endlessly
