You don't know how you move me
deconstruct me and consume me.
I'm all used up, I'm out of luck I am star struck
By something in your eyes
that is keeping my hope alive.

But I'm sick of myself when I look at you 
something is beautiful and true.
World that's ugly and a lie
it's hard to even want to try.
I'm beginning to think
maybe you don't know.

I'll take a leave, the room to breathe 
The choice to leave it
I'll throw away a chance at greatness just to make this
dream come into play
I don't know if I'll find a way

'Cause I'm sick of myself when I look at you 
something is beautiful and true.
World that's ugly and a lie
it's hard to even want to try.
I'm beginning to think
maybe you don't know.
