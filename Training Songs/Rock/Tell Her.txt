I know somethin' about love;
you gotta want it bad.
If that girl's (boy's) got into your blood, 
go out and get her (him).
If you want her (him) to be the very part of you
That makes you want to breathe,
here's the thing to do:
 
Tell her (him) that you're never gonna leave her (him),
tell her (him) that you're always gonna love her (him),
tell her (him), tell her (him), tell her (him) tell her (him) right now.
 
I know somethin' about love;
you gotta show it and make her (him) 
see that the moon up above, reach out and get it.
If you want her (him) to be always by your side
and if you want her (him) to only think of you,
 
Tell her (him) that you're never gonna leave her (him),
tell her (him) that you're always gonna love her (him),
tell her (him), tell her (him), tell her (him) tell her (him) right now.
 
Ever since the world began, 
it's been that way for man, and women 
were created to make love their destiny.
Then why should true love be so complicated?
Oh yeah, uh huh!
 
I know somethin' about love;
you gotta take it and show her (him) what the world's made of.
One kiss will prove it.
If you want her (him) to be always by your side
take her (him) hand tonight, swallow your foolish pride and 
 
Tell her (him) that you're never gonna leave her (him),
tell her (him) that you're always gonna love her (him),
tell her (him), tell her (him), tell her (him) tell her (him) right now.
