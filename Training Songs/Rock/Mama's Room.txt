Something's got my fear,
And then won't get through my head,
But there's something missing,
There's something missing here.
Here I go again,
React without a plan, oh,
But there's something missing,
There's something missing here.

Makin' love in mama's room,
Takin' all I can from you,
And when you go, go, go, oh, oh, oh,
Go, go, go, oh, oh, oh.

She's on high demand,
I can try but nobody can, oh,
But there's something missing,
There's something missing here,
Yeah.
Whoa,
Lay right on the floor,
I want to hear no more,
But there's something missing,
There's something missing here.

Makin' love in mama's room,
Takin' all I can from you,
And when you go, go, go, oh, oh, oh,
Go, go, go, oh, oh, oh.

Makin' love in mama's room,
Takin' all I can from you,
And when you go, go, go, oh,
And when you go, go, go, oh, oh, oh.

I like the pain that comes out at night,
Everybody dance, everybody feel right,
I like the pain that comes out at night,
Everybody dance, everybody feel right.

I can't sleep alone,
Everybody dance, everybody feel right,
I can't sleep alone,
Everybody dance, everybody feel right.

Makin' love in mama's room,
Takin' all I can from you,
And when you go, go, go, oh,
And when you go, go, go, oh, oh, oh.

Makin' love in mama's room,
Takin' all I can from you,
And when you go, go, go, oh,
And when you go, go, go, oh, oh, oh.
