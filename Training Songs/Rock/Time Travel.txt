Nothing is real,
I know this cause I made a deal,
With the devil he told me I was just wasting my time on the moon.
So I flew to the sun,
Lost track of my soul on the run,
Suffering 12 degree burns,
I learned that the sun was no fun.
So I ran back to earth,
Tripped and fell in the glorified dirt,
Honestly gravity sees me as a liability.
So I held my breath,
'Till my soul left my body for dead.
I ripped through the clouds to talk to the man in the sky.

I said take this for what it is,
I think you're a tad bit prejudice against,
The ones like us that are searching for the answers.
He said kid you don't know shit,
You should go back home and live,
In that quite little town you left behind.
I'm coming home,
Don't you cry, (don't you cry).
I'm coming home,
Just in time, (just in time).
I am a fake,
A constant go-getter of fate.
I lost track of time,
I carried my mind on a plate.
I seasoned it well,
With acid and MDMA.
Then I howled at the moon,
'Till the sun burned out both of my eyes.
So I checked my pulse,
Standing there white as a ghost.
I lacked in completion,
And stabbed my reflection twelve times.
So I held my breath,
'Till my soul left my body for dead.
I ripped through the clouds,
To talk to the man in the sky.

I don't know what I've been told,
I will sell my soul to rock and roll.
I don't know where to go,
I have lost control, oh no.
