Poets problem, patron saint
Puts me in the place I'm in
Passions letter
Poison pen
On these two things I can depend
Who will write your number on the wall?
I will not be there, when you call
I think I'll do a line and then again
Dirty dealers, school of thought
And armchair for the strength of thought
The TV sets been on all night
You were wrong and I was right
You will write your number on the wall
I will not be there when you call
I think I'll do a line and then again
Who will write your number on the wall?
I will not be there, when you call
You will write your number on the wall
I will not be there when you call
I think I'll do a line and then again
