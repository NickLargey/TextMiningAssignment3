Capp Street is an underwater cave 
That's filled with crutches and canes 
And faces that were washed away 
Away from innocence and pain 

They don't care who lost the one 
They just want to get the whole thing over and done 

They keep me up all night 
They sing songs to the moon 
Wishing they could close their eyes 
But they're waiting for Jacques Cousteau 

The girls outside - they're not waiting for the sun 
They just want to get the whole thing over and done 

Seems like bowl history down 
To a forty-five minute wait 
A big boredom filled with stars 
All burning with hate 

Yeah, we had a good time, we had some fun 
And now we want to get the whole thing over and done
