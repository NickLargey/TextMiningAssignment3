You said it once before
You don't do those things you used to anymore, 
You say in doubt, we're fading out
Forgetting who we used to be.

[Chorus]
Cause I will bring you down, 
I don't want to miss, I don't think you can handle this, 
You've lost what you can't find, never what you had in mind.

You take it with a smile, it's so easy when you're always in denial, 
Just in time, but out of line,
I can't make all the same mistakes you want me to.

[Chorus]

You're giving up, you know it's not what you need, 
And it's true what your going through, 
Try so hard not to listen to, everything I never say.

[Chorus]

I'm getting over, getting use to, 
And after all that I put you through, now I see, 
I'm not the only one, 
Never thought it would ever come to, 
This in fact was never what you wanted from me, 
Or how you meant it to be
