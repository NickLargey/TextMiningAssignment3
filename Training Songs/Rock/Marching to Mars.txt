Here we go marching to Mars
On a rainbow bridge
It doesn't seem so far
Steppin' into our universe
Moving towards life
To solve the problems on Earth
Everybody's marching to Mars
Gonna settle down there
Get me a house and a car
Save each other from ourselves
Poke our heads out of the sand
Sayin' Here I am
Marchin' to Mars
We're marchin' to Mars
Hollywood's marching to Mars
For a grand new movie
With some brand new stars
Plastered on the silver scren
Gonna bring it on home
So you won't have to leave
Is there life in the universe
Yeah, there's life in the universe
We'll find God in the universe
We'll find God but we'll find life first
Marchin' to Mars
Marchin' to Mars
We're marchin' to Mars
Marchin' to Mars
