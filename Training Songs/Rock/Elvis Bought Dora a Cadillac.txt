It was 1957, Evlis Presley came in the 
Spanish restaurant where Dora was working.
Dora took the order, bussed the plates, 
Poured the coffee as the party ate.
Col. Tom paid the check and Elvis Presley 
Left the tip, a brand new Cadillac....

And the Gods I loved were poor white trash.
One was making wine in Canaan, the other 
Tipping waitresses Cadillacs...

Twenty years later when Elvis died she parked 
The Caddy in the drive. With plaster statues, 
Lights, and stands she called her front yard 
PRESLEY LAND. She said he was just a poor man's 
Son who never forgot where he'd come.
Now that he is dead and gone she shares 
Her gift with everyone....

And the Gods I loved were poor white trash.
One was making wine in Canaan, the other 
Tipping waitresses Cadillacs...

The landlord had all he could stand.
Better cash was close at hand.
The land, the land, the land was in demand.
"Down the way they're selling German cars.
British clothes to movie stars.
We can kick the Spanish out for good, 
Rejuvenate the neighborhood. I'm the laughing 
Stock of all my friends, with that crazy old 
Woman and her Presley Land..."

When she was left with nothing, she said 
"They sold my house, can't get it back, 
Could hardly raise the cash if I sold 
My Cadillac...even if I could do that."

And the Gods I loved were poor white trash.
One was making wine in Canaan, the other 
Tipping waitresses Cadillacs...
