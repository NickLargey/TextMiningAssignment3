I got a line on you
We could be overdue
We could be trashed inside
We could be on the slide

No need to cool it out
Just one two three and shout
You just can't push me
You just can't push me
You just can't push me
Around

You got to help me in
You want to be my sin
You want to be my dream
You want to fill my dreams, yea
No need to feel it out

Just another something
To forget about
You just can't push me
You just can't push me
You just can't push me
Around
(Oh, not like this)

I got a line on you
We could be overdue
We could be trashed inside
We could be on the slide

You just can't push me
You just can't push me
You just can't push me
Around
