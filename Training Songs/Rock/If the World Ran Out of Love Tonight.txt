If the world ran out of love tonight
And there wasn't any hope in sight
It'd be up to you and me
To make the love the whole world needs

So I'll get up and lock the door
And baby, we can make some more
The world's supply will never end
As long as you and I pretend

That the world ran out of love tonight
Let's pretend that the world ran out of love tonight
As long as we are here together
Let's make enough to last forever

No one else has ever found
The part of me you're touching now
Suddenly it's clear to me
What a precious thing love can be

I can see you feel it too
'Cause baby, it shows on you
That our love will never end
As long as you and I pretend

That the world ran out of love tonight
Let's pretend that the world ran out of love tonight
As long as we are here together
Let's make enough to last forever
