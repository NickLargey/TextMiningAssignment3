I look ok but I'm not myself, standing by the phone
Darling I've been wondering how I'm gonna let you go
 
You made me build you a perfect world, to keep you satisfied
But now you're just a broken dream, and when I get back my pride
 
You'll still be waiting for love
You'll still be waiting for the sun to rise,
In the middle of the night
You'll still be waiting for love
I know you'll be waiting when that train passes by
You'll still be waiting for love
 
Like a dream there's a lucky feeling, coming from my soul
Girl I guess I learned the truth
That you already know (Oh oh oh)
 
Took me a while to realize, it's a dark and lonely town
And you'll know where you'll find yourself, 
when the wall comes 
Tumbling down
 
You'll still be waiting for love
You'll still be waiting for the sun to shine,
In the middle of the night
You'll still be waiting for love
I know you'll be waiting when that train passes by
You'll still be waiting for love
 
I lost my heart, I lost my mind
But it really doesn't matter
I'm gonna leave my tears behind
And you'll still be waiting
