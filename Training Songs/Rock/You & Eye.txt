You & I  may kill ourselves
You & I  go straight to hell
Where they have barbeque & beer
Better than they do up here

And you know all the words to the songs

Yeah--we smoke cigarettes
We dance with the dead
They're soft to the touch
We drink way too much

And Darling, I think you'll like it here
You might like it here

you & I  we ain't no saints
You & eye  we can see our fates

We'll be the faces in the clouds
We'll be a gospel singer's shout
We'll be the lights from an airplane
at night

Hey yeah--I can't stay in my skin
I been in here too long
But I know where to find, a really good
time
And darlin' I think you'll like it here
You might like it here

I'm gonna fall in love
With everyone I meet
And everyone I see
And everything I touch
And everything I feel

Isn't that the way 
It's supposed to be?
Isn't that the way
It's supposed to be?

I'm the look upon your face
The water on your lawn
The light from distant stars
The wreckage of a plane

The space between your teeth
The itch you cannot scratch
The mentally unfit
The pimple on your lip 

Isn't that the way 
It's supposed to be?
Isn't that the way 
It's supposed to be?
Isn't that the way 
It's supposed to be?
Isn't that the way 

I'm the ice cube in your glass
A busted Cadillac
The garden of delight
The joker in your deck

It ain't in what I feel
No, it ain't in what I say
And the pleasure of a kiss
It never fades away 

Isn't that the way 
It's supposed to be?
Isn't that the way 
It's supposed to be?
Isn't that the way 
It's supposed to be?
Isn't that the way 

You & I
