We will always be, we will always be, we will always be together
We may never see, we may never see, we may never see it again
Red light!!!

This is an alarm stay where you are
State of emergency!
This is an alarm don't go too far
State of urgency!

This is not the end
State of urgency!
This is not the end

We may never know, we may never know, we may never know what's ahead
If you believe it then you will see it it's in front of you, you know it's true
Red light!

This is an alarm stay where you are
State of emergency!
This is an alarm don't go too far
State of urgency!

This is not the end
State of urgency!
This is not the end

From the things we hate to the love we send what goes around comes around again
Standing on the starting line , make a wish and make it the time

It's just begun, it's just begun, it's just begun to matter
It won't be done, it won't be done, it won't be done until the time has come

This is an alarm stay where you are
State of emergency!
This is an alarm don't go too far
State of urgency!

This is not the end
State of urgency!
This is not the end
