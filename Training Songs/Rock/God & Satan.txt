I talk to God as much as I talk to Satan 'cause I want to hear both sides
Does that make me cynical
There are no miracles
And this is no miraculous life

I savour hate as much as I crave love because
I'm just a twisted guy
Is this pinnacle, is this the pinnacle, the pinnacle of being alive
Now I see the light

Well I look up to god and I see trouble 'cause this ain't a miracle
I just want to take my chance to live through a miracle

Ooahh
Ooahh

I know for certain that someone is watching but, is it from up or down
I make you miserable you stick with me although
You know I'm going to ruin your life

I talk to God as much as I talk to Satan 'cause I want to hear both sides
Does that make me cynical
There are no miracles
And this is no miraculous life

We walk into the ride

Well I look up to God and I see trouble 'cause this ain't a miracle
I just want to take my chance to live through a miracle

When the see-saw snaps and splinters your hand don't come crying to me
I'll only see your good side
And believe it's a miracle
A miracle

I slap the water and watch
The fish dance to the ripples of us
We're the dull blue duds
Blinking eyes encased in rust

This ain't a miracle
This ain't a miracle
This ain't a miracle
This ain't a miracle

Ooahh
Ooahh
