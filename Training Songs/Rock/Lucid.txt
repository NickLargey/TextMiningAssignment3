If you know my trouble
Then you should sense my doubt
Did I burst your bubble
When I found you out

Can you hear me now
Because you're faded know
Don't know what if true
Cause I can see right through you
I'm Lucid

Do you know who you are
And what would make with scar
Did you give them my name
When you were feeling the strain

But you don't ask why
Just let it pass you by
There's nothing you could do
Cause I can see right through you
I'm Lucid

So you found your glory
But I have my doubts
And I know your story
And the part you left out

And you're faded now
Like a low white lie
Like the friends you choose
I can see right through you
I'm Lucid
