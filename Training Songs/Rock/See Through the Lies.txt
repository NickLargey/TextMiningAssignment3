This world a fucking lie.
Your life contained by their plan,
Creating all you see.
You worship a fools gold.
Live blind, I can see through the lies
Your goals implanted in your mind,
Obey and fulfill their dreams.
Its always just out of reach,
Hands tied, I can see through the lies

The life that I despise is all you have,
Its not enough for me.
Content to die for nothing,
There's more that I see.
I can see through the lies.
I've come too far and I won't turn back,
To accept this, to deny it.
You live blind, but I can see through the lies.
