"The minstrel boy to the war is gone
In the ranks of death you'll find him;
His father's sword he has girded on,
And his wild harp swung behind him."

Go get your guns it's time to play
Let's hurry up don't waste the day
Out in the park we'll stage a fight
Just like on the T.V.
You play the one who has to die
I'll shoot the gun and you will cry 
You will fall down and I will run
Just like on the T.V.
My daddy has a gun for real
I'm gonna have my own someday
Just like on the T.V.

My daddy told me what to do
If anybody bothers you
He says the law is on our side
Just like on the T.V.

You've gotta shoot first
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
And ask your questions later
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
Shoot first
You gotta get them before they get you 

My older brother has his own 
It's got a handle made of bone
He carries it all over town
Just like on the T.V.
My daddy gave my mama one
Genuine real pearl-handled gun
She says she got to have her one
Just like on the T.V.
Did you see who got shot last night?
I stayed up to watch him
They rushed him off to surgery
Right there on the T.V.
Gosh I hope they catch the guy
I think they ought to shoot him
But if they bring him back alive
He'll be on the T.V.

You've gotta shoot first
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
And ask your questions later
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
Shoot first
You gotta get them before they get you

I've got to go it's getting late
I wish I had a real gun
Then I would never be afraid
Like some guys on T.V.
I'd never use my gun on you
You'd never have to worry
You'd be the good guy on my side
Just like on the T.V.

I think when I grow up someday 
I'm gonna join the NRA 
I saw them telling what they're for
Last night on the T.V.
My daddy says it's not a game
We've got to play to win it
He says I'll have to learn to fight 
Just like on the T.V.

You've gotta shoot first
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
And ask your questions later
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
Shoot first
You gotta get them before they get you

"Land of Song," said the warrior bard,
"Tho' all the world betrays thee,
One sword at least thy rights shall guard,
One faithful harp shall praise thee!"
