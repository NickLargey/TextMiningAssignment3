Come lay down next to me
We'll feed our desires, do whatever may come
And we'll get high
Watch all the colors bleed into one
With all the sounds, the beautiful sounds
 
Is it me or is my imagination running wild?
Some things are not what they seem, no
You know I'd ask you to come into my world for a while
But I know it's only a dream
 
I was looking down into you
Alone as you slept without a care in the world
Just you and I together forever, but we lost what we found
In all the sounds, the beautiful sounds
 
Is it me or is my imagination running wild
Some things are not what they seem, no
You know I'd ask you to come into my world for a while
But I know it's only a dream
 
Why do you think you're over
All the people who together held your hand?
You know I'll see you forever more
As I drown in sleep and dream of you instead
 
Is it me or is my imagination running wild?
Some things are never, never, ever what they seem
You know I'd ask you to come into my world for a while
But I know it's only a dream, yeah
 
I never need to awaken
I never want to end this sleep
Who is watching over...
Who is watching over you?
Who is watching you tonight?
 
Is it me or is my imagination running wild
Is it me or is my imagination running wild
Is it me or is my imagination running wild
Is it me or is my imagination running wild
