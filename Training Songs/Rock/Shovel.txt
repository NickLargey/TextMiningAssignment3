I've come back from all my quitting
I've come back from all my slitting
Only to find that i have laid a lonely shovel in my bed 
I've come back from all my slitting
I've come back from all my quitting

Is it that every car I hear is yours coming up the hill 
Hey, slice up my grave
I proved you my grave
Diggin' up, fillin' up, get enough 

The only way I could do it is to run into your shovel
The only way I could do it is to run into your shovel 
The only way I can dig is to run until you dig it
The only way I can dig is to run until you dig it 
Rot my cot
Fool for me to think
You're letting me split this scene
