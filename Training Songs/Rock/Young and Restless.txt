Standing at attention, waiting for the bell to ring
After all the crap I've been through gonna make my break
Whatever it takes to let them know that I'm not foolin'

Young and Restless Runnin' out of control...
Young and Restless Headin' for an overload...

Going for reaction, good or bad I don't care
Doing something drastic to turn the adrenaline on
Then take a stand and say I didn't know what I was doing

Young and Restless Runnin' out of control...
Young and Restless Headin' for an overload...

Trying for attention, recognition for the pain
Flyin' solo, its a vision so lost and so alone
Then all at once, it's gonna hit you without warning

Young and Restless Runnin' out of control...
Young and Restless Headin' for an overload...
