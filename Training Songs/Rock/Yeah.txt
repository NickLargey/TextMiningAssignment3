We're all sitting on a spaceball looking smart
Making babies breaking hearts
Wasted maybe we don't care
We are just a bunch of kids but we have a plan
We're a customized breed for the next century
Yeah, yeah
Have another one
Have more of all
Never ending fun
Have another one
Have more of all
Never ending fun
Have another one
Yeah

If you want to come along, 
Want to have some fun
We know where the night is young
Finger licking, looking hot
We are just a bunch of kids but we're growing up
We're a wealthy young breed, we're the evil seed
Yeah yeah
Have another one
Have more of all
Never ending fun
Have another one
Have more of all
Never ending fun
Have another one
Yeah
