I'm in love for the first time
I'm in love with your mom
Got a lump in the pants for her
I am the Son of Vom

Making out
Shacking up
Your Jazz is really hot
But your mummy
Is so yummy
She's something you are not
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOUR MOM

got my hands on your knockers
Yours are better than some
Yours have never had milk
Not like the ones on your mom

Highschool english
You got an A
You knew your Dickens plot
But your mom
Has been to college
You're just a dropout twat
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOUR MOM

I got my fingers in you baby
Wish they were in your mom
Suckin on her nips that's right
And her suckin on my prong!
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOUR MOM

Every night
I get a hard
I beat it till I'm sore
You wonder why
I'm often limp
It's cause I want her more
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOUR MOM
