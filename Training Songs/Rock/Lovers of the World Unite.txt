Lovers of the world, unite 
You alone know what is right 
People all should feel this way 
Needin' someone every day 
Keep the fire of dreamers bright 
Lovers of the world, unite 

All good people, hear my song 
If you feel the world is wrong 
All division, no one shares 
Dreams are dying, & no one cares 
Seems that just the young know how 
So I ask you, listen now 

Such a pity, such a shame 
Man has only hate & blame 
Give them beauty, give them life 
He created toil & strife 
Seems that just the young know how 
So I ask you, listen now
