So many heartbreaks
So little time
Too many tragedies
Too many crimes
Put on your body armor
Prepare your alibis
'Cause there is no one else
Gonna put it right

To the rescue
Down the streets and alleyways
Past the Chinese takeaways
Through the wind and driving rain
To the rescue
When the world won't understand
Government's got other plans
Take the law into your hands
To the rescue

Got a vigilante
Sleeping in my bed
I looked for Marilyn
I got Che instead (yes I did)
But I'll march behind you
Wherever you may go
And I'm more proud of you
Than you can ever know

To the rescue
Through the snow and freezing rain
Down deserted country lanes
Round the world and back again
To the rescue
Taking the forgotten ones
Big and small, the old and young
When nobody else will come
You'll come to the rescue
To the rescue
