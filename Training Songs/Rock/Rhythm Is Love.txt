If I try to take you there, would you come with me?
The reason flies, the fear is scare, the ocean loves the sea
If I try to take you there, would you come with me?
The reason flies, the fear is scare, the ocean loves the sea
Rhythm is love
Heaven is just another world
For the feelin called
Musical

Color is lust
Because all of the sexual "thangs"
We do
In my mind
I trust you make em all colorful
I'd like to put you
In such a romance

Take you down
To paris, france
Leave the caf√© and the bars
Walk the wintry boulevards
Is that a smile I see ?
Well, maybe your not even
Looking at me
Cuz if you smile for no reason

The season is lost
But if your love is the rhythm
Ma rhythm is love
Chorus
Ma rhythm is love
Coming at you
Just like this!
