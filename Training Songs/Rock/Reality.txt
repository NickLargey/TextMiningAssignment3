There's a space shuttle, in the sky tonight
A moonlight sky and the stars are very bright
He wants to go and fight them on his own
He's living in the bedroom, all alone
And he's seeing, things he has never, ever seen
He's in the real reality, he's blown his mind
And things, are being seen so differently in the real reality
He's blown his mind
There's a devil in the fire changing color so much
Warm hands in the fire, no burning touch
Can't wait to meet them, go upstairs, there's and evil air
The bed is moving, all around him, say your prayer
