Yeah, bringing you another disturbing creation
From the mind of one sick animal who can't tell the difference
And gets stupefied

I've been waiting my whole life for just one, f*ck
And all I needed was just one, f*ck
How can you say that you don't give a, f*ck
I find myself stupefied, coming back again
All I wanted was just one, f*ck
One tiny little innocent, f*ck
And when I feel like I'm shit out of, Luck
I find my stupefied, coming back again

Why, do you like playing around with
My, narrow scope of reality
I, can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down
And why, do you like playing around with
My, narrow scope of reality
I, can feel it all start slipping away

See but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it
I get stupefied
It's all the same you see
Live with it but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it
I get stupefied
I get stupefied

All the people in the left wing, f*ck
And all the people in the right wing, f*ck
And all the people in the underground, f*ck
I find myself stupefied, coming back again
All the people in the high rise, f*ck
And all the people in the projects, f*ck
And all la gente in the bario, f*ck
I find myself stupefied, coming back again

Why, do you like playing around with
My, narrow scope of reality
I, can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down
Why, do you like playing around with
My, narrow scope of reality
I, can feel it all start slipping away

See but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it
I get stupefied
It's all the same you see
Live with it but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it
I get stupefied
I get stupefied

Tifached
Tifached

And don't deny me
No baby now, don't deny me
And darlin' don't be afraid

Well, I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it
I get stupefied

Look in my face, stare in my soul
I begin to stupify
Look in my face, stare in my soul
I begin to stupify
Look in my face, stare in my soul
I begin to stupify
Look in my face, stare in my soul
I begin to stupify
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, stare into my soul
Look in my face, stare into my soul
I begin to stupify, ah
