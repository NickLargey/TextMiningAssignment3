The sun is out - the sky is blue 
there's not a cloud to spoil the view 
but it's raining - raining in my heart 

The weather man says clear today 
he doesn't know you've gone away 
and it's raining - raining in my heart 

Oh, misery - misery 
what's gonna become of me 

I tell my blues they musn't show 
but soon these tears are bound to flow 
cause it's raining - raining in my heart 

But it's raining - raining in my heart 
And it's raining - raining in my heart
