I I got somethin' baby on my mind
It's tearin' me up inside
And I got to let loose tonight baby now

I know you, can see what I'm goin through
Everybody telling me what to do, 
Well I need somebody to talk to

Well I'm different I can feel the changes
But I can't turn back the pages
And our hearts are all we have to save us
Come on save me tonight

We're gonna ride the night away
Yeah babe we're gonna ride the night away
Well there ain't no time left to borrow
I guess I'll have to think about it tomorrow
We're gonna ride, ride the night away, yeah baby.

I, got a gun pointed at my head
I put it there by myself
I can't ask ya but I need some help, baby now

Let me tell ya hunny
I got a fire burnin' in my soul
Well I'm dangerous and out of control
And tonight I got to let it go.

I can't look back baby I've tried
It's too late for me to compromise
Well I need somebody by my side
Come on save me tonight.

We're gonna ride the night away
Yeah babe we're gonna ride the night away
Well there aint no time left to borrow
I guess I'll have to think about it tomorrow
We're gonna ride, ride the night away.

I can't look back baby I tried
It's too late for me to compromise
Well I need somebody by my side
Come on save me tonight

We're gonna ride the night away
Yeah babe we're gonna ride the night away
Well there ain't no time left to borrow
I guess I'll have to think about it tomorrow
We're gonna ride, ride the night away.
