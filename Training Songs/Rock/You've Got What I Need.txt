Been down and depressed, my body's aching
Trembling hands, cold feet, and shaking knees
But people say that nothing was wrong
Except I've been in love too long
I've gotta find a woman knows how to care for me

And baby now you've got, you've got what I need
Yeah yeah, you've got, you've got what I need, oh

I used to laugh when I heard no man was an island
Never believed two heads were better than one
But now I've had a change of heart
But nothing's going to keep us apart
I've gotta find a woman knows how to care for me

And baby now you've got, you've got what I need
Yeah yeah, you've got, you've got what I need, oh

Yeah, girl, you look so fine
Thank god I changed my mind
Can't wait to see what I find in you

You've got, you've got what I need
You've got, you've got what I need, ooh yeah
You've got, you've got what I need, baby now you've got it
You've got, you've got what I need, ooh yeah
You've got, you've got what I need
You've got, you've got what I need, yeah yeah...

You've got, you've got what I need
You've got, you've got what I need'
