Well, she started out to be a dancer
She's gonna make her livin' dancin' in the Broadway shows
So she hitchiked cross-country from Pasaroba to the Big Red Apple
Where your dreams are made, and your debts are paid on time

[Chorus]
I'll hold you close, taxi dancer
And I'll listen to how you outgrew your dreams, and how they faded away
I'll hold you close taxi dancer
And we'll pretend this floor is the Broadway stage

Well, she wasn't used to livin' in the city 
So she took a job as a maid, cleanin' up at the Gramercy Park Hotel
And all her auditions: they didn't turn out so pretty
So she took a job dancin' at the bar down the street as well

[Chorus]

Well, I don't know how long or how far her fortune did take her
But I heard she sits alone, drunk in a bar down on 42nd Street
And sometimes an old butch will slip a quarter into the jukebox
And she'll stagger to the bar and dance with that girl for free

[Chorus]
