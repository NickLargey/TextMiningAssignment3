She's on the radio
She's my best friend
But she will barely let me know
About her

She's on the radio
And I only know
About her favorite animal
(The tiger)

Here she comes now
On the radio
There she goes now
Here she comes now
Here she comes now
On the radio
There she goes now
Through the sea of waves between us

Radio never lies
Just like your mother
Or like that guy who slowly died
In his trailer

Radio never lies
Not like the baker
Who sells a hundred photographs
Of his daughter

Here she comes now
On the radio
There she goes now
Here she comes now
Here she comes now
On the radio
There she goes now
Through the sea of waves between us

I am the radio
It really grows
There are a hundred books around
That I will close now

I am the radio
It really shows
There are a hundred things to say
That I won't say no

Here she comes now
On the radio
There she goes now
Here she comes now
Here she comes now
On the radio
There she goes now
Through the sea of waves between us
