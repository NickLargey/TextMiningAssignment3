Loosing the night
We visit town
It's a bumping along
Meant to man down

Another fight
Dozen rounds
Watching sped up scenes
From "Broken machines"

Life's a pearl for the nowhere girl
Oh, darling, see what you're missing
Don't worry I can't tell that you
Was someone else when I kissed you

[Chorus]
He said girl, you look amazing
This part is over, now I'm 'bout to take you home
Girl, you look amazing,
I never wanna, no, I never wanna go

If we got heartbeats to spend
I'm gonna spend my night cashing them in
Loosing the night
We visit town
It's a bumping along
Meant to man down

In the gutter you discover
All the things you miss
You wanna take me by the hand
And show me a love I would never understand

He said girl, you look amazing
This part is over, now I'm 'bout to take you home
Girl, you look amazing,
I never wanna, no, I never wanna go
