We're going over the country
And into the highlands
To look for a home
We're leaving nothing behind us
And no one will find us
When we're on our own

I feel the planets surround me
They gather around me

We're moving out of the city
We'll pack up the kiddies
And make for the road
Where flowing rivers will bind us
And shadows will find us
Now we're on our own

I feel the planets surround me
They gather around me
