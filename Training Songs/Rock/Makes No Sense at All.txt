Walking around with your head in the clouds
It makes no sense at all
Sell yourself short, but you're walking so tall
It makes no sense at all

Is it important? You're yelling so loud
It makes no sense at all
Walking around with your head in the clouds
It makes no sense at all
Makes no difference at all
Yeah, it makes no sense at all
Makes no difference at all

Well I don't know why you wanna tell me
When I'm right or when I'm wrong
It's the same thing, in your mind,
The only time I'm right is when I play along
When I play along

Walking around with your head in the clouds
It makes no sense at all
Sell yourself short, but you're walking so tall
It makes no sense at all

Is it important? You're yelling so loud
It makes no sense at all
Walking around with your head in the clouds
It makes no sense at all
Makes no difference at all
Yeah, it makes no sense at all
Makes no difference at all

You concern yourself with evidence
It's evident to me
Well you say you've got the tiger by the tail
But I don't see these things that way
See these things that way

Walking around with your head in the clouds
