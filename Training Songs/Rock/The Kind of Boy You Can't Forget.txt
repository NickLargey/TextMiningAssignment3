The Raindrops
(Male singing "Diddle-diddle-diddle-it" followed by female singing of the same; this
occurs frequently throughout the song)
I remember when I first saw him
Something told me that I couldn't ignore him
& I've been dreamin' of him every night ever since we met
'Cause he's the kind of boy you can't forget
(He's the kind of boy you can't forget)
I remember when I first kissed him
He touched my hand & then I couldn't resist him
& though he kissed me 'bout a week ago, I ain't got over it yet
'Cause he's the kind of boy you can't forget
(He's the kind of boy you can't forget)
Wo wo wo wo wo, wo wo wo wo wo
I could be so happy knowing he was mine (yeah yeah yeah) all the time
& I could make him happy, I would treat him good, yes I would, wo wo
Wo wo wo wo wo, wo wo wo wo wo
(instrumental)
Gotta tell him that I adore him
There is nothin' that I wouldn't do for him
I won't be happy till I make him mine & a wedding day is set
'Cause he's the kind of boy you can't forget
(He's the kind of boy you can't forget)
(repeat scat singing & fade)
