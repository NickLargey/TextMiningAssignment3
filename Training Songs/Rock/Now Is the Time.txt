Now, now is the time for lovin’ me
Now, now, now, now, now

It’s the time now for lovin’ me, baby
It’s the now time to please me
Oh baby, tease me in the morning
It’s the right time to seize me in the night
'Cause I’m ready for love and I know it's for me
'Cause I finally see, just how full life can be
It’s the time for me
Now, now is the time for lovin’ me
Now, now, now, now, now

It’s the time now for kissin’ me, baby
It’s the now time to brother me
Oh baby, smother me in the morning
It’s the right time to cover me in the night
'Cause I’m ready for love and I know it’s for me
'Cause I finally see just how full life can be
It’s the time for me
Now, now is the time for lovin’ me
Now, now, now, now, now

It’s the time now for never-let-go-in’
It’s the now time for showin’ me

In the right time, so groove me in the night
'Cause I’m ready for love and I know it's for me
'Cause I finally see just how full life can be
It’s the time for me 
Now, now is the time for lovin’ me
Now, now, now, now, now
