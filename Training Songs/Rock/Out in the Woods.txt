Well I'm goin' down,  Goin down a hard road			Just don't know,  Don't know where I've been                        A But I think I've been walkin',  I'm walkin' round in circles      Can't even find a friend
Woah... my love,  My love she is not waiting                        Think I might've been gone,  I've been gone too long             Look at the people,  People make me crazy
I can hardly sing my song
Hustlers stand around me, I'm lost and all alone
Can't tell the bad from the good
I'm lost in the woods, I'm lost in the woods
Big city gamblers,  Gamblers take my money
Yes it gets to be useless,  Yes it's useless to me
And I think I'm lost,  When I'm lost inside this Jungle
Can't see the forest for the trees
Well pretty little,  Woman come and get me                          Try me,  Try me one more time
Yes and your sweet,  Your sweet understanding
Can't fix this broken heart of mine
The vultures fly around me, Come and take me home
Can't tell the bad from the good
I'm out in the woods, I'm lost in the woods....	I'm a man gone crazy in the woods.  I'm wondering around in the bush.
