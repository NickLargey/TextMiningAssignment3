They took the beat away, replaced it with machines 
They took the words away and threw 'em on a screen 
They turned the switches on and handed us the phones 
They blasted out our ears with endless monotone 
Can you feel it, can you feel it 
From a million miles away 
Can you hear it, can you hear it 
Getting louder everyday 

Give the music back, give the music back 
Give the music back before it's gone 
Give the music back, give the music back 
Put the music back into the song 

They drove the blues away and banished rock n' roll 
They cut away the heart and sacrificed the soul 
They closed the discos down and shut off MTV 
They locked the music up and threw away the key 

Can you feel it... 
And now a silence fills the rooms where once we sang 
And all is quiet where once the chimes of freedom rang 
Somewhere a pirate ship is crashing through the waves 
Sending a signal out, a ballad to the brave 

Give the music back, give the music back 
Give the music back before it's gone 
Give the music back, give the music back 
Put the music back where it belongs...
