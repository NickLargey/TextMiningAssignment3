I've made some plans
But it's all up in the air
I made some sandwiches
And I got myself a garden chair
And forty-five balloons
One sunny afternoon

I suppose it's not surprising
I'm three thousand feet high and rising

Miles above your backyard
San Pedro's just a postcard
Don't call me a nincompoop
Just call me the coast guard

I know this seems ridiculous
I'm an idiotic Icarus
But a man just can't sit around all day
Up, up and away
