Can't live today off that minimum wage
unless you sleep on the factory floor
If there is anything great left in this sorry state
it was built on the backs of the poor
So we buy and we sell for your corporate cartel
and we vote when the contestant sings
A mind-control mix for our obedience,
strong sleep-aids and hard energy drinks
Cause Freedom is not free
Neither is apathy

Slay Goliath, slay Goliath
The flashmob all held up their phones
But you cannot predict when the students riot
And a big machine always moves slow
So throw your little stone

You can't stop us
We are Anonymous
You can't stop us
We are Anonymous
Expect us
We know what all of us know

You can't stop us
We are Anonymous
You can't stop us
We are Anonymous
Expect us
We know what all of us know

A half-dozen cops came to seize a laptop
from a sleeping fifteen year old kid
They broke down the door
and discovered some more,
A hundred million exactly like him
So we do not forgive and we do not forget
We are legion, expect us, you'll see
The righteous will resist,
underfed eat the rich
And the data mines finally come clean
Cause Freedom is not free
And neither is secrecy

You can't stop us
We are Anonymous
You can't stop us
We are Anonymous
Expect us
We know what all of us know

You can't stop us
We are Anonymous
You can't stop us
We are Anonymous
Expect us
We know what all of us know

We know what Big Brother did
We're the Tattletale
We'll see your All-Seeing-Eye in hell
