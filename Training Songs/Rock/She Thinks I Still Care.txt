Just because I asked a friend about her, 
Just because I spoke her name somewhere,
Just because I dialed her number by mistake today, 
She thinks I still care.

Just because I haunt the same old places, 
Where the memory of her lingers everywhere,
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be, 
She thinks I still care.

Oh if she's happy thinkin' I still need her, 
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer,
Oh how could she ever be so foolish, 
And where would she get such an idea?

Just because I asked a friend about her, 
Just because I spoke her name somewhere,
Just because I saw her, then went all to pieces, 
She thinks I still care.
She thinks I still care.
