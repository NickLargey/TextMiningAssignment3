It's fools like us
Always fooled
By the bright side of life
Then life on the cool
How does it turn?
How does it turn?
Into the dying embers
From a love that burned

On it's way to your heart somehow
On it's way to your heart somehow
On it's way to your heart somehow

They're falling again
My shining stars
From out of your heaven
And into my heart
Ribbons and chains
Ribbons and chains
Tie us together
And keep us apart

Got to get to your heart somehow
Got to get to your heart somehow
Got to get to your heart somehow

If I could be someone
Someone better than me
I would be that someone
Who's still waiting
Waiting to be free

It's always fools like us
Always burned
On the dying embers
Of a love that's turned

On it's way from your heart somehow
On it's way from your heart somehow
On it's way from your heart somehow
On it's way to your heart somehow

Time is on our side
