Rain falls from southern skies
I got a river falling from my eyes
It's a bad desire for another world
I break down in the dark of night
Where is she goin' in a dress so tight
You should be waiting for me....Victoria

Now who do I turn to
Oh, I can't keep it inside, keep it inside, keep it inside

I want to go where the lovers go
I want to know what the lovers know
Walking the dark nights alone with you
Like lovers do, like lovers do

Come and take me far from home
I'm so tired of being alone
I got a bad attraction and it's you tonight
You don't know it, but I'm watching you
And I'm seeing everything that you do
The only thing between us is a neon light

Now who do I turn to
Oh, I can't keep it inside, keep it inside, keep it inside

I want to go where the lovers go
I want to know what the lovers know
Walking in the dark nights alone with you
Like lovers do, like lovers do

If all of the angels came down from the skies
I'd show them that heaven was right in your eyes (now wouldn't I)

I want to go where the lovers go
I want to know what the lovers know
Walking the dark nights, me and you
Like lovers do, like lovers do
