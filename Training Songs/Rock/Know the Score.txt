Turned on the tv screen and what did I see
A video collage of our atrocities
Turtles getting cut open by poachers 
Knife how can I just look at that and not 
Change my life

Sometimes my life is so lucky and 
Sometimes its not 
I'm lucky enough to do something more

Something else I saw that made
Me want to boff
It was a video of an elephants tusk
While they were chopping it off
Why do us human beings have to wreck
Everything without a fuckin' thought
Of the pain, yeah that it brings
Yeah that it brings, yeah that it brings
Yeah that it brings

Brings brings brings
That it brings
Brings brings brings 
Yes of the pain that it brings
Yeah that it brings
