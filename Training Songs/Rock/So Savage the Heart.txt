Well it's six am. on a winter day
And it's raining a storm inside
And I'm steppin out
To the black stone pavement  
From my prison of lonely nights

This love is cold and hot now
These dreams of fire burned out
You bruised my pride, but somehow
I'll make it through, babe
I know I'll find a way, yeah

[Chorus]
So savage the heart that beats in you
I can hear the laughter
So savage the heart that beats in you
And that's all that matters
You've won the game
About how much you really know

As I walk alone, on these empty streets
Till the pain of the past is gone
Well I can still see you there
Drunk and laughing 
To the bed of your best friends arms 

This love is cold and dark now
These dreams of fire burned out
My hope is lost but somehow
I've gotta be brave
I know I'll find a way, yeah

So savage the heart that beats in you 
I can hear the laughter
So savage the heart that beats in you
And that's all that matters

You wanna hide your shame
From the town, deep inside your soul
Well the bones you've broken
On the trusting hand
And the moonlight promise
When we first met
Well I know there's justice
You're gonna get yours too
Some nights you'll look back
And wish that I was still there

Well, someday your heart will breakdown
But I just wanna tell, that you'll cry out and say

So savage the heart that beats in you
I can hear the laughter
So savage the heart that beats in you
And that's all that matters

[Chorus]

You're gonna call my name
On a cold dark night
You'll ask forgiveness
But I won't be there
For your savage heart
