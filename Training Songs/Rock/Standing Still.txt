What I see and what I need are two different things
But I see what I need
They become the same

c'mon sit back
Just try to relax and feel a little bit empty inside
There's still no hope at the end of the rope, it feels
Like someone has left you behind

Am I standing still?
Where do we go from here?

What I see and what I need are two different things
But I see what I need
They become the same

c'mon this time
It seems to be fine it feels
Like someone has left you behind
The shit rolls out and you try to get out, you fear
That nothing's left inside

Am I standing still?
Where do we go from here?

Am I standing still?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go from here?

What I see and what I need are two different things
But I see what I need
They become the same

Am I standing still?
Where do we go from here?

Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go from here?

What I see and what I need are two different things
