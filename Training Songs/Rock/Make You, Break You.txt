Many times I've seen you
Each time you always act the same
You've got everything you'll ever need, on that we're all agreed
I really do believe that butter wouldn't melt in your mouth.

You started out saying that you knew me
But I've never known anyone like you
You said we thought the same, so I just played the game
I really didn't mind 'cause I knew that I was winning all the way.

It takes so long to make you, but a whole lot less to break you
'Cause every time you try to act like a lady, you give yourself away
It takes so long to make you, but a whole lot less to break you
'Cause every time I see you look into a mirror, I can tell that's who you really are.

Why don't you take a look around you?
Just try and see the other side
Maybe you'll find it strange, or maybe you'll like the change
At least you would know there were other people living in the world

You can't play the same old game forever
Someone will surely cut you down
So if you're going to stay around, get your feet back on the ground
Find your direction, follow it all the way.

It takes so long to make you, but a whole lot less to break you
'Cause every time you try to act like a lady, you give yourself away
It takes so long to make you, but a whole lot less to break you
'Cause every time I see you look into a mirror, I can tell that's who you really are.
