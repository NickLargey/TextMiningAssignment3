Can you tell what's on my mind
She's with him it drives me wild
I'd like to hit him on the head until he's dead
The sight of blood is such a high
Ooh, he gives me head

We made it on a ballroom blitz
I took his arm and kissed his lips
He looked at me with such a smile, my face turned red
We booked a room into the Ritz
Ooh, he gives me head

Jet boy jet girl
Gonna take you round the world
Jet boy, I'm gonna make 'em penetrate
I'm gonna make you be a girl
Ooh, jet boy jet girl

I know I'm only just fifteen
I like to kick, I like to scream
And even if I have a kick or two in bed
When I'm with him it's just a dream
Ooh, he gives me head

Jet boy jet girl
Gonna take you round the world
Jet boy, I'm gonna make 'em penetrate
I'm gonna make you be a girl
Ooh, jet boy jet girl

The other day what a surprise
I saw him with some other guys
God, he was dressed up with a girl around his neck
I could have cried with both my eyes
Ooh, he gave me head

And if and when I make it through
Or if my brain is stuck on glue
And when the world trusts you to forget all that
I said I'll still remember you
Ooh, you gave me head

Jet boy jet girl
Gonna take you round the world
Jet boy, I'm gonna make 'em penetrate
I'm gonna make you be a girl
Ooh, jet boy jet girl

Jet boy jet girl
Gonna take you round the world
Jet boy, I'm gonna make 'em penetrate
I'm gonna make you be a girl
Ooh, jet boy jet girl
