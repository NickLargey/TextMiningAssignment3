Yoo, whoa, yoo

Wipe away your tears
Let's take a little walk up melody hill
Put aside your fears
We're gonna take a walk up melody hill

While sun shines on the flowers
(La, la, la, la)
We'll kiss away the hours
(La, la, la, la)
Listening to our happy little song

Baby, me and you are living
In a dream like Jack and Jill
Where skies are always real
Where grass is always green on melody hill

There's always perfect weather
(La, la, la, la)
For me and for us together
(La, la, la, la)
Baby, that's the place where we belong

(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, melody hill)
People laugh and
(Melody hill)
Skies are sunny
(Melody hill)
Birds are singing
(Melody hill)

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

While sun shines on the flowers
(La, la, la, la)
We'll kiss away the hours
(La, la, la, la)
Listening to our happy little song

(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, melody hill)
People laugh and
(Melody hill)
Skies are sunny
(Melody hill)
Birds are singing
(Melody hill)

Oh yeah
(Melody hill)
People grooving
(Melody hill)
Flowers growing
(Melody hill)
Skies are sunny
(Melody hill, melody hill)
