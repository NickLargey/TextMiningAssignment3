What would you do
If I told you
To run from him?
What would vou say
If I told you to
Abandon him?
I khow you drink,
You've had a lot to drink,
Do you have to talk like that?
If you go to parties
And cut your hair
People grab their hats.
Ah, but I know with a heart like that
In times like these with a heart like
That you cut it out.

What would you do
If I told you
To pack your bags?
What would you say
If I told you
To take off those rags?
I know you're down,
I know you're blue,
You broke his spell.
If you want life
You take that life
And you live it well.
Ah, but I know with a heart like that
In times like these with a heart like
That you cut it out.

Have you lost vour marbles?
You're not that crazy yet.
Listen to me, don't you forget.
What would you say
If I told you
You had to run from him?
Ah, but I know with a heart like that
In times like these with a heart like
That you cut it out.
