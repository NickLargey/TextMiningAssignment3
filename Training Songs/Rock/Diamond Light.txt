Why don't we pick one script and read it
Where the milk has dried on the throne
Open wide sing 
gracefully beside
Rolling rivers of diamond light

Dash and heave each ache to the sky

Why don't we choose one to believe in
Where shadows die
Also alone
Coincide
Colliding points of view
Perfect mountains of diamond light

Dash and heave each ache to the sky

Are you scared?
Are you frightened?
Terrified of being alone

Are you scared?
Are you frightened?
Terrified of being alone
