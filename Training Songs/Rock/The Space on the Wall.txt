Sometimes honesty gets in the way
Help me turn this around I
Feel like everyone's playing a game
I want to turn around
So when everything breaks, it's okay
I'm nervous now in the end
Sometimes honesty pulls me away
Help me turns this round, I
Feel like everyone's playing the game
I'm certain now in the end
When you go home
To the same room
You stare at the space on the wall
And you know that in your mind
It's not right
It's all a mistake
Iâ€™m waiting for the day
That you will know
I could just so easily fall in
It feels right
I stand closer
Cracks appear in walls
I can see the other side
It's waiting for you
All that you wanted
When you go home
To the same room
You stare at the space on the wall
And you know that in your mind
It's not right
It's all a mistake, and you're fallin' away
Cause it is true
It defines you
The moment you break is the moment you change
It's all fine From the outside
Waiting for the day that you will know
Waiting for the day that you will know 
Fly!
Walk away
This is wrong
It will stay
If I am wrong
You will change
You will become
You're the same
Do you feel anything inside anymore?
How far would you go?
How far would you go?
How far would you go?
How far
