Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
We are kneeling at the river's edge and tempting
All the steps to follow closer right behind
Is it only when you feel a part is empty
That it’s gnawing at the corners of your mind

I will ask you for mercy
I will come to you blind
What you’ll see is the worst me
Not the last of my kind

Ooh
In the muddy water we’re falling
Ooh
In the muddy water we’re crawling
Holds me down
Hold me now
Sold me out
In the muddy waters we’re falling

It is not clear why we choose the fire pathway
Where we end is not the way that we had planned
All the spirits gather 'round like it's our last day
To get across you know we’ll have to raise the sand

Ooh, I will ask you for mercy
I will come to you blind
What you’ll see is the worst me
I'm not the last of my kind

Ooh
In the muddy water we’re falling
Ooh
In the muddy water we’re crawling
Holds me down
Hold me now
Sold me out
In the muddy waters we’re falling

Ooh
Don’t fail me now
Put your arms around me and pull me out
Ooh
I know I’m found
With your arms around me, oh save me now

Ooh
Oh, oh
Ooh, in the muddy water we’re falling
Ooh
In the muddy water we’re crawling
Holds me down
Hold me now
Sold me out
In the muddy water we’re falling
