As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.
