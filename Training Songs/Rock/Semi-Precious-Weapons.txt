I can't pay my rent but I'm fucking gorgeous
I've got big lungs that'll kill your chorus
If you want to try
You better come inside
I can't pay my rent but I'm fucking gorgeous!

Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
You c-c-c-c-can't, cos you don't!

I don't drink booze cos my heart's explosive
I gave up food cos that shit's expensive
I know you want to be me
But baby it ain't easy
Don't drink booze cos my heart's explosive!

Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
You c-c-c-c-can't, cos you don't!

Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
I got a diamond in my pocket and a gun in my purse
Scream "Semi Precious Weapons" or ya might get hurt!

Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
C'mon, tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
I can't pay my rent but I'm fucking gorgeous!
