I hold your hand and
Gently touch your hair
Then we'll walk
Together hand in hand
The way it used to be

The way you smile
And kiss me tenderly
Tears begin to fill my misty eyes
Now you're gone from me

Where are you going to, my love
Will you come back
When the sun shines
Anytime you want to
Come home, it`s all right
Where are you going to, my love
Will our love return tomorrow
Anytime you want to call me
It's all right

I hear your voice
It`s always haunting me
Everywhere I turn
I see your face
But you`re never there

You`re all I have
(You`re all I ever had)
You`re all I`m living for
I can`t bear the pain and misery
Please come back to me
