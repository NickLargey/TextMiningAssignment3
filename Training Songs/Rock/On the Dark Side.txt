The dark side's callin' now, nothin' is real
She'll never know just how I feel
From out of the shadows she walks like a dream
Make me feel crazy, make me feel so mean

Ain't nothin' gonna save you from the love that's blind
Slip to the dark side and cross that line
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
