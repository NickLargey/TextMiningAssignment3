Tell me a story 'bout a fella with a crazy dream 
Everybody tells him that it won't amount to anything 
He fires the shot heard around the world 
He wins the prize and he gets the girl 
That's the kind of story I like, the kind that makes you think 

Sing me a song about a cowboy with an achin' heart 
Ridin' along the lonesome prairie 'bout to fall apart 
Every time those doggies moan 
He doesn't feel so all alone 
That's the kind of song that I like, the kind that breaks your heart 

Paint me a picture of a girl with a secret smile 
Lookin' back at ya 'cross the years through ancient eyes 
You're standin' there like an open door 
Cause she's seen it all before 
That's the kind of picture I like, the kind that makes you sigh
