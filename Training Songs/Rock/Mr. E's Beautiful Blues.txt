The smokestack spit
Black soot into the sunny sky
The load on the road 
Brings a tear to the Indian's eye 
The elephant won't forget
What it's like inside its cage
The ringmaster's telecaster
Sings on an empty stage

Oh-ho
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Oh-ho
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Oh-ho

The girl with the curls
And the sweet pink ribbon in her hair
She's crawlin' outta' window
'Cause her daddy just don't care
Come on

Oh-ho
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Oh-ho
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Oh-ho

The clown with the frown
Drivin' down to the sidewalk fair
Finger on the trigger
Let me tell you it is quite a scare

Oh-ho
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Oh-ho
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Oh-ho

The kids fit the lids
When their heads hear that crazy sound
My neighbour digs the flavour
Still he's moving to another town
And I don't believe you're comin' back

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Oh-ho
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Oh-ho

Well I don't know how you're taking
All the shit you see
You don't believe anyone
But most of all openly agree
With you

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day (with you)
Oh-ho
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Oh-ho
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Oh-ho
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Oh-ho
