All the kings and queens
Of the Bible
They could not turn back time
So what chance have I
Of a miracle 
In this life of mine?

I only want one day
So unsay the things I said
Undo the thing I did
Twenty four little hours
Oh God please wipe them all away
And I promise I will change

If I could start today again

I know I'm not the milk and honey kind
Today I proved it true
But when the red mist falls around my eyes
I know not what I do
Please give me back today
And I won't say the things I said 
Or do the thing I did
Every minute every hour
The replays just the same
And I can't stand the shame

Let me start today again

I only want one day
One lousy day
That's all
Of every day that's been before
Since time began
I know my prayer's in vain
But for a second I'll pretend
That I can start today again
