You could have stepped into the top of the water poles
Into the wells of the shimmer love
She's gonna drive you to the shores
But you don't know who you are
I tell her take your time now
You're gonna take, take your time

Walking through the city of too many roads
When I don't know how to walk
Staring all the pretty lights
Get off it starts feeling right
Places you will go

It can be shiny, tiny, stranger wandering
And if you don't wanna ride
It's gonna get a little lonely, that's right
The only thing you need to feel
Should have ?

Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla
Been talking so talking but you don't wanna hear
It's one of the seasons, let me try, trying to find
Put the trouble ?
Get out, get out the world you came
Places you will go
All the places you can go
It's so simple now
Feels like we don't want anyone
Put your head down on my shoulder
I can turn, we can turn to the places we know
I can turn, we can turn to the places we know
Turn in time and find some
