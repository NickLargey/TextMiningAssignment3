A fire is burning low the moon is on the rise
Stuck in a devil's canyon surrounded by all sides
Got nowhere left to run time is drawing near

Well load up your guns its time to fight
It just don't matter who's wrong or right
Load up your guns get a man in your sights
This canyon's gonna feel the fire tonight

We've been together since the day we were born
And watched our daddy die - shot and killed
End of story too many pages torn

Ya ain't gonna run ya ain't gonna go down alone
Many a man good, bad never see the dawn

Pappy wouldn't sell our home to make way for the tracks
Somebody from a big old railroad had my daddy shot in the back

Chorus repeat and bridge repeat

Well load up your guns its time to fight
It just don't matter who's wrong or right
Load up your guns get a man in your sights
This canyon's gonna burn

Chorus repeat

This canyon's gonna feel the fire
This canyon's gonna burn
This canyon's gonna burn like hell
