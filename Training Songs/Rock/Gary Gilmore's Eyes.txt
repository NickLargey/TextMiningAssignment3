I'm lying in the hospital 
I'm pinned against the bed 
A stethoscope upon my heart 
A hand against my head 
They're peeling off the bandages 
I'm wincing in the light 
The nurse is looking anxious 
And she's quivering with fright 

I'm looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes 
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes 

The doctors are avoiding me 
My vision is confused 
I listen to my earphones 
And I catch the evening news 
A murderer's been killed 
and he donates his sight to science 
I'm looked into a private ward 
I realize that I must be 

Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes 

I smash the light in anger 
Push my bed against the door 
I close my lids across the eyes 
And wish to see no more 
The eyes receives the messages 
And sends them to the brain 
No guarantee the stimuli 
Must be perceived the same 

When looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes 
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes 

Gary don't need his eyes to see 
Gary and his eyes are parted company
