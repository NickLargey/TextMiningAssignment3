If I had another chance tonight
Id try to tell you that the things we had were right
Time cant erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared

Now you're gone, I'm really not the same
I guess I have myself to blame
Time cant erase the things we said
But it gives me time to realize 
That you're the one instead

You know I won't hold you back now, 
the love we had just can't be found
You know I can't hold you back now

Now that I'm alone it gives me time
To think about the years that you were mine
Time can't erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize 
Just how much you cared

You know I wont hold you back now
The love we had just cant be found (listen to me baby)
Listen to me baby
You know I cant hold you back now
