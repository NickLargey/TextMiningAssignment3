Can you tell what's on my mind?
She's with him, it drives me wild
I'd like to hit him on the head
Until he's dead
The sight of blood is such a high
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
He gives me head

We made it on a ballroom blitz
I took his arm and kissed his lips
He looked at me with such a smile
My face turned red
We booked a room into the Ritz
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
He gives me head

Jet boy, jet girl
Gonna take you 'round the world
Jet boy I'm gonna make him penetrate
I'm gonna make you be a girl
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
Jet boy jet girl

And though I'm only just fifteen
I like to kick, I like to scream
And even if I have a kick or two in bed
When I'm with him it's just a dream
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
He gives me head

Jet boy, jet girl
Gonna take you 'round the world
Jet boy I'm gonna make him penetrate
I'm gonna make you be a girl
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
Jet boy jet girl

The other day, what a surprise
I saw him with some other guys
God he was dressed up
With a girl around his neck
I could have cried with both my eyes
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
He gave me head

And if or when I make it through
Or if my brain is stuck on glue
And when the world tries to forget
All that I've said
I'll still remember you
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
You gave me head

Jet boy, jet girl
Gonna take you 'round the world
Jet boy I'm gonna make him penetrate
I'm gonna make you be a girl
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
Jet boy jet girl

Jet boy, jet girl
Gonna take you 'round the world
Jet boy I'm gonna make him penetrate
I'm gonna make you be a girl
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
Jet boy jet girl
