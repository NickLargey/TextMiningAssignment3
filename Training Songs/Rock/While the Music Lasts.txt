See you out on the floor
Where the speakers blast
Dancing while the music lasts

Up and above the stars shine
On the nights you've passed
Dancing while the music lasts
Dancing while the music lasts

Teach me I want to know
How you move so fast
Dancing while the music lasts
Dancing while the music lasts

Waking up tomorrow 
This will be the past
Dancing while the music lasts
Dancing while the music lasts
