Papa says; it's a bitch to recognize it
Like catching rhythm from the pouring rain.
Mama says; it's a flicker in the eye of a lover.
Why would Mama lie?
It's so hard to explain
It's the light that keeps shinning
It's love! 

[Chorus]
Don't you know what love is
Let me show you love, girl
Don't you know what love is
It could be so long
And I know that it could last forever! Haah! 

I feel the passion in you growing stronger
And girl, you should know by now
Here I am calling you from the still of the moment
To the heat of the night
It's a joy to explain
It's a light that keep shinning in me for you
It's love! 

[Chorus]
Don't you know what love is
Let me show you my love, girl
(Oh, don't you know what love is)
Don't you know what love is

I could be the one
(Papa says; it's bitch to recognize it) Don't you know
(Mama says; it's a flicker in the eye of a lover) Oh! 
This could be the one
Yes, it's got to be the one
(Why would Mama lie?)
Don't you know what love is

[Chorus]
Love (Don't you know what love is) girl
Let me show you my love, girl
(Don't you know what love is)
Oh, it can be so strong
(Don't you know what love is)
It's got to be the one
(Don't you know what love is)
I could be the one

Don't you know what love is
