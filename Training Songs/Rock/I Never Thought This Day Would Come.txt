When did I become a habit
That you kicked long ago
A tired refrain on a broken down train
Old lantern buried in snow

I tried to reach you with science
To find a familiar phrase
A word that sticks, that helps to fix
The fragments of your face

I never thought this day would come
Now it won?t go away

I broke down on Union Street
?Cause you won?t come back to mind
Stuck on a note, an old song I wrote
On a tape I cannot rewind

You were the back of my hands dear
But now I can?t recall
I blame myself over and over
So you can?t blame me at all

I never thought this day would come
Now it won?t go away

I just want to feel something
Something, something
I just have to feel something
Something, something

When did we wake up lonely
Our connection falling short?
Stuck behind wires, impossible fires
Still the same distance apart

I never thought this day would come
Now it won?t go away

I just want to feel something
Something, something
I just have to feel something
Something, something
