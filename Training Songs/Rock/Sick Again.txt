From the window of your rented limousine 
I saw your pretty blue eyes 
One day soon you're gonna reach sixteen 
Painted lady in the city of lies 

Oh, do you know my name? 
Do I look the same? 
You know I'm the one you want, babe 
I must be the one you need, yeah 

Clutching pages from your teenage dream 
In the lobby of the Hotel Paradise 
Through the circus of the LA queens 
How fast your learn the downhill side 

Oh, how you like my face? 
Still don't know your name
You know I'm the one you want, babe 
Oh yes, I must be the one you need, yeah

Oh, you got me feeling
Just a bit, just a bit

Lips like cherries and the brow of a queen 
Come on, flash it in my eyes 
Said you dug me since you were thirteen
Then you giggle as you heave and sigh 

Oh, do you know my name? 
Do I look the same? 
Baby I gotta tell you, I'm the one you want
And everybody know I'm the one you need, yeah

Oh, give it to me, come on now

Hours, hours, and the moments in between 
Oh, baby, I couldn't count the times 
The fun of comin', oh the pain in leavin' 
Baby, dry those silver eyes 

Oh, do you know my name? 
Do I look the same? 
You know I'm the one you want 
Oh yes, I'm the one you need 

Oh, that's right, oh, yes that's right
Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right
Oh yeah, that's right
