Talking away 
I don't know what I'm to say 
I'll say it anyway 
today's another day to find you 
Shying away 
I'll be coming for you love O.K. 

Take on me 
Take me on 
I'll be gone 
in a day or two 

So needless to say I'm odds and ends 
But that's me, stumbling away 
Slowly learning that life is O.K. 
Say after me 
It's no better to be safe than sorry. 

Take on me 
Take me on 
I'll be gone 
in a day or two. 

The things that you say 
Is it live or just to play 
My worries away 
You're all the things I've got to remember 
You shying away 
I'll be coming for you anyway 

Take on me 
Take me on 
I'll be gone 
in a day or two
