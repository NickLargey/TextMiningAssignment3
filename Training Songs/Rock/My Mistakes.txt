You know I do my best thinking when I’m flying down the bridge.
Humming to myself and kicking up my kicks
? have to ? for my life
I hope I won’t crush like another summer,
I’m back on the bridge was just a wooden half,
? like he said it was back in 56.

[Chorus]
I thought I’d learnt from my mistakes,
I thought he’d learnt from my mistakes,
I thought you’d give me the right advice,
I thought he let me in for one last time.

? like an old time movie,
? she’s got kind of a native vibe before that was so cool
She’s got kind of a native vibe before I knew who was who
And he's ignoring me like it's 2001.
Why keep time travelling if it doesn’t get better on me?
A second time move on,
Why keep time travelling if it doesn’t get better on me?
A second time move on,

[Chorus]
I thought I’d learnt from my mistakes,
I thought he’d learnt from my mistakes,
I thought you’d give me the right advice,
I thought he let me in for one last time.

? on another Sunday morning,
Carrying umbrella, and talking on the phone!
? cut my hand and my knees.
? from California and I swear, I swear they’re here!
I swear they saved my life!

[Chorus: x2]
