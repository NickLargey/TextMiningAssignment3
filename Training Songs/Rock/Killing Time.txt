Now here's a little storyline
About some people in their prime
We sit indoors, we laugh and chat
We never goes outside the flat
Unless we're out of cigarettes and wine

We're killing time, we're doing fine
There's nothing to it
We're killing time, we're doing fine
We're born to do it
So take my hand, who needs a plan
When life is grand in our wonderland

Now here's a little lullaby
To make you sleep I'll have to lie
The skies are blue, the grass is green
The future is the best we've seen
And everyone relies on natural highs

We're killing time, we're doing fine
There's nothing to it
We're killing time, we're doing fine
We're born to do it
So take my hand, who needs a plan
When life is grand in our wonderland

Ba ba ba ba ba

We're killing time, we're doing fine
There's nothing to it
We're killing time, we're doing fine
We're born to do it
So take my hand, who needs a plan
When life is grand in our wonderland
