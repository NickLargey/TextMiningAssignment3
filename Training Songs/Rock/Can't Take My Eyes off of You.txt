No I can't, well I can't take my eyes off of you

4 to 9, 9 to 4
I take you baby, we're out on the floor
I get you 9 tonight again
And I use it when I can
A shimmy shimmy coco
Gimme gimme more of, more of what you got for me
I gotta let you let you know it every night
Yes you make me see

CHORUS:
But I can't take my eyes off of you
No matter what I want to do
Well I can't take my eyes off of you

Your money's late and you're crazy with me
Yes I know you've been told so before
I get it up, yes my cashflow is down
And I help you out the door

But I can't take my eyes off of you
No matter what I want to do
But I can't take my eyes off of you

I think about you all the time
I think about the day you will be mine
You make me feel alright
I think about you every night

(solo)

But I can't take my eyes off of you
No matter what I want to do
Well I can't tak my eyes off of you

Well I can't take my eyes off of you
No matter what I want to do
But I can't take my eyes off of you

Well I can't take my eyes off of you
No matter what I want to do
But I can't take my eyes off of you
