Winchester Cathedral
You're bringin' me down
You stood there and watched as
My baby left town

You could've done something
But you didn't try
You didn't do nothing
You let her walk by

Now everyone knows
Just how much I need her, that girl
(Are you that girl?)
She wouldn't have gone far away
If only you'd started ringing your bell

You stood there and watched as
My baby left town

You're bringin' me down

But you didn't try
No, you didn't do nothing
You let her walk by

Now everyone knows
Just how much I need her, that girl
(Are you that girl?)
She wouldn't have gone far away
If only you'd started ringing your bell
