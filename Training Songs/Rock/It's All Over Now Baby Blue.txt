You must leave, now take what you need
You think will last
But whatever you wish to keep
You better grab it fast

Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the Sun
Look out baby, the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, baby blue

The highway is for gamblers
Better use your sense
Take what you have gathered
From coincidence

The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky too is fallin' in over you
And it's all over now, baby blue

Leave your stepping stones behind
There's something that calls for you
Forget the debt you've left
That will not follow you

Your lover who has just walked through the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is foldin' over you
And it's all over now baby blue

Well, strike another match
Yeah, go start new, go start new
'Cause it's all over now, baby blue

Hey, hey, yeah
It's all over, it's all over now, baby blue
It's all, it's all over now, oh yeah
It's all over now, all over now, baby blue
