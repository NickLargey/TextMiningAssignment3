As all the rooms are full of empties
The wine attempts to tempt me
Would you help me disappear?
And we'll let the path go hungry
And head at last to country
Or a small town away from here

And maybe there we'll finally see
There is no need to try
All our lives
For a reason why

'Cause when the moon is glowing dimly
Upon our hopeful chimney
Trouble simply reappears
To throw a monkey wrench in
And hold the world's attention
With a show of surreal fear

Hoping for an answer
I glance up to indifferent skies
There's no reply
Or a reason why
Reason why

All we would hear
Is a deafening silence
Hollywood tears
In frivolous times
Oh to be near your love

You can wonder where the time went
Or what it was it all meant
It's been a life spent wondering why
Looking for a name or
Coat to pin the blame on
I'm done sighing for a reason why
Reason why
Reason why
Reason why

All we would hear
Is a deafening silence
