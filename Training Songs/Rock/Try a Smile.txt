There's nobody here
There's nobody home
There's no one I can turn to
Or call my own

But this is what I've wanted
For a long long while
So I lay back, take it easy
And try a smile

So strange, how we go
Our love never shown
Except, when we are parted
Or oh, so alone

When we're together
We miss love by a mile
So I lay back take it easy
And try a smile

Can this really be for the best
I got an achin' in my heart
I wanna tell you that I love you

I know we had to close the door
Only to find that there were more
I wanna tell you that I love you
Yes, I do, yes, I do, yes, I do

There's nobody here
There's nobody home
There's no one I can turn to
Or call my own

But this is what I've wanted
For a long long while
So I lay back, take it easy
And try a smile

Can this really be for the best
I got an achin' in my heart
I wanna tell you that I love you

I know we had to close the door
Only to find that there were more
I wanna tell you that I love you
Yes, I do, yes, I do, yes, I do
