You walk around with peers
You think that I'll shed a tear
But I got no sympathy
Can I run to cure me
You get what you paid for
As I go walking through the door

[Chorus]
Feel the pressure now you need a cure
So listen up baby before you hit the floor
So listen up baby before you hit the floor

don't bore us
With your tales
Its been so easy all these years
Laugh at you is what we'll do
Your message never did get through
Its mine for the giving and yours for the taking
Your one chance don't be mistaken

[Chorus]

Before you hit the floor!

[Chorus: x4]
