Older 
It seems like each day you get older 
And each day the world becomes colder 
In a cynical way 
Time 
Do you feel like you've missed your time? 
I feel like I've missed mine 
And I'm losing my way 

I think it's time you realized 
For I can see it in your eyes 
You seem convinced that you will live forever 

Over 
I feel like my life has blown over 
I keep looking over my shoulder 
And seeing nothing but grey 

It's a crime 
Don't it seem like such a crime 
I wish I had more time 
But I'm drifting away 

Older 
You see it's like I told you 
You've gained the right to grow older 
By living today 

I think it's time you realized 
For I can see it in your eyes 
You seem convinced that you will live forever
