Who's the man who stole fire for the people?
Who causes trembling in the bones of evil?
Who carved a mountain into a cathedral?

I am immortal.

Half-blind and spitting straight into the wind,
Down, down, trying to drag me down.

It's all right, I go to dreaming.
It's all right, I go to dreaming.

In dog yearsâ?¦

The blood of lions,
I, liquefying.
I ain't dying.
I am immortal.

Who rides the solar cycle with no hands ma?
Who found the ark inside texarkana?
Who asks the questions that have no answers?

Half-blind and spitting straight into the wind.
Down, down, trying to drag me down.

In dog yearsâ?¦

I am immortal.
I am immortal.
I am immortal.

In dog yearsâ?¦

The blood of lions,
I, liquefying.
I ain't dying.
I am immortal.
