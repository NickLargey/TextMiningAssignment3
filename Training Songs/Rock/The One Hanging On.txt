You’ve been there before 
You know how it feels 
You think they’ll come around 
You know that’s unreal 
You express you want more 
You give them time 
You think they’ll come around 
You’ve lost your mind

I know you’re not over him 
But baby he’s over you 
I won’t say that I told you so 
I wouldn’t be that cruel 

And I don’t wanna be the one hanging on 
Stuck thinking of someone that can’t be won 
I don’t wanna be the one hanging on 
Stuck thinking of someone that can’t be won

You see them now and then 
You can’t turn it off 
You think things have changed 
You can’t be wrong 
You ask where do you stand 
You wait to hear 
You’re told that you’re the past 
Your biggest fear 

I know you’re not over him 
But baby he’s over you 
I won’t say that I told you so 
I wouldn’t be that cruel

And I don’t wanna be the one hanging on 
Stuck thinking of someone that can’t be won 
I don’t wanna be the one hanging on 
Stuck thinking of someone that can’t be won

I don’t wanna be the one hanging on 
Stuck thinking of someone that can’t be won 
I don’t wanna be the one hanging on 
Stuck thinking of someone that can’t be won

And I know you’re not over him 
But baby he’s over you 
I won’t say that I told you so 
I wouldn’t be that cruel

And I don’t wanna be the one hanging on 
Stuck thinking of someone that can’t be won 
I don’t wanna be the one hanging on 
Stuck thinking of someone that can’t be won

I don’t wanna be the one hanging on 
Stuck thinking of someone that can’t be won 
I don’t wanna be the one hanging on 
Stuck thinking of someone that can’t be won
