Bye, bye butterfly
I get a little outta control
You mind your mama
Else she gonna swallow you whole

Infect me, protect me
She gonna resurrect me, I know
'Cause baby, I'm livin from dime to dime
If down is up I think 
I'll be doin alright, tonight

And I roll and it feels good around
I got sold for nuthin' as it seems
Infect me, protect me
She gonna resurrect me, I know

Bye, bye, butterfly
I get a little outta control
'Cause when the moon done
Get snuffed out
On your knees, you gonna 
See the sun cut down

Neglect me, select me
She gonna disconnect me 
I know and I roll
