I can't believe, I can't believe
How could this be, how could this happen?
When I awoke I was more broke then you can ever imagine
Because when I come up, I'll come back down
So hard, so fast, can't slow it down
Crash through the chaos of my storm
Babe, don't take off and join the
Swarm

I can't explain, I can't explain
The injuries that I've sustained
What can I say, what can I say
I'm off the rails, get out my way
Because when I come up, I come back down
So hard, so fast, can't slow it down
Crash through the chaos of my storm
Babe, don't take off and join the
Swarm

Come up, come up, I come back down
So hard, so fast, can't slow it down
Crash through the chaos of my storm
Babe, don't take off and join the
Swarm
