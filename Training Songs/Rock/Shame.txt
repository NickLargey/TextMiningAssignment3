Is it dark yet outside?
I'm through hiding tonight
Take from the rest, your debt erased
Sleep with my curse and feel no shame
No shame

It might take you all night
But you'll love me with time
Take from the rest, your debt erased
Sleep with my curse and feel no shame
No shame

Take from the rest, your debt erased
Sleep with my curse and feel no shame
No shame

Is it dark yet outside?
I'm through hiding tonight
Take from the rest your debt erased
Sleep with my curse and feel no shame
No shame

Take from the rest your debt erased
Sleep with my curse and feel no shame
No shame
