Way up north by the ice bound ocean
I was born I was born
Way up north in the Merrimack county
That's my home that's my home

When I was younger and in my schooling
I walked the mountains made of stone
The distance sang about tomorrow
And I did wish I was grown and gone

Well as I grew indeed I rambled
Out along the open road
There I learned the rainbow circle
It's truly said that's a sign of storm

Now I'm old my dreams they wander
Far away in yesterday
I'm going home to the Merrimack county
And find the grass that hides my grave

So let the birds fly down the valley
Let the storms roam on the sea
I was born to the rainbow circle
Stoney mountain that's home to me
