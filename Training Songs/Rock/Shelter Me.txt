There's a storm in my soul
And there's a wind, sharp and cold
Oh my heart, it's sinking deep
I'm going down
Shelter me

In Your arms
Been lost at sea, far too long
Just let me be, where life is sweet
Shelter me

[CHORUS]
Hold me close, 'til darkness flies
And disappears, in the morning sky
Then I'll stand strong, and face the day
But 'til the dawn...

Shelter me, from my fears
Be my friend, dry my tears
And give me love, that's safe and true
When I'm lost, I'll come running home to you

[CHORUS]
Hold me close, 'til darkness flies
And disappears, in the morning sky
Then I'll stand strong, and face the day
But 'til the dawn...

Shelter me, from my fears
Be my friend, dry my tears
Shelter me, 'til the dawn
In Your love, I'll stand strong
Shelter me
Shelter me
Shelter me.
