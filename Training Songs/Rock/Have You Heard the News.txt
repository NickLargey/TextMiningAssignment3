Have you read the papers?
Have you heard the news?
Then why'd you get out of bed?
Didn't you hear what they said?

They said today's the coldest Monday
Since it froze that awful Sunday
Was it in the afternoon that I got so wet?
I forget

Don't turn on the TV
No, I don't wanna see it
It only means more bad news
I've had enough of the blues

I'm gonna pull the bed clothes tighter
'Til there ain't another fighter
Left to want to change the world
I'll bury my head
Like I said

Oh, that I could get my vision back
I could see things that I lack
Love is a dream that floats away
