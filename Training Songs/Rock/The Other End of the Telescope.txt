Shall we agree for this just once
I'm going to change my life
Until it's just as tiny or important as you like
And in time 
We won't even recall that we spoke
Words that turned out to be as big as smoke
A smoke that disappears in the air 
There's always something that's smoldering somewhere 

[Chorus:]
I know it don't make a difference to you 
But oh it sure made a difference to me 
You'll see me off in the distance I hope 
At the other end 
At the other end of a telescope

The promise of indulgences in my confidential voice
Approached immortal danger but you'll never know how close 
Then down the hall I overheard such a heavenly choir 
They interrupted my evil designs 
One day you're up in the clouds 
The next thing you're down with the sweet Adelines

[Chorus]

Lie down baby now
Don't say a word 
There there baby your vision is blurred
Your head is so sore from all of that thinking 
I don't want to hurt you know
But I think you're shrinking 

You're half-naked ambition and half out of your wits 
Or several tiny fractions that this portrait still omits
Now it's so hard to pick the receiver up when I call 
I never noticed you could be so small 
The answer was under your nose 
But the question never arose

I know it don't make a difference to you 
But oh it sure made a difference to me 
You'll see me off in the distance I hope 
Cause late in the evening as I sit here moping 
With a bamboo needle on a shellac of Chopin 
And a cast-iron heart that you failed to rip open 
At the other end 
At the other end of the telescope
