There was a little girl, I used to know her
I still think about her, time to time
There was a moment when I really loved her
Then one day, the feeling just died
Chorus
We went straight into darkness
Out over the line
Yeah straight into darkness
Straight into night
I remember flying out to London
I remember the feeling at the time
Out the window of the 747
Man there was nothin', only black sky
(Repeat Chorus) 
Oh give it up to me, I need it
Girl, I know a good thing when I see it
Baby wrong or right, I mean it --
I don't believe the good times are over
I don't believe the thrill is all gone
Real love is a man's salvation
The weak ones fall the strong carry on
Straight into darkness
Out over the line
Yeah straight into darkness
Straight into night
