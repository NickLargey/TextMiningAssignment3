You've got no one to defend you, you're out on your own
Still fighting on the corner, you can never go home
In this world of temptation, in this city of sin
There's nothing that can save you, but a strength from within

[Chorus]
Because they'll do it again, they've done it before, 
The Devils Brigade
Headed down a dead end road with the Devils Brigade
You're being led astray

The crew will not rest until your life's in the piss
Stop and think of you're future, the chances you'll miss
Looking back on a resume of corruption and crime
Cause you wasted your youth, taken down in your prime

[Chorus]

Dying to belong though it's tearing you apart
A bullet to the head and a knife to the heart
Are the tools of the trade in this cold life of crime
A smart, decent kid who has now lost his mind
