It's all eggs, bacon, beans and a fried slice

Did you hear the one, yeah yeah
The one they wrote in the paper just the other day
Well, well, would you believe it
Well I said they took it all the wrong way

Now you've gotta be careful 'bout what you say
Cause they've got a bad habit
Were you're reading between the lines?
Or is that what I said?, now I just can't remember

They seem to have a very good memory though
But as far as I'm concerned, as as far as I'm concerned
You don't have to be black, white, Chinese or anything really
Just enjoy, shut up, listen and dance

It's all eggs, bacon, beans and a fried slice

(Don't quote me on that) don't quote me on that
(Don't quote me on that)
Please don't quote me (don't quote me on that)
(Don't quote me on that)

Hey Hey, you know something, I said I liked that guy
But that's not what I read in the paper
I don't have anything against them
It's just eggs, bacon, beans and a fried slice

(Don't quote me on that)
Hm, don't quote me on that (don't quote me on that)
Please don't quote me (don't quote me on that)
(Don't quote me on that)

You know, now we get worried about what we say
You know, we shouldn't be that way
You know, I don't care who comes
Cause as far as I'm concerned
It's eggs, bacon, beans and a fried slice

Don't quote me on that [x2]
Please don't quote me

Mama, mama, you know I'm still friends with Mickey
They say that I shouldn't like him anymore, 'cause I'm all white
Well, he's allright by me

Don't Quote me on that (don't quote me on that)
Please don't quote me (don't quote me on that)
(Don't quote me on that)

Now what I do is
I bring all my old friends along to see the show
And if you have the wrong ideas well

It's all eggs, bacon, beans and a fried slice

(Don't quote me on that, oh no) (don't quote me on that)
Please don't quote me (don't quote me on that, oh no)
(Don't quote me on that) I never said that
(Don't quote me on that) that's not what I meant
Well, I suppose you could take it that way (don't quote me on that, oh no)
But that's not what I meant to say (don't quote me on that, oh no)
Won't you give me another chance (don't quote me on that, oh oh oh)
Please, please
Don't quote me on that

(Don't quote me on that, oh no)
I'd like to say thank you to Pete, Peter Tosh
And all the other people who come and they believe in us for the fun and the music
Cause all I've got to say to you press now is:
It's all eggs, bacon, beans and a fried slice

Eggs, bacon, beans and a fried slice
Go to Maggies caff
132 Liverpool road
Just down the road, just round the corner
Only there's not much corner
It's just chairs and tables and they've even got a Space Invaders machine
A cup of tea, that's fine for me
'Cause it's all eggs, bacon, beans and a fried slice

Are you sure you turned that tape recorder off?
Are you sure? [x2]
