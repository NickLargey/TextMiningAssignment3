The river of love is risin' at my doorstep, it won't let me be.
I keep dreamin' of you and what the river will do
As it starts flowin' over me.

The river of love is risin' by my window, it won't let me sleep.
It's so windy and black and there's no turnin' back
'Cause I know I'm in so deep.

[Chorus]
In so deep, (in so deep)
In so deep, (in so deep)
In so deep,
So deep in the river of love.

(Repeat chorus)
Bridge:
I got to go where it takes me
I got to follow the flow.
I got to follow that feelin'
Wherever the river may go.

The river of love is always all around me, since I took my leap.
It will carry me through and keep me with you
'Cause you know I'm in so deep.

(Chorus)
(Chorus)
(Chorus)

The river of love.
