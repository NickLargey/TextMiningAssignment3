I have never loved
A woman that haunts me like you do
I can’t get enough, oh

Trust is easier when
I can hold on to you like I do
But lately I’m spent

'Cause you keep me waiting
Shaking
Trembling
Chasing
Mistakes that I made
Which words did I say
Oh I can’t take it I need you
Right now cause you keep me waiting

You, you're easy to chase
Your gravity pulls me into you
I can’t get away, oh

'Cause you keep me waiting
Shaking
Trembling
Chasing
Mistakes that I made
Which words did I say
Oh I can’t take it I need you
Right now

'Cause you keep me waiting
Shaking
Trembling
Chasing
Mistakes that I made
Which words did I say
Oh I can’t take it I need you
Right now cause you keep me
