I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there 
But she never comes 
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes 
And I rise to face another day 
Without her 

Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo

It's just no good anymore when you walk through the door 
Of an empty room 
And you go inside and set a table for one, it's no fun 
When you spend a day 
Without her

Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo

We burst the pretty balloon, took us to the moon 
It's such a beautiful thing 
But it's ended now 
And it sounds like a lie 
If I said I'd rather die, than live without her

Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo

Love is a beautiful thing when it knows how to swing 
And it grooves like a clock 
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part 
And it's breaking my heart 
To have to spend another day without her

Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo

I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there 
But she never comes 
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes 
And I rise to face another day 
Without her

Doo doo, doo doo doo

Can't go on without her 
Doo doo, doo doo doo
There's no song without her 
It's all wrong without her 
Can't go on without her
