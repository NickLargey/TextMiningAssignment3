Tell me it's crazy
Don't feel like I'm lazy
Just trying to get me some cheap

Cry cause they're staring
But nobody's caring
You know we can't stay underground

Get this, shoot this
Yeah but baby I'm still losing
Get this, shoot this
Yeah but baby I'm still losing
Baby I'm still losing

Watching is easy
Took one song to please me
These feelings don't want to be found

You talk like you mean it
You walk like you're dreaming
So baby stop writing it down, yeah

Get this, shoot this
Yeah but baby I'm still losing
Get this, shoot this
Yeah but baby I'm still losing
Baby I'm still losing

(Come and get it)
Yeah I'm open to suggestion like before
Always open to suggestion give me more!

Get this, shoot this
Yeah but baby I'm still losing
Get this, shoot this
Yeah but baby I'm still losing
Baby I'm still losing
Baby I'm still losing
Baby I'm still losing.
