He scares easily
It makes him so angry
At me

And his head it spins around
Just like the Exorcist and I
Find it ever so
Hard to resist his cries

But there's nothing more sadistic than an infant
Waving his pistol in my face
He wants me right down on my knees
Crumbling in disgrace

But he underestimates my mind 
I know he's messing with my head
My only weakness is
I can't believe the guy could be entirely dead

[Chorus]
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Trigger Happy Jack
You're gonna blow
But I'm gonna get off 
Before you go
My Trigger Happy Jack is just a
Drive by a go-go

And after awhile he calms down
And he looks at me like a prince
But I know I better bite the bullet
'Cause it's just another one of his 
Jedi mind tricks

But this ain't no headtrip honey
This is a collision on the road
And you've got me feeling oh just like a roadkill
And you know deep down I know

[Chorus]

Why do you make me feel like this? (1-2-3-4)
Why do you gotta be such a dick? (1-2-3-4)
Why do you make me feeling like this? (1-2-3-4)
Why do you gotta be such a dick? (1-2-3-4)
Go-go

And I hate myself
Just enough to want him
But I hate him just enough to get off
But I understand him
Maybe I'm just crazy enough
To love him
Why not? (Why not?)

You can't to a psycho like a normal human being
