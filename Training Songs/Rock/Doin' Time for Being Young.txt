Well, I'm here 'cause I drive too fast
And I'm too young to have a criminal past
Some good behavior would be all right
But I don't seem to qualify

I'm just out for a little fun
But I'm guilty till I'm twenty-one
I guess I'm doin' time for being young

So cut these shackles off of me
This kind of suit don't set me free
Well, I can't live if I can't ride
I want my baby by my side

I'm just out for a little fun
But I'm guilty till I'm twenty-one
I guess I'm doin' time for being young

Now, I can't let the right thing stand in my way
Someday baby, I'll know better
But right now I'm making my pay

No, I don't want to be in this zoo
I want to be outside lovin' you
It's heartbreaking to be this age
I was locked in prison of teenage rage

Well, I was out for a little fun
But I'm guilty till I'm twenty-one
I guess, I'm doin' time for being young

What do I do, who do I thank
To get me out of this stinkin' tank?
It's heartbreaking to be this age
Well, I was locked in prison of teenage rage

I was out for a little fun
And I'm guilty till I'm twenty-one
I guess, I'm doin' time for being young

I was out for a little fun
And I'm guilty till I'm twenty-one
I guess, I'm doin' time for being young

I must be doin' time for bein' young
I don't wanna be doin' time for being young
