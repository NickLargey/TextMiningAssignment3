Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
You're flying, you fall
You're trying, you fail
But still you keep going

You're crashing, you stall
You sink 'til you sail
'Cause you never know when
The tide's gonna turn
The wind's gonna change
We're gonna make it
The world's gonna learn and remember our name
It's been not breakin'

Through blood and tears we rise
Tonight we come alive

We are the sons of the promised dream
Daughters of hope we will not give up
They say we're broken
They say we're weak
But we've shown the heart of the champion

We're gonna stand
When we've been knocked down
We crawl, we walk, until we run
We're gonna fight
Gonna hold our ground
'Cause we've got the heart of the champion

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
'Cause we've got the heart of the champion

We are the soul
We are the proud
We are the dreamers
Not letting go and not backing down
Not gonna leave here
And seeing the prize, we'll keep reaching out
Until we hold it
This is our time
This is our house
This is our moment

We are the sons of the promised dream
Daughters of hope we will not give up
They say we're broken
They say we're weak
But We've shown the heart of the champion

We're gonna stand
When we've been knocked down
We crawl, we walk, until we run
We're gonna fight
Gonna hold our ground
'Cause we've got the heart of the champion

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
'Cause we've got the heart of the champion

Through blood and tears, we rise
With a fire in our eyes
'Cause tonight we come alive

We are the sons of the promised dream
Daughters of hope we will not give up
They say we're broken
They say we're weak
But We've shown the heart of the champion

We're gonna stand
When we've been knocked down
We crawl, we walk, until we run
We're gonna fight
Gonna hold our ground
'Cause we've got the heart of the champion

Oh oh, oh oh ,oh oh
We've got the heart of the champion
Oh oh
'Cause we've got the heart of the champion
Oh oh,oh oh, oh oh
Yes, we've got the heart of the champion
'Cause we've got the heart of the champion
