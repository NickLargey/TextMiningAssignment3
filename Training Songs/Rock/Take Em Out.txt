Knuckles to the ground hear that sound it's your ending
Silver bullet shells give 'em hell it's a war bringing

Spitting blood in the cold out here
I'm ready to blow
Will probably down to the bone

Take 'em out
Hit the floor you're ready
Take 'em out
Gonna break every levy
Take 'em out
Here it comes are you ready?
Take 'em out

Silence in the night it's a hide of the moon
Breaking calm before the storm it's a call of the undertaking

Spitting blood in the cold out here
I'm ready to blow
Will probably down to the bone

Take 'em out
Hit the floor you're ready
Take 'em out
Gonna break every levy
Take 'em out
Here it comes are you ready?
Take 'em out

You better brace yourself
No one can save you now
You better brace yourself
Right now, right now
You better brace yourself
The walls are coming down
You better brace yourself
Right now, right now

Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now

Take 'em out
Hit the floor you're ready
Take 'em out
Gonna break every levy
Take 'em out
Here it comes are you ready?
Take 'em out
