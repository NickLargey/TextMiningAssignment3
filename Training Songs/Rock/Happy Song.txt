Well it's all in the shoes
And the jeans
It's all in the walk and the thoughts
That move to your mouth from your dreams
N' it's all in the breeze
That cools your lungs
N' helps you to see
Just how crazy 
This whole world is
N' how important it all really is
Sing me a happy song
Yeah sing me a happy song
'Cause I am sick and tired 
Of being sick and tired
Sing me a happy song
So when time moves fast 
You've got to give up a lot To make it last
And when time moves slow
You've got a grab your head
Remember all you know
'Cause it's all in the desire
Desires designed like drip castles
N' always, always eat red red apples
N' remember where you've been...
Sing me a happy song
Yeah sing me a happy song
'Cause I am sick and tired
Of being sick and tired
Sing me a happy song
Sing me a happy song
Yeah sing me a happy song
'Cause I am sick and tired
Of being sick and tired
Sing me a happy song
