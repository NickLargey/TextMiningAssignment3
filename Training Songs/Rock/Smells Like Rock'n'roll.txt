Oh she was satan in high heels
She came over straight outta hell
The 666 mark on her wrist
It smelled like sex it smelled like Rock'n Roll
It smells like Rock'n Roll baby shake your ass for me
Yeah baby shake your ass for me
You're like sex you're Rock'n Roll
Like a fast car she drove me far
A million miles I rode this burnin' machine
The highway seemed not to end
It smelled like sex like Rock'n roll
Yeah it smells like rock'n roll â?¦â?¦.
Now come on
Shake shake yeah shake your little ass for me now
Shake shake yeah shake your candyass for me now
Shake shake yeah shake your butt for me
Shaaaakkkeee shake your ass for
Meee...
