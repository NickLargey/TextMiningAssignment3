Is it her way
Is it the way she looks at you
Seeing her face
As you walk through the crowded avenue
That sets you afire
Remembering all you left behind
Don't fall back in line
Better you let her memory die

Draw strength
Walk on into the night
Better you try to pass her by
Walk on into the night

Is it too late
Or are you forever in this state of crippling shyness
Whenever you see her walking by
