Pass me that lovely little gun
My dear, my darling one
The cleaners are coming, one by one
You don't even want to let them start

They're knocking now upon your door
They measure the room, they know the score
They're mopping up the butcher's floor
Of your broken little hearts

Ooh children
Forgive us now for what we've done
It started out as a bit of fun
Here, take these before we run away
The keys to the gulag

Oh children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice, come on, come on, come on, come on

Here comes Frank and poor old Jim
They're gathering round with all my friends
We're older now, the light is dim
And you are only just beginning

Ooh children
We have the answer to all your fears
It's short, it's simple, it's crystal clear
It's round about, it's somewhere here
Lost amongst our winnings

Oh children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice

The cleaners have done their job on you
They're hip to it, man, they're in the groove
They've hosed you down, you're good as new
And they're lining up to inspect you

Ooh children
Poor old Jim's white as a ghost
He's found the answer that was lost
We're all weeping now, weeping because
There ain't nothing we can do to protect you

Oh children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice

Hey little train, we're jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train, it ain't even left the station

Hey, little train, wait for me
I once was blind but now I see
Have you left a seat for me?
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?

Hey, little train, wait for me
I was held in chains but now I'm free
I'm hanging in there, don't you see
In this process of elimination

Hey little train, we're jumping on 
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
It's beyond my wildest expectation (children)

Hey little train, we're jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train ain't even left the station
