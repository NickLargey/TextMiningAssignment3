Window light shines through the leaves of my plant
And a jasmine hoop swings on the highest branch
We took cheap shots at each other on the phone
But it was my last chance before you were gone

You stand there ignoring all my friends
'Cause you said I'm all you can stand

I'm going to tell you half the story so you'll come back
I'm going to tell you half the answers so if you get one
You won't expect it 
Don't expect it dear
I'm nobody's fool
I'm nobody's fool
I'm nobody's fool

You stand there ignoring all my friends
'Cause you said I'm all you can stand

I'm going to tell you half the story so you'll come back
I'm going to tell you half the answers so if you get one
You won't expect it 
Don't expect it dear
'Cause you said I'm all you can stand
