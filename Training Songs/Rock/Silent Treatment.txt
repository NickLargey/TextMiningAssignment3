I’ll take the silent treatment
Off your hands uneven
I’ll take the easy cynicism
Less talking more reason

I, over you
I, over you
I, that’s all you left for me

I’ll wait up watching time
You tumble home
Safe inside
Twisted now, but at the time
No fears, a treasured prize

I, over you
I, over you
I, that’s all you left for me

I’ll take the silent treatment off your hands unbeaten
I’ll take the easy sequence
Less people, more freedom

The blood cheat
Don’t give myself away
Don’t give myself away
The dull seed
Don’t give myself away
And long for the rest of this curse

I, over you
I, over you
I, that’s all you left for me

I’ll take a quiet leave it
But I’m hot-wired, quick-feelinged
So I’ll take the silent treatment
I’ll take the silent treatment
