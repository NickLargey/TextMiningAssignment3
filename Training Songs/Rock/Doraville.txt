Doraville
Touch of country in the city
Doraville
It ain't much, but it's home

Friends of mine
Say I oughta move to New York
New York's fine
But it ain't Doraville

Every night
I make a living making music
That's all right to the folks in Doraville
Yeah, hey hey

Ooh, hot time in Dixie, hey
It's funky but it's pretty
Sweet Georgia

Yeah, hey hey
Ooh, hot time in Dixie, hey
Come on down, visit, you'll dig it

Red clay hills
Rednecks drinking wine on Sunday
Behind their field
Getting down in Doraville

Doraville
Touch of country in the city
Doraville
It ain't much, but it's home

It's all right
It's all right
It's all right

Doraville
Doraville, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
Doraville
