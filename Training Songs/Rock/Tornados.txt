I'm feeling tornados
Blood drips off the town now
Blood drips off the town now

I'm watching the wind change
Blood drips off the town now
Blood drips off the town now

My mouth is dry
I've had better luck
My eyes are blind
But soon I'll straighten up
Soon I'll straighten up

I left for a while
Blood drips on the floor now
Blood drips on the floor now

I'm looking for ghosts here
Blood drips on the floor now
Blood drips on the floor now

My mouth is dry
My joints are stuck
My eyes are blind
But soon I'll straighten up
Soon I'll straighten up
But soon I'll straighten up

My mouth is dry
I've had better luck
My eyes are blind
But soon I'll straighten up
Soon I'll straighten up

And I feel it ending
Blood drains from my face now
Blood drains from my face now
And you keep my heart pure
You keep my heart pure
You keep my heart pure
