Though the pin hole, see the night go
You're terrified of the light show
One more pill and you won't feel a thing

'Cause you push me off in pieces
So you never feel the blame
Of a broken heart and all that it contains

And you don't know who you are
But you don't know who you are

You try to, but you can't move
As the windows crash around you
No one there to carry you away

And the photographs are falling
And they're shaking to the core
YOu never did tread lightly
You want more

And you don't know who you are
But you don't know who you are

Come outside, take my hand
All the things you'll understand
And you will know
When you let go

I adore you
