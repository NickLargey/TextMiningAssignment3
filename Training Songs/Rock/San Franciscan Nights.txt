This following program is dedicated to the city 
And people of San Francisco
Who may not know it but they are beautiful 
And so is their city 
This is a very personal song
So if the viewer cannot understand it 
Particularly those of you who are European residents 
Save up all your brand 
And fly trans love airways to San Francisco U.S.A.
Then maybe you'll understand the song
It will be worth it
If not for the sake of this song 
But for the sake of your own peace of mind

Strobe lights beam create dreams
Walls move minds do too
On a warm San Franciscan night
Old child, young child feel alright
On a warm San Franciscan night
Angels sing leather wings
Jeans of blue Harley Davidsons too
On a warm San Franciscan night
Old angels, young angels feel alright
On a warm San Franciscan night

I wasn't born there 
Perhaps I'll die there
There's no place left to go
San Francisco

Cop's face is filled with hate
Heavens above he's on a street called love
When will they even learn
Old cop, young cop feel alright
On a warm San Franciscan night

The children are cool
They don't raise fools
It's an American dream includes indians too
