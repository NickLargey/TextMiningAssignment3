I'm on a one way destination
Feel the road rush under my wheels
I've been searching through this revelation
For something that was never here

Always been looking for a way to go
I've never seen the fun under the road
I should have known it so long ago
Sister tell the boys I'm coming home
To Riot Avenue
Try to walk them high and low
But that's the only road I know
I'm back, on riot avenue
I'm heading home
I tried my way with girls and money
But that don't ever seem to give me the thrills
There ain't no land of milk and honey
Because dance, kill or be killed
Always been looking for a different road
But I feared I was running the load
I should have known it so long ago
Hit the gas I'm coming home
To Riot Avenue
Try to walk them high and low
But that's the only road I know
I'm back, on riot avenue
I'm heading home
[Solo]
I should have known it so long ago
Sister tell the boys I'm coming home
To Riot Avenue
Try to walk them high and low
But that's the only road I know
I'm back, on riot avenue
I'm heading home
Oh I'm coming home yeah
Coming home
