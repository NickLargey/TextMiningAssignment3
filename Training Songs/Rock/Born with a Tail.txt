I'd rather choose my soul to lose
Than leave around just one confused
And lose desire
Don't know if I'll ever learn
Can't wait â€˜til I get my turn
To burn in the infernal hell fire

I'm waiting for my last drive
While the bugle of my backside
Blows a losing beat
Hope I don't run out of gas
Bet my sacrilegious ass
Ain't nothing down there that scares me
 
Oh yeah!
And you know!
I'm in league with Satan
And you know
There can't be no debatin'
My hell-bound trail
I was born with a tail!

I'm evil!
Yeah, and I run free
There's molten lead in me
So let's get the hell
Got the goods
Brother bring it on 
My mother done brought me up wrong
And you can use my dick 
As a walkin' stick as well

Oh yeah!
And you know!
I'm in league with Satan
And you know
There can't be no debatin'
My hell-bound trail
I was born with a tail!

It's time to fly the finger
Yeah, that middle digit brings your point 
And it drives it home
On my head there's no crown of thorns
This evil scalp has earned its horns
I'm on a highflying time with your mom before I go

Oh yeah!
And you know!
I'm in league with Satan
And you know
There can't be no debatin'
My hell-bound trail
I was born with a tail!
