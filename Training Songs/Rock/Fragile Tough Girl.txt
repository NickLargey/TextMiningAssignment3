When times are the worst you 
See who you've got 
You know what is real and you
Find out what is not 

I thought I had something
But now I hurt so bad 
You think you have friends that you 
Don't really have, oh 

[Chorus:]
I'm a fragile tough girl 
Break me if you can but 
I'm a fragile tough girl 
I'm a fragile tough girl 
Steady as a tree 
I'm a fragile tough girl 
And life is, messy 

Everyone has a ladder 
But at the top it's just another one 
None of it will matter in the end 
If you don't love someone 

The wounds that hurt the most 
Are the wounds you cannot see 
I thought for sure when I needed you 
You'd be here for me 

[Chorus]

Well you thought you were so wise to tell me 
I'd grow from all the pain
And yet you were never here for me 
Even when I called your name 
I can take a slap like the best of them 
But when it hurts too much to feel 
I just dress my heart up in these bandages of steel 

Oh I'm a fragile tough girl 
Break me if you can but 
I'm a fragile tough girl

I'm a fragile tough girl
Steady as a tree 
I'm a fragile tough girl 
So don't mess with me 
Don't mess with me 

'Cause I'm a fragile tough girl, oh
I'm a fragile tough girl 
Steady as a tree
I'm a fragile tough girl
And life is messy.
