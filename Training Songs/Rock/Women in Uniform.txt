Hello there sailor
Hi there Lili Marlene
Good morning school girls
Welcome to the team

Beehive hairdo forty-five on the hip
Patrolwoman Saunders don't you give her no lip
Took me to the station for a breath test
Then back to her bedroom for some house arrest

Women in uniform sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform but oooh they feel so warm

Flying to my hometown on a 747
Stewardess made me feel like I'm in heaven
Looking up the aisle trying to see what I could see
She leaned over and said coffee tea or me
White apron and brown leather shoes
The nurse at the clinic left my heart all bruised
Broke my left leg and sprained my right
Now she takes my temperature every night

Women in uniform sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform but ooh they feel so warm
Women in uniform Women in uniform
Women in uniform Women in uniform

Commando raid on the Lebanese border
Sergeant Anita she gives the order
Khaki jacket and a sten gun
Baby I surrender let's have some fun

Khaki navy blue and brass buttons bring me to my knees
A peaked cap and a badge or two oooh they're such a tease
So girls if the man you need just won't come across
Put on a uniform show him who's the boss

Women in uniform sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform but ooh they feel so warm
Women in uniform khaki white and blue
Women in uniform coming after you
