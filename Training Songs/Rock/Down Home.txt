The driver says it's gettin' late 
But I know that he's lyin' 
I got me no important dates 
My, how time is flyin' 

[Chorus] 
Well I keep on, keep on fallin' 
I keep on, keep on fallin' 
I keep on, keep on fallin' 
Fallin' down home 

Oh, la, la, la, la, Oh, la, la, la, la 
A pretty lady smiled at me 
Love that fancy dancin' 
Get back home where we can see 
Do up some romancin' 

[Chorus]

You know I'm just hangin' around 
Got to be there, Got to be there 
When it all comes down, 
Comes down down 
Comes down home 

Well now someone put firewater in my drink 
Liked to make me drop it 
Well now I know that this ain't no time to think 
But you can't hardly stop it 

[Chorus]

Here I go, Here I go 
Oh la, la, la, la, la, la, la...
