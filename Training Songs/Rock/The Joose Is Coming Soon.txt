If your days last forever, and gloom describes the weather
Strange sounds are too familiar, no chorus seems to thrill you
Switch onto sadless FM, where storm clouds scatter

If smiles are hard to muster, but not as rare as laughter
Your mellon collie makeup, could use a Rootjoose wakeup
Come down to hopeful hotel, it's a good prescription, yeah

You know you want to stay and watch the world
We think you ought to join our silly smiles

Chorus

If you like us want something new to hear
If you dislike the sounds that greet your ear
Just stick around a while, but never fear
'Cause the Joose is coming soon (x3)

Repeat chorus (last line x2)

We might take time to reach you, and we may never meet you
Just think of us as your friends, and help this slow game to end
Life seems to hold the best cards, but we'll keep fighting, yeah

Chances are fair, we've travelled for miles
But we'll meet you there, wearing silly smiles

Repeat chorus (last line x4)
