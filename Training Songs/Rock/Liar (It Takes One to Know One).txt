All our secrets, they are daily trouble
Drip loose knot around your hips
Your spotless instincts are valid
We coexist
Got twenty six days to work with (got twenty,six days)
We got twenty six days to work with (it moves, it moves, it moves)
We'll see what all gets done

I'm an addict for dramatics
I confuse the two for love
You can tell me that you don't bend

Liar (liar)
If we're keeping score
We're all choir boys at best
(Intrusive and arrogant)
Liar (liar)
If we're keeping score
We're all choir boys at best
(Interesting and arrogant)

Got twenty,six days to work with (got twenty six days)
Then back on that island
That you swear by
You barely can't afford
It's still a question of
How long will this hold?
Well, is it any different
Now that we are home?
Don't you know they're not here, not now?
(It moves, it moves, it moves)
Not here, not now

I'm an addict for dramatics
I confuse the two for love
You can tell me don't bend

Liar (liar)
If we're keeping score
We're all choir boys at best
