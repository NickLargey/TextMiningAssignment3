Slowly let me tell you a story of a tree 
An apple tree
 
Once in a summertime garden lived a little apple tree 
And the man who owned it wanted it to be picked 
And so he sent forth to hire me 
 
Well, I've traveled the mountains, and I've traveled the sea 
But never in my traveling days have I ever seen a little apple smile at me
 
So laugh, laugh oh little apple 
Autumn is waitin', you'd better be careful
And it will bring you down 
If it ever sees you wearing a frown 
So laugh, laugh oh little apple

Well all the apples were hidin' 
Frightened that they might be plucked 
And everytime that somebody passed 
All except that one little apple ducked 
 
Well, I've traveled the mountains, and I've traveled the sea 
But never in my traveling days have I ever seen a little apple smile at me
 
Laugh, laugh oh little apple 
Autumn is waitin', you'd better be careful
And it will bring you down
If it ever sees you wearing a frown 
So laugh, laugh oh little apple

Laugh, laugh oh little apple 
Autumn is waitin', you'd better be careful
And it will bring you down
If it ever sees you wearing a frown 
So laugh, laugh oh little apple
