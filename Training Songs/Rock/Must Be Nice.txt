One step, two step, electric slide
Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind
Engine, engine, number nine
Mama gonna let you set the moon on fire

Jack be nimble, jack be quick
Jack wound up with a broken neck
Humpty Dumpty, do your thing
Daddy gonna buy you a diamond ring

Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've ever failed
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale

Suzie steamboat, you're so fine
Grant the wish I wish tonight
Tinker tailor, whatcha' got?
Wheels on the bus are falling off

Pretty maids all in a row
Yes, sir, yes, sir three bags full
Silver spoon at supper time
Four and twenty blackbirds, oh, so high

Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've ever failed
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale

One step, two step, electric slide
Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind
Engine, engine, number nine
Stick your diamond ring where the sun don't shine

Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've ever failed
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale

Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've ever failed
Your life's a fucking fairy tale
