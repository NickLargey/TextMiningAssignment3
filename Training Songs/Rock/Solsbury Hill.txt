Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing, stretching every nerve
I had to listen had no choice
I did not believe the information
I just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom, boom, boom
Son, he said, grab your things I've come to take you home

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a slut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
Till I thought of what I'd say
And which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom, boom, boom
Hey, he said, grab your things I've come to take you home 

Take back home, grab your things
When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette?
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart was going boom, boom, boom
Hey, I said, keep my things I've come to take me home
Hey, I said, keep my things I've come to take you home
I've come to take you home
Hey, I said, I've come to take you home
Come to take you home
My heart was going boom, boom, boom
My heart was going boom, boom, boom
Hey, I said, you can keep my things and come to take me home
They've come to take me home
My heart is going boom, boom, boom
