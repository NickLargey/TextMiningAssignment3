I had a dream and you were in it
We got naked and
Can't remember what happened next
It was weird
I had my fortune told
You said that I would meet somebody with green eyes
Yours are blue!

[Chorus]
If you seek it, you won't find
The lovers' eyes so blinded by love
Blinded by love, blinded by love

In your heart lies long term loneliness
It's like an unexploded hand grenade
Time ticks away
Over the hills there is a valley
In the valley there's a little tiny house unoccupied

[Chorus]

If you seek it, you won't find
The lovers' eyes so blinded by love
Blinded by love, blinded by love

If you see your heart's design lay there
On a vandalized ... oh I sit with you anywhere
I had a dream and you were in it
We got naked, can't remember what happened next
It was weird
I've got a secret,
I want you to know if you could reach it
If you promise to close your eyes
It's all inside

[Chorus]
