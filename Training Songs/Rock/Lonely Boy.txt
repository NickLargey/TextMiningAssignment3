I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue
I'm all alone, with nothing to do
I've got everything you could think of
But all I want is someone to love
Someone, oh, someone to love, someone to kiss
Someone to hold at a moment like this
I'd like to hear somebody say
I'll give you my love each night and day 

I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue 
I'm all alone with nothing to do
I've got everything you think of
But all I want is someone to love
Somebody, somebody, somebody please send her to me
I'll make her happy, just wait and see
I've prayed so hard to the heavens above
That I might find someone to love

I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue, yes I am
I'm all alone with nothing to do, oh
I've got everything you could think of
But all I want is someone to love

I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue, yeah
I'm all alone with nothing to do
I've got everything you could think of
But all I want is someone to love
