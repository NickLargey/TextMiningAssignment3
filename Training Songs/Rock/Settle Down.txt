If I seem a little crazy, well, it's just because I am,
but that aint no call to talk behind my back.
Sometimes I go de-railin' when it's chaos in my mind,
but all in all my wheels are mainly on the track...

(So woncha) settle down, settle down,
Baby love, my baby love,
Don't quit your faith in me.

Well, I hear you when you whisper an' I've seen your nervous eyes,
I've known your fear and held your doubtful hand.
You're judging way too soon, you're 
underestimating me,
Sometimes I rock a bit but I can stand...

So woncha settle down, settle down,
Baby love, my baby love,
Don't quit your faith in me

Out on the highway, out on the cold road,
some lonesome losin' rounder wears a frown.
An' I could be there, without a notion,
if not for all the love you've brought around...

If I'm caught up in a whirlwind, babe, I know
I'll make it through, 
I've seen that spinning power rise an' fall.
I can ride it sailin' higher. I can ride it comin' down.
It's a natchral kind of cycle, babe, that's all... 

(So woncha) settle down, settle down, 
Baby love, my baby love, 
Don't quit your faith in me.
