Crash here we go you can face it or erase it
I do believe we can take it
And make it a wonderful love
You can taste it embrace it lovely
So sweet to see look after me social with company
Just you and me fall to the ground
You should wake up and turn up your favorite song
Let it move you
Just walk through breakfast and grace
I should unwind its bed time lovely so sweet
To see look after me social with company
Just you and me leaves on the ground
Then a snow storm my back yard is covered in white
Can i hold out its cold out
Lost in the shade
you've been waiting for sunshine lovely so sweet
To see look after me social with company just you and me
