Break down, break down
'Cause you care
Same old story, different time, a fairy tale

Stay down, stay down
Don't you dare
I will speak my mind today and I'm not scared

So if you're sin free
Throw the first rock against me
But I will stand for the braves
Whatever it cost me

Rise again, get up now
Together we stand, divided we fall

Break no, break no
Before you bent
When is said and done we'll rise our fist again

Cry no, cry no
Not these days
'Cause my eyes are dry for all the pain and hate

Now we're back down on the road
And all the damage is done
Just because you're winning
Don't mean you're the lucky one

Rise again, get up now
Together we stand, divided we fall
