I hate to see that evening sun go down I hate to see that evening sun go down
Because my little loved baby he done left this town
If I feel tomorrow like I feel today if I feel tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my bag and make my get away

Oh the St Louis woman with those diamond rings
She pulls her man around by the apron strings
If it wasn't for powder or that store-brought hair

That man of mine he wouldn't go nowhere nowhere
I got the St Louis Blues just as bluest I can be
I got a man with a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Oh St Louis baby look what you're doin' to me

If it wasn't for powder
I'm going back back to St Louis going back back to St Louis
Going back back to St Louis going back back to St Louis
