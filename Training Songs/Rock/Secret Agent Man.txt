There's somebody here with nothing to fear
Were they looking over you
Well it's the way it's supposed to be
From now on I'll be watching 
As your friends will take the liberties in you 
I'll be watching as you lay awake thinking it over

And now you're alone. There's nobody home
Is it the way you like it
And how was I supposed to know
And know you'll stop believing as you separate
Stop believing as you lay awake thinking it over

And everything will start again tomorrow, beauty in the sun
It's a way to come together, you can leave it when you're done
And I'm never gonna be the instigator, taking on your plan
I could leave it for the morning
I could leave it for the secret agent man

I told you before so tell me again
And its worthy of defence
But I know it anyway
From now on I'll be watching as your friends will take
The liberties in you 
I'll be watching as you lay awake thinking it over

And everything will start again tomorrow, beauty in the sun
It's a way to come together, you can leave it when you're done
And I'm never gonna be the instigator, taking on your plan
I could leave it for the morning
I could leave it as it stands

And it's something in the way the changes haunt you, I was not alone
You could stay this way forever
You could say you've just begun
Now I'm never gonna be the instigator, taking on your plan
I could leave it for the morning
I could leave it for the secret agent man
