No more promises.
I have made them before and broken them.
Give me the ‘go ahead' and I'll undress myself for you,
If you're at all interested now 
I'm growing legs
I'm the spider
I'm the spider
I crawl inside her
I'm the…hey
Oh I know your pain.
You, like I, plagued by the flies inside your brain.
Oh I'm creeping up your veins.
Are you smart enough and small enough to play this game?
I'm growing legs

I'm the spider
I'm the spider
I crawl inside her
I'm the whoa

I better watch my back around you.
You've got the movies, the shoes, the do 
You've got me oh no, no, no
And I want you to know I want to.

You've got those tired eyes all the time.
Yeah, you need someone to bring you to bed.
I'm growing legs
I'm the spider

I am cold,
Too cool to call you,
Far too stoned to leave my bed.
I'll write this song to win your kiss

But stay asleep instead.
