I know that I should think about giving 
and think about 
helping out 
and think about 
think about living 
but I can't seem to rescue myself 
what about my bank account 
and my holy desert shield 
that keep me dry under that arms? 
flags and mental jewelry's all I know 
and they keep me happy and warm inside 
so I said unto this man 
"who are you and where do you come from?" 
and he proceeded to tell me many things 
but I said nothing at all 
for the flower in the corner, by the room, 
in the window, and the sun 
said it all 
at least they said they would 
said they could 
mama said they would 
do me good
