You didn't have to be so nice
I would have liked you anyway
If you had just looked once or twice
And gone upon your quiet way

Today I said the time was right for me to follow you
I knew I'd find you in a day or two
And it's true

You came upon a quiet day (ooh)
You simply seemed to take your place (ooh)
I knew that it would be that way (ooh)
The minute that I saw your face (ooh)

And when we've had a few more days (when we've had a few more days)
I wonder if I'll get to say (wonder if I'll get to say)
You didn't have to be so nice (be so nice)
I would have liked you anyway (would have liked)
