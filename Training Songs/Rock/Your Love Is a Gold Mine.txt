She got rubies on her pillow
She got sapphires on the head of her bed
She got emeralds on her finger tips
She got diamonds in her hairs
She got jasper on her curtains
She got chrysolite on her ceiling
She got topaz on the soles of her shoes
And it sparkles as she's leaving

I see her standing in the candlelight come a come a to me tonight
Your love is the sweetest thing your love makes me feel so fine
Your love is a shimmering light your love is a gold mine

She got amethyst in her earings
She got platinum on the tip of her toes
She got sterling in her dresser drawers
She got yellow gold on the helms of her clothes

I see her standing in the candlelight come a come a to me tonight
Your love is the sweetest thing your love makes me feel so fine
Your love is a shimmering light your love is a gold mine
So many facets of your love it's so refined
Take me forever to mine it out  but I don't mind
I think about her and I call her name
Her eyes reflecting in the window pane

I see her standing in the candlelight come a come a to me tonight
Your love is the sweetest thing your love makes me feel so fine
Your love is a shimmering light your love is a gold mine
Your love is the sweetest thing your love makes me feel so fine
Your love is a shimmering light your love is a gold mine
Your love is the sweetest thing your love makes me feel so fine
Your love is a shimmering light your love is a gold mine
