Little woman got that look in her eyes 
Want to cut me down to size 
Show me watcha gonna do it's true 
Who's that gorilla standin' by your side 
Oh no that must be your ride 
You wouldn't be with such a fool 
Or your mama too 

There's something over here I want you to see 
There's a party but it isn't for three 
Get something straight between you and me...because 

[Chorus]
Oh no you're invited but your friend can't come 
Oh, no come on baby we're gonna have some fun 

Wow 

Heartbreaker yeah you came for the show 
But little did you know you'd end up in the spotlight 
Well all right 
Come on baby won't you show me what you've got 
Ready or not one, two, here we go 
Oh no 

Nobody's watchin' it's time to decide 
Shake the monkey, mama don't be shy 
Come on honey time to take a little ride because 

[Chorus)]

Oh, no you're invited but your friend can't come 
Oh, no you're invited but your friend can't come 

Rock the night like a hurricane 
Make me sweat like the drivin' rain 
Pour it on till I can't get no reaction 
It's gonna be your night tonight 
I'm gonna make you feel all right 
Scream and shout, I need it now! 
Now! Now! Now! Now!

I'm making plans for the rest of the night 
So tell your guard dog he better not bite 
My dogs are bigger and they're ready to fight 

Come on come on come on give it up tonight! 

[Chorus]

Oh, no you're invited but your friend can't come 

Oh, no come on baby we're gonna have some fun 

We're gonna have some fun, we're gonna have some fun 
Have some fun, baby oh she can't come 

Lick it
