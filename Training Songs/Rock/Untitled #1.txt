Do you dare take a breath
Do you dream of a tragic death, I know you do
Do you wail, do you weep
You sing yourself to sleep, you delicate flower

And so what is love? And who am I
To dare to pull the stars from your favorite sky

You were born forth from joy, you're every girl and boy
You know you are, you know you are
And you dress like a dame and you burn on a catholic flame
By the hours, by the hours

And so what is love? And who am I?
To dare to pull the stars from your favorite sky

You possess, s'avoir faire, put cheap bleach on your hair
You know you do, you know you do
Do you dare take a breath
You dream of a tragic death, you delicate flower

And so what is love? And who am I?
To dare to pull the stars from your favorite sky

And so what is love? And who am I?
To dare to pull the stars from your favorite sky
From your favorite sky
