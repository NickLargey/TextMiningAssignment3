Let's get together again
All you need is here to stay
Let's get together again
Forget about your yesterdays
Let's get together again
All you need is here to stay
Let's get together again
Forget about your yesterdays
It's been a very long, long, time since I last remember seeing you
I hope you'll write and say you're fine; did you ever sit and dream
Of a time when we could meet again?
It's very hard now you're not mine
The phone's right next to you, and you know just what to do
Just pick it up and call my name
Let's get together again
All you need is here to stay

Tomorrow's just a step away till I come running back to you
I hope you'll stay here by my side; I thought I'd never see
My angel back here next to me.  Promise me that you won't hide
The phone's right next to you, and you know just what to do

Let's get together again
All you need is here to stay

And you know there ain't much time; I'm so alone, please come home
I'm on my own; let's get together again
All you need is here to stay
