Days 'n nights n' nights n' days, 
In silent shades of lazy grays 
I call your name, It's all the same 
Sitting staring at the ceiling, 
Dripping painted pictures peeling 
From my walls, The time just crawls 

Was it yesterday? I don't know 
Was I dreaming? Or did I lose everything I believed in? 
If you could only see what I see 
Every time you leave 

Imagine a world with no sky 
Imagine the ocean run dry 
Imagine and you'll see the view 
Of my world without you 
Imagine no sun and no rain 
Imagine that each day's the same 
It doesn't matter what I do 
In a world without you 

Doers doing, Thinkers thinking, 
Lonely lover's lips are sinking 
In my tea, They're burning me 
Wasted weeping, Someone speaking 
In my head the bed is leaking tears again 
And there's no end 

Was it yesterday? I don't know 
Was I dreaming? Or did I lose everything I believed in? 
If you could only see what I see 
Imagine a world with no sky, 
Imagine the ocean run dry
