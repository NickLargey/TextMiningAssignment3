You thought I was sound asleep
But worries kept me wide awake
And thinking of a promise that I knew you would break

Leaving me lonely
What can I do
Knowing it's all because freedom calls
And makes you dream of something new

I watched you getting dressed
And wondering where you left your coat
I saw you sneaking around the room and writing that
Note

Telling me something
I should have known
Cause of this feeling I've had
The last few weeks whenever you were near
Your heart wasn't here

One way or another
You'll be back before long
Though you think you will not
Someday you'll discover
Life is not what you once
Might have thought it would be

And then in case you need a friend around
You know the place where I can be found

So like a bird uncaged
You only answered nature's call
But sooner or later freedom will be taking its toll

Leaving you lonely
What can you do
Other than turning around
I just can't wait to hear your knock on my door
Living alone is a bore
