I met you early in the night
You had nothing much to hide
Your eyes where burning in to me
Oh yes I'm nervous don't you know
Girl you make me loose control
My heart is pounding, missing beats
I can't move, with you right beside me
I'm going all the way
You hold the answer in your hand
The ice is melting where I stand
The lights go down on me
More and more I feel the heat
Girl you knock me off my feet
My head is spinning round and round
Just let go, forget the world around us
Hold me through the night

[Chorus]
Ready for the action
Oh yes I'm ready for the flight
Ready for reaction
Because I'm running wild tonight

I'm so caught up in desire
Got no way to cool the fire
The blood is boiling in my veins
All the secrets that you hide
I'll discover on the ride
I'm getting lost within a dream
One more time, we can feel the fire
Burning deep inside

[Chorus]
