Same old boring Sunday morning,old men out washing their cars
Mum''s in the kitchen cooking sunday dinner,Herberts still moaning for
food

And Johnnys upstairs in his bedroom sitting in the dark
Annoying the neighbours with his punk rock electric guitar
This is the sound,This is the sound of the suburbs
This is the sound of the suburbs

Rock groups just wanna be free,yeah they want ANARCHY!
The drums are quite good,the bass is too loud and I can''t hear the 
words
This is the sound of the suburbs- until the end where it goes
