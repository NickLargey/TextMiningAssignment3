Some of my friends sell drugs

Some of my friends sell records, 
Some of my friends sell 
Drugs 

You stand by me, I stand by you 
If there is a fight I'm the one to come to 
Good and bad, times we've been through 
You got my back and I got yours too 
All of my life you are in my crew 
I'd do anything for you 
Beat someone black and blue 
Black and blue and I'd do anything for you

Try to tell 'em leave us alone 
Still ridin' with them fellas down that unknown road 
There ain't no tellin, I told 'em before 
Wouldn't listenin' 
No more bitchin' 
Leave 'em all on the floor 
I know 
This labels money
They take 'till it hurts 
That's why I still got that nina, 
And I still got that work 
Tomorrow ain't promised 
I'll smoke it today 
The zone will run you five 
And I'll be on my way

It's official, I'm destined to fail 
I ain't tryin' to get yo case 
I ain't got no money for bail 
I'm hurt, I'm in the E.R. before New Year's Eve 
Said there's nothing we can do so we suggest that you leave 
Dirty G's joints, they don't give a damn 
That's a brake, and I'm a scale, break it down in the ground 
They said you came so close to losin' now I swear that's the truth 
Same shit, different day, man I swear what's the use 

It's a different day, with good intentions 
I got dirty with two positions 
I make a living ain't got no pension 
For transcriptions for my life on tension 
The world is mine, no limit I can do it 
Every drama in life I've been through it 
Even if I couldn't, I blew it 
Regret nothin' I move on and say f*ck you
