since the day i lost you girl
i just can't face the world
i'm kind of feeling kind of small
i let you go one day
but now i'm ashamed to say
i said oh baby i need you
i need your loving
well i need, said i need
i need you right by my side
i lost my day
i kow i must have said
a lot of things to make you cry
i made myself a lonely man
but now i have come to understand
i said oh baby i need you
i never need no one
like i need you girl
