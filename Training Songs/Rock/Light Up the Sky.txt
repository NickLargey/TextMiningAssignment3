Oh

Yea, we're all fast breakers comin' outta the gates
Takin' chances we're the crash an' burn
Yea, there is a way with beauty but you never gave a love
Cross the line where none return

Oh, I watch my television
Almost lost my mind
It said, open your eyes leave it all behind

I heard the wind a whisperin'
Strong magic comin' on
They comin' out for sure

Come see your children, yea
They're lightin' up the skies
Won't recognize them anymore

Wolves at my door, wised up quick
Turned here an' gone, from on the go
Seems the old folks who come up short
Were the pretty little kids who didn't want it, no

I had some crazy vision
One I can't deny it
It said, open your eyes leave it all behind

I heard the wind a whisperin'
Strong magic comin' on
They comin' out for sure

Come see your children, yea
They're lightin' up the skies
You won't, recognize them anymore

Oh, mama, see the firelights
Oh, we're comin' out tonight
Oh, mama, see the firelights
Oh, lightin' up the sky
Light 'em up

Lightin' up the sky
Lightin' up the sky
Lightin' up the sky
Lightin' up the sky
Light 'em up
