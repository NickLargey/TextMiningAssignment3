I prayed to the Lord to send a love
He sent me an angel from Heaven above
The stars in the skies, He placed in her eyes
She is my true love
 
The touch of her hand, captured my soul
And the kiss from her lips set my heart aglow
And I know from Heaven, From Heaven above
Came my, my true love
 
Darling, I love you, I'll always be true, my prayers
They were answered and the Lord sent me you 
With love and devotion that I never knew
Until the Lord above sent me you
And I thank the Heaven
The Heaven above
For sending my true love
My true love!
