Can you hear me?
Hope you can
Listen here closely
You'll understand

Make way for the killer race
They use the Bible
Millimeter by millimeter
Millimeter by millimeter

Six times hot as the sun
Didn't mean to hurt anyone
Didn't mean to hurt anyone
Sorry, sorry, yeah

Don't try to force them
To help them
Do what they do
What they do

So the hurting's not on you
Chasing for miles
Until you're standing before
The Human Being Lawnmower

Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
