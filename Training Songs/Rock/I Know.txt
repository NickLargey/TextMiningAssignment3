I should be getting some sleep
I try and I try but I can't keep
From picking apart everything that we said
Yeah, I shouldn't be running this maze
Trying so hard to find a way to raise up the dead

I should fix the lock, feed the cat
Take the clothes to the laundromat
Pay some bills, and get a clue
Get up, forget about you
I know, I know

I shouldn't be spinning my wheels
Just to see how bad it feels
Just to see how far I won't go
I should be breaking this chains
Not dragging them round
Just to feel the pain
Never should've taken this road

[Repeat Chorus]

Yeah, I know
But I can't let go

I should fix the lock, feed the cat
Count my blessings, all of that
Get a grip, and get a clue
Get up and forget about you
I know, I know
Yeah, I know
But, I can't let go
I can't let go
