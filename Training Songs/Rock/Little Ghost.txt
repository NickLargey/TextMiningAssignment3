Little ghost, little ghost
One IÂ´m scared of the most
Can you scare me up a little bit of love?
IÂ´m the only one that sees you,
And I canÂ´t do much to please you
And itÂ´s not yet time to meet the lord above

The first woman that I met her
I did not expect a specter
When I shook her hand I really shook a glove
She looked into me so sweetly
And we left the room discreetly
No one else could know the secret of our love

Little ghost, little ghost
One IÂ´m scared of the most
Can you scare me up a little bit of love?
IÂ´m the only one that sees you,
And I canÂ´t do much to please you
And itÂ´s not yet time to meet the lord above

Every morning I awoke
And I see my little ghost
WondÂ´rinÂ´ if itÂ´s really her thatÂ´s lying there
I lean to touch her and I whisper
But not brave enough to kiss her
When I held her I was really holding air

Little ghost, little ghost
One IÂ´m scared of the most
Can you scare me up a little bit of love?
IÂ´m the only one that sees you,
And I canÂ´t do much to please you
And itÂ´s not yet time to meet the lord above

Though I try my best to keep it
There really was no secret
Must have looked like I was dancing with the wall
No one else could see this apparition
But because of my condition
I fell in love with a little ghost and that was all

Little ghost, little ghost
One IÂ´m scared of the most
Can you scare me up a little bit of love?
IÂ´m the only one that sees you,
And I canÂ´t do much to please you
And itÂ´s not yet time to meet the lord above
No, itÂ´s not yet time to meet the lord above
