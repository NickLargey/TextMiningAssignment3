This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Without a women or a girl

You see, man made the car
To take us over the road
Man made the train 
To carry the heavy load
Man made the electrolight
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat full of water
Like Noah made the arc

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Without a women or a girl

Man thinks about little bit of baby girls and a baby boys
Man make them happy
Cos man make them toys
And after man make everything
Everything he can
You know that man makes money
To buy from other man

This is a man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Not one little thing
Without a women or a girl

He's lost in the wilderness
He's lost in bitterness
