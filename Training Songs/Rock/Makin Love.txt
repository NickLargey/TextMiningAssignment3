I just hate when the girl says wait
I really want her by my side
Don't hesitate
I really want her by my side
The whole night through
We do all the things that we want to do
Well, come on baby, don't leave me sad
Cause you're good lookin', the best I've had
Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)
Makin' love (makin' love) all night long
Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)
Makin' love (makin' love) all night long
Ow, all night long

Red light, green light, don't say "no"
I really want her, she says
"Stop, baby" go, go, go
I really want her by my side
The whole night through
We do all the things that we want to do
Well, come on baby, don't leave me sad
Cause you're good lookin, the best I've had

Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)
Makin' love (makin' love) all night long
Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)
Makin' love (makin' love) all night

Whoo
Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)
Makin' love (makin' love) all night long
Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)
Makin' love (makin' love) all night long

Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)
Makin' love (makin' love) all night long
Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)
Makin' love (makin' love) all night, oh
