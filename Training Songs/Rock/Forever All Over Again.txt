If she wanted the world to be a happier place
She'd stop at least one tear from rollin' down my face
She'd think about me, maybe pick up the phone
Say "I'm missin' you" at the sound of the tone

If she wanted the world to keep spinnin' around
She'd pick a piece of my heart up off of the ground
I'd whisper her name in the still of the night
And while I'm dreamin' of her holdin' me tight

She'd be changin' her mind, packin' her clothes
She'd buy a one-way ticket that would bring her home

And she'd come back to me
She'd be more than just a memory
She'd come back to me
And we would fall in love forever all over again

If I'd only known how I'd be breakin' inside
I would've begged her to stay, I would've swallowed my pride
An' I wouldn't be here drinkin' alone
I'd be holdin' her 'cause she wouldn't be gone

So God, if you're listenin' from somewhere out there
You know I'm down on my knees and if you'd answer one prayer

Then she'd come back to me
She'd be more than just a memory
She'd come back to me
And we would fall in love forever all over again

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

If she wanted the world to be a happier place
She'd stop at least one tear from rollin' down my face
She'd be changing her mind, packin' her clothes
She'd buy a one-way ticket that would bring her home

And she'd come back to me
She'd be more than just a memory
She'd come back to me
And we would fall in love forever all over again

Forever all over again, forever all over again
Yeah, we would fall in love forever all over again
Forever all over again
Yeah, we would fall in love forever all over again
