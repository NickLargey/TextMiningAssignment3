Ooh, it's been a long time, girl
Time has been a friend to you
Have you had it with your seesaw world
Yeah, I've had it with the same world, too.
Ain't no friend of mine.....oh, no

Here we are alone again
Down at Johnny's little seaside inn
Slammin' down a drink or two
Ooh, we were something, me and you

I know your life's been less than grand
This I can tell
And you took my heart and you took my hand
If time won't tell

Chorus:
Don't start thinking I'm alone tonight, no no
Don't start thinking I'll be coming home
To your lonely bed tonight
And don't start thinking I'm alone tonight, no no
Oh, it's over now, let the words go free
And don't start thinking 'bout you and me

You were always by my side
Yeah and love, it took its own sweet ride
Left a stranger where there was once me, oh yeah
Now we're staring at a sunset sky
Wishing time would turn its back a while
We'd be lovers like we used to be
Ooh, we were something, you and me

I know your life's been less than planned
This I can tell
And you took my heart and you took my hand
If time won't tell

(chorus)
Yeah

Bye bye baby, bye bye
In an everchanging world we live in
Will the flame carry on
Will it give us what's missin'
Bye bye baby, bye bye
Bye bye baby, bye bye
Dry your eyes
They're the same tears I cried.

(chorus x2)
