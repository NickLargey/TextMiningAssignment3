Last night, I couldn't get to sleep
Because my head's split open, it's down on the ground
Nail my thoughts into the floor
Can't hear you speak, can't hear you now
Everytime I think of you, it makes me feel so dead inside
Love you and I hate you in the same breath
Love you and I hate you in the same breath

Rewind my mind
Rewind my mind
Rewind my mind
Rewind my mind

I can't sleep yet again
There's something going on tearing into my head
I've been down this way, I've felt this way before
I can feel it twisting inside
I fight it, I hate it, I feel it, don't want it

Rewind my mind
Rewind my mind
Rewind my mind
Rewind my mind

I hate you

Rewind my mind
Rewind my mind
Rewind my mind
Rewind my mind
Rewind my mind
Rewind my mind
Rewind my mind
(Rewind my mind)
Rewind my mind
(Rewind my mind)

It was 3 o'clock in the morning, I couldn't sleep
All of the same thoughts kept racing through my mind over and over and over again
I just wanted them to stop, period
And I thought, well, if I kill myself I'll stop thinking
