Once again I just can't get it straight
Wondering if wandering is my fate
Don't lose hope in me quite yet
'Cause help must be on the way
Any day

From my head to my heart
Can't seem to find a way, they're so far apart
It's not you, it's not your fault
You've got everything I could ever want
And you've always understood my intentions are good
And we've been so close from the start
But the furthest distance I've ever known
Is from my head to my heart

I feel the distance standing here next to you
I don't want to keep you waiting, but I've been waiting too
Some day if I get there
And you still want me too
We can see it through

From my head to my heart
Can't seem to find a way, they're so far apart
It's not you, it's not your fault
You've got everything I could ever want
And you've always understood my intentions are good
And we've been so close from the start
But the furthest distance I've ever known
Is from my head to my heart

From my head to my heart
Can't seem to find a way, they're so far apart
It's not you, you've got everything I could ever want

From my head to my heart
Can't seem to find a way, they're so far apart
It's not you, it's not your fault
You've got everything I could ever want
And you've always understood my intentions are good
And we've been so close from the start
But the furthest distance I've ever known
Is from my head to my heart
