Wake up! won't you listen to me 
Wake up! won't you listen to me 
Won't you listen to me 
Wake up! won't you listen to me 
Wake up! won't you listen to me 
Won't you listen to me 

Big brother's watching, we watch him back 
We see right through his disguise 
He tries to scare us, with angry words 
But we all know that they're lies 
Whole world is waiting 
Just see the fear in their eyes 

Whole world is watching, observing every move 
Is it beginning or the end? 
Just like a chess game, but so intense 
That I just don't understand 
Anticipation 
It's much to big to pretend 

CHORUS 
(Wake up), it's 1984 
(Wake up), but we've been here before 
(Wake up), it's 1984 
(Wake up), but we've been here before, (here before) 

Big brother's screaming but we don't care 
Cause he's got nothing to say 
Think of the future, think of the prophecy 
Think of the children of today 
Big brother's marching 
So we all stand in his way 
Open your eyes, sisters and brothers 
Neatly disguised, so far away 
Open your heart, try to remember 
Two worlds apart, but so close 

(Wake up), it's 1984 
But we've been here before 
(Wake up), it's 1984 
But we've been here before 
All our lives leading up to this day, watching and waiting 

Wake up! Wake up! 
Wake up! Wake up! 

Open your eyes, sisters and brothers 
Neatly disguised, so far away 
Open your heart, try to remember 
Two worlds apart, but so close 

CHORUS 

Whole world is watching 
Anticipating 
Big brother's marching 
Is it beginning or the end? 

CHORUS
