Tonight I'll board the Delta Queen
Abound for New Orleans
And again I'll get that feeling that I'm free
Her paddle wheels will churn
And her smoke stacks they will burn
And slowly I'll be carried to the sea

'Cause I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
I make my livin' on the run
I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
Big Muddy will always be my home

I know every river ship 'cause I've taken every trip
And I know every captain by his name
In the eyes of every man, I can tell what's in his hand
I guess that I have played in every game

'Cause I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
I make my livin' on the run
I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
Big Muddy will always be my home

Tonight I'm a-sittin' here beneath a chandelier
There's a lady here to light my big cigar
And if luck will be my friend, we'll be finished up by ten
And we'll be standin' on the decks beneath the stars

'Cause I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
I make my livin' on the run
I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
Big Muddy will always be my home

'Cause I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
I make my livin' on the run
I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
Big Muddy will always be my home

'Cause I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
I make my livin' on the run
I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
Big Muddy will always be my home
