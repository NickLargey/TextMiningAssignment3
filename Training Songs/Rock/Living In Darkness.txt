Look at me now
I've got no reason to be like everybody else
So dumb, so happy
I like things that bite
Things that creep at night
Everybody's asking me what it's like down there
The concrete floor is cold
The walls are bare

I feel safest being alone
Living in darkness
Living in a world of my own

I'm so selfish, doing everything by myself
I feel so cold
I want to live to be a couple thousand years old
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I thought I knew somebody that I could trust
Now I'm not so sure

I feel safest being alone
Living in darkness
Living in a world of my own

One whole lifetime I'm never gonna last
Unless I live until dying is a thing of the past
And all these girls I know out turning boys into men
I know I am never going down again
Never again

I feel safest being alone
Living in darkness
Living in a world of my own
