Beyond ability and control, we could be weekend lovers
Steal a sentence and make a catch phrase
Parole for our revolution
Whispered all across the street about the new cool call
Or screamed at your face like a scabs payroll

Faces like angels, licking our fingertips
We don't have the patience to deal with it
With battered bodies and puckered lips
We don't have the patience to deal with it

A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in loud and fashionable ways
A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in loud and fashionable ways

Faces like angels, licking our fingertips
We don't have the patience to deal with it
With battered bodies and puckered lips
We don't have the patience to deal with it, yeah

Get down, get down, can I get a witness? Oh
This I gotta see
Bring it in! Bring it in! Bring it in!
One more time for me, yeah!

Gotta get away from this town
Bring it in! Bring it in! Bring it in!
One more time for me, go!

We don't have the patience
We don't have the patience
We don't have the patience
We don't have the patience

Yeah!
Get down
Listen to him

A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in loud and fashionable ways
A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in loud and fashionable ways

A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in loud and fashionable ways
A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in loud and fashionable ways
