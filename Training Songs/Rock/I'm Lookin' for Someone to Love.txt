Stayin' at home waitin' for you
Just won't get it 'cause you say we're through

I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here my baby I don't care
Because I'm lookin' for someone to love

Playin' the field all day long
Since I found out that I was wronged

Well I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here my baby I don't care
'Cause I'm lookin' for someone to love

Caught myself thinkin' of you
You can't love me and another one too

Well I'm lookin' for someone to love
Yeh I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here my baby I don't care
'Cause I'm lookin' for someone to love

Drunk man, street car
Foot slipped, there you are

Well I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here my baby I don't care
'Cause I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
