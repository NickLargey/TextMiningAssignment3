Oww, oww, huh, huh
Oww, oww, yeah, yeah

See her laughing, talking
She's walking to the factory
She don't look that much but I tell you
She is the ticket to the easy life for me

If she works nine to five
Sure to keep my love alive
If she works nine to five
That's okay with me

Hey yeah, I'm in love with the working girl
Hey yeah, I'm in love with the working girl

Oww, oww, huh, huh
Oww, oww, yeah, yeah

I walk up to her
Tell her how we must have made, been made for each other
And I'd take her home
Why I'd even take her round for tea with my mother?

And she could go out to work
And I'd lie around the house in the dirt
And she could go out to work
Bring her money home for me

Hey yeah, I'm in love with the working girl
Hey yeah, I'm in love with the working girl

(Working girl)
We got a love so pure
(Working girl)
She pays the rent
(Working girl)

Once in a lifetime chance in her
Must be heaven sent

Hey yeah, I'm in love with the working girl
Hey yeah, I'm in love with the working girl

Oww, oww, huh, huh
Oww, oww, yeah, yeah

I go at night, she can buy all the drinks
With the money she's earned
I dazzle her with science and grace her
With all this truth and knowledge I've learned

Then we get a cab back to her place
I put on my hate to borrow money face
We get a cab to her place
She'd do alright by me

Hey yeah, I'm in love
(I'm in love)
With the working girl
Hey yeah, I'm in love
(I'm in love)
With the working girl

Hey yeah, I'm in love
(I'm in love)
With the working girl
Hey yeah, I'm in love
(I'm in love)
With the working girl

Hey yeah, I'm in love
(I'm in love)
With the working girl
Hey yeah, I'm in love
(I'm in love)
With the working girl
