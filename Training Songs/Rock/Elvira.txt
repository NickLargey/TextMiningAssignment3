Well, tonight I'm gonna meet her
At the Hungry House Cafe
And I'm gonna give her all the lovin' I can

She's gonna jump and holler
'Cause I saved up two dollars
And we're gonna search and find that preacher man

Elvira, Elvira, my heart's on fire, Elvira

She's got eyes that look like heaven
And lips like a sherry wine
And she sure knows how to make a real poor boy feel fine

And she's gonna jump and holler
'Cause I saved up two dollars
And we're gonna search and find that preacher man

Elvira, Elvira, my heart's on fire, Elvira

She say giddy up oom poppa, oom poppa, mow, mow
Giddy up oom poppa, oom poppa, mow, mow
Hi oh, silver away yea, yea
