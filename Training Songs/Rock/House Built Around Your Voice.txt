This is the plan
Are you in, are you out
I lean on my smile
I pack up all of our doubt
On the back of a storm
Right out from your mouth
Drunk as I ride
Right up into your house

I've heard, I've heard you talk this way before
When you were talking of the casualties
About the bodies you've left in unmade beds
And there was nothing left to do but sleep

Living like this
In a house built 'round your voice
There's no fear for the instinct
A fear for all of our choice
This is the plan
Well, I'm in, oh, well, I'm in
It's impeachable silence
Behind your grin

Well, I've heard I've heard you talk this way before
When you were talking of the casualties
About the bodies you've left in unmade beds
And there was nothing left to do but sleep
