Is anybody in there
Is anybody home
Is anybody in there
Is anybody home
Can anybody hear me
Does anybody know
Know the way to break out of the undertow
When you need to hear your heartbeat
Just to know that you're alive
When someone's crying help me
You can see it in their eyes
Circumstance is deadly
Too afraid to know
The moment that we wake up
Caught in the undertow
Has anybody seen her
We've searched the city high and low
We've even heard her calling
From a place that no one knows
Listen you can hear her calling
I will never let you go
You're caught in the undertow
Can anybody hear me
Can anybody hear me
Can anybody hear me
Can anybody hear me
