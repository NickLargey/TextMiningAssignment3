Driving past hotels
In the night your words don't sit well

How can I feel free
When all I want to be
Is by your side in that municipality

Up in that farm land
Past the houses and gardens
Dozens of shade trees
Are waiting there for me

But that's not anything like my reality

To be by your side in that municipality
That's not anything like my reality
