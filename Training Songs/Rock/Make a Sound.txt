I don't know if we'll make it home
All we can do for now is hope

I don't know if we'll make it home
Water all around could swell and wash us all away
Away
And if we never said I'll be on land again
This will be one last song I will not forget

And if you drown
You won't even make a sound
You'll just swallow water down
At the bottom you'll find out
That it's quiet when you drown

I'm losing track of all the days
Lost inside a life boat
Drifting out with all the waves
The waves
And some will find their way by looking towards the sky
And some will leave their fate up to these ocean tides

And if you drown
You won't even make a sound
You'll just swallow water down
At the bottom you'll find out
That it's quiet when you drown

And when you drown
You'll never even make a sound
And when you drown
You're gonna swallow water down

The water gets so heavy
The water gets so heavy
The water gets so heavy

The water's heavy when you drown
You won't even make a sound
You'll just swallow water down
At the bottom you'll find out
That it's quiet when you drown

You'll never even make a sound
You'll just swallow water down
At the bottom you'll find out
That it's quiet when you drown
