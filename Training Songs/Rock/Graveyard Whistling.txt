All that afterlife
I don't hold with it
All your gods are false
Just get used to it
Let's go out tonight
Kill some stubborn myths
Set those ghosts alight, get into it.

No one's getting younger
Would you like a souvenir?
Let it take you under,
Feel your worries disappear

'Cause if you don't believe, it can't hurt you
And when you let it leave, it can't hurt you
'Cause if you don't believe, then you know
Then you know it can never do you harm
'Cause if you don't believe, it can't hurt you

Ok, I admit
I'm not innocent
I did everything and I would again
I'm not listening
I've heard everything
Graveyard listening
I'm into it

No one's getting younger
Would you like a souvenir?
Let it take you under,
Feel your worries disappear
Pow

'Cause if you don't believe, it can't hurt you
And when you let it leave, it can't hurt you
'Cause if you don't believe, then you know
Then you know it can never do you harm
'Cause if you don't believe, it can't hurt you

Got a picture and a passport and a number
Give me access to the cloud I'm living under
When I go there will I find a sense of wonder?
Open up the gates

'Cause if you don't believe, it can't hurt you
And when you let it leave, it can't hurt you
'Cause if you don't believe, then you know
Then you know it can never do you harm
'Cause if you don't believe, it can't hurt you
