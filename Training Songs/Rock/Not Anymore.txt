I'm walkin down another
cold dark street
I'm waiting
For dawn
Another coffee shop
an empty face 
Keep me warm until dawn
The heat from sewer grates warm my bed
the snow ain't cold anymore
My feet are so wet 
From the holes in my shoes
the shoes that walked out your door
But I don't care
don't push me away
You can't hurt me anymore
Not anymore
I'll sing you hymns 
for a cup of soup
so hungry
I don't care
How ?bout let me lay down for a little while
In a warm dry place
Gimme a quarter
For the movies all night
I gotta stay awake
I'm afraid of sleeping
And I'm freezing to death
I gotta keep me awake
But I don't care
don't push me away
You can't hurt me anymore
Not anymore
