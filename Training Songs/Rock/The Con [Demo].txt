I listened in
Yes I'm guilty of this you should know this
I broke down and wrote you back before you had a chance to
Forget forgotten, I am moving past this, giving notice
I have to go
Yes I know the feeling, know you're leaving

Calm down, I'm calling you to say
I'm capsized, staring on the edge of safe
Calm down, I'm calling back to say
I'm home now, I'm coming around, I'm coming around
Well, nobody likes to but I really like to cry
Nobody likes me, maybe if I cry

Spelled out your name and lists the reasons, faint of heart, don't call me back
I imagine you when I was distant, non-insistent
I follow suit and layed out on my back, imagine that
A million hours left to think of you and think of that

Calm down, I'm calling you to say
I'm capsized, staring on the edge of safe
Calm down, I'm calling back to say
I'm home now, I'm coming around, I'm coming around
Well, nobody likes to but I really like to cry
Well, nobody likes me, maybe if I cry

Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Well, nobody likes to but I really like to cry
Nobody likes me, maybe if I cry
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
