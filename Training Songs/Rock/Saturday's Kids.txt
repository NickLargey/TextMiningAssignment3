Saturday's boys live life with insults
Drink lots of beer and wait for half time results
Afternoon tea in the light-a-bite - chat up the girls 
They dig it!

Saturday's girls work in Tesco's and Woolworths
Wear cheap perfume 'cause its all they can afford
Go to discos they drink Babycham talk to Jan - in bingo accents

Saturdays kids play one arm bandits
They never win but that's not the point is it
Dip in silver paper when their pints go flat
How about that - far out!

Their mums and dads smoke Capstan non filters
Wallpaper lives 'cause they all die of cancer
What goes on - what goes wrong

Save up their money for a holiday
To Selsey Bill or Bracklesham Bay
Think about the future - when they'll settle down
Marry the girl next door - with one on the way

These are the real creatures that time has forgot
Not given a thought - its the system 
Hate the system - what's the system?

Saturdays kids live in council houses
Wear v-necked shirts and baggy trousers
Drive Cortinas fur trimmed dash boards
Stains on the seats - in the back of course!
