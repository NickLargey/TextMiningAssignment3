She ain't no good for you

But that's all right, well that's all right
Yeah that's all right, my mama
And any old way that you wanna do

Leaving here for sure
You ain't gotta be bothered with me
Hangin' 'round your door

But that's all right, yeah that's all right
Well that's all right, my mama
Anyway that you wanna do, ooh

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
