I don’t need to be anything other than a prison guard’s son
I don’t need to be anything other than a specialist’s son 
I don’t have to be anyone other than the birth of two souls in one 
Part of where I’m going is knowing where I’m coming from 

I don’t want to be anything 
Other than what I’ve been trying to be lately 
All I have to do is think of me and I have peace of mind 
I’m tired of looking around rooms wondering what I gotta do 
Or who I’m supposed to be 
I don’t want to be anything other than me 

I’m surrounded by liars everywhere I turn 
I’m surrounded by imposters everywhere I turn 
I’m surrounded by identity crisis everywhere I turn 
Am I the only one to notice? 
I can’t be the only one who’s learned 

I don’t want to be anything 
Other than what I’ve been trying to be lately 
All I have to do is think of me and I have peace of mind 
I’m tired of looking around rooms wondering what I gotta do 
Or who I’m supposed to be 
I don’t want to be anything other than me 

Can I have everyone’s attention please 
If you're not like this and that 
You’re gonna have to leave 
I came from the mountain, the crust of creation 
My whole situation made from clay to stone 
And now I’m telling everybody 

I don’t want to be anything 
Other than what I’ve been trying to be lately 
All I have to do is think of me and I have peace of mind 
I’m tired of looking around rooms wondering what I gotta do
Or who I’m supposed to be 
I don’t want to be anything other than me 
I don’t want to be 
I don’t want to be 
I don’t want to be 
I don’t want to be
