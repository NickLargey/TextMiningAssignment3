Is there love, tonight
When everyone's dreaming
Of a better life
In this world divided by fear, we've got to believe that
There's a reason we're here
Yeah, there's a reason we're her, oh, yeah

'Cause these are the days worth living
These are the years we're given
And these are the moments
These are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

See the truth all around
Our faith can be broken
And our hands can be bound
But open our hearts and fill up the emptiness
With nothing to stop us, is it not worth the risk?
Yeah, is it not worth the risk? No, yeah

'Cause these are the days worth living
These are the years we're given
And these are the moments
These are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

And even if hope was shattered
I know it wouldn't matter
'Cause these are the moments
These are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

We can't go on
Thinking it's wrong
To speak our minds
I've got to let out what's inside

Is there love, tonight
When everyone's dreaming
Well, can we get it right?
Yeah, can we get it right?

'Cause these are the days worth living
These are the years we're given
And these are the moments
These are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

And even if hope was shattered
I know it wouldn't matter
'Cause these are the moments
These are the times
Let's make the best out of our lives

Oh, yeah, let's make the best out of our lives
Oh, yeah, let's make the best out of our lives
