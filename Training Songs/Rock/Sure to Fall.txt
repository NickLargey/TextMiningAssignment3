I'm sure to fall, fall in love I'm sure to fall in love with you
You are so sweet and we are so near, I'm sure to fall in love with you

So hold me tight, let tonight be the night darling, don't ever let me go
For loving you is a natural thing to do, I want you for the rest of my life

So hold me tight, let tonight be the night darling, don't ever let me go
