Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes ah

When she walks she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes ooh

But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her?
Yes, I would give my heart gladly

But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at me

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see
Doesn't see

Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graça
É ela, menina, que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de Ipanema
O seu balançado parece um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar

Ooh, but I watch her so sadly
Aah, por que tudo é tão triste?
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall, tan, young, lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes I smile but she doesn't see
Por causa do amor
She just doesn't see
Nem olha para mim
She never sees me
Por causa do amor
