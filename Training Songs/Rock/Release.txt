I want the world to wake
I want to give you peace
I want to vindicate
You need to be released

Don't want to hurt you
I need to make you see
If I desert you
It's just to make you see

That I'm a man that's weak
And I'm a man that's lost
I gave it all away
To complicate the cost

Don't want to hurt you
I need to make you see
If I desert you
It's just to make you see
I'm not going to hurt you now
I need to make you see
If I desert you now
It's just to make you see

I want you to be free
I want you to be free from me
