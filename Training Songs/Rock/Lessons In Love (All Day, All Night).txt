When you walk my way, I feel the rush come over me
A sharp panic, panic
It's the things that you say that makes the rush come over me
It happens all the time
I never was too good at following rules
Nah, nah
I'm better just pretending I was the fool

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes, and I'm fallin' for you
Keep cool, stay tough but that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes, and I'm fallin' for you
Keep cool, stay young, I'm just havin' my fun
With the lessons in love

If I walk away, I feel a push inside of me that won't let me leave
But what could I say for you to feel whats inside of me?
This happens all the time
I never was too good at following rules
Nah, nah
I'm better just pretending I was the fool

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes, and I'm fallin' for you
Keep cool, stay tough but that's never enough
These are the lessons in love
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes, and I'm fallin' for you
Keep cool, stay young I'm just havin' my fun
With the lessons in love

I'm only lonely when the lights are on
I want the same rush, over and over and over and over and over
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
Come on!

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes, and I'm fallin' for you
Keep cool, stay tough but that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes, and I'm fallin' for you
Keep cool, stay young, I'm just havin' my fun
With the lessons in love
