You're kinda cool, a little rough
You're skin and bones and you talk so tough
You take your time, you like to make me waiting
Just when I'm ready to accelerate

You want to see me in the middle of the night
You hit the streets, you're riding every night, you want to

Kick start my heart, kick start my heart
Kick start my heart, kick start my heart

You get me going, you got the touch
And then you tell me that I want too much
You call me angel, say I'm a child
Then you hit me with that rebel smile

You want to take me and you know I want to go
I lose control so easily, you know how to

Kick start my heart, kick start my heart
Kick start my heart, kick start my heart
Kick start my heart, kick start my heart

Kick start my heart, kick start my heart
Kick start my heart, kick start my heart

(You get me going, you got my heart, you get me going, you got the touch)
