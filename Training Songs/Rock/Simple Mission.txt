Humble in the light from above
Standing in the shadow of love
Rock of ages; who can I be?
Where am I, and what will I see?
So just give me your love (Give me your love)
Give me your hate (Give me your hate)
It's a young man's time
And time won't wait
Oh! Just give me your love

Silenced by the lust of your plans
Caught up in the hatred of man
A darker side will persecute me
And God help you if I'm all you need
So just give me your love (Give me your love)
Give me your hate (Give me your hate)
It's a young man's time
And time won't wait
Oh! Just give me your love

You can tell just by the state I'm in
I didn't know where this thing
Ends or where it begins
I can see just by the look
In her eyes
She's laid out, ready and willing
Or maybe she's just hypnotized

It's a simple mission
