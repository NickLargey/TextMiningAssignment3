Candles burning, ruby red
Sheets are falling off the bed
Run your fingers through my hair
I know what you're thinkin'
Take me there
You hypnotize me with your touch
And I can never get enough of you
It's true
And anywhere you wanna go 
My hand is only yours to hold
Oh, you know

I'm so obsessed
With the way that your lips
Kiss me like crazy
Oh, you amaze me
When you walk in the room
You got me losing it
Yeah, I'm a mess
Girl, I confess
I'm so obsessed
Oh, yeah

Every time you walk away
I guess your perfume likes to stay
On my pillow, on my shirt
Listen, baby 
For what it's worth

I'm so obsessed
With the way that your lips
Kiss me like crazy
Oh, you amaze me
When you walk in the room
You got me losing it
Yeah, I'm a mess
Girl, I confess
I'm so obsessed
Yeah, yeah, yes

So, give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me now

I'm so obsessed
With the way that your lips
Kiss me like crazy
Oh, you amaze me
When you walk in the room
You got me losing it, babe
Yeah, I'm a mess
Girl, I confess
I'm so obsessed

Oh, babe
Yeah
When your friends are around
And you kiss me in front of everybody
You know it drives me crazy, girl
So, come and lay one on my lips, girl

Just do it to me
You know it
I'm so obsessed

You're never gettin' rid of me baby
Never gettin' rid of me baby

You know it
You know
You're never gettin' rid of me baby
Never gettin' rid of me baby

Break it down for me baby
Girl, you know you're driving me crazy
I can't get enough

I think you're feeling me too, baby
So lay me down, show me right
Do me good
Let's turn out these lights baby
I'm so obsessed
With the way that you walk into the room, baby
I can't even take it
You know, you know you do
I guess what I'm trying to say is
I'm so obsessed
