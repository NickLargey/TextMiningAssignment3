When the soul of the city
Was laid to rest
And the nights forgotten and left for dead

I happened on a house
Built of living light
Where everything evil disappears and dies

When they love you, and they will
Tell em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down
Tell em all to go to hell

When they love you, and they will
Tell em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down
Tell em all to go to hell

I settled in slowly, to this house that you call home
To blood and breath, fear, flesh and bone

Well shove our bodies in the heat of the night
All day the day after, blood in the skies

When they love you, and they will
Tell em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down
Tell em all to go to hell

When they love you, and they will
Tell em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down
Tell em all to go to hell

Its a lifeless life, with no fixed address to give
But your not mine to die for anymore
So I must live

Born of a bottle, from heavens hand
And now you know and here I am

When they love you, and they will
Tell em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down
Tell em all to go to hell

When the love Me and they will
I'll tell em all the love in your shadow
And if they try to slow me down
I'll tell em all to go to hell

When they love you, and they will
Tell em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down
Tell em all to go to hell

When they love you, and they will
Tell em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down
Tell em all to go to hell
