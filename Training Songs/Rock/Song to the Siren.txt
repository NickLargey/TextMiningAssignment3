Long afloat on shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
Till your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle
Sail to me
Sail to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you

Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you hare when I was fox?
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks,
Touch me not, touch me not,
come back tomorrow,
Oh my heart, oh my heart
shies from the sorrow

I am puzzled as the newborn child
I am troubled at the tide,
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Should I lie with Death my bride?
Swim to me,
Swim to me,
Let me enfold you:
Here I am,
Here I am,
Waiting to hold you
