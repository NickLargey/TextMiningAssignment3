Got something to tell me
Tell me this is fake
Forget compromise
They just complicate
And I go, empty again

I don't want sympathy
I'll do it my way
I don't want to listen
To what they will say
I'm much to paranoid

You Bully me 
You wont beat me 
I will be me again 

It becomes a habit
A priority
Never will forget it 
It's inside of me
It makes me feel ugly
I don't want it to repeat 

You Bully me 
You wont beat me 
I will be me again 

All this in me
I want to tell you 

You Bully me 
You wont beat me 
I will be me again 

You Bully me 
You wont beat me 
I will be me again
