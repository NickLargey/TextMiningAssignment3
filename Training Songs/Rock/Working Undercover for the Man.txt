I've been working hard, trying to sing and play guitar.
Growing out my hair, and practicing my stare.

Paid to fake it in a traveling band,
And I'm working undercover for the man.
Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la

Planing midnight raids on our unsuspecting fans,
While roadies rig the video surveillance van.

Paid to fake it in a traveling band,
And I'm working undercover for the man.
Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la
