If you disrespect everybody that you run into
how in the world do you think everybody's 'sposed to respect you?
If you don't give a heck about the man with the Bible in his hand
just get out of the way and let the gentleman do his thing.
You the kind of gentleman want everything your way.
Take the sheet off your face boy, it's a brand new day.

Respect yourself, respect yourself.
'Cause if you don't respect yourself
ain't nobody gonna give a good, good hootenanny boy.
Respect yourself.

If you're walking around thinking that the world owes you
something 'cause you're here
you're going out the world backward like you did when you first
came 'ere.
Keep talking about the president won't stop air pollution.
Put your hand over your mouth when you cough, that'll help the
solution.
You cuss around women folk, don't even know their name,
then you're dumb enough to think it makes you a big ole man.

Respect yourself, respect yourself.
'Cause if you don't respect yourself
ain't nobody gonna give a good, good hootenanny boy.
Respect yourself.
Respect yourself.
