Oh my darlin' I'll go down and commute
Until one hundred souls
There's a fire on the moon
I'll be over the line, I'll be under the spell
I'll be the comeback king
On his way home from hell

Seven nights, seven days
Seven wishes that will bury this place
Another reason not to get out of bed

Show me the way brother
Give me a sign sister
I'm not the only one who's waiting to be born
I see the day comin'
I see the time runnin' out
I see all of my dreams ragged and torn

Oh my darlin' all my sympathy's gone
And my sunsets are strange
My time's gettin' on
They'll rip me to shreds like it's never been seen
'Cause I never convinced them that I meant what I mean

Seven nights, seven days
Seven wishes that will bury this place
Another reason not to get out of bed

Show me the way brother
Give me a sign sister
I'm not the only one who's waiting to be born
I see the day comin'
I see the time runnin' out
I see all of my dreams ragged and torn
I see all of my dreams ragged and torn
I see all of my dreams ragged and torn

Seven nights, seven days
Seven wishes that will bury this place
Another reason not to get out of bed
Another reason not to, another reason not to
Another reason not to, another reason not to
Another reason not to get out of bed

Show me the way brother
Give me a sign sister
I'm not the only one who's waiting to be born
I see the day comin'
I see the time runnin' out
I see all of my dreams ragged and torn
I see all of my dreams ragged and torn
I see all of my dreams ragged and torn
I see all of my dreams ragged and torn
