Bet you're gettin' the wrong idea 'bout me
Bet you're thinkin' there's more than the eye can see
I'll tell you somethin', then maybe again I won't
'Cause now you see me, but who knows, maybe you don't
Time after time...you had your chances and you threw them away..oh no..
Don't waste my time, 'cause I don't need the glory
That's all I want to say.....
Chorus:
Gimme your love
You know what it does to me
-Drives me crazy....ain't tellin' no lies
Gimme your love
With you I feel satisfied
When you're by my side
I tell you no lies
It's on the line....can't think about nothin' else
Suits me fine, 'Cause I know we're two of a kind
To trust myself is something I just can't do
So how the hell..girl...am I going to trust you?
Night after night....two crazy people getting high on their love
Crazy love....
Don't stop me now, I got a one-way ticket straight to your heart..oh no..
Repeat Chorus
Bet you're gettin' the wrong idea 'bout me
I bet you're thinkin'...there's more than the eye can see
Well, you should talk...I know quite a bit about you
Don't look so worried, just do what we both want to do
'Cause time after time..you had your chances and you threw them away
All away........
You cut it so fine with your advances honey,
Now I know just what to say
Repeat Chorus
