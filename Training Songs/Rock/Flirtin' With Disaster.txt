I'm travelin' down the road
I'm flirtin' with disaster
I've got the pedal to the floor,
My life is running faster
I'm out of money, I'm out of hope,
It looks like self destruction 
Well how much more can we take,
With all of this corruption

We're flirtin' with disaster,
Ya'll know what I mean
And the way we run our lives,
It makes no sense to me
I don't know about yourself or what you want to be, yeah
When we gamble with our time,
We choose our destiny

I'm travelin' down that lonesome road
Feel like I'm dragging a heavy load
Yeah I've tried to turn my head away,
Feels about the same most every day

You know what I'm talking about, baby

Speeding down the fast lane, honey
Playin' from town to town
The boys and I have been burnin' it up, can't seem to slow it down
I've got the pedal to the floor, our lives are runnin' faster,
Got our sights set straight ahead,
But ain't sure what we're after

Flirtin' with disaster, ya'll know what I mean
You know the way we run our lives it makes no sense to me
I don't know about yourself or what you plan to be, yea
When we gamble with our time, we choose our destiny

Yeah, I'm travelin' down that lonesome road
Feel like I'm dragging a heavy load
Don't tried to turn my head away,
I'm flirtin' with disaster every day

And you are too, baby, ha ha ha

Flirtin' with disaster baby,
Ya'll know what I mean
You know the way we run our lives,
It makes no sense to me
I don't know about yourself or what you plan to be 
When we gamble with our time, we choose our destiny

Yeah, we're traveling down this lonesome road
Feel like I'm dragging a heavy load
Don't try and turn my head away, ba ba ba yeah
Flirtin' with disaster every day
