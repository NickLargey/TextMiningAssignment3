Well I'm spending all my money and its going up my nose
My Daddy's found me out and he's tearing up my clothes
My probation man says you know you ought to quit
I said now don't you hang me up now with none of that shit
I got the teenage depression that's what I'm talkin' bout
If you don't know what I mean then you better look out

Same thing every day, well I cant get out of bed
Too many questions are confusing up my head
I cant stand the thought of another day at school
But I know the weekends coming so I gotta keep my cool
I got the teenage depression that's what I'm talkin' bout
If you don't know what I mean then you better look out

It really makes me mad when they always ask me why
That I never comb my hair and I never wear a tie
School teacher bugging me it's the same old thing
Get out of my way I need another shot of gin
I got the teenage depression that's what I'm talkin' bout
If you don't know what I mean then you better look out

Got the teenage depression, It's becoming an obsession
Got the teenage depression, It's becoming an obsession
Got the teenage depression, It's becoming an obsession
Got the teenage depression, It's becoming an obsession

I got the teenage depression that's what I'm talkin' bout
If you don't know what I mean then you better look outâ?¦.Look out !
