I'm trying to create something that's not there
A spark I saw. A bomb is really just a means to an end 
I was just so happy to be out of my shell again, 
don't think that I really cared for who or what 
I'll just have to keep myself shut 

If you're not ready, you're not ready 
Please stop acting like you are 

How could I know 
that everything you say are lies about devotion and desire? 
I know the spark inside your eyes 
was just the match I used to set myself on fire 

My mouth's shooting blanks 
This situation's unbearable, 
I've gotten vulnerable 
Now anyone is free to waltz right in 
My temple's been invaded 
and there's nobody guarding it 
All over this lonely life, 
but what's so wrong with being all alone? 
Alone's the only way I've ever known 

If you're not ready, you're not ready 
Please stop acting like you are 

How could I know 
that everything you say are lies about devotion and desire? 
I know the spark inside your eyes 
was just the match I used to set myself on fire 

I'm pleading cause this kills and it's still bleeding 
My darling I'm taking my life back to start healing 

How could I know 
that everything you say are lies about devotion and desire? 
I know the spark inside your eyes 
was just the match I used to set myself on fire
