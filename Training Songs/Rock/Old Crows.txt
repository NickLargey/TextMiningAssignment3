Old crows ride in the mouth of the beast
Sleep beneath its tongue, cradled by its teeth
We roam from shore to shore
From the open sky to the ocean floor
The more we move the less we are ourselves
And when we finally stop, we've changed to something else

As rapid as a river flows
As frigid as the cold wind can blow
As devious as the devilâ??s grin
Our blood is cold and weâ??ve shed our skin

Now, we are not the kids we used to be
Stop wishing for yesterday
We are not the kids we used to be
Stop wishing for yesterday
We are not the kids we used to be
Oh oh oh
We are not the kids we used to be
Stop wishing for yesterday

The crows are calling seems the end is near
Theyâ??re spelling out their names, yet we have no fear
Oh, the damage a man can do
When ambition takes over his search for the truth

Sometimes life just gets the best of us
Some things in life will get the best of us

Now, we are not the kids we used to be
Stop wishing for yesterday
We are not the kids we used to be
Stop wishing for yesterday
We are not the kids we used to be
Oh oh oh (Stop wishing for yesterday)
We are not the kids we used to be
Stop wishing for yesterday
Wishing for yesterday

Every skyline beats in my chest
Somewhere between love and sadness
This is our fate, this is our test
We ride in the mouth of madness

As rapid as a river flows
As frigid as the cold wind can blow
As devious as the devilâ??s grin
Our blood is cold and now we shed our skin

We are not the kids we used to be
Stop wishing for yesterday
We are not the kids we used to be
Oh oh oh (Stop wishing for yesterday)
We are not the kids we used to be
Stop wishing for yesterday
We are not the kids we used to be
Stop wishing for yesterday
Wishing for yesterday
Wishing for yesterday
