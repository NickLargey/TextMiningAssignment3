I thought I might begin by filling you in, 
In case you didn't already know
I'll never forget how you got up and left
In fact it was downright pretty low
There ain't no way I want to
You know I ain't going to
Take you back, so don't even try
You can beg, you can plead, 
You can sweat, you can bleed
Too bad I could care if you cry

That's it! (That's all!) We had fun
(We had a ball!)
It was good while it lasted, 
But now I'm past it
(It was sure!) It was sweet
Sure you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then
But would I do it all again, nah, 

[Chorus]
You won't find me
Naked and cold just a sitting
On the doctor's table
Waiting to be told just a why
I'm no longer able
To feel my heart beating, 
Give me a good reason why
I kind of went numb just around
About the time you told me
You were moving on, and you
Said that you were going to phone me
It's been so long, and there
Ain't nothing wrong with the line

It's too late to regret it
But you're the one who said it
We're better off being apart
I hate to be a downer
But don't bother coming 'round here
Cause I won't have a change of heart

That's it! (That's all!) We had fun
(We had a ball!)
It was good while it lasted, 
But now I'm past it
(It was sure!) It was sweet
Sure you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then
But would I do it again, nah, 

[Chorus]

Nah

Well, I hope you learned a lesson
Cause you'll never be messing
With my head again the way that you did
It was never going to work; you were
Too much of a jerk
I'm finally fed up with it

That's it! (That's all!) We had fun
(We had a ball!)
It was good while it lasted, 
But now I'm past it
(It was sure!) It was sweet
Sure you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then
But would I do it all again, nah, 

[Chorus]

Nah
