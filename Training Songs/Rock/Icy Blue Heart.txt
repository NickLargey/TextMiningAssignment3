She came onto him like a slow movin' cold front 
His beer was warmer than the look in her eyes 
She sat on a stool, he said, "What do you want?" 
She said, "Give me a love that don't freeze up inside." 

He said, "I have melted some hearts in my time, dear
But to sit next to you, lord, I shiver and shake
And if I knew love, well, I don't think I'd be here
Askin' myself if I've got what it takes."

To melt your icy blue heart 
Should I start
To turn what's been frozen for years 
Into a river of tears?

"These days we all play cool, calm, and collected 
Why, our lips could turn blue just shooting the breeze." 
But under the frost, well, he thought he detected 
A warm blush of red and a touch of her knee 

He said, "Girl, you're a beauty like I've never witnessed 
And I've seen the Northern Lights dance in the air 
But I've felt the cold that can follow the first kiss 
And there's not enough heat in the fires burning there." 

To melt your icy blue heart 
Should I start
To turn what's been frozen for years 
Into a river of tears?
