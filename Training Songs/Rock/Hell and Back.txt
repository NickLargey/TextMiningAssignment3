I held on as long as I could possibly 
My blind faith pushing me to my knees
I felt the warmth of a touch 
And it made me believe
And I knew it well

I stood at the doorway hoping you might let me in
My head spinning 'round
My nerves jumping from my skin
I felt the stinging ragged cold 
Of the devil's hot embrace
And I knew it well

And you took me to hell and back
How many times can I walk away from you?
My mind's like a one way track 
And every one is taking me back to you 
And you tell me "Just one more time"
And you're lying like you always do
And I know it well

I must have walked a thousand miles or more tryin' to keep you off my mind 
I've knocked on a thousand doors I'm sure, just to see what I might find
I slept in the arms of a fallen angel cryin' next to me 
And I knew her well

And you took me to hell and back
How many times can I walk away from you?
My mind's like a one way track 
And every one is taking me back to you 
And you tell me "Just one more time"
And you're lying like you always do
And you give me just one more line and there’s nothing that I can do
If I do it just one more time, then I swear that I’ll be through
Yeah I know it well

And you took me to hell and back
My mind's like a one way track
And you tell me "Just one more time"
And you're lying like you always do
Yeah I know it well 

And you took me to hell and back
How many times can I walk away from you?
My mind's like a one way track 
And every one is taking me back to you 
And you tell me "Just one more time"
And you're lying like you always do
And you give me just one more line and there’s nothing that I can do
If I do it just one more time, then I swear that I’ll be through
Yeah I know it well
Yeah I know it well
