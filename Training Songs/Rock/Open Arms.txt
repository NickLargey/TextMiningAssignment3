Waking up, its half past ten
And I can't remember anything
About the way we'd met.
And if I ask you questions,

Try to tag along 'cause
I need to be reminded
Of where it all went wrong.
'Cause I'm holding on to what I've got today,

And maybe you'll forget to walk away.
But I thought I told you when,
I can't take this side of hell ?
And I know there's not a single way to fight it.

Could you blame me for the tears, 
When you've never felt the fear?
And your mind is closing in without a way through.
And now and then I like to

Dance and sing along,
But I see through all the emptiness
To fool myself no more.
So i`ll try to take you

Back with Open Arms,
To hold me on the wagon
When I fall.
But I thought I told you when,

I can't take this side of hell (?)
And I know there's not a single way to fight it.
Could you blame me for the tears, 
When you've never felt the fear?

And your mind is closing in without a way through.
'Cause I'm holding on to what I've got today,
And maybe you'll forget to walk away.
And without you my crutch

I`ll surely disappear,
And with a puff of smoke I`ll go
And you'll be clear.
'Cause I'm holding on to what I've got today,

And maybe you'll forget to walk away.
But I thought I told you when,
I can't take this side of hell 
And I know there's not a single way to fight it.

Could you blame me for the tears, 
When you've never felt the fear?
And your mind is closing in without a way through.
Aaaaaaa, aaaaaha, oooooooo, ho.
Aaaaaaa, aaaaaha, oooooooo, ho.
