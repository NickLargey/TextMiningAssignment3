The tycho, don't you know nothing?
The doors on the oven
Wide enough to make us all kin
Boy scout
Let it all gush out
Shopping your brains out now at the bargain bins

So many to germs to avoid
Thinking about it just nurtures them
Baby, return to your toys, a little mental hideaway

You're painting a hole
And you crawl up inside it
You're painting a hole
On everyone in your way
You're painting a hole
To magical violence
You're painting a hole
But it keeps fading away

Morning dove
One thing I'm sure of
Kisses ain't near enough
To reign the vultures in
Every good girl and boy
Prized away from the firmament
Elegant hands unemployed or on a permanent holiday

You're painting a hole
And you crawl up inside it
You're painting a hole
On everyone in your way
You're painting a hole
To magical violence
You're painting a hole
But it keeps fading away
