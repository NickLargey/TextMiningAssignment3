The higher you build your barriers, the taller I become
The farther you take my rights away, the faster I will run
You can deny me, you can decide to turn your face away
No matter 'cause there's

Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doin' me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, oh no
There's something inside so strong
Something inside so strong

The more you refuse to hear my voice, the louder I will sing
You hide behind walls of Jericho, your lies will come tumbling
Deny my place and time, you squander wealth that's mine
My light will shine so brightly it will blind you
Because there's

Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doin' me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, oh no
There's something inside so strong
Something inside so strong

Brothers and sisters, when they insist we're just not good enough
Well, we know better, just look 'em in the eyes and say
"we're gonna do it anyway, we're gonna do it anyway
We're gonna do it anyway"

Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doin' me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, oh no
There's something inside so strong
There's something inside so strong
There's something inside so strong

Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doing me wrong, so wrong
