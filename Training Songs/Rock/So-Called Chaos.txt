Deadlines, and meetings
And contracts all breached
D-days and structure
Responsibility

Have to's and need to's
And get to's by three
Dinner then flowers
And upset employees

[Chorus]
I want to be naked,
Running through the streets!
I want to invite this so called chaos,
That you think I dare not be
I want to be weightless,
Flying through the air!
I want to drop all these limitations
In the shoes upon my feet, oh!

Heart-burn and headaches
And soon to be ulcers
Compulsive yearnings
Non-stop to please others

[Chorus]

All won't be lost if I am
Governed by my own uniqueness
Stop lights won't work, I'll get home
Sound and safe, regardless
Won't need a hand if
I'm ruled by my own discreetness
My fire won't quell,
And I'll be harm free and
Distressless and trusting

Line towing, and helping
Expectations up to living
Inside box obeying
Inside line coloring

[Chorus: x2]
