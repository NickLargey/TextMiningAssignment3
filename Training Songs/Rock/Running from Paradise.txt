I caught you staring at the ceiling
Captured by the mirror up there
OK OK I see the separation
Making love down here
While you're watching in the air

If you're looking for love
And you don't find it in my eyes
Then you're Running from Paradise.
Look before you leap, darling
Don't you know that you're 
Running from Paradise

I gave you every pose you asked for
Played every game you fantasize
I called your bluff, we're running out of breath
You're hooked on looking, not on what you find
Paradise
