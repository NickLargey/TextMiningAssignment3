La dumb da da dumb
Take the cup of delusion
This empty hole inside
Drinks the wine of remorse
And giving cause to stumble
It's sobering, the changes

Don't turn around
Don't walk away
Don't try to lead
When you don't know

La dumb da da dumb
Blotting out the strains of nonsense
And drenched in this desire
Spilling from an empty cup
You bury guilt like sin
Hurling smiles and judgments
The blatant tone of your soul
Creates a blackness deep within

Bitterness trickles through
This vein of tenderness

La dumb la da dumb
La dumb la da dumb
La dumb la da dumb
