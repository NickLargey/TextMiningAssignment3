T was a night mmm, what a night it was 
It really was such a night 
The moon was bright, Oh how bright it was 
It really was such a night 
The night was alive, with the stars above mmm 
When she kissed me, I had to fall in love 

It was a kiss mmm, what a kiss it was 
It really was such a kiss 
How she could kiss, oh what a kiss it was 
It really was such a kiss 
Just part of her lips, could set me afire 
I I I reminisce, and I feel desire 

I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender 
How well I remember, I'll always remember 

Oh that night, oh what a night it was 
It really was such a night 
Came the dawn and my heart and my love 
And the night was gone 
But I'll never forget that kiss in the moonlight 
Such a kiss oh such a night 

I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender 
How well I remember, I'll always remember 

Oh what a night, oh what a night it was 
It really was such a night 
Came the dawn and my heart and her love 
And the night was gone 
But I know I'll never forget her kiss in the moonlight 
Such a kiss oh oh such a night 

Now she's gone, gone, gone 
Yes she's gone, gone, gone 
Came the dawn, dawn, dawn 
And the night was gone 
And my heart was gone 
And her love was gone 
And before that morn 
Oh oh oh oh such a night
