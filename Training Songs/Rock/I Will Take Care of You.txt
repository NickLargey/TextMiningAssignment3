When the daylight disappears
When you're haunted, I'll be near
When the shadows come to call
And when you're too scared to stand tall
I can stand tall

Dream and let your dreams come
It's your turn to fly
As long as I'm standing by
You can close your eyes

I will take care of you
Long as you want me to
Whatever else I do
I will take care of you

Don't you worry, while you sleep
All my love is your's to keep
All you wish for, all you know
Will be your's when you let go
You can let go

Smile if you can now
Smile through your tears
Here where your fears are known
Know you're safe at home

I will take care of you
Long as you want me to
Whatever else I do
I will take care of you

Hoo-hoo!
All you have to do is say goodnight
Close your eyes
And fly (fly) into the night

I will take care of you
Long as you want me to
Whatever else I do
I will take care of you, yeah
