We have a chance to turn the pages over
We can write what we want to write
We gotta make ends meet before we get much older

We're all someone's daughter
We're all someone's son
How long can we look at each other
Down the barrel of a gun'

You're the voice, try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear

It's time you know we all could stand together
We got the power to be powerful
And believe it, we all could make it better

We're all someone's daughter
We're all someone's son
How long can we look at each other
Down the barrel of a gun'

You're the voice, try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear

We're all someone's daughter
We're all someone's son
How long can we look at each other
Down the barrel of a gun'

You're the voice, try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear

No, no, no, hey, hey
We're not gonna sit in silence
No more, no more
Oh yeah, no no
