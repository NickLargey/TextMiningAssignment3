All my hopes and dreams came true today
My life won't be the same
You opened up my eyes and let the healing begin
You brought me hope within

You took away the chains that once held me down
Now I can hear You say

Come home, come home
You're calling me into your arms
I've been gone, for so long
I can hear You calling out my name

I can't believe how much You sacrificed
You chose death to give me life
I won't cry for myself anymore
I've found what I've been looking for
You were with me all this time

You've been watching me for so long
I can hear You calling out my name

I've been waiting, anticipating, patiently waiting for you
