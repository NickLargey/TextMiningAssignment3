Walk with me through the scrapyard
Past yesterdays most wanted cars
Piled high in the daylight

Chicken skins in the dustbins
Fur coats in the wardrobe
Spare bed in the good night

Don't bother with the bills
Fly

Nobody grows old
We just crease and fold
Like the laundry
Nobody will die
We're hung out to dry
Like the laundry

Walk with me in the moonlight
Hear the freight trains roll
From another life

Remember your bedroom ceiling
Remember those old patterned curtains
When you were sleeping

Don't worry who will see
Cry

Nobody grows old
We just crease and fold
Like the laundry
Nobody will die
We're hung out to dry
Like the laundry

Nobody grows old
We just crease and fold
Like the laundry
Nobody will die
We're hung out to dry
Like the laundry
