Oh Lord, I got to raise a fuss, Lord I got to raise a holler
About a workin' all summer just to try to earn a dollar
Oh Lord, I tried to call my baby, I tried to get a date

Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
Lord, there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well, my mom and pop told me, "Son you gotta make some money
Well, if you want to use the car to go ridin' next Sunday"
Well, Lord I didn't go to work I told the boss I was sick he said

Sometimes I wonder, what I'm a gonna do
Lord, there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

I've got to take the weeks I got to have a fun vacation
I've got to take my problem to the United Nations
I done told my congressman and he said, "Whoa, take this boy"

Sometimes I wonder, what I'm a gonna do
Lord, there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

I've got to take the weeks, I got to have a fun vacation
I've got to take my problem, to the United Nations
I done told my congressman and he said, "Whoa, take this boy"

Sometimes I wonder, what I'm a gonna do
Lord, there ain't no cure, for the summertime blues
Whoa, there ain't no cure
