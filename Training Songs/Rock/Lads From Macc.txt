Ten pints of Boddies and a barley wine,
We've got to make the Bear's Head before closing time.
We're the Macc Lads, we were born in a pub,
We like us ale and we like us grub,
We're the Macc Lads and we ain't fuckin' puffs.
We're the Lads from Macc,
We want some crack,
We're the Lads from Macc, alright?
Now before we go out shaggin' the night,
We drive around insulting every bugger in sight,
Hre's and old bag, just the job,
Right lads, lets get ready wi' gob,
Stanly Ogden? He's a fuckin' slob.
We're the Lads from Macc,
We want some crack,
We're the Lads from Macc.
We're the Macc Lads, we're fuckin' rough,
We like us ale, we can't get enough,
We're the Macc Lads and we ain't fuckin' puffs.
We're the Lads from Macc,
We want some crack,
We're the Lads from Macc, alright?
Get your gob 'round me knob,
Get your teeth 'round me beef,
Get your lipsies 'round me titsies,
Get your smackers 'round me knackers,
Get your gums 'round me brums,
Talk to me pork,
Get your smackers round me knackers.
Alright my son?
We're the Lads from Macc,
We want some crack,
We're the Lads from Macc, alright?

Beer 'n' Sex 'n' Chips 'n' Gravy
Clean me teeth, put on me best clobber,
Tonight's the night I'm going fer knob 'er,
Vaxhaull Vivas all covered in rust,
But you can't f*ck yer bird on a 29 bus,
One, two, one two three four,
Beer 'n' sex 'n' chips 'n' gravy
It's all a Macc Lad wants,
Beer 'n' sex 'n' chips 'n' gravy,
Tasty bit of cunt.
So gerrup off the floor,
Finish yer chips, we're gonna go sup some more.
I pulled a punt down the fox 'n' grapes,
A game of darts an' a lot of beer,
I said "can you hold your liquor love?"
She said "yes I can, always by the ears."
Beer and sex and chips and gravy,
Tasty birrov cunt,
Beer and sex and chips and gravy,
It's all a Macc Lad wants.
I've told you once before,
Gerrup off the floor,
Finish yer chips, we're gonna go sup some more...
Beer and sex and chips and gravy,
Beer and sex and chips and gravy,
Beer and sex and chips and gravy,
Beer and sex and chips and gravy,
Beer and sex and chips and gravy.
Treat yer women like toilets,
The're happy while you're abusing them,
But toilets don't follow yer 'round,
When you've finished using them
One two three four,
Beer and sex and chips and gravy,
Beer and sex and chips and gravy,
Gerrit down yer necks.
Beer an' sex an' sex an' gravy..
