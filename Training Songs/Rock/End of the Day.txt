But when I get home, gonna stay till the end of the day.
Waited so long, but I stay till the end of the day.
But when I'm gone I'll be trusting you again.
Working all night.
Making it right.
Trying so hard, so hard, so hard to be something, you'll keep
Playing these games.
I'm going insane.
I know, I know, I know it's never what it seems. 

But, but when I get home, gonna stay till the end of the day.
Waited so long, but I stay till the end of the day.
But when I'm gone I'll be trusting you again.
Fooling around.
Feeling so proud.
Hearing those words, those words I never mean,
Taking a chance.
A meaningless offense.
You know, you know, you know they're never what they seem. 

But, but, but when I get home gonna stay till the end of the day.
Waited so long but I stay till the end of the day.
But when I'm gone I'll be trusting you again. 

But, but, but when I get home gonna stay till the end of the day.
Waited so long but I stay till the end of the day.
When I get home gonna stay till the end of the day.
Waited so long but I stay till the end of the day. 

When I get home, when I get home.
When I get home, when I get home.
