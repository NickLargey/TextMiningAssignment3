Betrayed? It's the question
That I am asking.
Or just a lucky one deceived by too much love.
Confused. Is the issue.
I'm in need of high rescue.
Another lucky one stunned by too much love.

My wild child
She's my salvaged shipwreck.
My wild child she's my stone.
My wild child
She's my constant reminder.
My wild child she's my home.

Lost. Is the place
Where I'm hammering stakes.
Sign says, "A lucky one done in by too much love."
Saved. Is the state
That we are told was graced.
He was just a lucky one betrayed by too much love.

My wild child
She's my salvaged shipwreck.
My wild child she's my stone.
My wild child
She's my constant reminder.
My wild child she's my home.

Life. Is the riddle
Of which we're caught in the middle.
A couple of lucky ones
Tangled up in too much love.
My wild child
She's my salvaged shipwreck.
My wild child she's my stone.
My wild child
She's my constant reminder.
My wild child she's my home.
My wild child brings me home.
