You say with best intention
Let's throw away convention
Set sail across the water
To find the tides of fortune
I say please understand it
Don't let our love be stranded
Upon the midnight rocks
Upon the midnight rocks

You say there's no endeavour
We couldn't try together
No storm we couldn't weather
We'll ride the wind forever
I hear the words you've spoken
Don't let our love be broken
Upon the midnight rocks
Upon the midnight rocks

Ah, you know you know it's easy
Ah, to let it go believe me
Ah, you know, you know you feel it
Ah, don't lose it when you need it

I know that fascination
With living each sensation
In your imagination
There is no hesitation
I know your mind is turning
Don't let our love lie burning
Upon the midnight rocks
Upon the midnight rocks

I know that fascination
With living each sensation
In your imagination
There is no hesitation
I say please understand it
Don't let our love be stranded
Upon the midnight rocks
