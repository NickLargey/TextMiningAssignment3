I never thought you'd hurt me
I guess you live and learn
That when you're playin' with fire you're bound to get burned
I've been mistreated, I've been used before
I get kicked in the face still I come back for more

But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
We can pick up the pieces and start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl I can't take anymore

Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you'll ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
(Well) you can do anything, but baby, don't treat me bad
Oh, don't treat me bad

I gave it everything, but you threw it all away
I can't take anymore of these games that you play
I've been through heartache and I've been through pain
And it's hard to believe you still treat me this way

But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
We can pick up the pieces and start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl I can't take anymore

Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you'll ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
(Well) you can do anything, but baby, don't treat me bad
Oh, don't treat me bad

Oh girl, I can't take anymore, oh yeah, now listen to me

Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you'll ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
(Well) you can do anything, but baby, don't treat me bad
Oh, don't treat me bad
