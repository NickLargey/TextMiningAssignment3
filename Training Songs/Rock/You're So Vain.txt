You walked into the party
Like you were walking onto a yacht
Your skirt strategically hiked up on one thigh
Your scarf was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror
You think you're so damn hot
And all the boys dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
I'll be you think this song is about you
Don't you, don't you

You had me several years ago
When I was still quite naÃ¯ve
You said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams there were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
I'll be you think this song is about you
Don't you, don't you

Well I hear you went up to Saratoga
And your horse it naturally won
You jumped into your jet and flew to Nova Scotia
To see a total eclipse of the sun
Well you're where you should be all the time
When you're not you're with 
Somebody's boyfriend
Somebody's boyfriend and
