So many times left alone.
This was my only home.
Again down on my luck this is all I fucking got.
You think it's sad that I'm still here.
Well save that shit 'cause I don't fucking care.
All I've seen, all you've taught to me, is forever instilled in me.
You say you fucking live for this,
But what the f*ck did you ever give?
I gave everything.
You know I'll die to keep this alive.
Because of this ever dies, I fucking die.
Life and death for me.
