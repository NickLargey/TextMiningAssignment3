Life is a sieve through which my anarchy streams
Resolving itself into words
Chaos is the score upon which reality is written
The timeless, swirling, gyroscopic horde

Delirium of disorder

I am just an atom in an ectoplasmic sea
Without direction or a reason to exist
The anechoic nebula rotating in my brain
Has persuaded me contritely to persist
