I knew when I saw here posing like a pop star
In thrift store rags
Brilliantly glowing, moved like she was floating
In her tracks

Overhead I'm taken
Everything's radiating
When she shows, everybody knows
(And it goes)

And it goes right to my head
All ordinary things are turning Technicolor
In her hands
And in the air around her, the heavy scent of flowers

I'm in a trance
And there's a world below her
And she makes it over
When she shows, everybody knows

(And it goes)
And it goes right to my head
There's a world below her
And she makes it over

When she shows, everybody knows
(And it goes)
And it goes right to my head
