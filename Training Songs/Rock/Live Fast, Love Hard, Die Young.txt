I wanna live fast 
Love hard 
Die young 
And leave a beautiful memory 
I wanna live fast 
Love hard 
Die young 
And leave a beautiful memory 

Don't want slow walkin' 
Or sad singin' 
Let 'em have a jubilee 
I wanna leave a lot of happy women 
A thinking pretty thoughts of me 

I wanna live fast 
Love hard 
Die young 
And leave a beautiful memory 
I got a hot-rod car 
And a cowboy suit 
And I really do get around 
I got a little black book 
And the gals look cute 
And I know the name of 
Every spot in town
I wanna find 'em 
Fool 'em 
Leave 'em 
And let 'em do the same to me 

I wanna live fast 
Love hard 
Die young 
And leave a beautiful memory

I wanna live fast 
Love hard 
Die young 
And leave a beautiful memory 
I'm a wampus cat 
Let me grab my hat 
And baby come along with me 
We're gonna do some fancy stepping 
We're really goin' on a spree 
I wanna live fast 
Love hard 
Die young 
And leave a beautiful memory 
Now you may not approve 
Of the things I do 
But it really don't bother me 
But don't ever think you can tie me down 
I'm gonna stay footloose and 
Fancy free
So jump back 
Make tracks 
Move out 
And let the pretty gals at me 

I wanna live fast l
Love hard 
Die young 
And leave a beautiful memory
