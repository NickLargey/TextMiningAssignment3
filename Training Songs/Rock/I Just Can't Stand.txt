No answers just violence
And somehow your words stay unheard
Like your name is a number
Hey mister billion sixty-four

Some people
Don't get it
They're like a one-way road
Narrow-minded
No-go! 

I just can't stand
So much selfishness
So much foolishness
Attention addicts
Fanatic fools
You're so cold

Hear them laughing their heads odd
Now we are choking on their crap
Not to mention their impoliteness
Who created social blindness

Some people
Don't get it
They're like a one-way road
Narrow-minded
No-go! 

I just can't stand
So much selfishness
So much foolishness
Attention addicts
Fanatic fools
You're so cold

I just can't stand
So much selfishness
Attention addicts
Fanatic fools today

I just can't stand
So much selfishness
So much foolishness
Attention addicts
Fanatic fools
You're so cold

I just can't stand
So much selfishness
Attention addicts
Fanatic fools today
