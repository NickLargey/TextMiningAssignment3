Spark a dog-end, roll up smoke
Before you turn to dust
Got a lot of real good friends
But no one you can trust

She draws you like a siren
To the accident once more
You're lying in your good intent
And you just ask for more

And you've been using up
Your lucky days, two at a time
The way this town can beat you down
Is such a crime

Such a jealous mistress
She knows when you're on the bone
Your accomplice and your witness
But you sold your ticket home

Like a bottle or a friend
When you hit bottom, don't bother crying
All good things come to an end
But the bad ones seem to take their time

And you've been using up
Your lucky days two at a time
The way this town can beat you down
Is such a crime

She speaks in contradictions
That can knock you to the floor
Satisfaction's her addiction
And she'll burn you to like a whore

Like a bottle or a friend
When you hit bottom, don't bother crying
All good things come to an end
But the bad ones seem to take their time

And you've been using up
Your lucky days two at a time
There was a man you could have been
But he's broken inside

And you've been using up
Your lucky days two at a time
The way this town can beat you down
Is such a crime
