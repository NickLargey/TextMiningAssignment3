Why do we worry?
Why do we doubt?
Why do we wonder when our stories don’t play out?
Why are we hoping?
This too shall pass?
Why are we waiting?
For out train come at last 
This is my best and my worst guess
We will make with pain inside of us 
With a chose to feel just enough 

A great taste to feel and take the whole thing down 
We were made with fear inside our bones 
That king that make you feel alone 
So hold your breath and figure out 
We’re not alone, this makes us feel alive 
Why do we wonder? Far into lies 
Why do we feel our hope don’t rise 
This is my best and my worst guess
We will make with pain inside of us 

With a chose to feel just enough 
A great taste to feel and take the whole thing down 
We were made with fear inside our bones 
That king that make you feel alone 
So hold your breath and figure out 
We’re not alone, this makes us feel alive 
Don’t look to me for hope 
I’m lost, I’m just like you 
Don’t look to me for freedom 

There is a real way out 
There is a real way out 
We will make with pain inside of us 
With a chose to feel just enough 
A great taste to feel and take the whole thing down 
We were made with fear inside our bones 
That king that make you feel alone 
So hold your breath and figure out 
We’re not alone, this makes us feel alive

We will make with pain inside of us 
With a chose to feel just enough 
A great taste to feel and take the whole thing down 
We were made with fear inside our bones 
That king that make you feel alone 
So hold your breath and figure out 
We’re not alone, this makes us feel alive
We’re not alone, this makes us feel alive
We’re not alone, this makes us feel alive
We’re not alone, this makes us feel alive
