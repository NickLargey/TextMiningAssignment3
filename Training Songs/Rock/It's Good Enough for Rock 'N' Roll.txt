I never saw the trouble in front of me I never 
felt the whip come down Found my suicide motel room key It took an ol' 
blind bloodhound 

My record players broken again The red lights 
flickerin' 

chorus If it's good enough for rock n' roll 
Well it's good enough for me If it's good enough for rock n' roll Well 
it's good enough for me 

Waiting for this liquor store thief Just a 
lawyer in a fake pony skin Stolen from yesterdays bleed Bring your own 
bottle of sin 

Thought I saw your silhouette Buy my alcohol 
goggles are cracked 

If it's good enough for rock n' roll Well it's 
good enough for me If it's good enough for rock n' roll Well it's good 
enough for me 

bridge Tell me how you want it I ain't getting 
down on my knees Show me how you goy it I ain't getting down on my knees 
My record players broken again The red lights flickerin' 

If it's good enough for rock n' roll Well it's 
good enough for me If it's good enough for rock n' roll Well it's good 
enough for me
