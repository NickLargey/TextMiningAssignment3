I have this feeling inside me that I've always tried to hide
This feeling has never ended, didn't ever subside
I realized that keeping it would only cause me pain
So I tried to forget about it but the feeling only remained

Tell me will I ever survive
Stop my tears and keep it inside
Holding back myself from being close to you

Here I am all alone so lost and full of confusion
Not knowing how to help myself arrive at a decision
I can't get you out of my mind

I don't know what to do
It's this feeling that's ever growing
It's this feeling I feel for you

Tell me will I ever survive
Stop my tears and keep it inside
Holding back myself from being close to you

Will I ever wake up from this dream
I'm going through
