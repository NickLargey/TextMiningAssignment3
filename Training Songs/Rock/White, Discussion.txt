I talk of freedom 
You talk of the flag 
I talk of revolution 
You'd much rather brag 
And as the decibels of this disenchanting discourse 
Continue to dampen the day

The coin flips again and again, and again, and again 
As our sanity walks away
All this discussion though politically correct
Is dead beyond destruction 
Though it leaves me quite erect 

And as the final sunset rolls behind the earth 
And the clock is finally dead 
I'll look at you, you'll look at me 
And we'll cry a lot 
But this will be what we said 
This will be what we said

Look where all this talking got us, baby
