Hello, again, hello
Just called to say hello
I couldn't sleep at all tonight
And I know it's late
I couldn't wait

Hello, my friend, hello
Just called to let you know
I think about you every night
When I'm here alone
And you're there at home
Hello

Maybe it's been crazy
And maybe I'm to blame
But I put my heart above my head
We've been through it all and you love me just the same
And when your not there
I just need to hear

Hello, my friend, hello
It's good to need you so
It's good to love you like I do
And I feel this way when I hear you say
Hello

Hello, my friend, hello
Just called to let you know
I think about you every night
And I know it's late but I could't wait
Hello
