Your arms rest upon my shoulders
You're hypnotized
Never try to break my stare

Put your mouth on mine
Your back arched low
Your skin feels tight
A sudden urge within
Pulsate, pulsate
You and I begin
To tango skin to skin

[Chorus:]
Feel the drama rise
Look deep into my eyes
Let's tango, we tango
Let the rhythm spin you
Feel it deep within you
Let's tango, let's tango

Let's tango
We tango
You and me tango!
Tango! Tango!

I...race your figure in the darkness
Your body heat breathing deep in danger

Wrap your fingertips
'Round the back of my neck
Your eyes shut tight
My cigarette 
Tastes sweet
Heartbeat, heartbeat
You and I begin
To tango skin to skin

[Chorus:]

Whisper 'til we scream
Our shadows in the moonbeam
Let's tango, we tango
Surrender your alarm
And fall into my arms
Let's tango, let's tango

Let's tango
We tango
You and me tango!
Tango! Tango!

When the rhythm's real slow
And our bodies feel close
You wanna put your mouth on mine
Wanna put your mouth on mine
Feel the drama rise
Look deep into my eyes

Let's tango...
