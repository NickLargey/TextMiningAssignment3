About what's it gonna be,
If you don't like my peaches then don't shake the tree.
Maybe it's sad but it's easy,
The sick ship rolls, it takes a little to please me.
Go cross me off your list,
No use to be a part of a world that don't exist.
I'm giving up the fight,
I never getting paid but somewhere there's a light

I couldn't care less
'Bout sunny or shine
I couldn't care less
What broke me this time
I couldn't care less
That's why I'm drummin' it out
I couldn't care less
That's all I care about
Such a good drama, oh oh
Such a good drama, oh oh oh
I couldn't care less that's all I care about

If I am bored though I'm bound
Maybe I'm lost but I don't need to be found
My dreams don't match my pay
I'll be resting in my cage and forever's just a day
But why, where and how
F*ck the past, the past ain't now
'Cause I ain't got the time
Some things could be better but there's too much on mind

I couldn't care less
'Bout sunny or shine
I couldn't care less
What broke me this time
I couldn't care less
That's why I'm drummin' it out
I couldn't care less, that's all I care about
Such a good drama, oh oh
Such a good drama, oh oh oh
I couldn't care less, that's all I care about

I couldn't care less
'Bout sunny or shine
I couldn't care less
What broke me this time
I couldn't care less, that's why I'm drummin' it out
Couldn't care less, that's all I care about

I couldn't care less
'Bout sunny or shine
I couldn't care less
What broke me this time
I couldn't care less that's why I'm drummin' it out
I couldn't care less, that's all I care about
Such a good drama, oh oh
Such a good drama, oh oh oh
I couldn't care less, that's all I care about

Oh oh
Oh oh oh

Oh oh
Oh oh oh

Oh oh
Oh oh oh

Oh oh
Oh oh oh
