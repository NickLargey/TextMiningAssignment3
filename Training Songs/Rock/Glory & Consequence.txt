I'm more afraid of living
Than I am scared to die
I'm more afraid of falling
Than I am of flying high

Every moral has a story
Every story has an end
Every battle has its glory
And its consequence

I'm more afraid of loving
Than I am of being scorned
But I will keep on trying
Though I have been forewarned

Every moral has a story
Every story has an end
Every battle has its glory
And its consequence

I would rather me be lonely
And you have someone to hold
I'm not as scared of dying
As I am of growing old.

Every moral has a story
Every story has an end
Every battle has its glory
And its consequence
