Monday morning feels so bad
Everybody seems to nag me
Come on Tuesday, I feel better
Even my old man looks good

Wednesday just won't go
Thursday goes too slow
I've got Friday on my mind

I'm gonna have fun in the city
I'll be with my girl, she's so pretty
She looks fine tonight
She is outta sight to me

Tonight, I'll spend my bread
Tonight, I'll lose my head
Tonight, I've got to get tonight
Monday, I have Friday on my mind

Do the five day drag once more
No one, nothing else that bugs me
Now I'm working for the rich man
Hey, I'll change that scene one day

Tonight, I'll might get mad
Tomorrow I'll be glad
'Cause I've got Friday on my mind

I'm gonna have fun in the city
Be with my girl, she's so pretty
She looks fine tonight
She is outa' sight to me

Tonight, I'll spend my bread
Tonight, I'll lose my head
Tonight, I've got to get tonight
Monday, I have Friday on my mind

I'm gonna have fun in the city
I'll be with my girl, she's so pretty
I'm gonna have fun in the city
I'll be with my girl, she's so pretty
I'm gonna have fun in the city
