I took a step back as the room was filling up
I was packed up against some people who were tossing up a strong vibe
Now the door's locked
And the shower's on.
And I realize I don't recognize anyone,
But I don't mind
Well the neighbors have complained damn near every night.

You should of shown up
Should of shown up by now
You should of shown up by now
Give it a rest. Give it a rest
With a knock at the door,
The knock at the door as it goes
Whoa

Well now everybody's losing control!
Intoxicated circulation
Just try and sit back, get my palette wet,
Getting mentally prepared for the consequences
And you know why
Because that knock at the door
Calls the crowd to quiet.
The neighbors have complained damn near every night.

You should of shown up
Should of shown up by now
You should of shown up by now
Give it a rest. Give it a rest
With a knock at the door,
The knock at the door as it goes
Whoa

There's no one left lying on the second story floorboards
And I'm sure they heard next door
The bottles are hollow now
And there's room at the bottom
And I would take it back
If I could, but I won't!

You should of shown up
Should of shown up by now
You should of shown up by now
Give it a rest. Give it a rest
With a knock at the door,
The knock at the door as it goes
Whoa
