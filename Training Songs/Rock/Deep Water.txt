Every so often the things I need
Never seemed to be around
Every so often, I pick up speed
Trouble is I'm going down

And I'm in deep water
Wishing like a kid again
Yes, I'm in deep water
Won't somebody come on in
To my life and love me

Gotta be something inside of me
Making it a lazy day
Getting down under the height of me
Sure that there's another way

To swim in deep water
It seems I'm a kid again
Back in that deep water
I wish somebody'd come on in
To my life and love me

Now it's so easy to go uptown
But I never get things done
One mistake and I'm going down
Like to get away but I can't 

I run in deep water
It seems that I'm a kid again
Back in that deep water
Won't somebody come on in
To my life and love me

I'm in that deep water
Wishing like a kid again
Back in that deep water
Won't somebody come on in
To my life and love me

Yeah, love me
