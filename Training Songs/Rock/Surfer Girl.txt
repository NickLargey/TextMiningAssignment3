I was at the beach, 
Sitting on the sand 
When I saw this girl 
Dark brown eyes, and a dark olive tan 
She was watching the sets 
With a surfboard underneath her arm 
The first moment I saw her 
I knew she'd do me some harm 
She's so good 
She came out of the water 
From the best session I'd seen 
Man, she had the biggest chi chis I had ever seen 
She put down her board, 
And sat down next to me 
And played a soft ole lonely tune, 
On her ukulele 
I don't know what had happened 
But I'd fallen asleep 
The next morning I woke up 
She was sleeping next to meÂ  

[Chorus]
I fell in love with her 
I'm so in love with her 
I fell in love with her 
My little Surfer GirlÂ  

She got out of bed 
Waxed up both our boards 
Grabbed me by the hand and then 
She took me out the door 
We surfed all that day long 
At least eight hours straight 
Man! I knew she was the one 
And damn I couldn't wait 
Well I asked if she loved me 
She said, "Yeah well I guess" 
So I asked her to marry me 
Dammit, you know she said "yes"Â  

[Chorus]Â  

I was at the alter 
In my tuxedo-o-o 
Waiting for my Surfer Girl 
Man, where did she go 
Later on that day 
A friend to me did tell-ell-ell 
That she went to Mexico 
To catch a, to Catch a, 
To catch a 10 foot swell 
That BitchÂ  

[Chorus] 

My Surfer Girl
