I'm picking up my baby tonight
Though her daddy's makin' troubles it'll be alright
I'm working hard, I don't know why
I'm like a working class dog and I just get by
Chorus:
Tonite I'm crawling out from in it, and though we're living on a brink
Second by second by minute by minute
Love is alright tonite, we're gonna be alright
Love is alright, love is alright tonite
Everyone's saying the sky's gonna fall
Don't know where it's gonna stop if it stops at all
I know the world's going crazy alright
I hope it holds together for one more night
chorus
Don't worry daddy, I'll have her home at a respectable hour
Go to sleep, daddy, you won't think about tonight
With the night comes the feeling that I've got this incredible power
Gonna love her, daddy, she'll be feeling it tonite, alright
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright
Love is alright tonite and baby, we're gonna be alright
Love is alright, love is alright tonite
