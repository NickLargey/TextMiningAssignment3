Who's that knockin' on my door?
(Old man trouble)
I know you've been here before
(Old man trouble)

You called my good girl to leave home
(Old man trouble)
She left me sitting here all alone
(Old man trouble)

I can tell it's you by the way you knock
So my door gonna stay locked
You're just bidin' your time
Cause you ain't no friend of mine

Trouble, go away from my door
(Old man trouble)
And don't you never come back no more
(Old man trouble)
