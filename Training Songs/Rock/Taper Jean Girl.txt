Aha shake taper jean girl with a motel face
Aha shake bury your eyes in a secret place
Aha shake black as night on a Sunday

Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher

Heartbreak knocking' 'em down like the seventh grade
Heartbreak, cigarettes and songs, with a winter's chafe
Heartbreak keep like my daughter and a run away

Aha shake tapered jean girl kills me
