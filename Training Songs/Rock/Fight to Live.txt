Tonight we're alone and the music is right
Do you feel good do you feel alright tonight?
I'm out on the streets tonight I'm with a few
friends so it feel alright. Shouting out loud
to this doesn't do it. If it doesn't sink in
then i say screw it. Same old vices not much to
dream about is there anything left to fight about.
Fighting to live is the only fight I've got left in me
I've never been the same since that last show
I close my eyes and let myself go to a place
I'm never alone or scared Somehow i had a reason
a reason to care. I get so lost in it..

Live to fight - Fight to live
Tonight were alone and the music is right
do you feel good do you feel alright?
Tonight were alone and the music is right
do you feel good do you feel alright?

I'm on the train and I've got my phones
People all around but I'm good all alone
I won't worry what i need to be
wherever i am is the place to be
Tonight were alone and the music is right

do you feel good do you feel alright?
Tonight were alone and the music is right
do you feel good do you feel alright?
we feel good we feel alright tonight
