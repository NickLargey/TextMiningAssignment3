Inevitability 
Is pounding at my door
Screaming for more
In a world that owes you nothing
You give everything
Everything

Now I'm caught in between
What I can't leave behind 
And what I may never find
So fly one time
Fly one time

Standing
At the edge of your life
At the edge of our lives
Don't hold on, there's no fighting back the years
It's so hard to unlearn fears

Now that you're caught between
What you can't leave behind
And all that you may never find
So fly, just fly
Just fly one time

I see you so clearly, so clearly up so high
I see you up so clearly, up so clearly high
Now you're caught in between
What you can't leave behind
And what we may never find
So fly, so fly one time
So clearly, so clearly
So high, fly one time
Just fly one time
If you'd fly one time
