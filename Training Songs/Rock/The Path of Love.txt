Well come on,
follow down the Path of Love.
Come on little children
gather 'round me and hear what I say,
To lead the life you should,
you got to strive to be good ev'ry day.
You can brighten the dark
with a light in your heart,
that'll shine like the sun above,
So come on,
follow down the Path of Love.
Come on, ev'rybody together.
Come on, let me show you the way.
Come on, we can do much better,
follow down the Path of Love.
Come on, ev'rybody together.
Come on, let me show you the way.
Come on, we can do much better,
follow down the Path of Love.
Believe there is someone who loves you,
no matter what.
You can count your blessings
and be happy with whatever you've got.
Won't you brighten the dark
with a light in your heart,
you better shine like the sun above,
So come on,
follow down the Path of Love.
Come on, ev'rybody together.
Come on, let me show you the way.
Come on, we can do much better,
follow down the Path of Love.
Come on, ev'rybody together.
Come on, let me show you the way.
Come on, we can do much better,
follow down the Path of Love.
