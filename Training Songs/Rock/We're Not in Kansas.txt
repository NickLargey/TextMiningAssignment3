What did you learn in school today
Did you learn to run when the teachers pray
Did they teach you enough to know the state you're in
Not enough to get out, not enough to win
What did you learn at home today
Did you learn to hate in the proper way
Did your liberated parents patronize your friends
'Cause they had enough money, 'cause they had the right skin
I wander 'round thinking, well, what kind of place is this
Well maybe it's in the parks, maybe it's in the stores
But I know if we're being honest, it's in the people
But they're all caught up in the traffic
Listening to the weather
Well dog, I know we're not in Kansas, the sky's all colored wrong
I know we're not in Kansas, the days are all too long
I sure don't understand this, that's what you're howling for
I know we're not in Kansas, Kansas anymore
What did you learn in your job today
Did you learn to sleep while the boss is away
Did you shut your mouth when he called you down
'Cause there's not much work in that kind of town
I wander around thinking, well what kind of place is this
Where they say hey well what did you do in the war
And I ask well hey man well what did you do with the peace
Well we built these real safe weapons, so we could sleep with ease
Well dog, I know we're not in Kansas, the sky's all colored wrong
I know we're not in Kansas, the days are all too long
I sure don't understand this, that's what you're howling for
I know we're not in Kansas, Kansas anymore
Well what kind of place is this
On the wrong side of the rainbow where the twisters never come
And they tore up all the yellow bricks and they sold them to Japan
And still the advertisers tell you, hey, there's no place like home
Well dog, I know we're not in Kansas, the sky's all colored wrong
I know we're not in Kansas, the days are all too long
I sure don't understand this, that's what you're howling for
I know we're not in Kansas, Kansas anymore
I know we're not in Kansas, the sky's all colored wrong
I know we're not in Kansas, the days are all too long
I sure don't understand this, that's what you're howling for
I know we're not in Kansas, Kansas anymore
