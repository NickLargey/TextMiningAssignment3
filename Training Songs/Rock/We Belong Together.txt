You're mine and we belong together
Yes, we belong together for all eternity
You're mine, your lips belong to me
Yes, they belong to only me for all eternity

You're mine, my ba-a-by and you-ou will always be
I swear by everything I own you'll always, always be mine
(Mine, mine, be mine)

You're mine and we belong together
Yes, we belong together for all eternity
