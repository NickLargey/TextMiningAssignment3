Days confused 
My heart's abused 
I wake up alone 
I see coffee cups and washing up 
Reality is home 

My head is spinning so fast 
Will this hangover pass 
I don’t want to be lonely 
You left the world from above 
And I believe that no heart 
Is meant to find someone 

Hungry for love 
And tired of frustration 
Thirsty for something else 
I’m empty inside, I need a sensation 
Falling completely out of myself 

Life amaze 
I’m lost today 
I’m blowing away 
How do you find your destiny 
Is there anybody out there 

So now I’m driving to fast 
Hear the radio blast 
All the worries from my head 
Feel like I’m losing control 
Looks like I’m ready to go 
Yes I’ll find someone 

Hungry for love 
And tired of frustration 
Thirsty for something else 
I’m empty inside, I need a sensation 
Falling completely out of myself 

Ooo… nothing could be better 
Than taking all the missing pieces 
And make this picture last forever 

Yeahheayeahhh… 
Hungry for love 
And tired of frustration 
Thirsty for something else 
I’m empty inside, I need a sensation 
Falling completely 

Oooo.. Hungry for love 
And tired of frustration 
Thirsty for something else 
I’m empty inside, I need a sensation 
Falling completely out of myself 

Yeahheayeahhh yeahh.. 
I’m hungry for love now.. 
Yeahheayeahhh yeahh.. 
I’m hungry for love, I’m out of time.. 
Yeahheayeahhh yeahh.. 
Yeahheayeahhh yeahh..
