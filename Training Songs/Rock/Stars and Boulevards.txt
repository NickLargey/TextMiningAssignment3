Wait, dear
White horse is walking down my
Street here
Your words are creeping at my feet
I fear
That sunrise will come too soon and you'll
Disappear
To the haze of a city and yourself
Oh no

Look out
They're coming after us with big guns
They're only going to tell you all the bad things I've done
Even if the words they say aren't true
They've won
Now I'm left here dying in the sun

Whoa
Seem like I'm only coming
Seem like I'm never coming
Seem like in my eyes I'm at
I bet all the stars and boulevards
Aren't close enough to you

Late nights
Won't do me justice
When I drink I
Just get so damn depressed
And it's, it's not like
I ain't trying to get over you
It's just hard to look at all the seasons pass me all the time
And I said

Whoa
Seem like I'm only coming
Seem like I'm never coming
Seem like in my eyes I'm at
I bet all the stars and boulevards
Aren't close enough to you

One last
Phone call from you
It wouldn't hurt much
I just like to hear your voice
And pretend to touch
Any inch of you that hasn't said it all or read it all
I sung my life away
And I say

Whoa
Seem like I'm only coming
Seem like I'm never coming
Seem like in my eyes I'm at
All the stars and boulevards
Aren't close enough to you (seem like I'm only coming)
All the stars and boulevards
Aren't close enough to you (seem like I'm never coming)
All the stars and boulevards
Aren't close enough to you (seem like I'm only coming)
All the stars and boulevards
Aren't close enough to you
