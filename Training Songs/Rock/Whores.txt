Way down 
Low where the streets are littered
I find my fun with the freaks and the niggers
I don't want much man, give a little 
Or I'm gonna take my chances if I get 'em
Hear me go off!
Give me some more!
Motherfucker!
Need a little more
Goddamn you!
Give me some more!
Motherfucker!
Give me some more!
You give me breadcrumb - 
Uh huhI'm tired of living the boss' dream
They'll squeeze you dry man, if you let 'em
Better take your - take your - take your chances
If you get 'em
Hear me go off!
Give me some more!
Motherfucker!
Need a little more
Goddamn you!
Give me some more!
Motherfucker!
Give me some more!
