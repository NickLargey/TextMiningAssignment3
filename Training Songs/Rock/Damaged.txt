My name's Henry
And you're here with me now
My life
It's a song, ah
You're just, you won't even let it happen
You won't
You won't let
Damaged, by attack
I'm even attacking my mind
But you don't mind
'Cause this schedule thirteen
You just sit, down
Buy their ticket
Wait your turn

Aah, aah
Aah, aah
Aah, aah
Aah, aah
Aah, can't feel another day
Can't, can't get past you
I can't see nothin', I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
Hold out your hand to me
Give me your hand
Aah, I'll bite it off!!

Damaged!
Damaged!
Damaged!

Oh
I, I don't even care about self-destruction anymore
What's the use?
I just sit at home alone
Cold fingers, gold fingers, in a cold sweat
And then I remember
I remember a day
We'd go for a ride in the country
And you'd say
Sing it boy!
Do it again
Do it again
Yes sir!
Yes sir!
Yes sir, yes sir oh yes sir yes sir yes, aah
Aah

Right, now, look at me, now
Look at me now
Just shadows
I'm just shadows of what I was
I just want another day
I don't even get by for that
How much is it to ask for, how, how, aah?

Damaged
Ooh, aah

Ah, I'm sorry, my friend, I just, I just can't
Listen, everything's nice
Well, it's nice and cool here where I am
It's nice and tight
It's my mind
It's my mind where it's all dark
And no one comes in
Nobody comes in
Damaged
My damage
No one comes in
Stay out!
