You can never give
The finger to the blind
Sometimes I act so stupid
But you never seem to mind
That's no way to be
Laughing at the deaf
I know that I repeat myself
When I got nothing left

But you know
Hidden thoughts
Poison life, poison life
Yeah you know

Hidden feelings
You steal from yourself
Soho has the boots
Noho's got the crack
New England has the foliage
But I'm not goin back

You tell me that I'm good
I know that I was bad
You made me feel so guilty
I can't remember what I had

But you know
Hidden thoughts
Poison life, poison life
Yeah you know
Hidden feelings
You steal from yourself
