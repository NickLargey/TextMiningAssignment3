Well this is true I miss you
And this is true I've got to see you,
I've got to see you
Well I know we're both so busy
And I know that you're driving me crazy,
You drive me crazy

It's been two whole years
And three months before that
Since we first met, how could I forget
When we first met, how could I forget

You know it's all my fault
And this is true you're gonna get mad
Whenever I've been bad
I've got to make it up to you
One white rose or one sweet song for you
Anything for you

It's been two whole years
And three months before that
Since we first met, how could I forget
When we first met, how could I forget

I'm a fool if I think that I deserve you
I'm pretty foolish anyway
I've been planning to hold on to you
And so far things have, things have gone my way
So far things have, things have gone my way, my way

When we first met, how could I forget
When we first met, how could I forget
When we first met, how could I forget
Forget, when we first met
