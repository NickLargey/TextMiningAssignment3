I’ve known men who have had love but threw it away
For a moment with the wrong kind of girl
I’ll admit that I’ve been tempted but I’m happy to say
There’s a whole lot of love in my world

You can look out your window to the bright lights below
You can see it’s a temptation’s game
Well I’ve looked out my window to the bright lights below
And I don’t feel that I’ve missed a thing

How a man can be tempted is a mystery to me
For a moment with the wrong kind of girl
Well I guess that I’ve been lucky but I’m happy you see 
There’s a whole lot of love in my world
There’s a whole lot of love in my world
