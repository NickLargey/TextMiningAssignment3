There's no way out of here
When you come in you're in for good

There was no promise made
The part you played the chance you took
There are no boundaries set
But time and yet you waste it still

So it slips through your hands
Like grains of sand you watch it go
There's no time to be lost
You'll pay the cost so get it right

There's no way out of here
When you come in you're in for good
And never was there an answer, there an answer
Not without listening without seeing

There are no answers here
When you look out you don't see in
There was no promise made
The part you played the chance you took

There's no way out of here
When you come in you're in for good
And never was there an answer, there an answer
Not without listening without seeing

There's no way out of here
When you come in you're in for good
There are no answers here
When you look out you don't see in
There was no promise made
The part you played the chance you took

There's no way out of here

There's no way out of here
