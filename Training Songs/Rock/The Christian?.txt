[Chorus]
It's a hell of a time to be thinking about heaven
Didn't you forget the golden rule
You've been acting like Jesus owes you a favor
But he's a little smart for you to fool

You complain how you forgets the gospel
You remind them seek and you shall find
Maybe youth will have a time for seeking
After they clean up what you left behind

[Chorus]

You were right there when the plate was passed last Sunday
That's the second time you've been to church all year
Could you really call yourself a Christian
If charity cost half as much as beer
Hey

You pray a little more as you grow older
You get religion as your hair turns gray
But you don't need to worry about hereafter
Just worry what you're going to do today

[Chorus]
