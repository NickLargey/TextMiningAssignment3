Some of us are wild ones, ever under wanted, 
I believe

Lining up in the background,
Waiting for the crap shot to be seen

In the shadow of the big screen,
Everybody begs to be redeemed

Hey, I'm not Synthetica
I'll keep the life that I've got

We were never meant to crawl in for the bait,
We never will

I can think for myself,
I've got something no pill could ever kill

Hey, I'm not Synthetica, oh
I'll keep the life that I've got, oh
So hard, hard to resist Synthetica, oh
No drug is stronger than me, Synthetica

We're all the time confined to fit the mold
But I won't ever let them make a loser of my soul

Hey, I'm not Synthetica, oh
I'll keep the life that I've got, oh
I'll keep the life that I've got
I'll keep the life that I've got
I'll keep the life that I've got
