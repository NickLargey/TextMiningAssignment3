Learning what I am
Feeling like a bluebird
Flying away

I love the drops of rain
Smiling on my feathers
Guiding my way

Do, do do do do (x4)
I trip across the air
It's treating me so kindly
So far to go
So I flew unto a tree
Gather inspiration

Happy to meet
(All the other birds) x4

We talk about our flight
In this queer dimension
And how we're afraid
To carry on our own
And finish our direction
Flying home

(All the other birds) x4
Like me
