Heard you talk about leavin'
Heard you talk about leavin' before
Heard you talk about givin' up on me
Heard you talk about changin'
But talk is cheap and I've heard it all before
It used to be that I'd fall apart
But that don't work no more
Cause you can't leave half way
And I can't let you stay

[Chorus]
Take your promise
Take your pain
Take your restless heart
If you go
Go all the 
Don't look back
Cause in my heart you've been gone so long
I won't miss you that bad
If you go
Go all the way
Don't look back

She asked me why I'm not crying
Cause I did all of my crying before
I took off my pretty party dress
And I don't dance no more
I don't need someone else
To make me feel myself

Take your promise
Take your pain
Take your restless heart
If you go 
Go all the way
Don't look back
Cause in my heart you've been gone so long
That I won't miss you that bad
If you go
Go all the way
Don't look back

If you go 
Go all the way
Don't look back

If you go 
Go all the way
Don't look back

(Don't look back)

[Chorus]

Heard you talk about leavin'
Oh I heard you talk about leavin' before
