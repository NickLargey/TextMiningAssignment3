(m. crenshaw)

The dead of night and I'm all alone, yeah
I got my hand on the telephone
I've got to get ahold of you, 'cause when I do
I tell you something's gonna happen
Now just forget about your boyfriend, yeah
And I'll forget about my girlfriend
Come over and I'll show you how, I need you now
I said something's gonna happen
Aw baby, baby, baby
You know you really really wreck my nerves
You got my head goin' round and my feet off the ground
(you got me hangin' on the telephone)
Now we're all alone with the lights on down low, yeah
Rockin' music on the radio
It's just the way it ought to be, and momentarily
I tell you something's gonna happen
