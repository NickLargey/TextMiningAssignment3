For every woman you will leave an open door
You find yourself thinking why can't I have more? 
You say there's nothing you can do
You tried your best but you were only being you
Oh no
She's gone
Back wherever she came from
You watched
Her go
Your reaction's far too slow

Run aground
Run aground
Run aground

You don't know what you've got until you've lost it all
Might I suggest you find a softer place to fall
You take for granted all the riches of your world
You may have oysters but you'll never find a pearl

Oh no
She's gone
Back wherever she came from
You watched
Her go
Your reaction's far too slow

Oh no
She's gone
Back wherever she came from
You watched
Her go
Your reaction's far too slow

Run aground
Run aground
Run aground
Run aground
Run aground
Run aground

She's moving on
The love has gone
You left the door wide open
She's moving on
The just has gone
This anger's felt not spoken
It got too old
Was too controlled
Could have gone on forever

The love has gone
She's moving on
When she said now you never

Run aground
Run aground
Run aground
Run aground
Run aground
Run aground
Run aground
Run aground
Run aground
Run aground
Run aground
Run aground

Oh no
