I had a dream you died
And I just wanna be with you tonight
Mission bells were ringing
Somewhere higher
I let you get away
I let you get away

What kind of man misunderstands
A woman like you?
She's her in black and white
It's 5 am and the phonebook says
That you're not alone
In the cold grey morning light
The only one that's left to trust
My faithless heart wasted us

I had a dream you died
And I just wanna be with you tonight
Mission bells were ringing
Somewhere higher
I let you get away
I let you get away

What kind of fool thinks love's a prison
Or a handicap
Only says goodbye
Sinking fast in the rocky waters of alcatraz
His friends said suicide
The only one that's left to trust
My faithless heart wasted us

I had a dream you died
And I just wanna be with you tonight
Mission bells were ringing
Somewhere higher
I let you get away
I let you get away

I'm the end of a hitchcock movie
A little dark and a lot confusing
I'm the last of the worst pretenders
So lost, so lost in love
I'm the end of a hitchcock movie
A little dark and a lot confusing
I'm the last of the worst pretenders
So lost, so lost in love

I had a dream you died
And I just wanna be with you tonight
Mission bells were ringing
Somewhere higher
I let you get away
I let you get away
So lost, so lost, in love
So lost, so lost, in love
