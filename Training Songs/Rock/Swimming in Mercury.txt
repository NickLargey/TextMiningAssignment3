I was a boy in suburbia
You showed the future to me
Skinny and pale
My get out of jail
Swimmin' in mercury

And you were the ultraviolet
On our new color TV
The constant, the change
The never the same
Swimmin' in mercury

What a beautiful way
What a beautiful way
To say
Goodbye

What a beautiful way
What a beautiful way
To say
Goodbye

So many mothers and fathers
Said "Is it a he or a she?"
We didn't care
We went everywhere
Swimmin' in mercury

What a beautiful way
What a beautiful way
To say
Goodbye

What a beautiful way
What a beautiful way
To say
Goodbye

It's hard to believe that you're gone now
It's good to know you're free
There at the heart
Between nature and art
Swimmin' in mercury
