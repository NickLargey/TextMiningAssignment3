You were calling out from the underground
You had lots of big ideas but no one can hear them now
They riddled you with guilt
They tempted you with wealth
They twisted all your words
They made you hate yourself

So now you do your schtick, a loyal patriot
And you toe the party line even though it makes you sick
They gave you talking points
They taught you double-speak
They forced you into war
By saying you were weak

They signed your checks til they had you in the bag
They scared you blind then draped you in a flag
Made you a man at Ft. Bragg

You'll do good business as an apologist
If you exaggerate their facts, if you perpetuate their myths
They made activism trite
They made honor optional
They made propaganda news
They made science radical

They pulled your teeth til you smiled and agreed
They slit you throat and buried you at sea
All for the land of the free
