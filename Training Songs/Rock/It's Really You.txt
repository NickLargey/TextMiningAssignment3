Did you ever have a plan, dream
Think it would be right for you

For a moment in your life, believe
Heaven would decide for you

That a feeling deep inside will guide you

To a love you'll treasure it's you and I forever
Keep on believing

It's really you, It's really me,
We're all the things we ever wanted to be
The time is right and you're here tonight
So hold my hand and know that you'll understand

If there is something on your mind, a need
And you feel you want to shake it

Let it go let it fall, leave it
You don't have to chase it

'Cos there's a new world all around you that's so good
Darling then it's made for you ther's nothing more you need to do

It's really you, It's really me,
We're all the things we ever wanted to be
The time is right and you're here tonight
So hold my hand and know that you'll understand

Our love, love that I've tasted
Now there is love and I aint gonna waste it
Like I did before
Now I know it's really you it's me

It's really you it's me

It's really you it's me

You and I

You and I

It's really you it's really me,
We're all the things we ever wanted to be
The time is right and you're here tonight
So hold my hand and know that you'll understand

It's really you it's really me

The time is right and you're here tonight

It's really you it's really me
