If you can see me
You can save my skin
I could trust you
If you could see me within

Is this the way you see yourself
Is this the way you've never been wrong
Is this the way you work yourself
Is this the way you come undone

Is this the way you see yourself
Is this the way you've never been wrong
Is this the way you hurt yourself
Is this the way you come undone

This is war
This is strange fruit
This is the end of me
This is the end of you
This is war
This is war

If you can free your mind
If you could loose the chains that chain
If you could walk through the mine fields of history
What we came to be

Is this the way you see yourself
Is this the way you've never been wrong
Is this the way you hurt yourself
Is this the way you come undone

This is war
This is strange fruit
This is the end of me
This is the end of you
This is war
This'll be televised
This is how we live
This is how we die
This is war
This is war

No

They can try to break it down
Water beats rocks
They can try to break you down
Water beats rocks
They can try to break it down
Water beats rocks
They can try to break you down

This is war
This is strange fruit
This is the end of me
This is the end of you
This is war
This'll be televised
This is how we live
This is how we die
No more war
This is how we die
No more war
This is how we die

This is how we die
This is war
This is war
This is war
This is war
