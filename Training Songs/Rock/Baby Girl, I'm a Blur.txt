Baby girl, I'm a blur
I spoiled, stunted, sickened her
God and Death are none of my concern
I'm no philosopher
Deep in your heart, stitched the key
And only one can set me free from the beast
Where I dwell and let the saints all burn in hell

[Chorus:]
So take what you want from me, (I'm on my way) hey
And take all I've got from me, (I'm on my way) hey
You're with me all the time
The drugs can have my mind, love
You own the rest you'll find
And you're with me all the time

On the roof, burning black
The city smoked from the attack
But on the roof, we love the beast to death
The sweat and whiskey breath

[Chorus]

We fall right down
We get back up again
Thats how we be
You and me
I would not crowd,
I would not smother you
I'd let you breathe, over me

We're on a sinking ship, but we're escaping it
We're on a sinking ship, but we're escaping 
We're on a sinking ship, but we're escaping it
We're on a sinking ship, we're escaping 

You're with me all the time
You're with me all the time
You're with me all the time
You're with me all the time

No matter where I go you're on my mind
I stumble home and pray I'll find
With your flamethrower eyes and jilted smile
You'll soothe my wounds and drain my bile

You're with me all the time
