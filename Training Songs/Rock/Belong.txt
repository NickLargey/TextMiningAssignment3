What to do
Nothing new
We tried each other
Let's try another

When you came
Through the door
I felt everything
And nothing that I had before

Tell yourself
It's not yourself
But no one else
Can make me know there's no one else

When you came
Through the door
I was sure
You never even felt the floor

I know
It is wrong
But we just don't belong
In your eyes
In the sun
No we just don't belong

Change your mind
And stop the time
That comes between us
That bends beneath us

If you're mine
I don't mind
We tried another
Let's try each other

I know
It is wrong
But we just don't belong
In your eyes
In the sun
No we just don't belong

In hospitals
In shopping malls
With heavy heads
And locker walls

An empty street
At three a.m.
You told me you're not one of them

We took a vow
To never sleep
While there was still air left to breathe

And you're the same
So slightly strange
Among the fakes you knew the pains

I know
It is wrong
But we just don't belong
In your eyes
In the sun
No we just don't belong

I know
It is wrong
But we just don't belong
In your eyes
In the sun
No we just don't belong

We just don't belong
We just don't belong
We just don't belong
Don't belong
Don't belong
We just don't belong
Don't belong
Don't belong
We just don't belong
Don't belong
Don't belong
We just don't belong
