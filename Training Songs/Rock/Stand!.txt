Stand!
In the end you'll still be you
One that's done all the things you set out to do
Stand!
There's a cross for you to bear
Things to go through if you're going anywhere

Stand!
For the things you know are right
It's the truth that the truth makes them so uptight
Stand!
All the things you want are real
You have you to complete and there is no deal

Stand! Stand! Ooh!
Stand! Stand! Ooh!
Ooo ooo stand!

You've been sitting much too long
There's a permanent crease in your right and wrong
Stand
There's a midget standing tall
And a giant beside him about to fall

Stand! Stand! Ooh!
Stand! Stand! Ooh!
Ooo ooo stand!

They will try to make you crawl
And they know what you're saying makes sense and all
Stand!
Don't you know that you are free
Well at least in your mind if you want to be

Everybody
Stand! Stand!
