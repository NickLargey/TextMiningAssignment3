Sorry I've got things to do and say
I've listened long enough today
I'll keep my things In my control
But there's information you withhold
And I've heard everything you said about tradition
And everything they say to you It must be true, to you

And you can keep your good intentions
You can have your point of view
And I will listen very closely
Just don't try and change mine

Who controls everything I see
What I know you dictate to me
I'll change the station And the way
I see things told to me in rays
I've heard everything you said about tradition
And everything they say to you It must be true, to you

And you can keep your good intentions
You can have your point of view
And I will listen very closely
Just don't try and change mine

And you can keep your good intentions
You can have your point of view
And I will listen very closely
Just don't try and change mine

What I know you dictate to me
What I know you dictate
What I know you dictate to me
What I know you dictate
Who controls everything I see
What I know you dictate to me
What I know you dictate to me
