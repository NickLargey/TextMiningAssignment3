You take my money you slap my face
You take my money you take my place
You take my money just get up and go
You take my money and my fuckin' sad show

You take my money
You take my money
You take my money

You take my money you mess me around
You take my money all seven pounds
You take my money for little kicks
You take my money make me feel real sick

You take my money honey
You take my money
You take my money

You take my money baby
But don't be funny baby
I can get hard if you make me fight
You suck my honey baby
Oh take my honey
I don't need you
You know I'm right alright

You take my money honey
You take my money

You take my money you slap my face
You take my money you take my place
You take my money just get up and go
You take my money and my fuckin' sad show

You take my money
You take my money honey
You take my money
