The autumn leaves
Me here without a tooth
You've given me the shaft
My friend's car's breaking down
And I've got no ride home

And I'm left out
The apes in the evergreens
The grape leaves and jasmine tea
Comforts you, without me
Without me

And I am none the wiser for it all
Your voice is shaky on the telephone call
You ride your little Pinto in the rain

And you stall out
With no one to give you a jump
Just hook your cables to me
And then you'll see
That I can start you up
That I can start you up

It's closing time in town
There's not a soul around 
To see you when you're down
To see you when you're down

And I am none the wiser for it all
Your voice is shaky on the telephone call
You ride your little Pinto in the rain

When I think of all you've done
Take your Pinto for a run
I see you're the wiser one
You're the wiser one, you're the wiser one

When I think of all we've done
And the rain soaks up the sun
I see we're the wiser ones
We're the wiser ones, we're the wiser ones

And you know you're beholden
To no one but me
And you know you're beholden
To no one but me

Drive back
Drive back
Drive back
Drive back
Drive back
Drive back

When I think of all you've done
Take your Pinto for a run
I see you're the wiser one
You're the wiser one, you're the wiser one

When I think of all we've done
And the rain soaks up the sun
I see we're the wiser ones
We're the wiser ones, we're the wiser ones

When I think of all you've done
Take your Pinto for a run
I see you're the wiser one
You're the wiser one

When I think of all we've done
And the rain soaks up the sun
I see we're the wiser ones
We're the wiser ones

When I think of all you've done
Take your Pinto for a run
I see you're the wiser one
You're the wiser one
