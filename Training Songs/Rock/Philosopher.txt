All of the children in the park
Searching the sculpture to find where you are
All of the blind men in the dark follow you
Do you know where you go?
All of the travelers on the road
Put down the burdens to see where you go
All of the mortals with their loss
Follow you anywhere, follow you.
Do you know where you go?

Philosopher
If he should turn his head around
He will see they're all about
All of these people falling down.
Philosopher
Can you survive the world you teach?
And can we live the world you preach?
All of your people out of reach.

All of the people wanting more,
Needing to follow a philosopher
All of the wealthy and the poor
Follow you anywhere, follow you.
Do you know where you go?

Philosopher
If he should turn his head around
He will see they're all about
All of these people falling down.
