I am the girl you know, can't look you in the eye
I am the girl you know, so sick I cannot try
And I am the one you want, can't look you in the eye
I am the girl, you know I lie, I lie and lie

I'm miss world, somebody kill me
Kill me pills
No one cares, my friends
My friend

I'm miss world, watch me break and watch me burn
No one is listening, my friend
Now I've made my bed, I'll lie in it
I've made my bed, I'll die in it
I've made my bed, I'll lie in it
I've made my bed, I'll die in it

Cute girls watch when I eat ether
Suck me under
Maybe forever, my friend

Now I've made my bed, I'll lie in it
I've made my bed, I'll die in it
I've made my bed, I'll cry in it
I've made my bed, I'll lie in it
I've made my bed, I'll lie in it
I've made my bed, I'll lie in it
I've made my bed, I'll lie in it
I've made my bed, I'll lie in it, my friend
I am the girl you know, can't look you in the eye
