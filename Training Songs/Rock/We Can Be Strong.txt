Signed myself out today
Sent a letter far away
Said baby I'll be good someday
Gonna try again tomorrow
Try again tomorrow
I couldn't take that sterile place
In those rooms I lost my face
And in the end they couldn't sell me grace
And they can't sell me tomorrow
Can't sell me tomorrow
We can be strong...
Now I'm back on mamma's couch
Plenty of time to think about
All of the kids that went the college route
Chasing their tomorrows
Chasing their tomorrows
One by one my friends dropped out
Now I've got brothers to share my doubts
On what this business is all really about
Waiting on tomorrow
Waiting on tomorrow
We can be strong...
Signed myself out today
Sent a letter far away
Said baby come home today
I'm here and its tomorrow
I'm home and its tomorrow
We can be strong...
