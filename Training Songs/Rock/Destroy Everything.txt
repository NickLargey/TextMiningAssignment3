A new life begins!

Destroy everything(x3)
Obliterate what makes us weak
Destroy everything(x3)
Decimate what threatens me

Cleanse this world with flame
End this, cleanse this
Rebuild and start again
Obliterate what makes us weak

End this and embrace the destruction
End this to embrace new life (new life)

Even an empty threat deserves a response you won't soon forget
I must destroy everything that tries to infect
Even an empty threat deserves a response you won't soon forget
I must destroy everything that tries to infect

Destroy everything(x3)
Obliterate what makes us weak
Destroy everything(x3)
Decimate what threatens me

Cleanse this world with flame
End this, cleanse this
