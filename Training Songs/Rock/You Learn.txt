There's no one like the other
It's in your hands
It lies in all our hands
Listen to your mother
Break free from the fence
It's when you cry it all ends

And you learn like a shadow flows in the rain
Like a foreign flame in the dark
Showing you the way

Bringing you the fire
I will love you
I will hurt you too
All we need is cover
From the no lovers
From the cold others

And you learn like a shadow flows in the rain
Like a foreign flame in the dark
Showing you the way
And you learn
What we feel now isn't pain
Just a scent of it is enough
Blinding me with grace

And there's no have to do it your way
Like a shadow flows in the rain

And you learn
And you learn
And you learn
And you learn
And you learn, and you learn, and you learn, learn

Like a shadow flows in the rain
Like a foreign flame in the dark
Showing you the way

And you learn
What we feel now isn't pain
Just a scent of it is enough
Blinding me with grace

And you learn like a shadow flows in the rain
Like a foreign flame in the dark
Showing you the way
And you learn
