Serpent at the gates of wisdom
Curling 'round a tree
With your eyes so dark and empty
Looking straight through me
How did you get so unwinding?
Do you know my sins?
When you're so close to the answer
Why don't you go in?

Serpent at the gates of wisdom
Who did you deceive?
She was weak, but that's no reason
For what you did to Eve
You're a fool, you broke the stillness
She gave birth to desire
Rolling down the frozen highway
Like a burning tyre

Serpent at the gates of wisdom
Where do you belong?
Wisdom cannot be transmitted
It keeps you hanging on
Do you really serve the Devil
If it's all God's plan?
Good and evil need each other
Honey I'm your man

Serpent at the gates of wisdom
Like a purple scar
Leering at me round the dashboard
As I reach my car
I close the door, I start the engine
And I will take control
God above, and all his angels
Have mercy on your soul
