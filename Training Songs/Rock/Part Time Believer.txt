We've run out of reasons
Losing sight of what it's supposed to be
A part time believer, still true
We've somehow conceded
This sense of self-evasive solitude
It means way too much to me

And I hope you know how lucky you are

Oh, I remember sitting back on my balcony
I was a-listening to the Rolling Stones
See I was waiting for my dad to come home from work
So I could show him all the chords that I'd learned
See I was under the impression I was gonna lead
Some kind of simple, understated life
But now I'm living in the shadows of a memory
And I hope so, man I hope so, oh oh oh

It's been way too long
It seems that I can celebrate my meaning
For I am too young, too warm
The fib won't release
It pulls and it pushes me
Till I wither, till I wither, till I wither

And I hope you know how lucky you are

Oh, I remember sitting back on my balcony
I was a-listening to the Rolling Stones
See I was waiting for my dad to come home from work
So I could show him all the chords that I've learned
See I was under the impression I was gonna lead
Some kind of simple understated life
But now I'm living in the shadows of a memory
And I hope so, man I hope so, oh oh oh

And no, you dare
You run like a lion
To defend your senses
And oh it seems it cuts to the core
It's not the same my friend no more
No oh oh
