Oh yeah
Boots and buckles, red clay and sand
My point ain’t subtle here
I’m a southern man
Where the beer seems cooler and the women seem hotter
Where the world don’t seem so damn modern
And a good ole boy like me still has a chance

This is where I was born this is where I’ll die
Yeah, this is where I was born and this is where I’ll die

It’s all about the south
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina
Don’t you wanna get down and dirty
'Cause, Florida I’m thirsty
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, you crazy old timer
Sweet magnolia, dive bars and diners, oh yeah
Oh, and even if you’re up north
Come on now, come on now, oh
It’s all about the south
It’s all about the south
It’s all about the south

From daddy’s don Williams to mama’s patsy Cline oh,
We’re walkin’ after midnight” singing Tulsa time, oh, yeah
Where the beer seems colder and the women seem hotter
Where the world don’t seem so damn modern yeah
This is where I was born this is where I’ll die
Oh that’s right!
Ooh

It’s all about the south
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina
Don’t you wanna get down and dirty
'Cause, Florida I’m thirsty
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, you crazy old timer
Sweet magnolia, dive bars and diners, oh yeah
Oh, and even if you’re up north
Come on now, come on now, oh
It’s all about the south
Come on!
Yeah

Bring it on down and sing it with me now
This is where I was born and this is where I’ll die
This is where I was born and this is where I’ll die (that's what I'm talkin' about now)
This is where I was born and this is where I’ll die (this is where I’ll die)
This is where I was born and this is where I’ll die

It’s all about the south
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina
Don’t you wanna get down and dirty
'Cause, Florida I’m thirsty
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, you crazy old timer
Sweet magnolia, dive bars and diners, oh yeah
Oh, and even if you’re up north
Come on now, come on now, oh
I said even if you’re up north
Come on now, come on now, oh
It’s all about the south

This is where I was born and this is where I’ll die

This is where I was born and this is where I’ll die
