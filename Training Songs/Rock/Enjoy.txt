Flatulation punctuates the still night air
And I thank god you're here

I queefed - Enjoy
Make the most of my butt-toast
Enjoy my good friends - Enjoy

The laces of my shoes unlock the mystery
Come and share a treat with me
I can't recall the last time I washed my feet
We're in for a treat

Here's my shoes - Enjoy
And here's my socks - Enjoy
Make the most of my toe toast
Enjoy, my good friends - Enjoy

Flatulation punctuates the still night air
And I thank God you're here

I queefed - Enjoy
Smell my feces - Enjoy
Sniff my ass whilst I pass gas
Enjoy my good friends - Enjoy
