He's not a man of many words
He's wrapped up deep inside
Seldom seen and barely heard
The secrets of his life

Life looking through smoke rings
Circles of friends who have gone
Gone

In another time, another place
Things he could have done
With a different life, a different face
With drink to oblivion

Life looking through smoke rings
Circles of friends who have gone
Gone

Life looking through smoke rings
Circles of friends who have gone
Gone
