Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
Just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries

Remember me for centuries

Mama, fight my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong the story's aloof
Heavy metal, rock my heart
Come on, come on and let me in
I'm cruising on your thighs, leave my fingerprints
And this is for tonight
I thought that you would feel
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Remember me for centuries

And I can't stop till the whole word knows my name
'Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there is a light
My shadow is over you 'cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

He's been here forever
And he's the chosen fruit
I could scream forever
We all poisoned you

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
Just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries

Remember me for centuries
