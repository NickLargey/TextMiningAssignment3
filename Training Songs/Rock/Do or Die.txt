Words and music by John Kay and Michael Wilk
Got nothin' more to show ya, there ain't no more to say
You know the mess we made, it just will not go away
It's what we get for acting like a herd of sheep and swine
It's time to pay the piper and we're running out of time
We got to change the way we do the things we do
And we need everyone aboard to make it through
It's do or die, we got to turn the ship around
It ain't no lie, we're 'bout to burn, we're about to drown
It's do or die, we got to learn or we'll go down together
There ain't no captain here to teach us how to steer
There's just the crew, that's me and you
There ain't no easy answer, there ain't no magic tricks
It can't wait until tomorrow, you can't fix it in the mix
Come join the rainbow warriors, help us fight this dirty war
The enemy is everywhere, he's waitin' right behind your door
We got to hold the line or go down in defeat
Do what you can to help, take only what you need
It's do or die, we got to turn the ship around
It ain't no lie, we're 'bout to burn, we're 'bout to drown
It's do or die, we got to learn or we'll go down together
There'll be no Calvary to come and set us free
There's just the sea and you and me
