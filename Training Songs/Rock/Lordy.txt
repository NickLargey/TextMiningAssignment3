Hey,
Lady, she got painted eyes 
Have a way of talking to you 
Cut your heart out for the prize 
While the bitch sings hallelujah 

Lordy, 
Well I'm made of blood and bone 
Surely, you know 
I bleed when I get stoned 
Look at the way I made my bed 
Rocks and knots and I'm half crazy 
Get to dream 'bout bein' dead 
But I ain't been that lucky lately 

Lordy, 
Well I'm made of blood and bone 
Surely you know 
I bleed when I get stoned 

Lordy, 
Well I'm made of blood and bone 
Surely you know 
I bleed when I get stoned
