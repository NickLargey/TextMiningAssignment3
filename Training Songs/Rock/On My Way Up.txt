I'm on my way up (ooh!) 
Can't put me down (ooh!) 
Business is tough (ooh!) 
I ain't gonna get pushed around 
I'm on my way (ooh!) 
Gonna take this town (ooh!) 
It's gonna be mine all mine 
It's my time and 
I'm on my way (on my way up) 
Straight to the top (I'm telling myself) 
I'm telling myself (I'm totally sussed) 
I'm puttin' my name around (on my way up) 
Ooh hoo  (on my way up) 
Gotta get that rhythm 
I got positivism to give 'em 

I'm on my way through 
Where I'm going to 
You wouldn't believe 
But I'll make it, I'm tellin' you 
I'm on a roll 
Gonna have it all 
It's gonna be fine so fine 
Baby all of the time 
I'm in control 
I'm mighty bold 
I'm lookin' good 
I'm quittin' the neighborhood 
On my way up 
Gotta get right with 'em 
Got all of my life left for livin' 

Nobody gonna tell me no 
Nobody gonna stop me so 
Everybody gonna see me grow 
Nobody gonna hold me down 
Gotta get to a better place 
Gotta wake up, see your face 
Gotta hold on, move on 
Go through that wall 
It's my life or it's nothin' 
Our life or it's nothin' at all 
I'm on my way up

I'm on my way 
Yeah, gonna get it right 
I'm telling myself 
Gonna make it this time around 
On my way up 
Gonna get that rhythm baby 
Gonna start that livin' babe 
Got all my sights set on Heaven
