Can you 
Hear that knocking in your soul
No, you don't listen
Can you hear that knocking 
Overload
No, you don't listen
Never see the high beyond the low
No wonder, you lay 
Twitching
Do you share the rush to be alone
Come over, we'll go missing
We'll go where 
There's no snow
We'll go and they won't know
Just please don't give me your word
Do 
Do do, do do do do do do ah ah ah
Can you hear that knocking in your soul
No, you don't 
Listen
We'll go where there's no snow
Just please don't give me your word
Just please 
Don't give me your word
Do do do, do do do do do do ah ah ah
All that matters is the 
Music tonight
Just please don't give me your,
All that matters is the music,
But you 
Don't listen
Well, we'll run and run
Until we start again
Yea we'll we'll run run and 
Run away
Yea well, we'll run and run
Until we start again
Yeah we'll run run and run 
Away
