If, I could make
Time roll back
For her sake
Get back her smiling face
For the years it will take
She may break

She'll come undone
If she weeps
She'll come undone
Sorrow creeps
She'll come undone
Who's to blame
She'll come undone
Life will never be the same

There's a hole in her life
A son has disappeared
She asks why
How can God
Reach out his hand
Carve a hole in, hole in, hole
Into her life

She'll come undone
If she weeps
She'll come undone
Sorrow creeps
She'll come undone
Who's to blame
She'll come undone
Life will never be the same

So do you think you're the only
One
Who can feel bonds breaking
Come undone
