What a strange thing to say 
As you pass me on your way out. 
And all the things I had in mind for you and me. 
Say something new, something new. 
What a strange thing to do 
As you passed me 
On your way out, on your way out. 
And all the things I had in mind for you and me. 
Say something new, something new. 
About something you do, something you do. say something new, something new. 
About something you do, something you do.
