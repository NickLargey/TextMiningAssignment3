Alone at sea, close my eyes, I slip away, way up in the sky. 
And I play with the angels with my paper wings. 
Hook me a chain on the moon. 
I'll do anything, day or night, I'll tell you, I don't care 
Anytime, anyplace, go anywhere. 
Yeah, I'm a dreamer 
Lock me away, yes my body is yours 
But baby, you won't never keep me behind closed doors. 
And ya' may think I'm crazy, well, just maybe a touch. 
So you just use me, like we all need a crutch. 
And you've got yours, and I've got mine 
I step right behind the moon suits me just fine. 
Paralized I feel no pain 
Silver bullets numb my brain. 
I look at the future and what lies ahead 
The silver bullets have turned to lead. 
All the more I laugh, all the more I'm gonna cry. 
The more I live, the more I'm gonna die.
