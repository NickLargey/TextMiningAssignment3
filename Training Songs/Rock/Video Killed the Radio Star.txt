I heard you on my wireless back in '52
Lyin' awake intent on tuning in on you
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through
oh a oh
They took the credit for your second symphony
Rewritten by machine on new technology
And now I understand the supernova scene
oh a oh
I met your children
oh-a-oh
What did you tell them?
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Pictures came and broke your heart,
we can't rewind we've gone too far
Whoa!
Oh, aoh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, aoh, oh, oh, oh
And now we meet in an abandoned studio
You hear the playback and it seems so long ago
And you remember, the jingles used to go,
oh a oh
You were the first one
oh a oh
You were the last one
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Pictures came and broke your heart,
we can't rewind we've gone too far
Too far!
Oh, aoh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, aoh, oh, oh, oh
Alright

Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Pictures came and broke your heart,
We can't rewind we've gone too far
Pictures came and broke your heart
Put all the blame on VCR
You are, the radio star
You are, the radio star 
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star 
Video killed the radio star 
Video killed the radio star 
Video killed the radio star 
Video killed the radio star 
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed that radio star, yes it did
