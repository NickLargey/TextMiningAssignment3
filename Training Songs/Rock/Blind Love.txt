Now you're gone 
And it's hotels and whiskey and sad luck days 
And I don't care if they miss me 
I never remember their names 

They say if you get far enough away 
You'll be on your way back home 
Well I'm at the station 
And I can't get on the train 

Must be blind love 
The only kind of love is stone blind love 
The only kind of love is stone blind love 
The only kind of love is stone blind love 
Oh blind love 
Blind love 
Stone blind love 
Stone blind love 

Well the street's turning blue 
The dogs are barking and the night has come 
And it's tears that are falling 
From these brown eyes now 
And I wonder where you are 
And I whisper your name 
(i whisper your name) 
And the only way to find you 
Is if I close my eyes 

And find you with my blind love 
The only kind of love is stone blind love 
The only kind of love is stone blind love 
The only kind of love is stone blind love 
Oh blind love 
Blind love 
Stone blind love 
Stone blind love 

Oh it's blind love 
The only kind of love is stone blind love 
The only kind of love is stone blind love 
The only kind of love is stone blind love 
Oh blind love 
Blind love 
Stone blind love
