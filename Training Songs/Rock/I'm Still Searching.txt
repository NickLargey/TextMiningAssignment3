The rumors are vicious
My ears are burning
It's been a long, hard day
Telephone rings
I still got nothing to say
Considerations tossed
Out the window
I feel a little bit wired
The rules say anything goes
But I don't want to play
You said I could walk away
Take me back to where
My life burns
I'm still searching for something
I'm still looking for someone
But I'm caught in the middle
Of a broken heart
And a life on the run
Took a long walk
I went down through the backstreets
I heard the city scream
Reminds me of the time
I run wicked and free
Now, here I stand all alone
But I'm back to where
My life burns
One heart
One home
But I'm still holding on
I've loved
But I've roamed
Now I'm goin' home 
Goin' home
