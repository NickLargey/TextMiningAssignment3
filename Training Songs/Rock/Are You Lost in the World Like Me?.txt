Look harder, say it's done
Black days and a dying sun
Dream a dream of god lit air
Just for a minute you'll find me there

Look harder and you'll find
The forty ways it leaves us blind
I need a better place
To burn beside the lights
Come on and let me try

Are you lost in the world like me?
If the systems have failed?
Are you free?
All the things, all the loss
Can you see?
Are you lost in the world like me?
Like me?

Burn a courtyard, say it's done
Throwing knives at a dying sun
A source of love in the god lit air
Just for a minute, you'll find me there

Look harder and you'll find
The 40 ways it leaves us blind
I need a better way
To burn beside the lights
Come on and let me try

Are you lost in the world like me?
If the systems have failed?
Are you free?
All the things, all the loss
Can you see?
Are you lost in the world like me?
Like me?
Are you lost in the world like me?
If the systems have failed?
Are you free?
All the things, all the loss
Can you see?
Are you lost in the world like me?
Like me?

If the systems have failed
