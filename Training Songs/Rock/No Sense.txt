Mail arrives in the morning
I'm hoping for good news
Another letter from a girl that I don't know
Another letter full of no news

You don't tell me anything
You just go on and on
And you don't make no sense

You try to tell me that you love me
But we ain't never met
You try to say you're gonna be my one and only
But I wouldn't take no bet

You don't tell me anything
You just go on and on
And you don't make no sense
