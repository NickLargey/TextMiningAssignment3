In the middle of the night
In the depth of her loneliness
You heard her cry

And with a whisper and a sigh
She was givin' you the last request
Thinkin' you'd die
But you turn around and walk away from the one you love
Leaving your heart and soul behind

And as you're turning out the lights
(Turning out the lights)
You're standing still 
A fading paradise
(Heart gone cold)
Runnin' from your love
(Heart gone cold)

Well she had nothing to deny
Do whatever is easiest
Open your eyes
Cause no matter how you try
You can never feel her emptiness
Just say goodbye
But you turn around and walk away from the one you love
Leaving your heart and soul behind

And as you're turning out the lights
(Turning out the lights)
You're standing still 
A fading paradise

(Heart gone cold)
Runnin' from your love
(Heart gone cold)
(Heart gone cold)
Runnin' from your love
(Heart gone cold)

And as you're turning out the lights
(Turning out the lights)
You're standing still 
A fading paradise

And as you're turning out the lights
(Turning out the lights)
You made the sacrifice
(Turning out the lights)
You're standing still 
A fading paradise

(Heart gone cold)
She's runnin' from your love
(Heart gone cold)
Time to walk away
(Heart gone cold)
She's runnin' from your love
(Heart gone cold)
Oh
Heart gone cold
She's runnin' from your love
(Heart gone cold)
Heart gone cold
She's runnin' from your love
