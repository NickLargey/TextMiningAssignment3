There's a ghost in my house
The ghost of your memory
The ghost of the love that was took from me

Our love used to be
Only shadows in the past I see
Times can't seem to've erased
The vision of your smiling face

Dead flowers I sent thee
I can't get over ye

There's a ghost in my house
I can't hide (ghost in my house)
For the ghost of your love is inside (ghost in my house)
Keeps on haunting me (ghost in my house)
Just keeps on becalling me (ghost in my house)

Down in my tea cup
I see your face looking up
Sitting in my easy chair
I feel your fingers running through my hair

Though we're far apart
Your spectre's in my heart

There's a ghost in my house
I can't hide (ghost in my house)
For the ghost of your love is inside (ghost in my house)
Keeps on haunting me (ghost in my house)
Still just a part of me (ghost in my house)

By the way I hang my head
You can see I'm afraid
Thought my heart knows you're gone
My mind keeps rolling on

There's a ghost in my house
I can't hide

In my house I am helpless
practice superstitious

I hear footsteps on the stairs
I know there's no-one there
Keeps on haunting me
Keeps on haunting me

There's a ghost in my house
A ghost of your memory
A ghost of the love that was took from me
Ghost in my house...
