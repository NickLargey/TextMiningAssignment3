Baby there will come a day when our lives are over.
I know those movies make you sad, but you've got my shoulder.
You don't believe in heaven, babe.
Well then, I don't either.
But maybe there will come a world where we'll find each other.

If I leave before you do, I swear I'll find my way to you.
I'll hold you tightly when you sleep; I'll kiss you.

Baby just the other day I got these strange sensations.
Like somebody stepped on my grave; such a bad vibration.
I wondered if our memories would stay when we go.
I wondered would we recognize each other's soul.
But maybe there will come a world where we'll find each other.

If I leave before you do, I swear I'll find my way to you.
I'll hold you tightly when you sleep; I'll kiss you.

Well that's our love. Stronger than blood's bond. Stronger than blood.
