The perfect picture, paper doll dream
Hazel windows in velveteen Cadillac soul
In the city heat, jazzy silence at your feet

Hello darkness, goodbye sun, you're my only one
Holy clouds, playful light, so reluctant in silent flight
Fragile skin, stroking hands left in doubt with no demands

Hello darkness, you are my friend, hold me till the end
Devil cats, so black and sleek, walking down the alleyway
So hard to meet, sweet sensation, paradoxical dream
Curious creatures in between

Hello darkness, my last hotel
Sometimes it gets so hard to tell
