You say I'm looking really bad
You say I'm looking really sick
And I don't even care I never really did
So when push comes to shove
And I slap you in the face
Just remember one thing

When its time to feel the void
My whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my time is running out
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender

So I'm out of control
And I'm out of my mind
Just remember one thing
I think I'm just fine
So catch me when I fall
I won't remember anything at all
So catch me when I fall

When its time to feel the void
My whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my time is running out
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender

When its time to feel the void
My whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my time is running out
When its time to feel the void
My whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my time is running out

I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender
