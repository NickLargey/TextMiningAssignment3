Your head come on is dead and gone it might as well be said so long
It's suds and soda a brain decoder and can I wait for my decoder
Get off get up you son of pop the light below is bright on top
It's suds and soda a smile decoder and can I get yeah what I ordered?
And there's always something in the air, sometimes, suds & soda mix ok with beer
Can I, can I break your sentiment
You're just a monument, can't see no precedent
Just wanna shout what the f*ck
Jimmy Dean is Halloween like kerosene for dee dee scene
It's suds and soda a brain decoder and can I skip this thing I ordered
Get off get up you son of pop the light below is bright on top
It's suds and soda a vibe decoder and can I get yeah what I ordered?
