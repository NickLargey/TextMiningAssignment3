For you, my friend, I'd do anything
Shine your shoes, anything
Lose your blues, make love with you
Take you under my wing, anything

For you, my hero, I'd do anything
Paint your picture, anything
Kiss your photograph, even though I know you'd laugh
Stand beneath your wings, oh anything

And for you, my love, I would do anything
Kiss your feet, and everything
Suffer your pain, but I'd ride your train
Spread our tiny wings, baby anything

And for you, my son, I'd do everything
Protect your mind, and everything
I believe your lies, dry tears from your eyes
Spread your tiny wings, Anything

Cause everything is anything [Repeats]
