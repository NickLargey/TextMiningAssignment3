Well it never was all that clear
Why you left me standing in the mirror
The horizon drank me down

No, I never did completely know
Why you sunk down on that gas pedal
Always trying to skip the town

Scribble down in pencil
Ten-track souvenir

Music to my ears

No, I never really understood
How you do it like a stranger does
Send me flying every time

I was just trying to pass some time
I ain't crying, I'm just fine

Scribble down in pencil
Ten-track souvenir
Audio momento
Music to my ears

You questioned my credentials
You quoted Vladimir
You're Dario Argento
Music to my ears
Music to my ears
Music to my ears
Music to my ears

I never really wondered why
I was just trying to pass some time
I ain't crying, I'm just fine
