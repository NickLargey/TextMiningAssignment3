What do you do?
I said what do you do?
You ain't wearin' a tie,you ain't got a jacket
You can't come in 'cause you're in the wrong bracket
You can shove it

VIP's and royalty get treated like they're special see
But the trick is there for all to see
They're people just like you and me
You can shove it

Girls - we love it
Cars - we love it
More girls - we love it
Late night bars - we love it

Pool - we love it
School - fantasy
What do you do?
You can shove it

You gotta talk,act and dress right
If you ain't got money,they treat ya funny
When they say the class system's dead
If you think that's true better get a new head

You can shove it
You can shove it
You can shove it
Girls - we love it

Cars - we love it
More girls - we love it
Late night bars - we love it
Pool - we love it

School - shove it
What do you do?
Shove it
You can shove it

So why do people scrape and fuss
When everyman's the same as us
It's a joke on all humanity
It's privilege

And we don't need it
War - shove it
Hate - shove it

Politicians - don't cut it
Blind dates - shove it
Girls school - we love it
Crazy rules - shove it

What do you do?
You can shove it
You can shove it

Shove it
Shove it
