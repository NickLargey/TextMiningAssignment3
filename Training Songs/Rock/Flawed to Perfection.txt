Flawed to perfection baby
Flawed to perfection yeah

You know it sends me half crazy driving down the strip
It's one place in the world I could lose my grip
I fall in love so easy got to bite my lip every time
I see a silicone sister in a black sedan

She stopped the other traffic just by raising her hand
I feel so happy I was born a man she's so fine
Did I see her in a magazine?
Right off the top shelf you know just what I mean
She's like a loving machine, she's flawed to perfection

She's flawed to perfection baby, flawed to perfection yeah
She's flawed to perfection baby, flawed to perfection yeah

There's a ladder in her stocking that I'd love to climb
I'm hot under the collar for the hundredth time
If the girls in California gonna make me blind that's alright
When she put that red dress on she knew what it would do
To every single man including me and you

She wears it just the way she's s'posed to do it's so tight
And if my thoughts are gonna send me to hell
She ain't no angel 'cause I know she knows darn well
The way she's ringing my bell
She's flawed to perfection

She's flawed to perfection baby, flawed to perfection yeah
She's flawed to perfection baby, flawed to perfection yeah

And if my thoughts are gonna send me to hell
She ain't no angel 'cause I know she knows darn well
The way she's ringing my bell, ooh she rings it so well
She's flawed to perfection

She's flawed to perfection baby, flawed to perfection yeah
She's flawed to perfection baby, flawed to perfection yeah
