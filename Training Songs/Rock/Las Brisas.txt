Cross over the border,
We'll take a sailing ship into the night.
 
A sea without horizons,
We'll have each others love to hold us tight,
On a starless night.
 
Oh, las brisas,
Means the breeze will carry us like two birds in flight,
On a starless night.
 
Oh, penumbra,
Means the sunset that I see within your smile,
Is the dawn of your eyes.
 
Yo te amo,
Means I love you like I've never loved before.
 
Dreams come true, dear,
When I take you in my arms forever more,
Forever more.
 
Oh, las brisas,
Means the breeze will carry us like two birds in flight,
On a starless night.
 
Oh, penumbra,
Means the sunset that I see within your smile,
Is the dawn of your eyes.
 
Penumbra,
Means the sunset that I see within your smile,
Is the dawn of your eyes.
 
Yo te amo,
Means I love you like I've never loved before.
Forever more,
Forever more.
