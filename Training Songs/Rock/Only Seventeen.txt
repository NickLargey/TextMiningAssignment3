She was an only child
With her body and mind she had to much attention
Too much of everything
She was an angel child
But the devil within her would test her on the way

Into the dark filled places underground
She entered in forbidden rooms
Only seventeen

All alone so alone
All alone so alone

Into the tunnel and back toward the light
That shines between the fingers of dark
The light that shines showing the way to the start

She was an only child
She had so far to fall then so far to climb
To get to the light again
She was a special child
She know what was coming but she know she could not turn

Back in the dark filled rooms
One of a crowd but more than on her own

All alone so alone
All alone so alone

Into the tunnel and back toward the light
That shines between the fingers of dark
The light that shines showing the way to the start

Only seventeen somewhere in between

The race is almost over now
The dance is almost done
Remember how it was when it was fun?

All alone so alone
All alone so alone

Into the tunnel and back toward the light
That shines between the fingers of dark
The light that shines showing the way to the start
