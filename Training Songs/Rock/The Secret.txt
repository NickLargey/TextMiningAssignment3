The sound of the engine
The feel of the tires
Your hands on a wheel and the smell from the fires
Streetlights and headlights on a road that goes nowhere
She left you, she left you but you know she's still out there
And somehow it always seems like you are waiting for something

And somewhere they're dancing the night away madly
And their sweat fills their eyes as they clutching so sadly
So you struggled for words you could never find somehow
But it's nowhere to hide 'cause the secret's out now

Out now
Out now

It's out now
Out now

Somehow it always seems like you could wake up from a dream
She never knew you
She only knew what she heard
So just once you'd pull her close
And you'd whisper the words

But you hated yourself
For the things that you gave her
But you stole with your mind
And you heart was impure
So you think you'll forget
All these nights like a sickness
And there's nothing for miles
Everywhere in the darkness

But somewhere they're dancing the night away madly
And the tears fill your eyes as you clutching her sadly
And you're searching yourself
But could not find an answer
Now the feeling grows inside of you like a cancer
And roar the engine on a road that's just endless
And her ghost is with you everywhere in the darkness
You struggled for words you could never say somehow
But it's nowhere to run 'cause the secret's out now

Out now
Out now

It's out now
Out now
