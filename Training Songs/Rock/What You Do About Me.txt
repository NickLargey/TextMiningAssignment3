I wish that I was her and I wish that she was me.
But you've gotta let her go and you know that you agree.
Because how could we ever start, if you're afraid to break her heart.

You say you love me so.
But you have to let her go.

All that she wants is you.
And all that she sees is you.
All that you gotta do is set her free.
That's what, that's what, what you do about me.

Love's not an easy thing, if somebody gets hurt.
I know you were meant for me even though she saw you first.
You need to deal with her honestly.
I won't let you cheat with me.

I bet you never knew,
what you got yourself into.

All that she wants is you.
And all that she sees is you.
All that you gotta do is set her free.
That's what, that's what, what you do about me.

We could be beautiful
(We could be beautiful)
We could be so special
We could be wonderful

All that I want is you.
All that I see is you.
All that you gotta do is set her free.
That's what, that's what, what you do about me.

All that she wants is you.
And all that she sees is you.
All that you gotta do is set her free.
That's what, that's what, what you do about me.
What you do about me.
What you do about me.
