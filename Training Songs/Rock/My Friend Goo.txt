My friend Goo has a real tattoo
She always knows just what to do
She looks through her hair like she doesn't care
What she does best is stand and stare

She can play the drums set too
And the boys say, "hey Goo what's new?"
My friend Goo just says, "Hey you"
My friend Goo just says, "Hey you"

I know a secret or two about Goo
She won't mind if I tell you
She likes to wear green underwear
And lays down most anywhere

She doesn't have nothing to do
And the boys say, "hey Goo what's new?"
My friend Goo goes, "Hey you"
My friend Goo goes, "Hey you"

I know a secret or two about Goo
She won't mind if I tell you
I know a secret or two about Goo
I know a secret about Goo and you

And she sticks just like glue
And the boys goes, "hey Goo what's new?"
My friend Goo just goes, "Hey you"
My friend Goo just goes, "Hey you"

Goo Goo Goo
Goo Goo Goo

Goo Goo Goo
My friend Goo
Goo Goo Goo
Talkin' 'bout Goo
Goo Goo Goo
My friend Goo
Goo Goo Goo
You would too
Goo
