Shikari was a third generation aztec, his tribe accepting human reality
It was the basis of their ability, to sustain with humble tranquility
Most civilizations encouraged religions which in turn introduced depravity
And that was as big a realization as when my boy newton discovered gravity
Cos it transformed the way we bounce about on a daily basis
Not content with a doubt about the knowledge of who's up there
Quick! give him a name, a trident, and a chair sharpish
What happened to wonder?
Why can't we accept we're not capable of thunder?
So we welcome the lies with open arms, and we turn into suckers when they turn on the charms

You're trying to run us all into the ground, to be swallowed by the soil and trapped by the rain,
In your concrete garden of falseness
You shout through our speakers
And we don't turn them off, cos trapped in silence is tougher

But this time we'll turn the speakers off
And we won't stay silent, we'll make as much noise as we can!

And I ask what's a though without a voice to voice it
It's just a thought
It's just a thought

The original affluent society, floating free of capitalistic anxiety
But all that's survived not is a pack vibe, but the catch is dogs don't eat other dogs
We're able animals employed by criminals in this cannibalistic society
Where we scrimp and save, just to behave with the utmost propriety

You're trying to run us all into the ground, to be swallowed by the soil and trapped by the rain
In your concrete garden of falseness
You're trying to run us all into the ground, to be swallowed by the soil and trapped by the rain

And I ask, "what's a though without a voice to voice it?"
It's just a thought
It's just a thought
It's just a thought
We will shout our heads off, we wont stop until you hear
We wont stop until you trip up upon yourselves

And I ask, "what's a though without a voice to voice it?"
It's just a thought
It's just a thought
It's just a thought
And I ask, "what's a though without a voice to voice it?"

We won't stay silent, we'll make as much noise as we can!

We won't stay silent
We won't stay silent
We won't stay silent
We won't stay silent
We won't stay silent
We won't stay silent
We won't stay silent
We won't stay silent
We won't stay silent
