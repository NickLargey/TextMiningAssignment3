I'm knockin' at your door 
And there's no answer 
I hear the moans and groans 
Of your nasty laughter 
I'm kickin' in the door 
As your breathin' gets faster 
Your trail of clues 
Is leadin' to disaster 

Once I looked into your eyes 
I thought they were true 
Innocence can turn to lies 
And now the finger points 
At you, baby 

Shame Shame Shame 
You should've known better 
Than to cheat on me 
Shame Shame Shame 
Now it don't matter 
So let me be 
You've got your own self to blame 
Now it's time to feel the pain 
Of your twisted little game 
It's such a cryin' 
Shame Shame Shame 
Shame Shame Shame 

Did you do your poses 
In the mirror 
Did you tell him 
Baby, baby please 
Did you twist his tongue 
And bend his ear 
Did you have him beggin', beggin' 
On his knees 

Once you looked into my eyes 
And told me you were mine 
Now I see your cheap disguise 
And you're runnin' out of time, baby 

Shame Shame Shame 
You should've known better 
Than to cheat on me 
Shame Shame Shame 
Now it don't matter 
So let me be 
You've got your own self to blame 
Now it's time to feel the pain 
Of your twisted little game 
It's such a cryin' 
Shame Shame Shame 
Shame Shame Shame
