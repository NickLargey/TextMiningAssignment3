You told me you'd hold me
Now I know better
All you did fold me honey
Like a dear John letter
You put me in a box
With God and his uncle
Like a pair of gym socks
Lookin' like Artie Garfunkle 
You took my heart
The check's in the mail
We'll do lunch when you get out of jail 
Sure Pinocchio
Anything you say
Sure Pinocchio
Have it your own way 
You took me for a ride
Well, I'm crawling out of this gutter
You hurt me down inside
What was that you muttered
Somethin' bout wishing on a star
for a fish out of water
Well, I know who you are
Your Gepetto's wicked daughter 
This hurts you more that it hurts me
You never inhale, yeah, and cops eat free 
Sure Pinocchio 
Anything you say
Sure Pinocchio
Have it your own way 
Sure Pinocchio
What hurts me makes you stronger
Sure Pinocchio
That nose keeps gettin' longer and longer 
You took my heart
The check's in the mail
We'll do lunch when you get out of jail 
Sure Pinocchio
Anything you say
Sure Pinocchio
Have it your own way 
Sure Pinocchio
Anything you say
Sure Pinocchio
That nose keeps gettin' longer and longer
