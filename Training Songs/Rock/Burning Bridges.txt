Sometimes press them tenders
I'm never truly land
And all your expectation
I never truly care
You'll never safe on, or come up with other reason
You've been weak and I take a bad decision

Burning bridges,
Burning bridges it down
Burning bridges
Burning bridges it down
Burning bridges
Burning bridges it down

Now you've a [?] and you lost ti
You won't get up the fire
I can add you to my list
And keep it up at night
You're the [?]
There's I stare on braking walls
The tragedy unfalls

Burning bridges,
Burning bridges it down
Burning bridges
Burning bridges it down
Burning bridges
Burning bridges it down
Burning bridges
Burning bridges it down

With the [?] was a time to us
And it might not come again
You must chose what eyes don't look throw in the end
Every love is hard
We have it in a Powel
And these lonely hours make me worst

Burning bridges
Burning bridges it down
Burning bridges,
Burning bridges it down
Burning bridges
Burning bridges it down
Burning bridges
Burning bridges it down
Burning bridges
Burning bridges it down

Burning bridges
Burning bridges it down
Burning bridges
Burning bridges it down
Burning bridges
Burning bridges it down
Burning bridges
Burning bridges it down

Why you wanna burn
Why you wanna burn
Why you wanna burn it down
