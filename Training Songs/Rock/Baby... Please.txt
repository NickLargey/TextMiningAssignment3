I think I'll lose an hour or two
With you beside the water
Don't lose time in bringing me
That good thing that you ought to

Baby...please
You've got me scraping my knees
Baby...please
Please, please, don't make me go back to the freeze

Every time that I try to connect girl
Well, it seems that your line is engaged
I'm a slave to the way that you move me
I'm a puppy dog wagging my tail

Baby...please
You've got me scraping my knees
Baby...please
Please, please, don't make me go back to the freeze

Staring out of windows like a helpless child
Pouring down the whiskey like it's goin' out of style
Trying to tell myself that everything is fine
In a big rubber room with a silver spoon still on my mind

Well, I'm pacing the floor like a tiger
Living nights that have passed into days
Looking over my shoulder
To catch anything coming my way

Baby...please
You've got me scraping my knees
Baby...please
Please, please, don't make me go back to the freeze
