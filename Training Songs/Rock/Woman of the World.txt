Did you ever meet
The kind of a lady
She lives her whole life
Saying maybe
Running here and there
As she pleases
Not a thought
For the social diseases

Though she never
Thinks of settling down
She'll spend time
Turning your head around
But don't let your heart start dancing
The lady don't
Waste no time romancing

Are you mine or are you
The woman of the world
Are you really so different
From all the other girls
Do you care that I care
About the things that you do
Does anything matter to you
Does anything matter to you

Once in a garden of glory
Someone sowed
The seeds of this story
And the whole thing began
With a woman and a man
Still it's something
No one understands
