Later here this morning, if the crowds hold back the rain
I'll declare my intent to race again
Baby I've done running
I've cut myself a deal
Gave myself a ladder, this time for real
And I've got nothing on the inside left to charm, just look at me
And I've got nothing to live up to and nothing to reveal
Go on run for me
Go on run for me
Go on run for me because I can't take it back
Gone the summer gone the past and now it's done
Now it's done

The lane is laced with ashes
My road is paved with fear
I bathed myself in sweet grass to tame the years
And I've got nothing on the inside left to charm, just look at me
And I've got nothing to live up to and nothing to reveal
Go on run for me
Go on run for me
Go on run for me Ã…?cause I can't take it back
Gone the summer gone the past and now it's done
Now it's done
