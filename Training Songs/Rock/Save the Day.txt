So here I come to save the day, a regular Joe now on parade
They say, it's the only way, but they, they only want it when it's there 
So here I come to save the day, the future's here and the past is yesterday 
They say, it's the only way, they say, they only want it when it's there 
We're not going on a holiday, we do a lot of work and we don't get paid 
Stand up don't walk away, take your pride and swallow 
Life's full of much unwanted waste, crime pays and the junkies walk away 
But for husband and the good son, they speak ill at ease but they dare not run 
They dare not run
