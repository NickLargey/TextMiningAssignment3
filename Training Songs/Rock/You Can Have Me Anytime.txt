Here we are, in a room full of strangers
And an open door
Here we are, away from all danger
But that open door is calling out again
Acting like a friend who wants to know
If you might come away
I wonder what you'll say
You wonder out again.

On wings of the night
Once again you'll take flight
And I don't hear your voice anymore
Tonight's dreams will end
But I'll stay long after then
And you can have me anytime.

Here we are
Alone in the shadows of our lonely room
Here we are
We all hollows those very lonely rooms
Like a faithless child
Frightened of the wild he runs and hides
To keep from being still
We run around until
We lose ourselves again.
