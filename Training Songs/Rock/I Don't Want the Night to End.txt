I don't want the night to end
I don't want you to burn the treats
Daylight ain't my friend
I don't want ever night to end

Don't want the night to go
I don't want to see the break of dawn
Daylight do what you said
I don't want it ever back again
I want the night to go on and on and on
Feel so bright and strong and strong

I don't want night to end
I don't want to see it go away
Can't stop and start again
I don't want the night to end

I want to carry on and on and on
I feel so right and strong
And strong and strong
Don't want night to end
Don't want to see it go away
Cannot stop and start again
I don't ever want the night to end
I don't ever want the night to end
