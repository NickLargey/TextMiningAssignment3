Pergola 55, 30 kids come alive
Doorbell, ring-a-la, whining at the playground
Mothers call, mothers scream, gotta sleep, had a dream
Boom box, booty shave, one o'clock and I'm awake

Console, TV-set, in control and out of bed
Rob a bank, steal a car, kill a gang, start a war
With low life animals, with shooting eyes, tentacles Grabbing me, sucking on my energy, stop

One of these days I'm starting over
Write me a song like Crimson and Clover
Too many times I tried to remember
One of these days I'm gonna make a new life

Here we go, once again, and again
Going round and round, pretend
Coming home, going out, coming back for some more

Going out, get some food, driving through the neighbourhood
Parking lot, local store, all in line, find the door
In I come, heart attack, checking out a paper bag
With toothpaste, cornflakes, party cakes, stop

One of these days I'm starting over
Write me a song like Crimson and Clover
Too many times I tried to remember
One of these days I'm gonna make a new life

Here we go, once again, and again
Going round and round, pretend
Coming home, going out, coming back for some more

Here we go once again and again
Going round and round, pretend
Coming home, going out, coming back get some more
Here we go once again and again
Going round and round, pretend
Coming home, going out, coming back for some more
