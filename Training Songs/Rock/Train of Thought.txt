When you're talkin' in your sleep 
And the name that you whisper ain't mine
And I've finally faced the fact 
That you're cheatin' on me one more time
When my anger starts to rumble and my steam starts to rise
And the wheels keep turnin' faster as I think of all your lies

Oh that train of thought's runnin' right on time
But it's off the track and I'm losin' my mind
'Cause the way you use me's gonna drive me insane, honey
Say you'll never leave me
For God's sake stop the train

Oh the camel's back is broken 
By the one extra straw added on
And a woman can't see reason 
When her last ray of sunshine is gone
There's a finger on the trigger and that locomotive sound
And I think how much I love you and I turn the gun around

Oh the train of thought's runnin' right on time
But it's off the track and I'm losin' my mind
And you hold me the last time as I try to explain, honey
Don't feel bad about me
I just-a had to stop this train

Gotta get off, gotta get off  
Gotta get off, gotta get off (woo-woo)
Gotta get off, gotta get off this train of thought (woo-woo)
Gotta get off, gotta get off (woo-woo)
Gotta get off, gotta get off the train of thought (woo-woo)
