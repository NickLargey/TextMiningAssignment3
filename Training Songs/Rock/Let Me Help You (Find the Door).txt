Why's it got to be the same damn thing
Same damn song that everybody wants to sing
Same sons of bitches still rigging the game
They sell the same old faces with a brand new name

No matter if I'm wrong or right
I ain't losing sleep tonight

I've heard it all before
I can't take it anymore
If that's all you got
Let me help you find the door

Here we go digging the same damn ditch
Just line 'em up can't tell ya which one is which
Standing in the back with a shit eatin' grin
They were buying it once I bet they'll buy it again

As long as it's the devil you know
I bet he got a piece of your soul

I've heard it all before
I can't take it anymore
If that's all you got
Let me help you find the door

I've heard it all before
I can't take it anymore
If that's all you got
Let me help you find ah ah

I've heard it all before
I can't take it anymore
If that's all you got
Let me help you find the door
