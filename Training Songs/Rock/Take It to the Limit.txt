Speed on up
S-S-speed on up
To the limit, come on

She's got a body I can barely believe
She's indeed the devil,
But on another level
Her kind of curves are k-killing me
There'd be nothing better than riding her forever

Gotta grab hold
When I'm ready to roll she's got some get up and go

Speed on up, take it to the limit
Only live once, live it fast for a minute
Speed on up, take it to the limit
Go and get some, gotta fight to the finish
And take it to limit yeah yeah

Zero to 60 in 4.3
She gets me into trouble and then she makes it double
Takes all my money she's a spending machine
But baby I ain't hurting I love the way you work it

Gotta grab hold
When I'm ready to roll she's got some get up and go

Speed on up, take it to the limit
Only live once, live it fast for a minute
Speed on up, take it to the limit
Go and get some, gotta fight to the finish
And take it to limit yeah yeah

Her kind of curves are k-killing me

Speed on up, take it to the limit
Only live once, live it fast for a minute
Speed on up, take it to the limit
Go and get some, gotta fight to the finish
And take it to limit yeah yeah

Speed on up, take it to the limit
Only live once, live it fast for a minute
Speed on up, take it to the limit
Go and get some, gotta fight to the finish
And take it to limit
Speed on up,
T-take it to the limit
Only live once
Gotta fight to the finish
So take it to the limit, yeah yeah
