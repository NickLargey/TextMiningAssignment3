How does a man get the love of a woman?
Or a woman of a man?
How does a man tell his feelings to a woman?
You know it's hard to understand.

The world seems difficult to me
It's such a shame to see
The loneliness that lays to waste
Both you and me.

Where can I find a lover to protect me?
Not run away with my mind.
How will I know that she won't reject me?
Somebody give me a sign.

The world seems difficult to me
It's such a shame to see
The loneliness that lays to waste
Both you and me.

And if I'm lying, lying down
I'm confused.
And if I stand here long enough
I just might find myself getting tough
And amused.
