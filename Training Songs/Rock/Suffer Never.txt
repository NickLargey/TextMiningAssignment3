Has she fallen from the sky
So heavy of heart
The sigh was on her tongue
The grief was in her arms

She will suffer never
I mean her no harm

She'll come slowly rising
On the air
Lift her weightless
On the air, on the air

And the silence was enough
To shed my guilt
She will always know my wishes
'Cause I remember how it felt

Kisses slowly rising
On the air
Lift her weightless
On the air, on the air

She will suffer never
I mean her no harm
