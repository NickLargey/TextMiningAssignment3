Look in the mirror
Familiar figure
Staring right back at me
Split decision
Now my reflection's talking
But I didn't speak
He said, oh my god, you're piecing it together
You are just a shadow of me
Oh my lord, you've never left the mirror
You were never ever free
But tonight, you will play that tambourine, yeah

You will be that chosen master
You will leave with the girl this time
You will be the leading actor
Movie of your own design
And when you hit disaster
The answer will be yours to find
You're the mirror's master
Now forever, I'm resigned

Take in the vision
My imperfections
Shatter in the mirror of me
Another shadow
Slips into the chateau
Hoping that I cannot see
I said, oh my god, I'm piecing it together
You were just a memory
Oh my lord, you've never left the mirror
You were never ever free
But tonight you will play that tambourine, yeah

You will be that chosen master
You will leave with the girl this time
You will be the leading actor
Movie of your own design
And when you hit disaster
The answer will be yours to find
You're the mirror's master
Now forever I'm, resigned

You will be that chosen master
You will leave with the girl this time
You will be the leading actor
Movie of your own design
And when you hit disaster
The answer will be yours to find
You're the mirror's master
Now forever, I'm resigned

You will be that chosen master
You will leave with the girl this time
You will be the leading actor
Movie of your own design
And when you hit disaster
The answer will be yours to find
You're the mirror's master
Now forever, I'm resigned

'Cause now forever, I'm resigned
Now forever, I'm resigned
