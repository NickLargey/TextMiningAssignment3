You have never been so brave
You lose your fear of tomorrow
Romancing in the dark
I share all the love you gave
I play no part in your sorrow
Romancing in the dark

The stars are shining on your face
You have no sense of time and place
Who am I, who are you

But every time I take your hand
I feel your heart will understand

Is it love if you don't know (you don't know)
Is it love if you don't know that I'm just romancing
Romancing in the dark
Is it love if you don't know (you don't know)
Is it love if you don't know your touch is entrancing
Romancing in the dark

But every time I take your hand
I feel your heart will understand

You are standing near the flame
The fire's only beginning
Romancing in the dark
I believe it's just a game
That no one needs to be winning
Romancing in the dark

But every time I take your hand
I feel your heart will understand

Is it love if you don't know (you don't know)
Is it love if you don't know that I'm just romancing
Romancing in the dark
Is it love if you don't know (you don't know)
Is it love if you don't know your touch is entrancing
Romancing in the dark

But every time I take your hand
I feel your heart will understand

Is it love if you don't know (you don't know)
Is it love if you don't know that I'm just romancing
Romancing in the dark
Is it love if you don't know (you don't know)
Is it love if you don't know your touch is entrancing
Romancing in the dark

Is it love if you don't know (you don't know)
Is it love if you don't know that I'm just romancing
Romancing in the dark
Is it love if you don't know (you don't know)
Is it love if you don't know your touch is entrancing
Romancing in the dark
