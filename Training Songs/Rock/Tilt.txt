Sunday evening down the penny arcade 
I see your face in the pinball game
Put in a quarter and it starts to fade 
Tell myself it won't appear again 
But this is just another game I've played so badly
Right from the start 
And through the bells and buzzers you're still singing sadly 
It tears me apart 
The higher you fly 
The farther you gotta fall
Tilt - you're pushing too hard 
Try just another ball 
Tilt - so why's it so hard 
Keeping it under control 
Take it easy take your time, you said 
Take me home I'll see you soon enough 
You say I'm pushing but it's in your head 
I feel so helpless, you say I'm so tough 
And now we fight it out until I just can't hear you 
I can't understand 
When all I want is just permission to be near you 
Holding your hand 
But nobody said 
The lights would keep flashing red 
Tilt - you're pushing too hard 
Try just another ball 
Tilt - so why's it so hard 
Keeping it under control
