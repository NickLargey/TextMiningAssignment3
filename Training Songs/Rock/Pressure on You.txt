She wakes me in the morning 
And our day will there begin
She thinks to tell me over breakfast
"You roll your cigarettes too thin
And where were you last night?"
"Well you know I had to work late again"

We're not eating right,
See we're beginning to look thin
You look just like your mother
My grey eyes are growing dim
Sure I'd like to fight you 
But I only have the strength to give in

There's pressure on you
Pressure on me 
Pressure on you
Pressure on me 
(I don't feel it)

So we drive into the city
Though I want to grab the wheel
I resist all my temptations
I resist all that I feel
You drop me at the lights
I am ejected, dejected but free

No-one looks as pretty when they're standing in the rain
You may say you love the city but our feelings always change
Maybe I'm just like you 
I just have it so easy you see

There's pressure on you
Pressure on me 
Pressure on you
Pressure on me 
(I don't feel it)

Now there's a crack in every window
There's a fault in every frame
I want to change everything
But I want to stay the same
My God, you used to love me!
Or at least I believed that you did

There's pressure on you
Pressure on me 
Pressure on you
Pressure on me 
(I don't feel it)

I don't feel it
I don't feel it
I don't feel it
