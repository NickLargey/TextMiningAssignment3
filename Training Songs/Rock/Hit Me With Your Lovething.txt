Well, I've been chasing you around night and day
Spending a fortune on makeup and hairspray
'Cause I know that you're the perfect one for me
And all I wan't is that you show me how good love can be

Heeeeheeee
Hit me with your lovething
Heeeeheeee
Hit me with your lovething

When my head starts turning round and round
And I start to growl like a mad blood hound
Well don't get scared or angry with me
A cure of soothing love is the secret recipe

Wake up darling, feel the rhythm coming on
Seize the moment, make use of it before it's gone
In my sphere of rhythm
The meaning of existence

The unity of all life
The absolute necessity for compassion
Mutual understanding
If life is to be more than simple blunt existence
