Well, an old man said to me in a voice filled with pain,
"Where you going young man?"
Said I'm going to fight a war, 
gonna fight for my country in some foreign land.
He said,"The sun will never hurt you, never harmed anyone, 
but you must realize if you try to stare her down, she will win in the end.
She will burn your eyes, she will burn them."
 
Seen a million places, seen a million faces die.
and I wonder who will walk with me when I get to Heaven.
 
He said, "Boy, I was young once, yeah, 
I was tough, sailing on Uncle Sam's boat.
Hey, I could kill the enemy, 
I could die on foreign streets, but I could not vote.
But now you walk by me, you won't talk to me, say this is my fate.
But ev'ry time you walk the streets, boy, most of them you meet. 
You see it's you they hate, it's you, yeah."
 
Seen a million faces, seen a million places die.
and I wonder who will walk with me when I get to Heaven.
I've seen a million places, seen a million faces die.
and I wonder who will walk with me when I get there.
 
See this woman sitting next to me, 
she's been there for a long, long time.
And when I fell, she picked me up; 
when I cried, she wiped my tears. 
I thank God she's mine.
And when I leave this world, 
she won't have anything but her love for me.
'Cause the man took ev'rything else,
made me hate myself, so just let her be, boy.
Won't you let her be?
 
Seen a million places, seen a million faces die.
I've seen a million mothers cry,
I've seen a billion brothers dying,
but I wonder who will walk with me when I get there,
when I get to heaven, when I get there, when I get to Heaven.
