You rest your heart, you rest your head.
You have the softest bed
You need it's familiarity
It's very nice. You like the warmth.
You've been in other beds before,
But disregard their similarity
You may be bored
The only flaw
As far as you can see

And when that calm descends,
It's almost as good as happiness
When that calm descends,
It's almost as good as happiness

You drift away, well no one said
That you should look ahead
You're not supposed to lie there all day long
It's a love that you maintain
There's none of it in vain
These easy sacrifices are not wrong
Though they're ignored,
You're forgotten
But you're not gone

And when that calm descends,
It's almost as good as happiness
When that calm descends,
It's almost as good as happiness

then one day when she has gone 
And you can love no one, 
It may be even easier that way.
To lie alone and watch the sky 
Or watch the world go by 
To pass the time that passes anyway.

And when that calm descends,
It's almost as good as happiness
When that calm descends,
It's almost as good as happiness

Almost as good as happiness

Almost as good as happiness
