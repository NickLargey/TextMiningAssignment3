Short sleeved shitkicking animals 
Lining me up 
It's all over their face 
Here's a new chicken shit angel eyed boy 
With a face to rip open all night 
Step up to the line boys 
Cover your eyes as they fire their guns 
The Friday night abattoir spills out into
The streets 

Here comes the panzer attack

This boy's taking the easy way out 
Cause there's nothing like a midnight run 
Don't you tell me not to hide 
You've got to grit your teeth 
And try to keep them too 
Curled up in a can 
They don't know where I am 
I'll spend the night in here 
Cowered in the trash till 4 am 
You missed another one 

Here comes the panzer attack 

Panzer attack
