All the people in the world 
Have been waiting for

Ozonic stratus has been destroyed.
The earth became warmer.
But we'll go, and go, and go, go, go.

Punk pop band Shonen Knife. 

Nick Lowe, Costello, Beatles.
Redd Kross, Ramones, Buzzcocks.

Every every everybody! Shonen Knife! 

Violence, military power, atomic energy.
Here comes the end of a century.
But we'll go, and go, and go, go, go.
