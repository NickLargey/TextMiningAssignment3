There's no shoulder, and I wanna rest my head
All my tears have spilled into a drink instead
There's no shoulder, and I wanna rest my head
You are gone and by myself I go on
 
Here again, a man without a song
Lookin' at the rain fallin' around the town
Seems like life is stringin' me along
Left your love behind, and now I'm feelin' like a clown
 
There's no shoulder, and I wanna rest my head
All my tears have spilled into a drink instead
There's no shoulder, and I wanna rest my head
You are gone and by myself I go on
 
Had to be the winner of the game
Didn't know that I would be so lost inside
Just another face without a name
 
All around me crowds of people no place left to hide
 
There's no shoulder
 
No no no
I'm so low and all alone here
No no no, you know
That I never thought that I would need you
 
Wanna hold her, and there's just an empty bed
I can still recall the final words she said
Should have told her that I wanted love to stay
But by myself I sit alone and wonder
 
There's no shoulder and I know
Should have never let you go
You are gone and by myself I go on
 
There's no shoulder and I know
Should have never let you go
You're not here so by myself I go on
