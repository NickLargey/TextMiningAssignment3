Quiet now in sleepy dreams 
To me it seems the only time to be
Just me 

Bombarded by the phone, in my own home 
Can't get the space that I need
And how I need it, yeah

Oh me, yeah, oh my
Oh me, me, me, me oh my
Oh when I look
When I look at my life
Oh me, oh my
When I look at my life, yeah, la la la

Crowded by the city, all around me 
Need some silence from the loud
And noisy crowds 

And I'm trying to catch a breath 
Through the air of death
Can't see the sun for the clouds
Those dirty clouds

And the night has no compassion 
For your actions
When you're trying to get away
From the hard day, yeah 

And I need someone to talk to 
Apart from you
But I guess that's just the way
Come what may, oh

Oh me, yeah, oh my
Oh me, me, me, me oh my
Oh when I look
When I look at my life
Oh me, oh my
When I look at my life

Oh God 
Are you there 
Are you there
Are you there
No, no, yeah 

God 
Are you there
Are you there
Are you there
Yeah
Well are you out there 
Are you there
Are you there
Are you there 
If so where are you hiding?
I'm having trouble finding you 

Oh me, and oh my
Oh me, me, me, me oh my
Oh when I look
When I look at my life
Oh me, oh my
When I look at my life 

Oh God 
Are you there 
Are you there
Are you there
No, no, yeah 

God 
Are you there
Are you there
Are you there
No
Well are you out there 
Are you there
Are you out there yeah yeah
Are you out there yeah yeah
Are you out there 
Are you out there
Are you out there
