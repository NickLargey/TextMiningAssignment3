Too many people
Have been disillusioned
By the way you've spit it out
You promise them everything
They believe in your dream
Of make believe
But that's an illusion
I was one
Who was caught in your make believe
I was one
Who was lost in your fantasy
You took me in
I was a friend
I joined in your dream
Of make believe
Clearly blinded
And once you hurt me twice
It opened my eyes
It was dawnin'
I was seein' through your scheme
I was one
Who was caught in your make believe
I was one
Who was lost in your fantasy
I was one
But I can see
You're caught in the light now
Nothing seems right now
We're too far apart
You can call me
Tryin' to stall me
But I can see through you
So get out run away
Too many people
Have been disillusioned
By the way that you spit it out
You promise them everything
They believe in your dream
Of make believe
But that's an illusion
I was one
Who was caught in your make believe
I was one
Who was lost in your fantasy
I was one
Who was caught in your make believe
I was one
Who was lost in your fantasy
I was one
Caught in your make believe
I was one
Lost in your fantasy
I was one
Caught in your make believe
