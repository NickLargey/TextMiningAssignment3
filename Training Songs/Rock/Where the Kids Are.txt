I can't blame it all on you
'Cause I'd be wrong
All in all, all all, in all
You're such a beautiful girl

Don't take my chances
Smile for the lenses

Live it up, you're growing up
Parties in the wilderness of life
Light it up, just give it up
Where the kids are running free tonight

The cars on the avenues
Can wait in line
All in all, all all, in all
Lived out this innocent time

Gold roads leave Kansas
Scarecrow loves dances

Live it up, you're growing up
Parties in the wilderness of life
Light it up, just give it up
Where the kids are running free tonight

They're running free tonight
They're running free
They're running free tonight

Live it up, you're growing up
Parties in the wilderness of life
Light it up, just give it up
Where the kids are running free tonight

Live it up, you're growing up
Parties in the wilderness of life
Light it up, just give it up
Where the kids are running free tonight

Where the kids are running free tonight
Where the kids are running free
