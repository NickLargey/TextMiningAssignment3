After the music had stopped, I still heard it playing 
I moved a little closer to hear the words she was saying 
She said, "I'll never break your heart 
I'd never try to fake it
My love is here for you all you have to do is take it" 
Kisses sweeter than wine 
My little girl so fine 

The night seemed to say it was right but could I believe her? 
My heart said, "it's time to go" 
But my eyes wouldn't leave her 
There's always something trying to break your heart 
Somebody trying to take it 
My little girl tries so hard to help me make it 
Kisses sweeter than wine 
My little girl so fine 
Whoa whoa so fine
Whoa whoa so fine

When we danced I forgot everything 
And whispered, "hold me tight"
Take a chance on what tomorrow brings 
Won't you be mine, be mine, be mine tonight?
We walked away laughing together 
Into the night forever and ever and ever 

Now, I know I'll never break my baby's heart 
I'll never try to fake it 
I'll give her all my love all she has to do is take it 
Kisses sweeter than wine 
My little girl so fine
Kisses sweeter than wine 
My little girl so fine
Kisses sweeter than wine 
My little girl, my little girl, yea
My little girl so fine
Whoa whoa so fine, my baby
Whoa whoa so fine, my baby
