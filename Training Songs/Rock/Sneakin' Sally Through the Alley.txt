(Sneaking sally through the alley, oo, oo, oo)

Sneaking sally through the alley,
Tryin' to keep her from sight.
Sneaking sally through the alley,
My baby caught me last night.

I said, "I can't find nothing wrong with being friends,
'Cause sometimes she lets me use her car."
She said, "if you can't find nothing wrong in your mind,
I know you've gone too far.

Sneaking sally through the alley,
Tryin' to get away clean. (tryin' to get away)
Sneaking sally through the alley,
My baby saw the whole scene.

So I began to try and explain,
But it just wasn't, wasn't much of a thought.
Now I should find me somebody new, (somebody new)
'Cause this man has been caught.

She caught me sneaking with sally through the alley,
Tryin' to get away clean.
Sneaking with sally through the alley,
I know you know what I mean. (what I mean, what I mean)

(Tryin' to get away)
(Tryin' to get away)
(Tryin' to get away)

(Sneaking sally through the alley, oo, oo, oo)
(Sneaking sally through the alley, oo, oo, oo)

I talk double talk,
Anything's trouble talk.
Catching myself in lies.
Mama, just look at me,
Thinking about killing me,
I saw it in her eyes.

(Oh, oh, oh)

She caught me sneaking with sally through the alley,
Tryin' to keep her from sight.
I was sneaking with sally through that alley,
My baby caught me last night.

Well, I was sneaking sally through that alley,
Tryin' to get away clean.
You know, sneaking with sally without knowing,
My baby saw the whole scene.

(Oh, oh, oh)

And you know what happened, man?
She got right up to me one more time,
She said,
"What are you doing in the alley with that sally?"
I said,
"You'll just wait till tomorrow and we'll talk!"
