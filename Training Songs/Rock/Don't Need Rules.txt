MThere's something going on here deep inside of me
Some kind of sucker who can walk on water
In the sea of tranquility
I'm getting free

I don't need rules, and neither do you
I don't need rules, no

Your honor I move to make a motion, motion
I'll be the judge of wrong or right
I'm ready to fight

I don't need rules, and neither do you
I don't need rules, no

I don't care if you don't like my hair, that's right
Get a job
I don't need no rules, just a license to drive my life
Yeah--rock n' roll
No rules
