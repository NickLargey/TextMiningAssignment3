I can't stop this feeling I've got, 
I know who I am and I know what I'm not, 
I know where I've been and I know what I've lost 
But I can't stop this feeling I've got 
Wasn't looking ahead and I heard 
Didn't I see, didn't I learn 
And I don't know what you mean to me 
But I'm starting to think its just a mystery 

I can't stop this feeling I've got, 
I know who I am and I know what I'm not 
I know where I've been and I know what I've lost 
But I can't stop this feeling I've got 
Wasn't looking ahead and I heard 
Didn't I see, didn't I learn 

I may be right you may disagree 
But I'm starting to think its just a mystery 
Whatever it is its just a mystery 

Ah you don't really look so easy 
You spend a lifetime looking for someone 
And then they come and you're just so uneasy 
You get the feeling that if I don't come 
Then there's one more story be on your way 

And I can't stop this feeling I've got, 
I know who I am and I know what I'm not 
I know where I've been and I know what I've lost 
But I can't stop this feeling I've got 

The scar before then see me split 
You may say that isn't it 
I may be right you may disagree 
Same old story same old me 
And I don't know what you mean to me 
But I'm starting to think its just a mystery 
I've got to admit its just a mystery
