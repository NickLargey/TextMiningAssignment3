First base, it's me living an empty life so wrong
Heading to nowhere, drinking all night long
Then somebody told me, "Man, you better stop
You're going down, you need something to believe"

On the second, I was building, castles in the air
Dreamed of a kingdom, I was never going to share
But it felt so empty, something should've come my way
Now I know and it's clear inside of me

Here I stand again, I'm a gambler, I'm a man
It's my homerun, my homerun to you
Every life's a game and there's no one you can blame
This is my homerun, my homerun to you

Third base saw me taking all her pictures from the wall
When love surrendered, I fell as deep as I could fall
And the fourth back to my music, to free this troubled mind
I found something after times of being blind

Here I stand again, I'm a gambler, I'm a man
It's my homerun, my homerun to you
Every life's a game and there's no one you can blame
This is my homerun, my homerun to you

I was searching, bleeding, I cried some tears of pain
I was yearning, screaming it all brought me back to you

Here I stand again, I'm a gambler, I'm a man
It's my homerun, my homerun to you
Every life's a game and there's no one you can blame
This is my homerun, my homerun to you

Here I stand again, I'm a gambler, I'm a man
It's my homerun, my homerun to you
Every life's a game and there's no one you can blame
This is my homerun, homerun
