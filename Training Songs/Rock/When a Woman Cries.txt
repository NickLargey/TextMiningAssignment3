When a woman cries, when a woman cries
She can wash your world away
When storms fill her eyes, when storms fill her eyes
You never know just what to say
Don't say a word, don't say anything
She don't need your truth or lies
Just hold her close and love her
When a woman cries

When a woman cries, when a woman cries
There is no sadder song
So you apologize
Even if you don't know what you did wrong
But if you really want to make her happy
To stop her sobbing and her sighs
Just hold her close and love her
When a woman cries

Now don't you waste your time thinkin'
Of the right thing to say
Just put your arms around her
'til the clouds roll away

When a woman cries, when a woman cries
She can tear your world apart
When storms fill her eyes, when storms fill her eyes
It can break a, break a man's heart
And if you find that you are cryin' too
Don't let it come as no surprise
Just hold her close and love her
When your woman cries
