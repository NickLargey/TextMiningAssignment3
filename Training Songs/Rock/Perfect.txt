You like it in your face
And I take you from behind
The things that you love to hate
Are the things that make you mine

Nothing is gonna change
Nothing is gonna change Oh
You like it when we fight
You like to be the one

The one who is always right
The one who can do no wrong
You like it when I bite
And I lie and make you cry Oh

Keep my mouth shut
Say it's my fault
Can't be you, Your perfect
Lay the blame on me

I don't care
Can't be you
Your perfcet, So perfect
I try to drag you down

But you like to speak for god
Agreeing to disagree
Keep on keeping on
Nothing is gonna change

Nothing is gonna change Oh
Keep my mouth shut
Say it's my fault
Can't be you, Your perfect

Lay the blame on me
I don't care
Can't be you
Your perfect, So perfect

Oh you pretty thing
I love to let you win
I love to see you smile girl
Keep my mouth shut

Say it's my fault
Can't be you, Your perfect
Lay the blame on me
I don't care

Can't be you
Your perfect, So perfect
