Hell yeah
Yeah Woh oh'.

Well I got up early this mornin'
And had a song come to my mind
Yes and the woman I had was grinnin'
Says I didn't have the time

Too many people 
Keep hangin' on my back door
Yes and they're always askin' me
Can I have a little more
Aww you know what I got to say 'bout that

Ohh keep runnin' baby

All my dreams are sorrow
Sometimes they're hard to bear
Lawd when I think about tomorrow
Woh why should I care

Well I'm always into something
Yes you know that's right
Well everybody's always running
Time to take a free ride

And I feel like I'm 
Like I'm flyin' high
(Flyin' high)
And I feel like I'm so
Lawd I'm so damn high
And it seems like that day
Just ain't ever gonna come
(Seems like I'm always on the run)

Well I never sing alone
And I love to be the star
And travellin' on the road
Has left it's battle scars
Well I feel my world is movin'
Lawd It's just around the bend
My song was born on the highway
And that's where it's gonna end

And I feel like I'm 
Like I'm flyin' high
(Flyin' high)
And I feel like I'm so
Lawd I'm so damn high
And it seems like that day
Just ain't ever gonna come
(Seems like I'm always on the run)
