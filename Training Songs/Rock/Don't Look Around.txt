Don't look around
'Cause I'm never coming back
It's high time
You saw the last of me

You thought I was a whiner
I'd forgotten where to go
I had no place to lay my head to rest
I had to go

Don't look around
'Cause I'm never coming back
It's high time
You saw the last of me

Whoah
Had to change my mind
You're going to change my mind 
Now I'm working all day long
I'm singing for my food
Baby, you know that I've got everything I need

I've given all I can
The rest belongs to me
Fact was it didn't matter
Just who I had to be

Don't look around
'Cause I'm never coming back
It's high time
You saw the last of me

Whoah
Had to change my mind
You're going to change my mind

I'm gunnin' right on through the town
Don't need you anymore
Now I think I'll turn my back and walk away from you

We're livin' in the country
Doing everything we please
I don't want you comin' round swirling up a be

Don't look around
'Cause I'm never coming back
It's high time
You saw the last of me

Whoah
Had to change my mind
You're going to change my mind
