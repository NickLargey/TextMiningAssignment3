I'm not saying that I'm something special
But you might know my name to some degree
Sometimes I can't believe that I'm still standing
And it feels pretty good to be me

I get to live out here in California
I got a palm tree and a swimming pool
Have some fun and try to play my music
Was all I really said I could do

And if anybody asks me, Joe how do you do it
'Cause you do it with such style and grace
I just shake my head and smile
Look 'em in the eyes and say
I'm just lucky that way, just lucky

Got a good woman and she makes me happy
Most of the time I make her happy too
We decided we should live together
So we both said 'I do'

And when someone says, hey Joe, I saw you on TV
And how do you know what to play
I just shake my head and smile
Look 'em in the eyes and say
I'm just lucky that way

Started in the middle of nowhere
I didn't have far to fall
And the times I thought were the end of the world
Didn't turn out so bad after all

Yeah, I started in the middle of nowhere
I didn't have far to fall
And the times I thought were the end of the world
Didn't turn out so bad after all

I'll let you all in on a little secret
If I can share with you a thing or two
If you just act like you know what you're doing
Everybody thinks that you do

And when anybody asks me, Joe, how do you do it
'Cause you do it with such style and grace
I just shake my head and smile,
Look 'em in the eyes and say
I'm just lucky, I'm just lucky
I'm just lucky that way
I'm just lucky that way
I'm just lucky
