Oh, you never let it on, all you wanted was a little disaster
It's temporary, it's temporary
It's temporary, it's temporary
And now you, you knew it all along
Make it till the morning, we can think about it after
It's temporary, it's temporary
It's temporary, it's temporary

They don't ask no,
It's temporary, it's temporary
It's temporary, it's temporary

I really don't know why I let it roam
(?) can be the moment, it's about to fall
It's temporary, it's temporary
It's temporary, it's temporary

They don't ask no,
And they don't ask no
They don't ask no
So you, you never let it on
Make it till the morning, we can think about it after
It's temporary, it's temporary
It's temporary, it's temporary

So all you wanted was an honest (?)
(?) got the one (?)

They don't ask no,
And they don't ask no
They don't ask no
So you, you never let it on
Make it till the morning, we can think about it after
It's temporary, it's temporary
It's temporary, it's temporary
