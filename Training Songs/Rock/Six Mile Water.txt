You and me used to be like brothers
On the nights we got drunk to each other
You know me, I used to have some wit
It ended up in a shit filled sandpit
We come from across the border
We drink the six mile water
This mongrel needs a new home
This mongrel needs a new home

That time when things got better
We'd take trips across the wire
Like the night we took mad acid
Swore we saw the city hall on fire
We come from across the border
We drink the six mile water
This mongrel needs a new home
This mongrel needs a new home

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
But I'm not ready for home

Bukowski day, I'm gonna miss it
We'd get together each month for a day
All the memories I have are
Decked out in Presbyterian Gray
We came from across the border
We drank the six mile water
This mongrel needs a new home
This mongrel needs a new home

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
But I'm not ready for home

Now, me and you don't talk of one another
It never really started out that way
I always meant to write you a letter
I always meant to call you some day
We came from across the water
We drank the six mile water
This mongrel needs a new home
This mongrel needs a new home

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
But I'm not ready for home

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
