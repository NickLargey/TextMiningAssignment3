Rock show
You came to see a rock show
A big gigantic cock show
You came to see it all
Rock show
You came to hear it
You came to sneer it
You came to do it all

Do you want to get it for credit?
Forget it
Don't bet it
Call in the medic
It's pathetic
You've gotta let it go

Let's go
Rock show
C'mon

Rock show
You came to see a rock show
This ain't a fucking talk show
You came to see it all
Rock show
You came to fear it
You came to sear it
You came to do it all

Do you want to get it for credit?
Forget it
Don't bet it
Call in the medic
It's pathetic
You've gotta let it go

Do you want to get it for credit?
Forget it
Don't bet it
Call in the medic
It's pathetic
You've gotta let it go

Let's go
Rock show
C'mon

Rock show
Let's go
Rock show
Let's go
Rock show
Let's go
Rock show
C'mon
