Good Lord, I tried
To push her memory to the back o' my mind
"Mustang Sally" from her head to her toe
My life was in shambles
When she shot down that road

That was then, this is now
I'd I learned my lesson, I forgot it somehow
Headlights in the driveway,
A knock at the door,
I hear that voice, and I know what's in store...

Whoa Oh Whoa Oh
I looked in those angel eyes
Whoa Oh Whoa Oh
The devil was in disguise, year

She took me, 
Down the road to ruin
(Yeah baby) my head was spinnin' round
Don't know what I'm doin'
Back on the road to ruin...

(Listen)
Hip Hips 
Sexy legs_
Ain't no surprise I got on my knees and begged
Forked tongue, and pointed tail
If we make it this time, it's a cold day in hell

Whoa Oh Whoa Oh
She said she'd be sweet this time yeah
Whoa Oh Whoa Oh
One kiss and it all seemed so right

She took me,
Down the road to ruin
(Yeah baby)my head was spinnin' round
Don't know what I'm doin'
Back on the road to ruin...

Guitar solo-

Whoa Oh Whoa Oh
She said she'd be sweet this time
Whoa Oh Whoa Oh
The devil was I n disguise

Chorus out-
