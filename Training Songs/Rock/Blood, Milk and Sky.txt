The siren sings a lonely song
Of all the wants and hungers
The lust of love a brute desire
The ledge of life goes under

Divide the dream into the flesh
Kaleidoscope and candle eyes
Empty winds scrape on the soul
But never stop to realize

Animal whisperings
Intoxicate the night
Hypnotize the desperate
Slow motion light

Wash away into the rain
Blood, milk and sky
Hollow moons illuminate
And beauty never dies

Running wild, running blind
In the body deep
A thousand years beside myself
I do not sleep

Seduce the world at rest
Dead water lies
Ride the only one who knows
Beauty never dies
