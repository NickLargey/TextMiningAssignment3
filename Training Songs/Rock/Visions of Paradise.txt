Don't tell me when something is beautiful
And don't tell me how to talk to my friends
Just tell me the names of the stars in the sky
What's your favorite song
Tell me the names of the lovers you had
Before I came along

Don't put your arms around me
And don't hold me tight
'Cause I could get used to your vision of paradise

And don't ask me where all of the pain goes
'Cause you make me feel that I don't know myself
You say that you want me forever and I
I say that love is no crime
So tell me the names of the children we'll have
At the end of the line

Don't put your arms around me
And don't hold me tight
'Cause I could get used to your vision of paradise
And don't let me near the garden

Of earthly delights
'Cause I could get used to your vision of paradise
Of paradise
Of paradise

Just use your heart not your head
While I fall apart in my bed
I find myself aching for you
I feel myself breaking in two

So don't tell me when I should come on home
There might be a time you don't want me around
So don't build your world around me
And don't hold me tight
'Cause I could get used to your vision of paradise
