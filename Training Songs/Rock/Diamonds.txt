Here our bodies burn diamonds.
I know. 
Into ocean tread.
Into fire bled.
Peeling back fur. It's gone.
I like to destroy myself.
I don't want to do you wrong.
Well, just go ahead and break my body down.
Let's drown, into the sea.
And this old heart of mine pumps down deep, and sweet.
Oh sugar don't beg me now.
" Oh what's the use of draggin' you don?" the jackals howl.

Oh babe, and if it's here we burn, won't the love return?
You'll never learn. 
Oh sugar don't beg me now.
Oh the pressure's great, the fates await, and they 
Oh sugar don't beg me now.
"Can we turn the coal?" but diamonds is the goal.
Oh sugar don't beg me now.
Here our bodies burn diamonds.
I know.
I like to destroy.
