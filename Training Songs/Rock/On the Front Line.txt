Coming from the ghetto there's no future for the poor
Where the cops don't care if a bullet hits a bone
Where's there's unemployment and no work for you and me
A youth culture will rise to fight you all!

On the front line [Repeat x4]

This is my town not a pretty place to be
Where a kid's life is lost taking him into drugs
See him fucking drown each day more and more
Rebel youth wake up and hear the call

On the front line [Repeat x4]

These boots I wear are strong and they are for work
For the dead end jobs with no future or any hope
I've been victimized and oppressed for too long
Generation of scars hear the fucking call

On the front line [Repeat x4]

Casualties army new breed of today
Generation of scars will fucking have their say
Rejected and unwanted by the system
Casualties army rebel youth take a stand

We were taught to be hard to survive in this world
If you don't like my ways then f*ck you all
This is a call to the rebels of today
To unite be counted and fucking be heard

On the front line [Repeat x4]
