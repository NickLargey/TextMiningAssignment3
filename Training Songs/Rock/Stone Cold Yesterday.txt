I want a word with you, 'bout some average jimmy.
He told me things that I guess I never knew.
He was a bad dancer, 'til he learned to shimmy.
He was adrift until the world came into view.

He had an old stand-by. not your average betty.
She showed me things that I guess I always knew.
She was a slow burner, 'til the world got steady.
She wasn't found until the early afternoon.

Hey, get me out of this some way.
I wouldn't feel so inhibited.
Gotta get me out of this some way.
I want to see what it is thay see.

Stone cold yesterday, changed, how did it change me?
Don't it make you wonder, man?
Stone cold yesterday, changed, how did it change me?

And I walked, and I breathed, and I tried to not let it change me.
