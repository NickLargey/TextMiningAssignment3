You can see the water
Comin' outta the ground
You can see the foundation
Slipping down

And you can't help but wonder
How long it will be
Before the restless ocean
Comes lapping to 
the branches of the trees

When the full moon
Pulls up a mighty tide
And there's no place to run
And no place to hide

When the ghosts in the ocean
Turn up the sea
And the waves come crashin'
Over you and me

I can see it comin'

In the distance is the gloom
Of the end of days
When the sun calls home
Its wandering rays

When all of the iron 
Has gone to rust
And every living thing
Has turned to dust

There won't be anyone left
To float your boat
They all went to high ground
While their vessels still float

They scream God's will
But you know it's a lie
By your own book
It says by fire next time

The golden egg's cracked open
And there was nothing inside
Cast all dispersions
Build a levy of lies

I can see it comin'

Bite down on the leather
And close your eyes
There's nothin' to be done
That can turn the tide

The money in your eyes
Has left you blind
You'll be the one drownin'
When it's swimmin' time

I can see it comin'
