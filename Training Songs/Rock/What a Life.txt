Wasted, ruined, tragic 'cause it doesn't have to be like this
Pasty, dirty, sweaty, faithless, greasy, dirty, smelly, wretched
Make it be a whore, a tabloid cliche
Nasty, spoiled, deceptive, wrecked
Mousey, grungy, deceptive, wrecked

[Chorus:]
What a life - you wear it like propriety
What a life - you do it like you really mean it
What a life - I watch it like a scary movie
What a life, what a life, what a life
 
STD's, sick, sex, drug-addled debauchery monger
Messy, stringy, pathetic, hopeless, dredgey, stringy, pathetic, hopeless

[Chorus]

Wear it like a badge, wear it like a crown, wear it like a trophy
Wear it like a badge, wear it like a crown, wear it like a trophy
Wear it like a badge, wear it like a crown, open like a cut
Pick it like a scab, feed it like a dog

[Chorus]

Wasted, ruined, tragic 'cause it doesn't have to be like this
Greasy, dirty, sweaty, smelly
Faithless, grungy, pathetic, wretched

[Chorus]
