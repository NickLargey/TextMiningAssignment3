When she's on her best behavior
Don't be tempted by her favor
Never turn your back on mother Earth

Towns are hurled from A to B
By hands that look so smooth to me
Never turn your back on mother Earth

Grasp at straws that don't want grasping
Gaze at clouds that come down crashing
Never turn your back on mother Earth

Three days and two nights away from my friends
Amen to anything that brings a quick return to my friends
Never turn your back on mother Earth
I'll admit I was unfaithful

But from now I'll be more faithful
Never turn your back on mother
Never turn your back on mother
Never turn your back on mother Earth
