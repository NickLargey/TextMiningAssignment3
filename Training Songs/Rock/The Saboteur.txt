I am the saboteur and I'll let you into my world
Sometimes it's hard to live and sometimes it's hard to love you
I keep pushing you away, doing things so you won't stay with me

Wouldn't it be cool, if I could let it go
All of the things that I never seem to control
I am the saboteur and I'm fighting inside my mind
The harder I ignore is the more it crashes down
I see you by, you push me babe, see if I fade away in time

Wouldn't it be cool, if I could let it go
All of the things that I never seem to control
I am the saboteur and I'll let you into my world
I'm love in here but I'll let you know
Well, I'm the big means anymore, anymore as I stand tall

Wouldn't it be cool, if I could let it go
Wouldn't it be cool, if I could let it all go
Wouldn't it be cool, if I could let it go
Wouldn't it be cool, if I could just let it all go
