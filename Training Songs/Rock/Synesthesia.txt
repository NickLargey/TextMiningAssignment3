I saw pictures from the space shuttle
Of America tonight
I could almost see my house
I could almost see the rest of my life
And my mother's in the hospital
And my friends are in the news
Collecting trophies for the songs they wrote
While we lived in the shadow of the moon

Yes, I never made a gold record
And I've never been to Mars
But I've traveled around this world
Shooting fireworks and falling stars, and prison bars

And my father's got a decent job
And he's finally pulling through
There's more to life than singing songs we wrote
While we lived in the shadow of the moon

And I see colors when I hear your voice
Put on your wings that put gravity on trial
And I see colors, I don't hear the noise
Because we're only flying for a while
Because we're only flying for a while

I saw this picture of my niece
Twisting high above the narrow beam
And my brother looked so proud
Like he woke up in this perfect dream

And I've known you all my life
But I knew you long before that tune
Let's go dancing to the songs we wrote
When we lived in the shadow of the moon

And I see colors when I hear your voice
Put on your wings that put gravity on trial
I see colors, I don't hear the noise
Because we're only flying for a while

And I could love you in the falling rain
Like many things, this is a storm we're meant to ride
Like synesthesia aboard a stalling plane
It's like we're only flying for a while
Flying for a while

Whoooaaaaaaa (x3)

And I see colors when I hear your voice
Put on your wings that put gravity on trial
I see colors, and I don't feel the choice
Because we're only flying for a while

And I could love you in the falling rain
Like many things, this is a storm we're meant to ride
Like synesthesia aboard a stalling plane
It's like we're only flying for a while

Flying for a while
Flying for a while
Flying for a while
Whoaaaaaaaaaaaa
