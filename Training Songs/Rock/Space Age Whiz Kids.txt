I used to play that pinball, I used to go outside 
I had to spend my money, get on your bus and ride 
I used to go out dancing, put on my high-heeled shoes 
Get in my short black Chevy, go on a downtown cruise 
I feel a little bit mixed up, maybe I'm obsolete 
All us pinball pool sharks, we just can't compete 

Space age whiz kids kids 
Leaders in the field 
Pioneers of research 
Space age whiz kids 

Arcade mothership monsters, laser beam blast shield eyes 
Full on space age madness, make-believe satellite skies 
Alien ships approaching, there's trouble in sector five 
Left hand on the joystick, right hand hyperspace drive 

Space age whiz kids kids, Space age whiz kids 
Space age whiz kids kids, Space age whiz kids 
Space age whiz kids 
Space age whiz kids 
Space age whiz kids 
Space age whiz kids 

They got nothing to do, put another quarter in 
Pay those space age dues 
Donkey Kong high score, Pac Man's on a roll 
Klingons on the warpath, whiz kids on patrol 

Space age whiz kids, Space age whiz kids 
Space age whiz kids, Space age whiz kids 
Space age whiz kids, Space age whiz kids 
Space age whiz kids, Space age whiz kids 
I like space age whiz kids 
I like, I need, I need quarters, quarters! 
Give me quarters! I like quarters!
