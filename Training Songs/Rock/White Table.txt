Meet me darlin', won't you?
I've been waiting for you
At my lonesome white table
Ready, willing, and able

Torn in two
Beaten and scarred
I'll give you my love but not my heart
Tattered and worn
Battered and bruised
I'll give you my love but it won't be true

Someday darlin' maybe
You could be my baby
Until then I'll be waitin'
At my lonesome white table

Torn in two
Beaten and scarred
I'll give you my love but not my heart
Tattered and worn
Battered and bruised
I'll give you my love but it won't be true
