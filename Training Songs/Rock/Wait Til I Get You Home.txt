I LOVE THE WAY YOU SMILE WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FUN
I LOVE THE WAY YOU SAY THAT I'M THE ONE
YOU MAKE ME SO HAPPY
BUT THERE'S ALL THESE PEOPLE AROUND
SO WAIT TIL I GET YOU HOME
AND THE WALLS COME DOWN

TONIGHT THE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT AND THE MUSIC'S LOUD
BUT I'M KIND OF SHY WHEN I'M IN A CROWD
YOU TELL ME DON'T WORRY
IT'S FINE TO BE PAINTING THE TOWN
JUST WAIT TIL I GET YOU HOME
WAIT TIL I GET YOU HOME
WAIT TIL I GET YOU HOME
AND THE WALLS COME DOWN 

I LOVE THE WAY YOU SMILE WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FUN
I LOVE THE WAY YOU SAY THAT I'M THE ONE
I LOVE THE WAY YOU DANCE AND YOU HOLD ME CLOSE
I LOVE THE WAY YOU WHISPER THAT I'M THE MOST
YOU KISS ME, I'M DIZZY
BUT THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE AROUND
JUST WAIT TIL I GET YOU HOME
WAIT TIL I GET YOU HOME
WAIT TIL I GET YOU HOME
AND THE WALLS COME DOWN
(COULDN'T WE DO THIS IN PRIVATE?)
