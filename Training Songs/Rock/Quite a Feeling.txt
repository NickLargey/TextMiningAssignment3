Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a mess

Someone convinced me of jealousy
It's the best compliment I'll ever get
So I shouldn't be the sad girl
Shouldn't but I said I was
And who's going to tell
Who's going to tell this time?
It's a blizzard outside
Don't you dare stay inside

Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a mess

And what of the light boxing in the back
Why do I fear the poison I spread out
There's no need to swing back
Coasters, 
(The bottle of pain/the battle display)
And he's going to fail,
He's going to fail this time

Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a mess

It's a blizzard outside
Don't you dare stay inside
It's a blizzard outside
Don't you dare stay inside

Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a mess
