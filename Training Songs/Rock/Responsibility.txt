Poor ole surrender Mimosa
Finally burnt out by the sun
I feel pretty burnt out myself
When the long, hot summer is done

Summertime's long been my favorite
Now I can't grab it no more
Can't find no time for a fish on the line
Or that swing in the old Sycamore

I'm in such a hurry now
It starts to worry me
Stop an' smell the roses?
Baby, I can't hardly see

No, I ain't forgotten just how good it all can be
But I've got so much responsibility
Got so much responsibility

Baby, you know how I'm working
Sorry I'm busy so much
Sorry those days when the world went our way
Are so hard to return to an' to touch

Maybe our future looks brighter
Maybe our ship will come in
Maybe these years an' these muletrain careers
Will be things we won't think about then

But I'm in such a hurry now
It start to worry me
Stop an' smell the roses?
Baby I can't hardly see

No, I ain't forgotten just how good it all can be
But I've got so much responsibility
Got so much responsibility

Competition's heavy on a hard line wreckin' crew
The good ones never leave
An' still there's always someone new
Pressure comes down hard up on a top notch rivet team
We don't get time to pace ourselves
We don't stand around and dream

Poor ole surrender Mimosa
Finally burnt out by the heat
I feel pretty burnt out myself
When I make that ole turn down our street

Summertime's long been my favorite
Now it's ole autumn I love
Summertime fun on some beach in the sun
Is not somethin' I'm seein' much of

I'm in such a hurry now
It starts to worry me
Stop an' smell the roses?
Baby, I can't hardly see

No, I ain't forgotten just how good it all can be
But I've got so much responsibility
Got so much responsibility
Got so much responsibility
