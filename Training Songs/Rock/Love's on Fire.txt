Come clean with me about what you're afraid of
I don't believe in never wanting love
U say U like it, U say it's all right, but I saw U crying alone last night

Take my hand & take your turn, there's chance that U won't get hurt
Take a heart that you can't return, love's on fire but it don't burn

You're not the first one who''s been downhearted
Remember when I was shook up and torn apart
I know abandon and how it hurts you
When your heart's breaking it hurts me too

Take my hand & take your turn, there's chance that U won't get hurt
Take a heart that you can't return, love's on fire but it don't burn

Aw, come with me baby, you will see what good love, love can be
Love's on fire, love's on fire, love's on fire, love's on fire, hey!

You're not the first one who's been downhearted
Remember when I was shook up and torn apart

Take my hand & take your turn, there's chance that U won't get hurt
Take a heart that you can't return, love''s on fire but it don't burn
Take my hand & take your turn, there's chance that U won't get hurt
Take a heart that you can't return, love's on fire but it don't burn
