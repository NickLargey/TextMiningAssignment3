However you feel,
Whatever it takes,
Whenever it's real,
Whatever awaits,
Whatever you need,
However so slight,
Whenever it's real,
Whenever it's right.

I've been thinking long and hard 
About the things you said to me,
Like a bitter stranger,
And now I see the long, 
The short, the middle and what's inbetween,
I could spit on a stranger,
(Pour/pull me out)
You're a bitter stranger.
(Pour me out)

Whatever you feel,
Whatever it takes,
Whenever it's real,
Whatever awaits me,
Whatever you need,
However so slight,
Whenever it leads,
Whenever it's right.

Honey I'm a prize and you're a catch 
And we're a perfect match,
Like two bitter strangers,
And now I see the long, 
The short of it and I can make it last,
I could spit on a stranger,
(Pour me out)
You're a bitter stranger,
(Pour me out)
I could spit on a stranger,
(Pour me out)
You're a bitter stranger.
(Pour me out)

I see the sunshine in your eyes,
I'll try the things you'll never try,
I'll be the one that leaves 
You high...high...high
