Ya know, the Motor City is burning, babe
There ain't a thing in the world they can do
Ya know, the Motor City is burning people
There ain't a thing that white society can do

Ma home town burning down to the ground
Worser than Vietnam

Let me tell you how it started now

It started on 12th Clair Mount that morning
It made the, the pig cops all jump and shout
I said, it started on 12th Clair Mount that morning
It made the, the pigs in the street go freak out

The fire wagons kept comin', baby
But the Black Panther Snipers wouldn't let them put it out
Wouldn't let them put it out, wouldn't let them put it out

Get it on

Well, there were fire bombs bursting all around the people
Ya know there was soldiers standing everywhere
I said there was fire bombs bursting all around me, baby
Ya know there was National Guard everywhere

I can hear my people screaming
Sirens fill the air, fill the air, fill the air

Your mama, papa don't know what the trouble is
You see, they don't know what it's all about
I said, your mama, papa don't know what the trouble is, baby
They just can't see what it's all about

I get the news, read the newspapers, baby, baby?
You just get out there in the street and check it out

I said, the Motor City is burning, people
I ain't hanging 'round to fight it out
I said, the Motor City is burning, people
Just not hang around to fight it out

Well, I'm taking my wife and my people and they're on TV
Well, just before I go, baby, [Incomprehensible]
Fireman's on the street, people all around

Now, I guess it's true
I'd just like to strike a match for freedom myself
I may be a white boy, but I can be bad, too
Yes, it's true now, yes, it's true now

Yes

Let it all burn, let it all burn, let it all burn
