Open your eyes and see your downfall.
You've tried and tried but your faithfulness isn't real.
With a mind that's plagued inside, 
By the common misconceptions you idolize.
Hang your head shame,
You manipulate everyone.

I put the whole world in front of you.
Would it be too much to ask for,
Would it be too much to say.
Everything you had dreamed of,
Well it won't come back to you.
No, no it won't come back.
No, no it won't come back to you.

Do you feel, do you feel like you're running away?
Did you ever have any intention, to say 
you never meant it. To save yourself from ending.
I'll stand by the ocean and watch your body washing away. 

Do you feel, do you feel like you're running away?
Did you ever have any intention, to say 
you never meant it. To save yourself from ending.
Here's a toast to devotion, as your body washes away. 

While you float face down.
With a twist to your crescent lips
Your intentions were so elegant.
Lie, after lie, after lie
Glorified by the ones you despise.

You could of given more than what you left for me. 
I too was blind before I opened up my eyes to see. 
You should of given more, more than you left for me. 
Your vices won't weight me down tonight. 

If you could have untied that weight from your leg, 
I could of saved you. I could of saved you.
But the one thing I learned from all of this. 
Is to admit when your time is finally up.

Do you feel, do you feel like you're running away?
Did you ever have any intention, to say 
you never meant it. To save yourself from ending.
I'll stand by the ocean and watch your body washing away. 

Do you feel, do you feel like you're running away?
Did you ever have any intention, to say 
you never meant it. To save yourself from ending.
Here's a toast to devotion, as your body washes away. 

Raise your glass face down.
Take a bow, all our eyes are off you now
