A rollin' rock, electric shock
She gives a lickin' that doesn't stop
She line 'em up, push you 'round
Smokin' rings going round and round

Her hot potatoes
Will elevate you
Her bad behavior
Will leave you standing proud
Hard as a rock

Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock, yeah

The lightnin' rod, strike it hot
It's gonna hit you like the Rushmore rock
No nicotine, and no pipe dreams
So low and dirty it's darn right mean

Hell elevator
I'll see you later
No, I ain't gonna take it
Listing, I'm bustin' out
Hard as a rock

Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock, yeah

Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yeah
I'm gettin' harder

Harder than a rock

Well, I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Babe, I'm harder than a rock, yeah

Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock, yeah

Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Guess I harder, harder, harder
Harder than a rock
