Well, I'm off to meet my fortune in the big old world
You know, it won't take long to get where I'm going
And you'll soon forget me if you've got any sense in your sleepy head

Dirty blue jeans and bloody knees
We slept all night in a nightclub toilet

All my friends are in debt
I was the only one with any money left
I left my house at midnight
I let the pale moon light my face
Rusty as a teaspoon and twice as useless

I'm sick of sucking on second hand air
I've gotta get off the train and have an affair
With the pretty girl sitting across from you
You know that she would do; any girl would do

Oh, don't talk
Talk to me about passion
I spent it all
I spent it all
And then I saved it up

And I'm off to meet my fortune in the big old world
You know, it won't take long to get where I'm going
Maybe it'll help me to feel myself again

Dirty blue jeans and bloody knees
I have my arm round you in the stranger's doorway

Selfishness was always the coolest flaw
You don't need to tell me twice
You leave your parents for your friends
For your new-found cooler friends
Then you meet a guy, you stop seeing your friends

Oh, don't talk
Talk to me about caring
I spent it all
I spent it all
And then I saved it up

And I'm still in control
I'm still in control

Well, I'm off to meet my fortune in a big old world
Mother nature (and the...?) couldn't stop me
And you'll soon forget me if you've got any sense in your sleepy head

Dirty blue jeans and bloody knees
We fucked all night in my brother's old bedroom

And if it doesn't work out, I'll come home and be alone
I'll be alone
I'll be alone
