If your lookin' for trouble
I'm the man to see
If you're looking for satisfaction
There's satisfaction guaranteed
Oh, I was cool as a bunny on ice
Hotter than the rolling dice
Send you to heaven take you to hell
I ain't fooling can't you tell

I'm a live wire
I'm a live wire
I'm a live wire
Gonna set this town on fire

And if you need some lovin'
And if you need some man
You've got the phone and the number
And I got no future plans
Oh come on honey you've got nothing to lose
You've got the thirst
I've got the booze
Give you an inch
Take you a mile
I'm gonna make you fry
I'm a live wire
(Live wire)
I'm a live wire
(Live wire)
I'm a live wire
(Live wire)
Holy smoking sweet desire
Like a hot rod baby
Oh stick this in you're fuse box
Oh cooler than a buny on ice
Hotter than the rolling dice
Wilder than a drunken might
You're gonna burn to night

I'm a live wire
(Live wire)
I'ma live wire
(Live wire)
I'm a live wire
(Live wire)

And I'm gonna set this town of fire
Live wire
(Live wire)
I'm a live wire
(Live wire)
Oh I'm your live wire
(Live wire)

I'm a live wire (Live wire)
Look at me burn
Ah look at me, guilty
Soak my circuit
Burn burn burn burn burn
