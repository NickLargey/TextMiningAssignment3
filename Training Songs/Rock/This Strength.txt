We could really go for so much more
There must be something still worth fighting for
Might be nice to even break the law
We could really be the crudest pair
I want to see you in a different light
I want to have you when the sky is bright tonight
This strength will take us through the day
Our world will turn and never change
This strength is you and me 
And more like lovers stranded on the shore
A little boy will stand before you now
A little child so deep inside your bones 
And you will say that he will always stay, always stay
This strength will take us through the day
Our world will turn but never change
This strength is you, and me, and more
Like lovers stranded on the shore
And when the night time closes in
We'll have our laughter and our dreams
We'll close our eyes and slip away
