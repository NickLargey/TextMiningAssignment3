The crusaders and their stooges 
All you renegade rulers 
All you spotlight fugitives 
All you shakers, all you movers 
All you cutthroat dealers 
And you small-time users 
All you turncoat schemers 
All you victors, all you losers 

You play the king and you play the pawn 
You give up and you soldier on 
This is the last crusade we're on 
This is the last crusade we're on 

There's a lighthouse on a battered shore 
Gotta fight now, never mattered more 
And the black tongues spitting poison 
Spare no one 
Gotta keep on, gotta keep on 
Till the Ghosts of War come marching in 
They've been reborn, they're free from sin 

You play the king and you play the pawn 
You give up and you soldier on 
This is the last crusade we're on 

This is the last crusade we're on 
You play the king and you play the pawn 
You give up and you soldier on
This is the last crusade we're on 
This is the last crusade we're on 

Now tell me, who do I look like to you? 
Someone you thought you knew 
Drinking wine in the afternoon 
A rebel today is tomorrow's tycoon 
Arm in arm, arm in arm 
We are our father's sons and daughters, one by one 
Marching off to kingdom come 
And we're hunting down 
We're trying to find 

The architects of the wasted mind 
And the way we laugh and the way we live 
Brace for the aftermath 
Something's got to give 

You play the king and you play the pawn 
You give up and you soldier on 
This is the last crusade we're on 
This is the last crusade we're on 
You play the king and you play the pawn 
You give up and you soldier on 
This is the last crusade we're on 
This is the last crusade we're on
