You don't love me, just the kissin'
Don't trust the facts, trust the fiction
I'll take the picture
I'll take the picture

What it is and what it should be
Baby I want everything
What it is and what it should be

Baby it's the love you love
Baby it's the love you love
Not me
Baby it's the love you love
Baby it's the love you love

I wanna stay up all night again
I wanna work hard
Don't wanna play again
Don't wanna

Where we are and where we should be
Baby I want everything
Where we are and where we should be

Baby it's the love you love
Baby it's the love you love
Not me
Baby it's the love you love
Baby it's the love you love
