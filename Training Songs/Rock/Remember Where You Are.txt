Milling round, encroaching on 
My right of way and under the 
Battle scars of Daddy's latest lesson 

Little time for intuition 
Little time for cry-babies 
Come on son can't you not take a joke? 
More sticks and stones to break you 

It's freezing in here, can't even dress yourself 
Lie awake still waiting on a single bite of cherry for you 
Hold it in your arms 
Jeopardize what little you have 
See any further than your own faults 
A single bite of cherry for you 
And yours is not to question 

And down the road a shining haven 
(rocks), slaves and _ mothers 
Live around the corner from themselves 
You'll never break the chain will you? 

It's freezing in here, can't even dress yourself 
Lie awake still waiting on a single bite of cherry for you 
Hold it in your arms 
Don't jeopardize what little you have 
See any further than your own faults 
A single bite of cherry for you and yours is not to question 

Question it all, clutch your pride and all you could ever learn 
The sorrow __ 
no hope left for you to nurture 
I just wrote the ending years ago 
Way down the line 

Don't you run too far away from home 
Don't you trust what you have never known 
Don't go far remember where you are 

Remember where you are 

A single bite of cherry for you
