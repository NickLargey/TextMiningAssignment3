Oh you don't love me the way that I 
I love you
'Cause if you did girl you would not 
Do those things you do
You kill my heart just to see if 
I will rise
Above your anger and above your lies

And all I see of you
Is when you're not so busy
Oh you're not so busy

And you don't love me the way that I
I love you
'Cause if you did girl you would not 
Do the things you do
You turned my life around and for that I am glad, oh
However much I love you, this love is getting bad

And oh my darling you could chose
The words that only you could use
But you know you'll always be my girl, oh girl
I'd take you out just for a bite
And show you all the city sights
But you know you'll always be my girl, girl

But you don't love me the way that I 
I love you, oh
'Cause if you did boy you would not 
Do those things you do
You kill my heart just to see if 
I will rise, oh
Above your anger and above your lies

But all I see of you
Is when you're not so busy
Oh you're not so busy, yeah

Do do ohoh
Do do do

If you don't love me you don't care
You don't love me you don't care
'Cause you don't love me you don't care
You don't love me you don't care
