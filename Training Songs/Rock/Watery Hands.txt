When you leave this coast
Take me with you 
Because I can’t live without you 
She’s too much like you 
She’s bigger than
Pyramids 
On water skies 
And we both know that I’ve got bad knees 
For tricks I won’t do
So I’m swimming back to you

Sunken white 
And fully intercoastal 
But I still can’t forget
Your farewell toast to our dead
On the beach
If I read these
You dropped anchor and dropped me 
Now my flag flies blue 
So I’m swimming back to you

You’re made of water 
I’m made of sand 
Don’t quit your teeth 
Just let me kiss your
Watery hands 

Stop, watch, and do it

You’re made of water 
I’m made of sand 
Don’t quit your teeth 
Just let me kiss your
Watery hands
