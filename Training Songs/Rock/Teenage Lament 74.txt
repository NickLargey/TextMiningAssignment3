What a drag it is these gold lam√© jeans
Is this the coolest way to get though your teens?
Well, I cut my hair weird, I read that it was in
I looked like a rooster that was drowned and raised again

What are you gonna do?
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Why don't you get away?
I'm gonna leave today

I ran into my room and I fell down on my knees
Well I thought that fifteen was gonna be a breeze
I picked up my guitar to blast away the clouds
But somebody in the next room yelled, "You gotta turn that damn thing down"

What are you gonna do?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
Why don't you get away?
Well I'm gonna cry all day

And I know trouble is brewing out there
But I can hardly care
They fight all night about his private secretary
Lipstick stain, blonde hair, oh

What are you gonna do?
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Why don't you run away?
I'm gonna leave today

But even
I don't know
What I'm gonna do
Don't know what I'm gonna do, no

What are you gonna do?
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Why don't you run away?
I'm gonna leave today

What are you gonna do?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
Why don't you get away?
Well, I'd rather cry all day

What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

What are you gonna do?
Gonna do, gonna do

What are you gonna do?
Gonna do, gonna do

What are you gonna do?
Gonna do, gonna do

What are you gonna do?
Gonna do, gonna do

What are you gonna do?
Gonna do, gonna do

What are you gonna do?
Gonna do, gonna do (Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice)

What are you gonna do?
Gonna do, gonna do
