a glass eye I use to spy
have little tiny teeth that tell a golden lie
my feet are small, I'm not that tall
I tell you the truth, but really not at all

I'm small like a superball, THROW me at the wall
I'm FRAGILE like an eggshell, I'm mad as hell

my teeth are gold, I'm not that old 
I would tell you the truth, but I'm not that bold 
hook me with your hand, my mouth is full of sand
everything I say ends with and

I'm small like a SUPERBALL, throw me at the wall
I'm fragile like an eggshell, I'm MAD as hell
