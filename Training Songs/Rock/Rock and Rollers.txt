Rollin' down the highway,
I got a feeling when the clock strikes nine
We're gonna have ourselves, yeah, a real good time.
We're feeling more excitement,
I got my tickets in my hand
We're gonna keep on rockin' to the beat of the band
So play it for me, yeah!

The show is just beginning,
And the lights have all gone down
The curtain's ready to rise, the spots are bright in our eyes
They brought down the whole house,
And they walked out on the stage
They're coming on with a song, that's so hot and so loud!
So play it for me, yeah!

[Chorus]
Rock & Rollers, we're gonna see ya tonight
Rock & Rollers, we're gonna be there tonight

Can't help but move, yeah.
Stop my feet to that rock and roll beat
The band is hot, come on, yeah, we like it a lot
So play it for me, yeah!

[Chorus: x2]

Can't help but move, yeah,
Stomp my feet to that rock and roll beat
The band is hot, come on, yeah, we like it a lot
So play it for me, yeah!

[Chorus]
