I got it all right here in my heart
I got love to bring you
I got it all here in my head
I got a song to sing you

Come on, come on
Come with me tonight
Come ride my fire

Let's get it on
'Cause I need you tonight
I'm caught up in my desire

I get much higher
I get much higher
Bein' in you, yes I do

Yes, I feel there's a change in the air
There's a good vibration
And I find that bein' with you each time
You're a fascination

Turn me, turn me
Turn me on
To a new sensation

Long as I'm with you
I'm goin' inside
To the realization

I get much higher
I get much higher
Bein' in you, yes I do

Yes, I feel there's a change in the air
There's a good vibration
And I find that bein' with you each time
You're a fascination

Turn me, turn me
Turn me on
To a new sensation

Long as I'm with you
I'm goin' inside
To the realization

I get much higher
I get much higher
Bein' in you, yes I do

I get much higher
I get much higher now
I get much higher
Bein' in you, yes I do
Woo, hoo, hoo
