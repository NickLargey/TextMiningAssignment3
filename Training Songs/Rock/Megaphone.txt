Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa

Stick to your guns, they fail to protect
I've seen this before and we died in the end
Lept without looking we land in the flames
We don't even care anymore
We're tired of being ignored

Speak up now
Yeah, we're not alone
This is not a joke
Pick up the megaphone
Think out loud
What are you waiting for?
Clear your god damn throat
You are the megaphone
Don't wait (don't wait)
Or turn away (turn away)
Don't choke on words you meant to say
Speak up now you are not alone
This ain't a fucking joke
Pick up the megaphone
Yell "hey!"

Say something, anything to me
Or can you feel something, anything for me?
'Cause it's not enough to wait for the storm
To relent and give up

Speak up now
You are not alone
This is not a joke
Pick up the megaphone
Think out loud
What are you waiting for?
Clear your god damn throat
You are the megaphone
Don't wait (don't wait)
Or turn away (turn away)
Or choke on words you meant to say
Speak up now you are not alone
This is not a joke
Pick up the megaphone
Yell "hey!"

Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa
 
Say something, anything to me
Feel something, anything for me
Say something, Say something
Say something, Say something
Say something, Say something
Say something, Say something
Now speak up
You are not alone
You are the megaphone
Now speak up
You are not alone
You are the megaphone
Yell "hey!"
