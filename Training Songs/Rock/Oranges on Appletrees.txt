Oranges on appletrees
Bugs that mate with bumblebees
Oranges on appletrees

Water comes and water goes
Where it ends no-one really knows
Water rises, waterfalls
Where it comes from no-one knows for sure
It seeps from every pore

We have seen the rain before
But not like this, it's flooding every shore
People come and people go
I can hear their laughter through the door
But no-one's kepping score

Oranges on appletrees
Bugs that mate with bumblebees
One big happy family
Endless possibilities
Oranges on appletrees, and more

I see your face in front of me
You believed what no-one else could see
I feel it deep inside of me
Everything we know shall be released
And everyone will see

Oranges on appletrees, for sure

I used to be the only one
Not now since you have come
Cause you and I have seen the signs
That's why we're running blind
That's why 

Oranges on appletrees
Birds that mate with bumblebees
Endless possibilities

Oranges on appletrees
All the things that we can see
Multigender wannabes

Oranges on appletrees
Bugs that mate with bumblebees
One big happy family
Endless possibilities, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oranges on appletrees, for sure
