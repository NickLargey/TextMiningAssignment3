She's the kind of girl that tends to brown
Freckles on her elbows and her knees
And I'm the boy that passes through these towns
I leave before we find out what it means

I'll send a letter addressed to you
It says you're my California brown and blue
Another chorus line gives into waves
It fades away

So I push through another hotel door
And I pull back the bed sheets till they break
And I sleep so hard I don't even dream
Weightless in the arms of Golden Gate

The only music I want to hear
Is the sound of the last light left disappears
Another songbird gives up it's wings it fades away

Dada dada dada 
Dada dada dada

I'll send a letter addressed to you
It says you're my California brown and blue
Another chorus line gives in to waves
It says your my California Golden Gate

The only music I want to hear is the sound of the last light that disappears
Another songbird gives up it's wings 
It fades away
Another songbird gives up it's wings 
It fades away
