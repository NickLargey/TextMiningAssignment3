You can stab my back, you can steal my flag
But it's alright
Little sticks and stones, break my brittle bones
But I'm alright
Every single day is a little step closer to my new heaven
If that's the way you want it
That's the way you'll get it
If that's what you're thinking
Don't think you won't regret it
If that's the way you see it
Just reach out and touch it
But you better beware it don't burn your hands
So step back and step back
Don't cry, don't cry
I am strong enough, I'm made of serious stuff
Yes I'm alright
You can sling your mud, yeah even draw a little blood
But I'm still alive
Every single word, you're serving up as hot air for my big balloon
If that's the way you want it
That's the way you'll get it
If that's what you're thinking
Don't think you won't regret it
If that's the way you see it
Just reach out and touch it
But you better beware it don't burn your hands
So step back and step back
Don't cry, don't cry
So you bought your new dream
But you're payin' with your dignity so dearly
Don't cry, don't cry
