You say you want to cry
But your tears are dry
When I was that way
There's nothing left to say
Nothing left to say

Now my lady's on fire
She wants to tear it down
She knows you're a liar
My lady's on fire
She said, "no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no"
She said, "no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"

Still I wonder why
Why he had to die
When I feel that way
There's nothing left to say
Nothing left to say

Still my lady's on fire
She wants to tear it down
She knows you're a liar
My lady's on fire
She said, "no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no"
She said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"
