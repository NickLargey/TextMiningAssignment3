[Chorus]
Why didn't you believe in Him
Why didn't you believe
Why didn't you believe in Him
Why didn't you believe

He asked for you to love one another
You turned your back and played on with your games
If you had listened, you would have discovered
The Bible would have told a different story

[Chorus]

I'm sick and tired of this old world
There's so many religions to believe in
If I had been alive at the time,
I'd known where and what and why I am

[Chorus]

You got to believe (Gotta believe)
You got to believe (Gotta believe)
You got to believe (Gotta believe)
You got to believe (Gotta believe)
You got to believe

(Gotta believe, gotta believe, gotta believe,
Gotta believe, gotta believe, gotta believe, gotta believe)
You crucified the man who came to save us
Forgive them for they know not what they do
But I cannot forgive you what you did
I believed, why couldn't you

[Chorus]
