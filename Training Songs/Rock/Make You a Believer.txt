Let me tell you all a story 'bout this time I was down and out
Just goes to prove there's always a light on
But if you look you'll find it's inside of you
So I want why'all to listen up
I been sitting here all night
Tryin' to make this thing word out right
I been getting nowhere fast
Suddenly as I lay down on the bed
I hear a little voice inside my head
It says if you want to do it girl - you got to have some faith
Come over here and listen - hurry up or you'll be late

[Chorus:]
Listen to my story
Listen to me well
Ooh I will make you a believer
If you're feeling sorry for yourself I can tell
Ooh I will make you a believer
Yeah - I will make you a believer

So you been trying to make amends for
The bloodsuckers you call friends
Drag you deep into the hole
Crazy - that you'd let them into your world
They will take your diamonds, baby they will steal your pearls
If you want to play the game
You got to lose the rules
You can play with passion
Rules are just for fools

[Chorus:]

You got to learn to fall in love with what's inside
Get on the horse I want to ride
I got a reason to believe the light's inside
Some things I can have now
Some things have to wait
Some things I will never get
I will always - I will always have my faith
