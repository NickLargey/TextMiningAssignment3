The one who reads the stars has told me
Why you're not like everyone
Your father is a fiery wizard
He travels all around the sun
No one ever knew just where you came from
Orphan girl, you grew up wild
Your father left you on the way home
Yes, girl, you're a Jupiter's child

Wish I knew the way back
Back to where you came
Gladly I would leave here
Take another name
I can tell by you, it must be true
It's up on Jupiter's face
They don't embrace our own disgrace
Somebody, help me off this place

You really quite belonged
Like a pearl among the swine
You tried to live the way we do
Hoping you would learn in time
But, mankind, with all it's virtue
Will soon make you lose your smile
On this earth, with all it's madness
Heaven help a Jupiter's child

Wish I knew the way back
Back to where you came
Gladly I would leave here
Take another name
I can tell by you, it must be true
It's up on Jupiter's face
They don't embrace our own disgrace
Somebody, get me off this place
