She moves like nobody moves
Like a cat on a hot tin roof
She sees what nobody sees
Talks sense, never gives up easy

She speaks in what she does
When she speaks she says so much
All the world's a stage to her
She wants to bash and dance on it

She moves to a different drummer
Nobody tells the truth like she can
She moves to a different drummer
She's in time, she don't lie
Different Drummer, Different Drummer
Different Drummer, Different Drummer

Got to beat life on the street
Ears to the ground, wings on your feet
Keeps her head way above water
Carries herself like a west side daughter

That look, what about that
Like a left bank angel on the Bonneville Flats
She's so sweet, so damn gritty
She comes to wake me up when she gets up early
 
She moves to a different drummer
Nobody tells the truth like she can
She moves to a different drummer
She's in time, she don't lie
Different Drummer, Different Drummer
Different Drummer, Different Drummer

She's not afraid, afraid to be herself and says what she means
When I'm away, it's like I'm in hell, I'm so incomplete
I know she's on my side and that's honesty
Make no mistake

Different Drummer, Different Drummer
Different Drummer, Different Drummer

She moves like nobody moves
Like a cat on a hot tin roof
She sees what nobody sees
Talks sense, never gives up easy

She moves to a different drummer
Nobody tells the truth like she can
She moves to a different drummer
She's in time, she don't lie
Different Drummer, Different Drummer
Different Drummer, Different Drummer
