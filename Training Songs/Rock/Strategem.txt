Angry hands upon the wheel turn slow
Without a star the water turns to stone
Here I stand by lovely strategem
When love is gone I'll invent again 

Lady in Ashes, Forget her name
Her beauty was matchless, her nature untame 

And by now her face is far below
Still beneath the desert rivers flow
Take the sand in empty hand and then 
Blow away and bring her back again 

And if you ask it, dear one plays again
Her beauty was matchless, her nature untame 

Deathless hand in land where devils roam
Who with a switchblade cut the head of hope
It's time to exchange the evil, blow by blow
Without a star the water turns to stone 

If time is our master, then I'm lost again
Her beauty was matchless, her nature untame
