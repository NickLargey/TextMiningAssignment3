All the birds have been blue
They don't know what to do 
Ever since you said goodbye to me
And the flowers in their gloom, have just refused to bloom
'Cause we all want you back, you see naturally

All the birds have been blue
They don't know what to do 
Ever since you said goodbye to me
And the flowers in their gloom, have just refused to bloom

'Cause we all want you back, you see
And even Mister Moon
Is left without a tune
And his shadow's lost the harmony

So don't waste any time
Come back and change your mind
Everything will work out
Naturally

You know that love is a struggle 
And only the strong survive
So it's up to me and you
To do what we've got to do

To keep our love alive
And now bees have been gone
And they know that something's wrong
'Cause they don't feel like buzzing at all

And the starts up in the sky, all they do it cry
And that's why the rain must fall
And the early morning sun
He knows that you're the one

And we both miss your company

So don't waste any time
Come back and change your mind
Everything will work out naturally

You know that love, love is a struggle 
And only the strong survive

So it's up to me and you
To do what we've got to do
To keep our love alive

So don't waste any time
Come back and change your mind
We'll be singing harmonies
With the birds and bees

If only you'll be mine
Things will work out fine
Naturally
