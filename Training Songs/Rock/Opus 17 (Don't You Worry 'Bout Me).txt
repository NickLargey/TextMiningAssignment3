I can see
There ain't no room for me
You're only holdin' up your heart in sympathy
If there's another man
Then girl I understand
Go on and take his hand
And don't you worry 'bout me
I'll be blue
And I'll be cryin' too
But girl you know I only want what's best for you
What good is all my pride
If our true love has died
Go on and be his bride
And don't you worry 'bout me

I'll be strong
I'll try to carry on
Although you know it won't be easy when your gone
I'll always think of you
The tender love we knew
But somehow I'll get through
So don't you worry 'bout me
Oo, baby

Sweetie pie
Before you say goodbye
Remember if he ever leaves you high and dry
Don't cry alone in pain
Don't ever feel ashamed
If you want me again
Just don't you worry 'bout me
I love you
No matter what you do
I'll spend my whole life waitin' if you want me too
And if this is goodbye
You know I'd rather die
Than let you see me cry
'Cause then you'd worry 'bout me

I'll be strong
I'll try to carry on
Although you know it won't be easy when your gone
I'll always think of you
The tender love we knew
But somehow I'll get through
So don't you worry 'bout me
I'll be strong
I'll try to carry on
Although you know it won't be easy when your gone
I'll always think of you
The tender love we knew
But somehow I'll get through
So don't you worry 'bout me
