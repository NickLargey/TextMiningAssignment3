Got along without ya before I met ya
Gonna get along without ya now.
Gonna find somebody twice as cute
Cause ya didn't love me anyhow.
You ran around with ev'ry boy in town
And ya never cared if it got me down.
You had me worried always on my guard.
But ya laughed at me cause I tried too hard.
Boom, boom. Boom, boom.
Gonna get along without ya now.
Boom, boom. Boom, boom.
Gonna get along without ya now.

Got along without ya before I met ya
Gonna get along without ya now.
Gonna find somebody twice as cute
Cause ya didn't love me anyhow.
I lost my money and I lost my pride
Didn't have much money, but I really tried.
It made you happy when you made me cry.
And ya broke my heart so I said goodbye.
Boom, boom. Boom, boom.
Gonna get along without ya now.
Boom, boom. Boom, boom.
