Keep searchin' for someone to tell me the truth
It seems like the longer I wait
Hesitate, it comes down to you
Time won't heal
Love ain't real anymore

Halfway to daylight
And my heart is open wide
It seems like the time that we shared
When we cared
It has passed us by
Life ain't fair, when I stare
At this picture of you
I feel the touch of your hand
And the look in your eyes
Oh! Don't ya know I feel just like dying
When the tears start to fall
And my heart turns to stone
I'm tellin' you baby
I never walk alone

Life ain't fair, when I stare
At this picture of you
I still feel the touch of your hand
And the look in your eyes
Oh! Lord I feel like dying
Cause when the tears start to fall
And my heart turns to stone
I never walk alone
