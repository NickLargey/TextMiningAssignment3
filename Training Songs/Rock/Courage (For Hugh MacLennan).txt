Watch the band
Through a bunch of dancers
Quickly follow the unknown
With something more familiar
Quickly something familiar

Courage, my word
It didn't come, it doesn't matter

Sleepwalk so fast asleep
In a motel that has a lay of home
And piss on all of your background
And piss on all your surroundings

Courage, my word
It didn't come, it doesn't matter
Courage, your word
It didn't come, it doesn't matter

Courage, my word
It didn't come, it doesn't matter
Courage, it couldn't come at a worse time

There's no simple explanation
For anything important any of us do
And yeah, the human tragedy
Consists of the necessity
Of livin' with the consequences
Under pressure, under pressure

Courage, my word
It didn't come, it doesn't matter
Courage, your word
It didn't come, it doesn't matter

Courage, my word
It didn't come, it doesn't matter
Courage, it couldn't come at a worse time

It couldn't come at a worse time
It couldn't come at a worse time
Courage, courage
