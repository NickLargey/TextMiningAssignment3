Born a natural loser I can't recall just where
Raised on brew and poker and a dollar here and there
Black-jack hand dealer man you better payoff that last debt
Two bit hand a twenty one that's all I ever get
 
Go down gamblin' 
Say it when you're running low
Go down gamblin'
You may never have to go, no
 
Down in a crap game I've been losing at roulette
Cards are bound to break me but I ain't busted yet
'Cause I've been called a natural lover by that lady over there
Honey, I'm just a natural gambler but I try to do my share
 
Go down gamblin' 
Say it when you're running low
Go down gamblin'
You may never have to go, no
 
Go down gamblin' 
Say it when you're running low
Go down gamblin'
You may never have to go, no, no, no
