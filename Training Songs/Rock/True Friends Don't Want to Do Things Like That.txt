I live my life like I'm reading my own biography
Every night writing my discography
But let's talk about our coy romance
Doesn't it seem like it's always been here?
Love, I mean
Love, I mean

Walking around bumping into things
I try to say "hi," I end up making you cry
True friends don't want to do things like that
True friends don't want to do things like

Live my life like I'm reading my own biography
Every night arranging my own anthology
But let's talk about this crack from which
Whenever we're close, something yanks us back
It's probably me, it's probably me

Stumbling around, crashing into things
I try to be sly, I end up licking your eye
True friends don't want to do things like that
True friends don't want to do things like that
