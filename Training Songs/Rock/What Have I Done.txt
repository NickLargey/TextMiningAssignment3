You are my everything
My head and my heart, my mind, my wing
I couldn't give all again
I'm never sure of anything with you

The jokes, the laughs, the teardrops too
The games, the fun, the travels too
Yes, I'll go through it all with you
All good things now come from you

I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done to fall so hard for you?

I give my everything
My head and my heart, my mind, my wing
The past, the present, tomorrow too
I'll spend my final day with you

I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done to fall so hard for you?

I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done to fall so hard for you?
