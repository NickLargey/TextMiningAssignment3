Jump into that water and see for yourself
Take a deep breath and hold it in
Hold it in

She's got a secret
And she wants to tell
But I made a promise to hold it in
Hold it in

Baby, I'm in love
And it's not in to tell
Only thing that I can do is hold it in
Hold it in

Was told that I'm a man now
And that I'm not allowed to cry
Only thing that I can do is hold it in
Hold it in, ha!

Life is Oh my god, if I tell him he'll tell her
And then she will know I like her
Good grief, I don't think that I can take this heartbreak
Any Longer
I will not hold it in

Ooh

Couple with a baby and it's no secret why
Neither one was able to hold it in
Hold it in

Kids in the streets, yeah they're all gettin' high
Everybody's screaming hold it in,
Hold it in!

Life is Oh my god, if I tell him he'll tell her
And then she will know I like her
Good grief, I don't think that I can take this heartbreak
Any longer
I will not hold it in

Ooh

If there's a God, he's embarrassed
And it's no secret why:
Only thing that he can do is hold it in
Hold it in

So I printed him a letter to be sent out to sea
I'm looking for a bottle to hold it in,
Hold it in, ha!

Life is Oh my god, if I tell him he'll tell her
And then she will know I like her
Good grief, I don't think that I can take this heartbreak
Any Longer
I will not hold it in

Ooh
