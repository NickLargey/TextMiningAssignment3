Both of us talking
Ain´t nobody giving an inch...
Such a shame
The beat of our hearts
They´re just so far apart
That we can´t even feel the pain 

So tell me how long
Can we go on this way...
Not another day
Well you know it´s so sad
To watch a good love go so bad...
Just thrown away 

Give a little love
Give a little love 

Both of us talking
Ain´t nobody listening at all...
It´s such a sin
It´s time we start facing
This love we are wasting
Ain´t never gonna come back again 

Just tell me how long
Can we go on this way...
Not another day
You know Iit´s so sad
To watch a good lovego so bad...
Just thrown away 

Give some love
Got to let her know
Take some time
You got to give her some time
Give a little love
Just a little love
Give her some love
Just a little love
Give a little love
Changing like the weather
So hard to stay together
It´s hard to give that much all the time
We´ve got to stop and give back
We´re on the wrong track
We´re coming to the end of the line 

Just tell me how long
Can we keep holding on...
Not another day
You know it´s so wrong
To let a love that was so strong...
Just slip away
You got to give a little love
To get a little love
We´re gonna have to make up our minds
Take a little..make a little time
To put our hearts together tonight 

Give a little love
Just a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love
Give some love
Give a little love
Take some time
Give a little love
