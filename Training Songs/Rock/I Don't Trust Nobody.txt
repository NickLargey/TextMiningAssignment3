I don't trust nobody 
When it come to my girl
I don't trust nobody
When it come to my girl
You know things are gettin' funny
All over the world

Now this old man
You know they call him James
When night begin to fall
You know he change his name
At ten o'clock at night
They all go out to play
Twelve o'clock comes
He says "Come to Annie Mae"

I don't trust nobody
When it comes to my girl
Things are gettin' funny
All over the world

Now this fine fox
That lives on my block
When she begin to walk
You know cars begin to stop
Finest little thing
That you'll ever see
She's the same one 
Took my woman from me

I don't trust nobody
When it comes to my girl
Things are gettin' funny
All over the world

It ain't always a man
Who acts like a flirt
It ain't always a man
That gets your daughter hurt
It ain't always a man
Who drags her in the dirt
It ain't always a woman
Who wears a mini skirt

I don't trust nobody
When it come to my girl
Yeah, things are gettin' funny
All over this world

I don't trust nobody
When it come to my girl
I don't trust nobody
When it come to my girl
Not a doggone soul
You know things are gettin' funny
All over this world
Yeah, things are gettin' funny
All over this world

I don't trust nobody
When it come to my girl
I don't trust my best friend
I don't trust my brother
I don't trust my father
I don't trust you
I don't even trust the president
When it come to my girl
