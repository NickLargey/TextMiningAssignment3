I know what today
Oh, let's simon's say
I just know I do
So much head my flu
So sick, so so sick,
So sick, that is me.

I know what to do
All these things to you
Want so much of you
Know I do, I do
So sick, so so so sick,
That's my name

All I want to do
Is staying up with you
Smoother hottest space
Always kissing Kisser,
So sick, so so sick, so,
Watch your wide eyes go.

Lovey Love I do so,
Lovely lover for you
So, so, so, so, so,
So.

On the sidewalk with you
So closer, closer still
Yes I will die for you
Joy is Me and You,
So Sick, that's my name.
