Please forgive me for not smiling
Please excuse the tear in my eye
You were out late, you were playin'
I was alone late last night

It's gettin' too late, it can't be true
Has this lovin' world turned it's back on you?
Out spendin' your time, baby, diggin' for gold
Dig inside yourself, it's inside your soul

Sometimes love gets so hard and only Lord knows
Just to win the fight, we gotta take the scars
If we could change the way things might have been
I'd bet we'd go back to where it first began
I bet you would, baby

Emptiness can be a silent friend
It stays with you until love comes once again
So I hope you find what you're looking for
'Cause that friend may stay with you until the very end

Where were you when midnight struck?
Where were you when midnight hit?
Am I just a fool with such bad luck?
Where were you when midnight struck?

Hang my life by the end of a string
You tell me that our love don't mean a thing
Well, I know that it can't be true
'Cause I was up late, baby, waiting for you

And now my feelings just fade away
All my memories come to an end
That night, girl, you dragged me down
That's the night I swear, I saw the devil in you
The devil in you, girl
