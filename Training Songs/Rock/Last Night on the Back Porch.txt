I love him in the springtime, and I love him in the fall,
But last night on the back porch, I loved him most of all

I love him in the morning, and I love him last night
I love him, yes I love him, when the stars are shining bright
I love him in the springtime, and I love him in the fall,
But last night on the back porch, I loved him most of all

(Now a dance…it's me dancing…I had lessons)

I love him in the springtime, and I love him in the fall,
But last night on the back porch, I loved him most of all

I love him in the morning, and I love him last night
I love him, yes I love him, when the stars are shining bright
I love him in the springtime, and I love him in the fall,
But last night on the back porch, I loved him most of all
