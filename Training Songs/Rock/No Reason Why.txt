You ain't gonna live
As long as you figured
'Cause somebody's got a gun
And their finger's on the trigger

You gave 'em a bad time
And you went down for the very last time
You wanted to live, somebody wants you to die
And there's no reason why

Life ain't as long as you want it
'Cause sombody's got a bullet
With your name written on it

You gave 'em a bad time
And you went down for the very last time
You wanted to live, somebody wants you to die
And there's no reason why

I'm not afraid of what you might do to me
'Cause if the back turns
The tide will turn as they will see

But in the meantime
They got their eye on you
And when the shot's fired
There's nothin' you can do

You wanted to live
They want you to die
There's no reason why
No reason why

You ain't gonna live
No reason why

No reason
(Why)
No reason
(Why)
No reason
(Why)
No reason
(Why)
