Here I am, standin' still
Knowin' I'm not goin' nowhere today
And maybe not tomorrow,
No no, maybe not tomorrow
Maybe not tomorrow,
But that's okay.

Here I am, empty head
I'm full of heart with an empty bed,
Knowin' I'm not goin' nowhere, nowhere today
And maybe not tomorrow,
No no, maybe not tomorrow
Maybe not tomorrow,
That's okay.

Here I am, dear I am, standing still
With a lot of time to make a rhyme
And a lot of time to kill
Count the raindrops as they fall
Knowin' that it's rainin'
It's rainin' and that's all
I know that it's just rain
And that is all
La da da, la da da;
La da da, la da da.
Here I am

Nothing left, so here I am
I didn't save for later,
Got nothing in the can
Knowin' I'm not goin' nowhere, nowhere today
And maybe not tomorrow,
No no, maybe not tomorrow
Maybe not tomorrow,
That's okay
That's okay.
