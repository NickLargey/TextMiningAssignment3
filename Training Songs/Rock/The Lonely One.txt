I told the sun, not to shine and stay away
I told the lake, to go dry and wash away
Am I wrong? Am I strong? Walk away
Do I know there are no words to say?
Am I yours? Am I mine, anyway?
Do I know there are no words?

I am the only princess, I am indestructible
I am winged victory, I am so breakable
I am the distant planet, I am the golden sun
I am the broken pieces, I am the lonely one

Asked the sky to fall down on you
Asked the night to be solid proof
Am I good? Am I bad, or the same?
Am I bad? Am I worse? Stay away
Is there anything else left to say?
Are there really any words?

I am a flying spaceship, identifiable
I am the perfect lover, tell me, I am lovable
I am the distant planet, I am the purple sun
I am the highest mountain, I am the lonely one

So here's me now, without you
I turn the lights out, without you
Should I be frightened, without you
Always night now, without you

I am the darkest morning, I am the sleeping fool
I am the wandering gypsy, I am right here next to you
I am the distant planet, I am the golden sun
I am the empty canyon, I am the lonely one

The lonely one
