Ula models for top magazines
See her smile in her pink limousine
Queen of lipstick, shampoo and sun creams,
She's the fun of every man's dreams
She thinks she's ooh-la-la,
But she's just la-de-da

Minus zero 

Flies to Rio when Rio is sunny
Never sweats,'cause she stands in the shade
She's a honey, and brings in the money
Works for pleasure, but always gets paid
She oozes sex appeal,
But she just isn't real
