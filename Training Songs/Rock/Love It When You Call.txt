I found a switch, you turned it on
I hit the ditch, you carried on
I was so near, now you're so far
Are you quite sure, just who you are?

Oh I-I-I-I-I-I, know you could choose a friend but you don't seem to have the time
Oh I-I-I-I-I-I, I wonder if you ever get to say what's on your mind

Well take a little time
Come on, take a little time

I love it when you call
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
Say what's the complication
It's only conversation
I love it when you call
But you never call at all,  whoa-oh
(He loves it when you call)
(He loves it when you call)

Remember me, I used to be
Your best time buddy that you couldn't wait to see
But gettin' old, it takes a toll
And hearts getting broken lead to people growin' cold

Oh I-I-I-I-I-I, I'm thinking were the kind that's got a tale on either side
Oh I-I-I-I-I-I, I'm gonna be the one who makes you stop and realize

You could have it all
Yeah, we should have it all

I love it when you call (He loves it when you call)
I love it when you call (He loves it when you call)
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
So what's the complication
It's only conversation
I love it when you call
But you never call at all,  whoa-oh
(He loves it when you call)
(He loves it when you call)

Now I wonder where you've been
Yeah I wonder who you've seen
Now I hope you find your dream
When you do I really hope its all it seems

I love it when you call
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
Say what's the complication
It's only conversation
I love it when you call
But you never call at all,  whoa!
