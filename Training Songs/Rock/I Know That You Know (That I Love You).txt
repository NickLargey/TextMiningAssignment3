I jump when you yell like a good little boy I dance when you sing like a good little toy
I'd leave in a minute and head down the track
But you and I know I'll just have to come back
Yes I know that you know that I love you as sure as the stars shine above you
You don't have a care and I don't have a prayer
And I know that you know that I care

I'd come when you call like a good little clown
I make with the jokes and I jump up and down
I'd say that I'm leaving but you and I know
That I'm only talking to hear the wind blow
Yes I know that you know...
You don't have a care...
