Guildford, Guildford
Holy mother of hell and Jesus
In the architraves
Waiting, waiting
Comes to take all my misery away
At least for now

Kelvin ghetto homie figure we can work it out

(1, 2, 3, 4)

It must be 5 years ago now
Skulking home one public holiday
Eighteen, eighteen, baby brains
I got the nervous twitching algorithms
Right beneath the trees
Yeah I half expect her knuckles now to bring me to my knees, ah

If she wants this to be
She'll have to see the things that I have had to see
But maybe she would know
Maybe she would care

She only loves me when I'm there

It must be five years ago now
My trimester public holiday
Eighteen crack these oysters open
She can be forgiven but she doesn't go away
Yeah, I see her on the bus, man, see her everyday

Oh, if she wants this to be
She'll have to see the things that I have had to see
And maybe she would know
Maybe she would care
She only loves me when I'm there

But I don't want to live like this anymore, kid
I don't want to live like this anymore

(1, 2, 3, 4)

She only loves me when I'm there
She only loves me when I'm there

I got the nervous twitching algorithms
Right beneath the trees
Yeah I half expect her knuckles now to bring me to my knees
