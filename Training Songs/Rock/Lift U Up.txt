I’ll tell ya what to do when your life has you in a bind 
When you’re calling up on luck, 
But the Beep Beep is all that you find 
And there’s nothing you can do about it 

'Cause there’s more than is meeting the eye 
Now I wantcha to know 
That you’re part of the show 
Come around, come around, come around 

I can’t live without 
Whoa, want to rock this feeling off the ground 
want to lift you up 
Whoa, want to rock , rock ‘till the morning dawn 

Morning dawn 
All I want to do’s put a smile back there on your face 
Just forget about the blues 
'Cause we need you here to shake up the place 

And there’s nothing you can do about it 
'Cause there’s more than is meeting the eye 
Now I wantcha to know 
That you’re part of the show 

Come around, come around, come around 
I can’t live without 
Whoa, want to rock this feeling off the ground 
ant to lift you up 

Whoa, want to rock , rock ‘till the morning dawn 
Morning dawn 
One crowd, one hymn 
Now let the show begin 

One time again 
Around, come around, come around 
I can’t live without 
Whoa, want to rock this feeling off the ground 

Want to lift you up 
Whoa, want to rock , rock ‘till the morning dawn 
Rockin’ and rollin’ and rockin’ and rollin’ and… 
Whoa, want to rock this feeling off the ground 

Want to lift you up 
Whoa, want to rock , rock ‘till the morning dawn 
Morning dawns
