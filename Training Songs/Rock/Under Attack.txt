Hey you!

Send us off to war, send us off to die
We know the truth, we won't buy your lies now
We're fed up, we don't want to wait
This war is a farce, you send us to die now

Under attack, we're under attack
Under attack, we're under attack

We said it once, we said it before
We're not the ones, who want this fucking war
We are fed up, we don't want to wait
We need a change, we won't buy your lies now

Under attack, we're under attack
Under attack, we're under attack

Power is terror, power is terror

See the youth mislead and used
We don't want to kill for you

We don't want your lies, we're sick of your faults
You want a war, we don't want it at all
You don't give a f*ck, if we live or die
You don't really care, if there's no one left
