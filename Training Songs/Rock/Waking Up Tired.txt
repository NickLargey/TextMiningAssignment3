Oh, the nights are long
And I'm so tired of waking up tired,
Man, they just drag on and on
And I'm so tired of waking up tired.
The company I'm keeping
Won't let me get my sleep in.

Oh, I hate the light
And I'm so tired of waking up tired.
The morning sun is getting way too bright
And I'm so tired of waking up tired.
If I was worth a fortune
I'd never leave my bedroom
I just want to stay right here, safe and sound.

Oh, I have to go
But I'm so tired of waking up tired.
The lights are on but there is no-one home
'Cause I´m so wired from waking up tired.
I need a month of Sundays
To help me cope with Mondays,
I just want to stay right here, safe and sound.
Blankets pulled up to my ears, safe and sound.

I need a good vacation 
From too much recreation.

Oh, I'm late again
And I'm so tired, might even get fired.
I could blame it on a cancelled train
But I won´t try it, I know they won´t buy it. 

If I was worth a fortune
I'd never leave my bedroom until next June!
I just want to stay right here, safe and sound.
Blankets pulled up to my ears, safe and sound.
I just want to stay right here, safe and sound.
