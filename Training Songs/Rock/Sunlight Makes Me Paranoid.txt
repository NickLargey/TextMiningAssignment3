The sunlight's making me feel paranoid
I look outside and see the world at war
The people walk to work like they're alone
I sit in silence staring at the phone 

And it helps me breathe, And it helps me see 

I cover up my eyes to block the light
I cover up my eyes and try to fight, the fall 

And it helps, When I come down, And it helps 

The sunlight's making me feel paranoid
I look outside and see the world at war
The people laugh and play like they're alone
They're watching us while we sleep in our homes
I never, I never meant to shut you out
All I know and all I need is you
I never, I never meant to cause alarm 
All I know and all I need and all I got is gonna bleed 

It helps, when I come down, It helps, when I come down 

It helps me breathe, When I come down
Annie
The smell of the ocean on her skin
The rags of her dress blowing in the wind
A chorus of angels on the boardwalk
They know what you did in the dark 

Chorus 

I never meant to hurt you Annie
Leave you standing with the gun
Come and play with me little Annie
Lose yourself, lose yourself 

I lay her back on the cold sand
And wipe the blood from her hand
I fix her hair and kiss her chest
The secrets die in her breathe 

Chorus 

I never meant to hurt you Annie
Leave you standing with the gun
Come and play with me little Annie
Lose yourself, lose yourself 

Oh no, her hands are cold
Oh no, I played with her soul
All night again
I'm alone LOVE 
I want the girl all dressed in white
She turns and says hello
She changes colors like a bird
I grab her wings and fly away
She takes me high and leaves me there
I never want that down 

Chorus 

Love, It's a beautiful place, It's a beautiful taste
Where I am now, where I am now, And I belong 

The gentle high is all to blame
I cried for seven days
I feel myself losing control 
To all the voices in my soul
There is the girl in white again
I need the sugar from her hand 

Chorus 

Love, It's a beautiful place, It's a beautiful taste
Where I am now, where I am now, And I belong 

And it's such a wonderful way, We're making love right now
And it's such a wonderful way, you feel me up inside 

Chorus 

Love, It's a beautiful place, It's a beautiful taste
Where I am now, where I am now, And I belong ESTER 
Ester why do you look all blue
What did I say to you to make you feel all blue
Ester when you walk in the room 
Everybody turns to look at you 

Chorus 

And that night when I called you
I was being young
And the way I tried to win you
I was being young, I was being young 

Ester why can't you talk to me
Why can't you look at me
Why can't sit with me
Ester with your lips all full
With your heart all full, is there room for two 

Chorus 

And that night when I called you 
I was being young
And the way I tried to win you 
I was being young, I was being young
