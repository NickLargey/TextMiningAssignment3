I wanna let it be known
Ever since I was young
I've always been a refugee
Always very high strung
I've always been low key
Just let the record show

No, I won't jump for joy, I don't
If I get excited nobody knows (nobody knows)
Ohh (ohh) but I'm gonna love you the same
I'll always be your fool
And when it looks like I don't care
I'm just playing it cool

I know, I won't jump for joy, I don't
If I get excited, no one will know (no one will know)
Ohh (ohh) I've always been low key
Oh you know me

Woo oohh oohh
Woo oohh oohh
Woo oohh oohh

I've always been low key
You know me

No, I won't jump for joy, I don't
If I get excited nobody knows (nobody knows)
Ohh (ohh) but I'm gonna love you the same
I'll always be your fool
And when it looks like I don't care
I'm just playing it cool

No, I won't jump for joy, I don't
When I get excited, nobody knows
