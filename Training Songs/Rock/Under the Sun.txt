You can find it anywhere, under the sun
You can find it in your heart if you look hard
You can know your way around and be lonely
You can tear us all apart and be on your way

There's a fire burning up, under the sun
There's desire in your heart, where it don't belong
You can see the planets turn, under the sun
And the light that shines on you is the only one
Yeah, the light that shines on you is the only one

The air begins to feel a little colder
The air begins to show a little time
The air begins to know what you are thinking
The air can see the trouble in your eyes

So, tell nobody you're on your own
And find somebody to take you home
To take you home, ah

You can find it anywhere, under the sun
You can find it in your heart, if you look hard
You can know your way around and be lonely
You can tear us all apart and be on your way
You can tear us all apart, be on your way

The air begins to feel a little colder
The air begins to show a little time
The air begins to know what you are thinking
The air can see the trouble in your eyes

So, tell nobody you're on your own
And find somebody to take you home
To take you home, ah
