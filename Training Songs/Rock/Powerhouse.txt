Tough day on the firin' line, dontcha wanna make some time
Come down take a chance or two, I'll be lookin' out for you

Run all night, slip all day
Make me crazy baby, don't you wait

I got the key to the powerhouse
I got the key to the powerhouse
I got the key, you can't lock me out
C'mon baby we can work out--work out--work

Cold steel rollin' down the track--big wheel gonna break your back
Love's not an easy thing--love'll show ya everything

Drive all night--slum all day
Take me closer baby--don't you wait

I got the key to the powerhouse
I got the key to the powerhouse
C'mon down you can knock me out
C'mon baby we can work out--work out--work

Run all night, slip all day
Make me crazy baby, don't you wait
Drive all night, slum all day
Pull me closer baby, steal away
