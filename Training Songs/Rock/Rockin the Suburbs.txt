Let me tell ya'll what it's like
Being male, middle class and white
It's a bitch, if you don't believe
Listen up to my new cd
Sham on

I got shit running through my brain
So intense that I can't explain
All alone in my white boy pain
Shake your booty while the band complains

I'm rocking the suburbs
Just like michael jackson did
I'm rocking the suburbs
Except that he was talented
I'm rocking the suburbs
I take the checks and face the facts
That some producer with computers
Fixes all my shitty tracks

I'm pissed off but I'm too polite
When people break in the mcdonalds line
Mom and dad you made me so uptight
I'm gonna cuss on the mic tonight
I don't know how much I can take
Girl give me something I can break

I'm rocking the suburbs
Just like quiet riot did
I'm rocking the suburbs
Except that they were talented
I'm rocking the suburbs
I take the checks and face the facts
That some producer with computers
Fixes all my shitty tracks

In a haze these days
I pull up to the stoplight
I can feel that something's not right
I can feel that someone's blasting me
With hate and bass
Sending dirty vibes my way
Cause my great great great great grandad
Made someone's great great great great grandaddy slaves
It wasn't my idea
It wasn't my idea
It never was my idea
I just drove to the store
For some preparation h

Y'all don't know what it's like
Being male, middle class and white
It gets me real pissed off and it makes me want to say
F*ck

Just like jon bon jovi did
I'm rocking the suburbs
Except that he was talented
I'm rocking the suburbs
I take the checks and face the facts
That some producer with computers
Fixes all my shitty tracks these days
I'm rocking the suburbs
You'd better look out because I'm gonna say f*ck
