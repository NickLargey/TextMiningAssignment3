I've been drivin' all night, 
My hands are wet on the wheel 
There's a voice in my head 
That drives my heel
And my baby calls says 
She needs me here and
It's half past four 
And I'm shifting gear 
When she gets lonely 
And the longin' gets too much 
She sends a cable comin' in from above 
We don't need to talk 
At all we got a thing
That's called radar love 
We got a wave in the air 
Radar love 
Radio's playin' some forgotten song
Brenda lee's comin' on strong 
The road has got me hypnotized 
And I'm spinning into a new sunrise 
When I get lonely 
And I'm sure I've had enough 
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don't need a letter at 
All we got a thing that's called radar love 
We got a line in the air radar 
Love solo no more speed
I'm almost there gotta keep cool now, 
Gotta take care last car 
To pass here I go 
And the line of cars goes down real slow 
And the radio played some forgotten song 
Brenda lee's comin' strong 
And the newsman sang his same song 
Oh one more radar lover gone 
When I get lonely and I'm sure
I've had enough she sends her comfort 
Coming in from above 
We don't need a letter at all 
We got a thing that's called radar love 
We got a line in the sky 
We got a thing that's called radar love 
We got a thing that's called radar love
