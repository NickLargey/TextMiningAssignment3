So now, let me tell you about this girl of mine
Heart like all men?s dreams in the days of 49
I turn hollow, no me more swallow, fast only she breaks
But distance keeps her miles or meters, what difference does it make?

'Cause here they come again to repossess my dreams
Child don't play yourself things are never what they seem
A bridge, a river, a pale moon sliver, city shines so bright
But to my despair, I return where they sleep out every night

But the girl I love is oh, so, oh, so far away
And I wonder can she hear me as I go through my day

Oh, now the ragin' sea she laps upon my door
I?ll round a thousand horns just to drown upon her shore
Blood red roses go down moses, oh, billowin' sails
Those so weak-willed, guts all sea-filled, throw them o?er the rails

Boys, slacken up the jib and sing a hearty song
We've been driftin?, driftin?, for far too long
I take no care, me I'm so bare-breasted on the bow
Scabbed and weathered skin of leather, who's the deader now

But the girl I love is oh, so, oh, so far away
And I wonder, can she hear me as I go through my day
It's so long lady angel, I guess, I?ll say goodbye
But I do believe I'm aging right before your eyes

Wash up on her coast, not a nickel to my name
Sold my, sold my, sold my gold watch and chain
Enough to hire a band of lyres to march me on my way
Through hills and valleys, streets and alleys up to her open gates

But the girl I love is oh, so, oh, so far away
And I wonder, can she hear me as I go through my day
It's so long lady angel, I guess, I?ll say goodbye
But I do believe I'm aging right before your eyes

Cock crow in the morning, heard it loud and clear
Asked her for to marry, she answer with a tear
Boy, you have my heart and I know you always will
But that ain't enough to hold me 'cause love don't pay the bills

I turned away in shame for all my days in vain
Guess, I?ll just drag on, no one loves you till you're gone
Let the river be my guide, let the desert be my bride
Till my heart turns to steel, till I no longer feel

But the girl I love is oh, so, oh, so far away
And I wonder, can she hear me as I go through my day
It's so long lady angel, I guess, I?ll say goodbye
But I do believe I'm aging right before your eyes
