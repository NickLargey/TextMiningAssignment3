She came on like a storm
From the blind side of a memory
Soft and warm, left me seasick on the shore
She believed she could prove
It was her world that I needed
But I left her for someone I wanted more

Always using clever words to hide the truth
Communicating in the ignorance of youth
Still I believe that my delusions
Are realities within confusion
I accept the consequences for my lack of innocence

She was wrong, sunshine bright
Flaunting careless situations
Guarded wit always answering just because
Wild cliche, I'm discreet
Waking up from perfect dreaming
When I realize I want what never was

Always using clever words to hide the truth
Communicating in the ignorance of youth
Still I believe that my delusions
Are realities within confusion
I accept the consequences for my lack of innocence

Why do I just refuse to agree
With what I believe?
I found myself wandering aimlessly
Calling it freedom

She came on like a storm
From the blind side of a memory
Soft and warm, left me seasick on the shore
She believed she could prove
It was her world that I needed
But I left her for someone I wanted more
