Find your faith in your security 
All broken up at seventeen 
Jam your brain with broken heroes 
Love your masks and adore your failure 

We're a mess of eyeliner and spray paint 
D.I.Y. destruction on chanel chic 
Deny your culture of consumption 
This is a culture of destruction 

Don't want to see your face 
Don't wannt hear your words 
Why don't you just 

Babes on the run with poisoned lips 
Wrap your arms round this everlasting kiss 
Clinging to your own sense of waste 
All we love is lonely wreckage 

Your school your dole and your cheque book dreams 
Your clothes your suits and your pension schemes 
Now you say you know how we feel 
But don't fall in love 'cause we hate you still 

Don't want to see your face 
Don't wanna hear your words 
Why don't you just 

Destroyed by madness 
Destroyed by madness 
Destroyed by madness 
Destroyed by madness 
Anxiety is freedom
