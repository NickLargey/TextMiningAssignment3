The smokestack is spitting black soot into the sooty sky
The load on the road brings a tear to the Indian's eye
The Elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage
The Ringmaster's Telecaster sings on an empty stage

Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
Oh

The girl with the curls and the sweet pink ribbon in her hair
She's crawlin' out her window 'cause her daddy just don't care
(Come on!)

Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh

The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair
Finger on the trigger let me tell you it's quite a scare

Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh

The kids flip their lids when their heads hear that crazy sound
My neighbor digs the flavor still he's moving to another town
(and I don't believe he'll come back)

God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh

Your mind don't know how you're taking all the shit you see
Don't believe anyone but most of all don't believe me

God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh [Repeat: x4]
