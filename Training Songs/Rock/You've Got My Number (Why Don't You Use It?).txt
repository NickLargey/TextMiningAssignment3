You've got my number
Why don't you use it
You know my name
You won't abuse it

If you wanna wanna wanna wanna
Wanna have someone to talk to

I'll pick you up
In my car
Take you home
Its not far

If you wanna ...
Do it - do it - do it - do it

Why don't you ring my number ?
Why don't you ring my number now ?

Let's say goodbye
I couldn't stand it
You've got my number
Why don't you use it
