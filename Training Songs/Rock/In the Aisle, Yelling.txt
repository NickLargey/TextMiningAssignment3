Blessed be
Messed up me
Should I feel different? Was I
Crying to get my face wet

To discern what I did from what I thought
It's hard to discern what I gave from what I got
It's part of me.
Blessed be.

Low lit theater
Quiet crowd
I'm on the screen projected
I'm in the aisle yelling fire.
