I said
Oh, misery, shame and scandal in the family 
Oh, misery, shame and scandal in the family 

Down in Trinidad, there was a family
With much confusion as you will see
A mama and a papa and a boy who was grown
He wanted to marry and have wife of his own
He found a girl, she suited him nice
He went to his father to ask his advice
His father said, "son, I have to say no
The girl is your sister, but your mama don't know"

Oh, misery, shame and scandal in the family
I said
Oh, misery, shame and scandal in the family

And then the weeks went by and the summer came down
Soon, the best girl on the islands he found
He went to his papa to make it a date
His papa shook his head and to this he did say
"You can't marry that girl, I have to say no
Cause the girl is your sister, but your mama don't know"

Oh, misery, shame and scandal in the family
I said
Oh, misery, it's shame and scandal in the family

Oh, he went to his mama, he covered his head
He told his mom, what his father had said
His mother, she laughed, she said, "go man go
Your daddy ain't your daddy, but your daddy don't know"

Oh, misery, it's shame and scandal in the family
Well
Oh, misery, shame and scandal in the family

I said
Oh, misery, shame and scandal in the family
I said
Oh, misery, it's shame and scandal in the family
