Her hair was the color of the sun
Was the color of her eyes
Was the color of my own true love

Now hair was the color of the sun
Was the color of her eyes
Was the color of my only love

Love maker make me a love song to sing
I'm in the right, she is wrong and she knows
(he's in love and it shows)
I want her love but she won't let me in
When I see her I think: who's fooling who?
(she loves you too)

Her hair was the color of the sun
Was the color of her eyes
Was the color of my only love

Her hair was the color of the sun
Was the color of her eyes
Was the color of my only love

Maybe there's someone else but I won't give in
I'll play her game and I hope I don't lose
(you'll be the one she would choose)

Love maker make me a love song to sing
She'll hear my song and I hope she'll be there
(she knows you care)
