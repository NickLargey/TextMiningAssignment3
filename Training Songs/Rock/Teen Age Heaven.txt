I want a house with a pool
Shorter hours in school
And a room with my own private phone
I wanna stay up all night
See the big city lights
No more troubles or worries at home

Hmm, just gimme
Some time on my hands
I wanna make my own private plans
Yeah, I want my own Coupe de Ville
Make my dad pay the bill
Yeah man, that's heaven to me

Yeah, I want my own Coupe de Ville
