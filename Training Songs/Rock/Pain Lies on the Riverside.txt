I have never taken life
Yet I have often paid the price
And you  you are a victim of this age
And the guilt that hangs around your neck
Has got me locked up in a cage
You've got to learn  to live until no end
But first you must learn to swim
All over again (oh no)
Because...
Pain lies on the riverside
And pain will never say goodbye (oh no)
Pain lies on the riverside
So put your feet in the water
Put your head in the water
Put your soul in the water
And join me for a swim tonight
I have forever, always tried
To stay clean and constantly baptized
I am aware now that the river's banks are dry
And to wait for a flood
Is to wait for life
I've got to learn to live until no end
But first I must learn to swim
All over again (yeah yeah yeah)
Because...
Pain lies on the riverside
And pain will never say goodbye (oh no)
Pain lies on the riverside
So put your feet in the water
Put your head in the water
Come on, put your soul in the water
Join me for a swim tonight
For a swim tonight (oh my love)
I've got to learn to live until no end
But I've got to learn to swim
All over, all over
All over again (yeah yeah yeah)
Because...
Pain lies on the riverside (ohoho nanah nanah)
Pain will never say goodbye (oh no)
Pain lies on the riverside
So put your feet in the water
Put your head in the water now
Come on, put your soul in the water
Join me for a swim tonight (yeah)
For a swim tonight
Got to swim
All over, all over, all over
All over again
Got to live
All over, all over, all over
All over again
