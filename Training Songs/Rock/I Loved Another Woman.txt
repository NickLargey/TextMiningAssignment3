My baby's gone and left me cryin' by myself
My baby's gone and left me cryin' by myself
I loved another woman, now I lost my best gal

She was a real good woman
Never done me no harm
Was a real good woman
Never done me no harm

Now she`s up and she`s gone

Well, come back baby
I won't do you no wrong

I won't do you no wrong
I loved another woman
And I won`t do that no more
