Another hour past midnight
Moonshine through the skylight
The bottle's empty and my mind is full
Of your ghost that keeps hauntin' this room
And I could spend all my life
Just sittin' here paralised
And I could spend all my life
Waitin' for you to materialize
Love was the only thing
I always felt for you
Bigger than anything
Baby I die for you
Hold me cause I think I'm falling
Like rain on a Monday morning
And when it rains I'm pourin'
My heart out again
I can't remember I can't forget
I can't see 'cause my eyes are wet
The bottle's empty and it says: you fool
How many tears do I spill for you?
I could spend all my life
Just sittin' here paralised
I could spend all my life
Like a thorn of glass in your eye
