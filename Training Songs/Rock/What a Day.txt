Sittin' on your ass all day
Thinkin' bout your hangover and the par-tay
You left your fuckin' keys at
And had to beg for a 
Ride from a stranger that I never met before
He acted so friendly that I had to take the ride
But for some reason he resembled that guy
Wanted for a robbery
And beatin' on his kid
"You remind me of my stepson" 
He chuckled with a grin

What was that move 
That they taught in self-defense
You block the killer's knife 
Move with some confidence
The signal when you're trapped inside a moving car I wonder if he'll drive real far

What a day, What a day
Should've stayed home shootin' the breeze all day
What a day, What a day

What a day, What a day
You should think next time
Before you start to play
What a day, What a day
I wonder what'll happen today

Rub your eyes from
No sleep this week
Tap your heels home
Then fall asleep

Sittin' 'round looking for a fight
Kinda' pissed off how I'm turnin' my life
Up-side down from insecure insecurities
Makin' up my mind through old hypocrisy

Up and out of harms way 
Down cause I want to be there
Here because you want me
Not because you're caught in my stare

What was that move 
That they taught in self-defense
You block the killer's knife 
Move with some confidence
The signal when you're trapped inside a moving car 
I wonder if he'll drive real far

What a day, What a day
Should've stayed home shootin' the breeze all day
What a day, What a day

What a day, What a day
You should think next time
Before you start to play
What a day, What a day
I wonder what'll happen today

Rub your eyes from
No sleep this week
Tap your heels home
Then fall asleep
Alseep in me
There is something wrong instead

What a day, What a day
Should've stayed home shootin' the breeze all day
What a day, What a day

What a day, What a day
You should think next time
Before you start to play
What a day, What a day
What a day, What a day

What a day, What a day
