Early morning hits
I found a way to get out of this 
Underneath your desk
I carve your name across my chest

I got off my hands
I got on my knees
Now I know I'll pave the way
To paint your face with greed
I got up off of my knees
I got up on to my feet
And then I found that I paved the way
To pay for your disease
  
Well easy comes but here we go again

Just take two of these and call me later on
Everything is cool, you can borrow what you want
I've got the necessary tools to get you through the day

It doesn't matter who you are 
because there ain't  no other way, go on, go on

Now I spend my days 
Occupied in different ways
Orange afternoons
Soap-box preachers and jail tattoos

I got off my hands
I got on my knees
Now I know I'll pave the way
To paint your face with greed
I got up off of my knees
I got up on to my feet
And then I found that I paved the way
To pay for your disease  

Well easy comes but here we go again

Just take two of these and call me later on
Everything is cool, you can borrow what you want
I've got the necessary tools to get you through the day

It doesn't matter who you are because there ain't  no other way, go on, go on

Easy comes and easy goes  

Well easy comes but here we go again

Just take two of these and call me later on
Everything is cool, you can borrow what you want
I've got the necessary tools to get you through the day

It doesn't matter who you are because there ain't  no other way, go on, go on
