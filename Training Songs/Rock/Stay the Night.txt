I don't want you to misunderstand me
I just want to say what's on my mind
No need to hit me with an attitude
Because I haven't got the time

I want you to know one thing is certain
I truly love your company
I won't take no if that's you answer
At least, that's my philosophy

Stay the night, there's room enough here for two
Stay the night, I'd like to spend it with you
Stay the night, why don't we call it a day
No on can stop us, and nothing is in the way

It comes from friendly conversation
And if you still don't have a clue
Unless there's something else you've got in mind
We've got better things to do

Stay the night, there's room enough here for two
Stay the night, I'd like to spend it with you
Stay the night, Why don't we call it a day
No one can stop us, and nothing is in the way

(Just to have you near me) Here by my side
(Just to have you near me) And when I get next to your body
(Just to have you near me) Oh
One thing I can tell you, we're gonna be fine
We're gonna have a very good time!

Stay the night, there's room enough here for two
Stay the night, I'd like to spend it with you
Stay the night, Why don't we call it a day
No one can stop us, and nothing is in the way

Woooooh, woooooh, woooooh
No one can stop us, and nothing is in the way
What do you want to say?

Stay the night
Stay the night
