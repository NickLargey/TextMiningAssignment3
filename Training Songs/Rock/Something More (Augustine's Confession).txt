Augustine just woke up with a broken heart 
All this time, he's never been awake before 
At thirty-one, his whole world is a question mark 
All this time, he's never been awake before 

Watching dreams that he once had feed the flame inside his head 
In a quiet desperation of the emptiness he says 

[Chorus]
'There's gotta be something more than what I'm living for 
I'm crying out to You 
There's gotta be something more than what I'm living for 
I'm crying out to You' 

Augustine, all his fears keep falling out 
All this time, he's never been awake before 
Finding out his old dreams aren't panning out 
All this time, he's never been awake before 

But he's mad to be alive and he's dying to be met 
In a quiet desperation of the emptiness he says 

[Chorus]

Hey, I give it all away 
Nothing I was holding back remains 
Hey, I give it all away 
Looking for the grace of God today 

[Chorus]

There's gotta be something more than what I'm living for 
I'm crying out to You
