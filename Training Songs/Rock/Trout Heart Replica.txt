They've been circling
They've been circling
Since the day they were born 

It's disturbing
How they're circling
Fifty feet from the pond

Pretty often
Pretty often
I don't want to be told

It's a problem
It's a problem
It's a problem I know
And I won't keep what I can't catch in my bare hands without a net
It's hard enough to walk on grass so conscious of the consequences

They've been jerking
They've been jerking
In a pail by the dock

I know that oxygen might
Make them blossom and die
But I'm not going to talk

Feed them details
Feed them emails
They'll eventually grow

But it's not working
It's not working
Not as far as I know

And killing things is not so hard it's hurting that's the hardest part
And when the wizard gets to me I'm asking for a smaller heart

And I got you
I thought that I got you
now I'll ruin it all

Feeling helpless
Acting selfish
Being human and all

And they're jumping
And they're jumping
But they'll never get out

Just keep touring
Just keep on ignoring
Be a good little trout

And the butcher stops and winds his watch and lays their lives down on the block
He raises up his hatchet and the big hand strikes a compromise

Wait, we'll trade you
Wait

Please just one more day
And then we'll go with no complaining
No complaining
No complaining
No complaining
Stop
Come

And they're cutting
And they're cutting
And I think that I know
And they're gutting
And they're gutting
And I think that I know
And it's beating
Look, it's beating
And I don't want to know
And it's beating
Look, it's still beating
God, I don't want to know

And killing things is not so hard 
It's hurting that's the hardest part 
And when the wizard gets to me 
I'm asking for a smaller heart 
And if he tells me "no" 
I'll hold my breath until I hit the floor 
Eventually I'm know I'm doomed 
To get what I am asking for

Now my heart is exactly the size 
Of a six-sided die cut in half
Made of ruby red stained glass

Can I knock you unconscious as long as I promise
I'll love you and I'll make you laugh?
Now my heart is exactly the size 
Of a six-sided die cut in half
Made of ruby red stained glass
Can I knock you unconscious as long as I promise 
I'll love you and I'll make you laugh?
