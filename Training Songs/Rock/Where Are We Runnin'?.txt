Fast lane
High speed
On the grind
24/7
No time, always runnin' here and there
Chasin' the money
So much jibber-jabber's cloggin' up our soul

(Where are we runnin'?)
We need some time to clear our head
(Where are we runnin'?)
Keep on workin' 'til we're dead
(Where are we runnin'?)
Ooh-wee-ooh-wee-ooh
Where are we runnin' now?

In style
Profile
Got to buy
The new Cavalli
Keep the skin tight and the booty in the air
Don't stop the party
The road is paved but narrow
I hope we all get home

I see you up there
Oh, you up on that stage
You up there
