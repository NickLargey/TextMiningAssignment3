Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?

I’m no angel, I’m no sinner
Just an ordinary man
And I try to live my life the best I can
When the night is taking over
There’s a place I want to be
Where the rhythm is the flesh for fantasy

Come alive, come alive, come alive
Keep the good times rollin’
Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?

Come alive, come alive, come alive
When you dance the night away
The only thing that gets me through the day

Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?

You got moves that make me shiver
I’m about to lose control
You fill my hunger, body, heart and soul
And my world is dressed in velvet
It’s filled with neon light
No, I don’t mind another sleepless night

Come alive, come alive, come alive
Keep the good times rollin’
Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?

Come alive, come alive, come alive
When you dance the night away
The only thing that gets me through the day

Come alive, come alive, come alive
Keep the good times rollin’
Come alive, come alive, come alive
When you dance the night away
The only thing that gets me through the day

Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?

Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?
Could it be love, could it be love now?
