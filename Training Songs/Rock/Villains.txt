i turned the volume up this morning
till there was ringing in my ears
i haven't felt this good in years

another villain on the cover
of every major magazine
the victim somewhere in between

see how they twist and shout

and as i'm searching for the story
subscription card falls on the floor
i'm losing interest more and more

to pick it up i'm bending over
out of the corner of my eye
i see a pair of blazing thighs

see how they twist and shout
see how they twist and shout

i straighten up to look her over
and up my back a shooting pain
it's bound to settle in my brain

another villain on the cover
of every major magazine
the victim somewhere in between

see how they twist and shout
see how they twist and shout
