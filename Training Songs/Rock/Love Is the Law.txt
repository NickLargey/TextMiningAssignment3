Though I speak in tongues of angels
And in many tongues of men
Though prophecy may sing through me
Without love I'm nothing

Though I understand all mysteries
And can see the story's end
Though my faith can move mountains
Without love I'm nothing

Love is the law, the law is love
Love is the law, the law is love

You may give away your riches
Do good deeds in the sight of men
You may be strong against temptation
But without love you're nothing

Without love you're jus useless
Without love you're living in hell
Without love you're so hollow
An empty horn, a clanging bell

Love is the law, the law is love
Love is the law, the law is love

Love can suffer hardship
Love is touch and kind
Love is never envious
Or puffed up with pride

Love is always truthful
Love is never stale
Love is always hopeful
And never dreams that it can fail

Love is the law, the law is love
Love is the law, the law is love
