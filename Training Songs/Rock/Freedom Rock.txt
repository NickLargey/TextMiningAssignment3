My name is Chip
And I'm different
I don't conform
I wear a different uniform

I'm out of the blue
And so you are, too
Let me sing about one thing that's clear
That nobody owns
The pleasure of tones
That belongs to a guy with no ear

They tried to give me advice
Down at the record shop
I said sit down boys
This may come as a shock
What's all I listen to
It's all freedom rock
How can you free me
When I'm free? 
I am free

My name is Chip
And I'm different
I don't conform
I wear a different uniform

I'm out of the blue
And so you are, too
Let me sing about one thing that's clear
That nobody owns
The pleasure of tones
That belongs to a guy with no ear.
