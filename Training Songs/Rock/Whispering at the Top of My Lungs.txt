Close your eyes
Maybe someone will apologize
Maybe somehow you will hear what I'm
Whispering at the top of my lungs

Ego cursed
I feel bad about not feeling worse
Come on kiss me on the honeyburst
Whispering at the top of my lungs

Someday I'd like to forgive you
Someday I'd like to regret
Someday I'd like to remember the good things
That I seem to forget

I know that there's somebody out there
I know that they're having a blast
And now that it's time to surrender to you dear
I find you hear at last

Easy love
You cry my name
But drag no pain through my lullaby
Easy love you don't cry

Baby please
Speak now or forever bite the leash
Don't you see that I am on my knees
Whispering at the top of my lungs

Close your eyes
All is fine
Loneliness is just a state of mind
Whispering at the top of my lungs
