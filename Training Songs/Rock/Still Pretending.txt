I hear you coming up the driveway,
I tie a ribbon in my hair.
Well, look who's come to see me.
Funny, you always end up here.

[Chorus]
But it's still pretending.
And it's still wrong.
And I still can't tell my heart
Why I'm still alone.

I guess I'm supposed to lock you out.
I guess I'm supposed to play it tough.
But I see how you look at me 
Baby, it always is enough.

[Chorus]

Barefoot in the kitchen laughing,
Till you leave, when I'll be crying
Inside the door I close behind you,
Wishing you would stay.

[Chorus]
