I pull out of the driveway
And head out on the highway
And I can see them in my rearview mirror
Hanging out the window
Snappin' a shot of me
So I pull into the fast lane
Nobody's gettin' past me
And I can hear the helicopters coming
Drivin' down the street is such a pain in 
The ass for me

[Chorus]
And God I want to know why
Whoever said it was painless
Should try and be famous
You know I'm just livin' life
But nothings for free
Lets see what they say first
Front page of the papers
Some days I find that even I
Don't want to be me
Just tryin' to be me
Why don't they leave me the hell alone

So I'm hanging out on Melrose
Watchin' all the girls go by
Then a hottie spots me
Sippin' on tequila
So happy to be alone
No need to call the paparazzi
Cause they already got me
Everybody's got a cell phone camera
Walking down the street is such a 
Pain in the ass for me

[Chorus]

And I'm just tryin' to be me
And I'm just tryin' to be me

[Chorus]

Repeat chorus to end of song
