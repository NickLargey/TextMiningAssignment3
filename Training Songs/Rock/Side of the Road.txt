I'm half dead, I'm the third alive
A quarter ticking over on the middle by the side of the road
Don't get surrounded by people you hate
They'll choke you out the house
Down the path and out the garden gate

Ooh, I'll ever, never, not once when we're together
One gun punks on vogue at the side with the bands
And the vans and the gangs and the clan
With the monkey man high with a little girl at his side

What is it that you're doing to me?
Oh, I don't know, I know, I know, I know
I know, there came a truce and tea

Ooh, I will never, never, not chop those two together
With wheeling dope just do it on the side
With the bands and the fans and gangs and the clan
With the monkey man high with a little girl at his side

Well, I'll never, ever, now that we're together
Waiting on the dope
As he's queuing up inside, inside graveyard

I'm half dead, I'm the third alive
A quarter ticking over on the middle by the side of the road
