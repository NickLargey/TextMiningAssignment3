I touch your lips and, all at once, the sparks go flying
Those devil lips that know so well when I am lying
And though I see the danger, still flames go higher
I know I must surrender to your kiss of fire
Just like a torch, you set my soul within me burning
I must go on along the road, no returning
And though it burns me, it turns me into ashes
My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire

I can't resist you, what good is there in trying?
What good is there denying you're all that I desire?
Since first I kissed you, my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave; I want to be...

Don't pity me, don't pity me
Give me your lips - the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight, devil take tomorrow
I know that I must have your kiss although it kills me
Though it consumes me, your kiss of fire
I know that I must have your kiss although it kills me
Though it consumes me, your kiss of fire
