In the dust, thereâ€™s a flame that burns
Pack of wolves watch the meat in turns
Because the pain that you alone will feel
Will never seem as real
As the night you went and died

Where in the world, has a fool like you to run
When the sun (burns beyond the veil of days)
She broke her vows
She lost her life (in the end they call us death)

When the stars in the sky they bleed
All my life they've lied to me
The hearts of men possessed by sin
Revenge it pulls me in
When the devil calls me home

Me home

Where in the world, has a fool like you to run
When the sun (burns beyond the veil of days)
She broke her vows
She lost her life (in the end they call us death)

Where in the world, has a fool like you to run
When the sun (burns beyond the veil of days)
She broke her vows
She lost her life (in the end they call us death)
She broke her vows
She lost her life (in the end they call us death)
