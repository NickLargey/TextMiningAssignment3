Laugh out loud [Nat & Nic] (Ha ha ha)
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
Laugh out loud (Ha ha ha, can you hear me')

The day I left my mother and my father and my sister
Lookin' for a job to pay the rent and buy my dinner
I found it so boring

You see my life revolved around a long term lover
Music was the same I had no time for any other.....interest
This was my whole life

"You can't sing, [Mel & Nat] if you want to make a living
Stop dreaming", [Mel & Nat] as a little girl I would listen to them say
I just kept smiling
Oh now I'm a sing it now!

One two what's a girl to do'
I said 3, 4 I'm gonna laugh some more (can you hear me laughing')
I'm gonna 5, 6 get in the stitch
You'll never know you'll never ever break me baby

One two what's a girl to do'
I said 3, 4 I'm gonna laugh some more (its just so funny)
I'm gonna 5, 6 get in the stitch
You'll never know you'll never ever break me baby

Now times have changed I found myself involved with another
Still tryin' to forget the game without goin under....slowly
Yet I'm still gooooooooin (still going)

I can't believe the way some people want to stomp on others
Tryin' to take away a sense of pride, must be fulfillin'
If you got no feeling

You can't sing [Mel, Nat & Nic]
I thought I already told y'all that
Stop dreamin' [Mel, Nat & Nic]
Now get yourself back into class
Can't you see what ever you are trying to achieve rewards in nothing'

You'll never know you'll never ever break me baby

As I laugh Haaa Haaaa (Ha ha, ha ha ha) [Mel, Nat & Nic]
You can kiss my ass
All you guys thought I'd live a nonexistent life
That's right you thought I might not make it on my own
Got my own car, gold cards, I own my own home

Got to be effective, livin'' my dreams (Ha ha, ha ha ha) [Mel, Nat & Nic]
Those inhibitions I had to achieve
Try to ruin me you can't pull me down
So I'll prove you wrong and sing my song
When you pass I'll do a laugh

As you bring me down (ha ha ha ha I start to laugh a little louder baby)
I just laugh out loud (start to laugh a little harder honey)
You still on the ground (ha ha ha if you still on the ground)
As I laugh out loud (can you hear me')
