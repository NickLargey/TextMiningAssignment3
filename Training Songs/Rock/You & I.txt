Lately, what's the problem?
What's the headline, this time?
Somehow, we're okay with
All these differences leaving us blind, blind, blind

I'm not scared of fighting
I'm just a little bit over this conversation
I'm not trying to hide it
I'm just thinking slowly
Maybe you and I could live together if we ever learn to ease the tension
Maybe the world isn't crazy
Maybe it's you and I, I, I

I found the truth in the distance
I heard the words in the wind
And on it goes like wildfire
It's spreading from past lives to the living
Who's changing the people or time, time, times?

I'm not scared of fighting
I'm just a little bit over this conversation
I'm not trying to hide it
I'm just thinking slowly
Maybe you and I could live together if we ever learn to ease the tension
Maybe the world isn't crazy
Maybe it's you and I, I, I

Lost with a cause
Someone wrote down on a paper
That defines all the lines that we draw
But we don't understand what's unstable
Maybe we're all lonely and afraid
Maybe we're all trying to find the words to say
Maybe we just need love, (give me some) love, (give me some)love, (give me some) love

I'm not scared of fighting
I'm just a little bit over this conversation
I'm not trying to hide it
I'm just thinking slowly
Maybe you and I could live together if we ever learn to ease the tension

Maybe the world isn't crazy
(Maybe it's you and I)
Maybe the world isn't crazy
(Maybe it's you and I)
Maybe the world isn't crazy
Maybe it's you and I, I, I
