(Hey baby)
Yesterday has just departed
Yet tomorrow hasn't started
All that really matters
Is right now
And you should
Live a lifetime
In each minute
Take the sweetness
From within it
Yesterday has gone
Without a sound

Come on, baby,
Let the good times roll
Time is wasting
And we'll soon be old

Just give in
To what you feel inside
Give your life a chance
To open wide

(Hey baby)
Yesterday has just departed
Yet tomorrow hasn't started
All that really matters
Is right now
And you should
Live a lifetime
In each minute
Take the sweetness
From within it
Listen to me
Yesterday has gone
Without a sound

What's the good
Of living in the past
Look around you
Things are changing fast

Don't concern yourself
With what's ahead
It's too late to live
When you are dead

(Hey baby)
We gotta live for today
No time to live for tomorrow
No time for tears of sorrow
We gotta live right now
We gotta live right now
Listen to me --
Yesterday is gone
It's never gonna come back again
A laugh's gotta last forever
No time for the tears or the pain
Dreams are there for the making
Hopes are there for the taking
Gonna get it together
And face stormy weather
Baby, baby, take hold of the moment

Yesterday has just departed
Yet tomorrow hasn't started
All that really matters
Is right now
And you should
Live a lifetime
In each minute
Take the sweetness
From within it
Yesterday has gone
Without a sound

Yesterday has gone
Yesterday has gone

We gotta live right now

We gotta live
We gotta give
we gotta live
We gotta give right now

We gotta live
We gotta give
we gotta live
We gotta give right now
