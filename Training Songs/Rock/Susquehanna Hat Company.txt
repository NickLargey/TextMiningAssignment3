So she said f*ck this town,
Nothing's ever going down
Spun herself round and round
Drilled herself into the ground
Twenty kids fell in that hole
I was twenty-one out of control
She crawled right inside my brain
She's some mental hurricane

All you do is say her name
Everybody goes insane

So I said screw that girl
She's the end of the world
Don't like what she does to me
Makes me hate my memory
I said things I am ashamed
To the girl with three first names
She crawled right inside my brain
She's some mental hurricane
