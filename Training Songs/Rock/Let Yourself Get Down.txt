Feel the beat
Lose the beat
Move your feet
Stomp your feet
Do the freak
Feel the heat
I'm so sweet 
So petite
I got pretty little feet they're so petite
I got shiny little legs so nice and neat
My belly button I q-tip it clean
They call me wicked witch because my mouth's so mean
My toes 
So short and sweet
They used to call me stubby now they lick my feet
Smoke in the bowl
Smokin' through the toll
Let yourself get down
Let yourself get down
Let yourself get down
Let yourself go
I got pretty little panties
I like a seville
I'll give em to ya free for a dollar bill
So sweet 
So petite
So sweet 
So petite
My body baby so complicated
Once you get to it you'll be glad you waited
Cause baby's the lady 
Sexy like sadie
No g no are baby she's x-rated
To all the fly boys to all the fly boys to all the fly boys why doncha enjoy
Schooly school y'all 
Hangin' in the hall y'all
He never goes to the mall y'all
Let yourself get down
Let yourself get down
Let yourself get down
Let yourself go
Let yourself get down
Let yourself get down
Let yourself get down
Let yourself go
With whole lotta soul
Appetizin'
Young firm and...???
Appetizin'
Kaos kaos ya don't stop with the schism that makes a primal drop
Like that y'all 
To the top y'all 
I just want to q-pump the rock y'all
'cause the beat the beat it's so luscious
We'll make your body move but don't rush us
Because the beat's so vicious 
And the ladies on top is so delicious
Take control
Lose control
Find your soul
Lose your soul
Take it slow
Let it go 
The more you know
The less you know
Let yourself get down
Let yourself get down
Let yourself get down
Let yourself go
Let yourself get down
Let yourself get down
Let yourself get down
Let yourself go
Let yourself get down
Let yourself get down
Let yourself get down
Let yourself go
