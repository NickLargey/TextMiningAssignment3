Since you took my heart 
I can give you everything 
So I'll give my everything 
To you my love 

[Chorus]
As we`re far apart 
I will send my all to you 
And I'll send my whole life too 
To you my love 

Long to be near you and hold you and kiss you my sweet 
When I am with you I know that my life is complete 

Now I'm coming home 
Coming back to give my love 
To the one I'm dreaming of 
To you my love 

[Chorus]

Now I'm coming home 
Coming back to give my love 
To the one I`m dreaming of 
To you my love 

To you my love 
To you my love
