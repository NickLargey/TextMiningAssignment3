Yes it means I'm in love again
Had no lovin' since you know when
You know I love you, yes I do
And I'm savin' all my lovin' just for you
Need your lovin' and I need it bad
Just like a dog when he's goin' mad
Hoo-ee baby hoo-ee
Baby won't you give your love to me
Eeny meeny miney mo
Told me you didn't want me 'round no more
Hoo-ee baby hoo-ee
Baby don't you let your dog bite me
 
Yes it's me and I'm in love again
Had no lovin' since you know when
You know I love you, yes I do
And I'm savin' all my lovin' just for you
Need your lovin' and I need it bad
Just thinkin' of you makes me feel so glad
Hoo-ee baby hoo-ee
Baby won't you give your love to me
Eeny meeny miney mo
You know it's you that I love so
Hoo-ee baby hoo-ee
