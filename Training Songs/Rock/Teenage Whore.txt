When I was a teenage whore
My mother asked me, she said, "Baby, what for?
I give you plenty, why do you want more?
Baby, why are you a teenage whore?"

I said, "I feel so alone and I, I wish I could die"
I've seen the things you put me through and I, I wish I could die

When I was a teenage whore
The rain came down like it never did before
I paid good money not to be ignored
Then why am I a teenage whore?

I've seen your repulsion and it looks real good on you
Denying what, what what you put me through

Of my house, get out of my house!
Get out of my house, get out of my house!

When I was a teenage whore
My mother asked me, she said, "Baby, what for?
I give you plenty, why do you want more?
Baby, why are you a teenage whore?"

I've seen your repulsion and it looks real good on you
I don't want to live what you had, you have put me through
I wanted that shirt and I, I wanted those pants
It's all the lying put me through and I
I never, whoa!
