Saint Joe he said he's never been 
Dressed up like a woman 
Saint Joe they said your dad is gay 
They said your mom 
She's a whore they said it 'till you 
Were raw they said your mom 
She's a bore they made her beg 
Them for more my Aunt Mary 
Aunt Mary 
Aunt Mary says 
They have the darkness there in their eyes 
Saint Joe he said he's never been made 
Up like a woman 
Saint Joe the time is coming when
When Mary never will return 
When Mary never will come back here
Yeah Mary never will return 
Oh Mary please 
Come home 
Oh my aunt Mary 
Aunt Mary 
Aunt Mary says they have 
The darkness there in their eyes 
Oh my aunt Mary 
Aunt Mary 
Aunt Mary says they have the darkness there 
They have the family disease 
They have the darkness there in their minds
