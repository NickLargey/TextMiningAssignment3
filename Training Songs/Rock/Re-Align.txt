Decisions made from desperation
No way to go
Internal instincts craving isolation
For me to grow

[Chorus:]
My fears come alive
In this place where I once died
Demons dreaming
Knowing I, I just needed to realign

Fell in a river of illusion
And apathy
Drowning in a self-induced confusion
I'd rather be

[Chorus x4]
My fears come alive
In this place where I once died
Demons dreaming
Knowing I, I just needed to realign

Yeah!
