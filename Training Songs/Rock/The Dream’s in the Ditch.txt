Well the dream's in the ditch
Now the kids are all pissed
But its not new to hate what they make you do
First they pull all your teeth
Then they'll want you to eat
Well get over it kid
You don't want any part in it

But its not the way you cant afford your time
Or the envy of the friends you've left behind
So whenever you go they can have everything you lose
Is this it? This is it

So they paid you to scream
But it buried your dreams
So you wait for the pain
That will send you to sleep again
Now you walk with your wolves
Like you got nothing to lose
Act like you don't care
While you pray for a cross to bear

But its not the way you cant afford your time
Or the envy of the friends you've left behind
So whenever you go they can have everything you lose
Is this it? This is it

Is this it?
Is this it?
This is it!

But its not the way you cant afford your time
Or the envy of the friends you've left behind
So whenever you go they can have everything you lose
This is it. Is this it?
