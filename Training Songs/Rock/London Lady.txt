Little lady 
With Dingwall's bullshit 
You're so stupid 
Foetid brainwaves 
Little lady 
What really happens 
When you see mirrors 
You get the shivers 

Ah! 

Making love to 
The Mersey Tunnel 
With a sausage, have you ever been to Liverpool? 
Please don't talk much 
It burns my ears 
Tonight you've talked for a thousand years 

Plastic's real when you're real sick 
Plastic's real when you're real sick 
Plastic's real when you're real sick 
Plastic's real when you're real sick 
Plastic's real when you're real sick 
Plastic's real when you're real sick 
Plastic's real when you're real sick 
Plastic's real when you're real sick 

Tell me what you've got to look so pleased about 
Tell me what you've got to look so pleased about 

Oh London Lady 
Why did you lay me? 
Your head is crowded 
With the names you've hounded 
The lines around your 
Eyes they show me 
You realize the party's over London Lady 
Party's over London Lady 

Tell me what you've got to look so pleased about 
Tell me what you've got to look so pleased about
