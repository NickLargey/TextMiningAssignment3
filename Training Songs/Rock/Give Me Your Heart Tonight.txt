Oh-hoh tonight 
I'm walking the streets again 
Running away 
From all of my tears and friends 
Oh-hoh tonight 
The stars are in darkened sky 
They don't hold all our life
I can see in your lonely eyes 
'Cause I'm not waiting for a secret 
I don't wanna hear a lie 
Don't want the promise of tomorrow 
Give me your heart tonight 

Too young 
Too young to start selling down 
I'm getting too old 
To wanna keep running around 
Oh-hoh your love 
Is something I don't wanna miss 
And I follow 
Is leading on a one night kiss 

'Cause I'm not crying without out reason 
I'm not asking what is right 
Just like the changing of the season 
Give me your heart tonight 

'Cause I'm not waiting for a secret 
I don't wanna hear a lie 
Don't want the promise of tomorrow 
Give me your heart tonight 

I'm not crying without out reason 
I'm not asking what is right 
Just like the changing of the season 
Give me your heart tonight 

I'm not crying without out reason 
I'm not asking what is right 
Just like the changing of the season 
Give me your heart tonight 

Ohhhhh, Ohhh, Ohhhhh 
Give me your heart tonight 
Ohhhhh
