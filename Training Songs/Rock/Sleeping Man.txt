You're a freak of nature
You are a Siamese
You are in a pickle jar
For all the world to see

Watching the sleeping man
Watching the sleeping man
Watching the sleeping man
Watching the sleeping man

You are a guarded secret
In a government home
But now they come to see you
By the busload
