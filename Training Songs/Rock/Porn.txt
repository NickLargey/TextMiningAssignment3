Hey

She's the one who keeps me bored
I'm meaningless and uncensored
Baby, baby, drinks for free
I'll let you tumble down with me
So much to do, so much to say
So much to prove, so much to fake

I hate it when you frown this way
I hate you so much got to say
Baby, baby, masquerade
Baby I'll just masturbate
So much to do, so much to say
So much to prove, so much to fake

Hey, yeah
And I hope you like porn
'Cause if you want to stick with me
Yeah you better like porn
The way I do
And it has to be real
It has to be real funky
Yeah you better like porn
The way I?

So
Don't understand the points you make
And should've stayed in bed today
Baby, baby, drinks for free
I'll let you tumble down with me
So much to do, so much to say
So much to prove, so much to fake

Hey, yeah
And I hope you like porn
'Cause if you want to stick with me
Yeah you better like porn
The way I do

Some people have no points to make
So tell me why we're on this date
So baby, baby, drinks for free

So much to do, so much to say
So much to prove, so much to fake
