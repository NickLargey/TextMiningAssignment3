On the streets that go by number
Still can't figure out how to get home
There is no life lines, only dead lines
Sure picked a fine time to be born
First you taste it then you're wasted
By the time you're almost 16 years old
Everything used to be so simple
Like the beating of a heart
Dedicated to my little darling
Right until the day we'd part
There's a fist on the door
I can hear it knocking
Gotta check it out
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
There's something heavy going down
And there's more to it than a pistol and a gun
There's something going down
On a midnight operation
When the searchlights make your skin crawl
My reaction to the action is
I don't want to be doing this at all
Breaking rules that are made in schools
That teach you how to be successful
Used to be oh so simple
Like the beating of a heart
Dedicated to my little darling
Right until the day we'd part
There's fist on the doorI can hear it knocking
Gotta check it out
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
There's something heavy going down
And there's more to it than a pistol and a gun
There's something going down
Something heavy going down
There's more to it than a pistol and a gun
There's something going down,
Something heavy going down
There's more to it than a rocket and a bomb
There's something going down,
Something heavy going downA
Nd there's more to it than a pistol and a gun
There's something going down, down, down, down yeah
Something heavy going down
