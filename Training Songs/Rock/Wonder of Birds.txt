We keep our hands above the water
We know that, someday, we will fly away
With all the wonder of birds
With all the wonder of birds

We keep our voices as guarded secrets
Wait for awhile
And we will surely sing
With all the wonder of birds
With all the wonder of birds

We make a sky where we may be
We build a home with windows to fly through
Windows to fly through

We learn to dance with broomstick partners
Grace will be ours

When we will grow our wings
With all the wonders of birds
With all the wonders of birds
