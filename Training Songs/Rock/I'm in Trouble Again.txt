Oh man
I'm in trouble again  
Oh man
It's got me worryin'

I don't like worryin'
I don't like worryin'
I don't like to worry
It gets me all confused

Oh man
I'm in trouble again  
Oh man
It's got me hurryin'

Feels like I'm always hurryin'
I don't like hurryin'
I don't like hurryin'
It gets me all confused

Oh man
I'm in trouble again  
Oh man
It's got me worryin'

I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble again
Can't you hear me tellin' ya
I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble again
Oh man
