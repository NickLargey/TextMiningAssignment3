Though there are many roads to lead us
Through heaven and hell and in between
Fate is the frame sometimes deceives us
When it cruelly leads to broken hopes and dreams

Will you be my sanctuary
Comfort me when all the world's in vain
Shelter me should I run for cover
Show me the sun when all I can feel
Is the rain

Sympathy, warmth and understanding
With every breath of your love bequeathed
And I'll know I can get save landing
Even though the storm may rise
From deep beneath

Will you be my sanctuary
Be for me when all the world's in vain
Let me know your true devotion
Open my eyes when I feel them
Closing with pain

When all around seems to be trouble
When life seems only to deceive
When nothing really seems to matter
And I look in desperation
For something I can believe

Will you be my sanctuary
There for me when all the world's in vain
Shelter me when I run for cover
Open my eyes and help me to
Be once again
