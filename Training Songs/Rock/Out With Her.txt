They say it's meant to change your life
When you fall in love
And if this is what it's like
I couldn't ask for more
You put out the fire
And I'm not too vain to make a change
Even though it's not my style
I'll try to say goodbye
And I never ever wanted to be part of this

When I'm out with her
You know that I don't care
You know that I don't care
When I'm out with her
You know that I don't care
You know that I don't care

If you chose another
Well I won't suffer
It's true, you never needed
Anybobody, anytime
So the guilt is mine
You make everything
and I know I shouldn't care at all
I know I shouldn't care but there
He's already there
And I never ever wanted to be part of this

When I'm out with her
You know that i don't care
You know that I don't care
When I'm out with her
You know that i don't care
You know that I don't care

Must have been something in the way
You smiled at me
When you put me at ease
I don't ask you for please
Do you feel? 
Do you feel? 
Do you feel the way I do?

Feel it, you could say I love you
Feel it, you could say I need you
But you forced me into a corner
I can't take no more!

When I'm out with her
You know that I don't care
You know that I don't care
When I'm out with her
you know that I don't care 
Feeling your touch all night
You know that I don't care
Feeling your touch all night
