Under an emerald moon
'Neath the sun's furious lights
The center of a storm
Or the stillness of night

A million miles away
Or as close as your breath
Before you were born
Or mere seconds from death, yeah

Hey, when you fall down
(When you fall down)
I will pick you up
(When you fall down)
And when you call out
(When you fall down)
I will come to you, I will come to you
(When you fall down)

On your wedding day
Or a funeral procession
With a fleeting notion
Or a moody obsession

With a shriek of a devil
Or the laugh of a child
A saint's fervent prayer
Or the call of the wild

And when you fall down
(When you fall down)
I will pick you up
(When you fall down)
And when you call out
(When you fall down)
I will come to you, I will come to you
(When you fall down)

And nothing you can do
Will drive me away
And push me away
Will drive me away, away, away, away

And when you fall down
(When you fall down)
I will pick you up
(When you fall down)
And when you call out
(When you fall down)
I will come to you
(When you fall down)

And when you fall down
(When you fall down)
I will pick you up
(When you fall down)
And when you call out
(When you fall down)
I will come to you, I will come to you
(When you fall down)

I will pick you up
