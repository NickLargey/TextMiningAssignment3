Moving on
I can see
These things moving
Please
One down, and I'm on my knees
So please don't take this away from me
I hope that you know that the world is still spinning around
I hope that you don't let the weight of it all get you down
It's just to say
I'm on my way

My head is filled with disease
At least my body is free
Of black cans, tempting the devil in me
And walking these streets by the sea
I hope that you know that the world is still spinning around
I hope that you don't let the weight of it all get you down
It's just to say
I'm on my way

The last time I came around
I saw you 
You never looked so proud
Looking back, I wish I was there now
Talking about some girl
How she'd ruined my life somehow
How she'd ruined my life somehow
