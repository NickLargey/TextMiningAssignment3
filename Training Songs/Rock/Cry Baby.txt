Pick you up on a Saturday night hopin' that later I can hold you tight
Spendin' my money like it's out of style
I love my truck it brings a smile from you baby

You don't like it I'll say goodnight
I don't need no cry baby bye bye

Took you out on another date I begged you baby please don't be late
Supposed to be ready 'bout an hour ago
Me downstairs just pacin' the floor
You're late, I'll wait

You don't like it I'll say goodnight
I don't need no cry baby bye bye

The moon is rising, we could be driving
Girl we're just wasting time
With all your crying your just denying
Any love that comes to you

Bless my soul what's wrong with you
Crying all the time like babies do
The game you're playing is just not my bag
Why must you be such a drag
No fun I'm done

You don't like it I'll say goodnight
I don't need no cry baby bye bye

I don't need no cry baby bye bye
Baby bye bye
Baby bye bye
