Give me my cycle and a star-filled sky above
And a good lookin' woman with a heart full of love
I'll go to any honky tonk in any old town
'Cause I am the wild one and I'll never settle down

I am the wild one, I am the wild one
I am the wild one, I'll never settle down

I've got a gal in every town who claims she loves me so
I love 'em and leave 'em and want them all to know
That when I hear that wild wind a blowin' down the road
I know I'll have to travel fast to leave without a load

I am the wild one, I am the wild one
I am the wild one, I'll never settle down

I am the wild one, I believe in travelin' light
Just me and my cycle speeding through the night
I love a lot of women and I take them all around
But I am the wild one, I'll settle down

I am the wild one, I am the wild one
I am the wild one, I'll never settle down
Never settle down, I'll never settle down
