He was barely a man that morning when he got on that plane
In his pocket some music and pictures of home
A few days later he's lying in the jungle, beneath the pouring rain
Listening to songs of freedom, feeling scared and alone
Can anybody tell me why I'm here, where's the rhyme where's the reason
It's all so crazy, it's madness over here, just who are we fighting for
The guys back home, they're feelin' no pain, yeah, they're living and lovin'
While we are flyin', dancin' and dyin' in this rock 'n roll war.
Everything looked the same that morning, when he came home again
In his baggage some medals and memories of war
But he was different, changed forever and out of touch with time
Walking the streets of home, he felt lost and alone
Can anybody tell me where I am, I feel like a stranger
Some call me hero, some have called me names, some don't call anymore
I made it home, but I'm still in pain, I'm not livin' or lovin'
For I'm still flyin', fightin' and dyin' in that Rock n' Roll war
Tell everybody I feelin' better, It's been slow but I'm healing
Through mother earth and father time, I don't hurt like before
I love a good woman, we have a son, he's our joy, our salvation
May he never fly in, fight in or die in some rock 'n roll war
Tell everybody I'm doin' all right, yes, I'm livin' and lovin'
For I'm done flyin', livin' and dyin' in that rock n' roll war.
