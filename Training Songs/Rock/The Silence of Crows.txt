Go!

I just see another day
Someone to see over tomorrow
You must see yesterday
I know what you did last day

The silence of crows
The art of dying
I'm walking the other way
I don't care nothing changin' tomorrow

Kuzure ochi yuku gensoo no kagiri [The illusion's shadow goes to destroy the calm]
Sozo sareta futashikana kozo [Uncertain structures are created]
Ume tsuku sareta hikari no naka ni ha [In the light, it starts to bury]
(It is over) The silence of crow
No reason why

'Cause just is
(No reason why)

So! The silence of crows

I just see another day
Someone to see over tomorrow
You must see yesterday
I know what you did last night

The silence of crows
The art of dying
I'm walking the other way
I don't care nothing changin' tomorrow

Tojikomerareta gensoo mo kageri [confined illusion and shadows]
Sugi saru kao ha futashikana shoozoo [Unsure images passing by my face]
Kizamikomareta ikari no hate ni ha [Cut the anger's end]
(It is over) The silence of crow
No reason why

'Cause just is
(No reason why)
