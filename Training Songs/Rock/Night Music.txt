Can you here the lone night music coming in so near
When I hear the lone night music
Every nightmare crumbles and they disappear
And you hear the echoes calling, speaking in verse
When I hear the lone night music
Everything gets stronger and I lose this curse

Help me break the chains that hold me from the truth
I want to feel the hands that raise me from a low down level
To the highest roof, woh oh
Night music, I hear it now night music

I want to catch the rock that's falling, roll it back up hill
When I hear the strange night music
The whole world's turning and I'm still standing 
Still I feel it growing deep inside me, still I'm at a loss
When I hear the lone night music
It's a warning signal there's a bridge to cross

(The time and place to cure your bitter heart)
Feels like running water, water of the soul
Spinning like a spinning wheel, way beyond control
Spinning like a spinning wheel, way beyond control

Can you hear the lone night music coming in so far 
When I hear the lone night music
It's a lonely planet, it's a burning star
I want to swin the widest ocean, diving in so deep
When I hear the lone night music
I can get so blue that I just can't sleep
Sing to me, oh night music, coming in so near
When I hear the lone night music
All my nightmares crumble and they disappear
