Oh, I feel it coming round
I hear it, sounds like the good life
I know
Oh, I see this running down
Defiance comes, oh
The underground is overground
The overground will pull you down
It's how it goes in these times
How we know it's in their eyes
Upstarts now are on their way
Upstarts now have to pay

Oh, I hear us coming round
Denial comes, oh
The underground is overground
The overground will pull you down
It's how it goes in these times
How we know it's in our eyes
Upstarts now are on their way
Upstarts now have to pay
And hear, they tell it now so fast

Oh, I hear us coming round
Oh, I feel it
Upstarts are on their way
