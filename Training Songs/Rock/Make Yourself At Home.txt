"I'll leave them on the table in the same brown bottle, you know," 
She said, "It's good to have you home." 
The second the I smelt the scent of my own house I said it.
"Send just one postcard home.
And call as often as you can to tell us how it goes.
Let us know." 

"Make it a note to make a point," he said 
That's good advice I'll take it,
Now, I'll start to use it to know.
Sentence long messages,
From me to you to let you know I'm ok, 
I'll let you know.

I'm out making you proud.
So, don't wait up, I'll be home soon.
I'm out of town for now.
You're what makes it home that I'll come back to.

"Make it a note to take your time," they begged. 
"Take baby steps to everywhere, and come home in one piece to us."
You know, it's so good to be home,
And know that when I hit the road,
I'm thinking of you both, I miss you. 

"Send just one postcard home,
And call as often as you can to let us know how it goes,
Let us know."

I'm out making you proud. 
So, don't wait up, I'll be home soon.
I'm out of town for now.
You're what makes it home that I'll come back to.

Thank you for everything.

I'm out making you proud.
So, don't wait up, I'll be home soon.
I'm out of town for now.
You're what makes it home that I'll come back to.
