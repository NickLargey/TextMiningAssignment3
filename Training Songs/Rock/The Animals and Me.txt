The animals and me have been in league through history,
I love them and they love me,
Oh I have been there.
Cats and dogs have got it sussed
They worm their wa into your trust,
Spend there whole life getting fussed,
Oh I have been there.
For a very long time.
The animals and me have been in league through history,
I love the fish in the 7 seas,
Oh I have been there.
Cows and sheep suffer great defeats
'cause they weren't quick enough on their feet,
And now we're cooking them up to eat.
Oh I have been there.
For a very long time.
There's a message here, for what it's worth,
Tht the meek shall inherit the earth.
That makes me a heir from my day of birth.
Oh I have been there.
