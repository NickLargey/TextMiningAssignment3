Lightning smashing on heavy like beat
Excuse me the diff but I just can’t wait
Deep in a dungeon that’s rattling the chains
Man got to fight, he’s gonna eat my brain

It feels so good to be afraid
Vincent Price is back again

The heart pumping now, the music sound of time
The vampire’s dying, he’s got him wild
Red blood dripping, she doesn’t have a prayer
I know it’s not real but I just don’t care

It feels so good to be afraid
Vincent Price is back again

I want seven screaming virgins on a sacrificial altar
Hell and God, screeching doors, zombies, aaaaah!
