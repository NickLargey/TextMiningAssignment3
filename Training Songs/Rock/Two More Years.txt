In two more years, my sweetheart, we will see another view
Such longing for the past for such completion
What was once golden has now turned a shade of grey
I've become crueler in your presence

They say: 'Be brave, there's a right way and a wrong way'
This pain won't last for ever, this pain won't last for ever

Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years so hold on
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years so hold on

You've cried enough this lifetime, my beloved polar bear
Tears to fill a sea to drown a beacon
To start anew all over, remove those scars from your arms
To start anew all over more enlightened

I know, my love, this is not the only story you can tell
This pain won't last for ever, this pain won't last for ever

Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years so hold on
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years so hold on

You don't need to find answers for questions never asked of you
You don't need to find answers
You don't need to find answers for questions never asked of you
You don't need to find answers

(dead weights and balloons)
(drag me to you)
(dead weights and balloons)
(drag me to you)
I've become crueler since I met you
(dead weights and balloons)
I've become rougher, this world is killing me

You don't need to find answers for questions never asked of you
You don't need to find answers
You don't need to find answers for questions never asked of you
You don't need to find answers
