Our curse has spread
The fault to each our families
And so we've left
Yeah we tried to understand it
So who I
Put our book back off the shelf
We still have a while to go

If you'd ever unwind
And relax then maybe

If you'd ever unwind
And relax then maybe
We can have a good time
This would help (i know)

Our curse can spread
We said to us from our families
Brought years, brought tears 
The hurt was so demanding
But I don't mind
This book will take a lifetime
We still have a while to go

If you'd ever unwind
And relax then maybe
We can have a good time
This would help

If you'd ever unwind
And relax then maybe
We can have a good time
This would help (ah, ah, ah)

If you'd ever unwind
If you'd ever unwind
If you'd ever unwind
