Have you seen my baby
On the avenue
You know she's drivin' me crazy
With the funny things she do
I've seen her with the milkman 
Ridin' down the street
I said "please mister milkman
Send my baby home to me"
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on
You know it's been so long
Since she has been gone
Hold on hold on hold on

Seen her with a gypsy 
Dancin' in the woods
She's always been unfaithful to me
she ain't never been no good
I said "please don't talk to strangers baby"
But she always do
She said, "I could talk to strangers if I want
'Cause I'm a stranger too"
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on
You know it's been so long
Since she has been gone
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on ohh, hold on
Ohh hold on hold on yeah hold on

Mmmmm hmmm...hold on...
