I met her down
At the apothecary
With sad sad eyes
The burden she carried

Oh darlin' try this one
If you need a friend
I've got the cure for
The shape that you're in

When you met me you were numb
From the voice in your head
Conspiracy, delusions
That your boyfriend kept fed

But I swear I want nothin'
Just give me your hand
I've got the cure for
The shape that you're in

Your saccharin luster
She's a hard little pill
She eased me and taught
My hands to be still

Just once in the morning,
Evening again
She had the cure for
The shape I was in

Since I met her down
At the apothecary
Her sad sad eyes
The burden she carried

Oh darlin' try this one
If you need a friend
I've got the cure for
The shape that you're in

All delusions of grandeur
They've long left my head
As I rode off the notion
That I’ve been well bread

First she shot me with whiskey
Then she chased me with gin
Swore I was the cure for
The shape she was in

Then she left me, reeling,
With that time release feeling
Like a low whisper thunder
I hung from the ceiling

So if you see me down
At the apothecary again
I can't find the cure
For the shape that I’m in

Since I met her down
At the apothecary
Her sad sad eyes
The burden she carried

Oh darlin' try this one
If you need a friend
I've got the cure for
The shape that you're in

I've got the cure for
The shape that you're in.
