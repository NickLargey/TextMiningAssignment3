Waking up I see you dreaming of a drive in
Open yr eyes to see TV-set in blue
I've been waiting for you to smile, I'm the great head freezin' 
Wintertime comes summer, you are why it's happenin', to me

Sugar babe, sugar babe do it to me
Do me babe, do me babe can't you see me?
Sugar now, sugar now do it to me
Do me babe, do me babe can't you see me?

I feel the morning slip in sights into your mirror
Now I see what you might see it's pretty clear
I been looking just to feel that funny feelin'
I don't know but it's a mystery to reckon, right you

Sugar babe, sugar babe do it to me
Do me babe, do me babe can't you see me?
I'm sugar now, sugar now do it to me
Take me babe, take me babe can't you see me?
