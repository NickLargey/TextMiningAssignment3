You're the queen of the slipstream
With eyes that shine
You have crossed many waters to be here
You have drank of the fountain of innocence
And experienced the long cold wintry years

There's a dream where the contents are visible
Where the poetic champions compose
Will you breathe not a word of this secrecy
Will you still be my special rose?

Goin' away far across the sea
But I'll be back for you
I'm gonna tell you everything I know
Baby, everything is true

Will the blush still remain
On your cheeks, my love?
Is the light, is the light always seen in your hair?
Gold and sliver they placed
At your feet, my dear
But I know you chose me instead

All right

Well, I'm goin' away far across the sea
But I'll be back for you
Tell you everything I know
Baby, everything is true

You're the queen of the slipstream
I love you so
You have crossed many waters to be here
And you drank, and you drank at the fountains of innocence
And experienced, you know very well

You're the queen (you're the queen), queen of the slipstream (queen of the slipstream)
Yeah, yeah, queen of the slipstream (you're the queen)
I seen you slippin' and slidin' in the snow (you're the queen)
Oh, queen of the slipstream (you're the queen)
You come running to me, darling (you're the queen)
Queen of the slipstream (you're the queen)
(You're the queen)
(You're the queen)
