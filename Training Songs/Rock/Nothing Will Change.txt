The boys find a home in a family born of hate
The girls plant desperate love
In a womb that just won't wait
Forgotten mother pushes a cart with her heart

Through a twisted fate
As walls come down and spirits rise
The business of fear never dies
The artful dodgers with their false alarms

Take from the mouths to feed the arms
Pit god against god for a piece of land
They think they hear his words but they don't understand
Like a river lost on its way to the sea

Where is humanity
I know that nothing will change
'Til it changes in me
'Til it changes in you

There's a plague upon the body
A plague upon the mind
While the bridge is burning are we deaf dumb and blind
From the fallen forest to the poison bay

The world is turning
Turning out that way
Fe fi fo fum
I smell the blood of an Englishman
Fe fi fo fum

I smell the blood of an Irishman
I smell the blood of an African
I smell the blood of Americans
I smell the blood of a Chinaman
I smell the blood of an Indian
I smell the blood of Rumanians
I smell the blood of a Latin American
I smell the blood of a million sons
I smell the blood of everyone
