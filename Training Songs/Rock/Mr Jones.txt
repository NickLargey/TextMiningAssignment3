Mrs. Jones is 17 and 6 and 24 moderately pretty
She is all the girls you know
We are going far away, we're going for a ride
Mr. Jones has got a plan if you just come inside

So good, so far, slow down ha ha
Movie stars and ads
And radio define romance
Don't turn it on, I don't want to dance

Mr. Jones is beautiful, your eyes are made of glass
Looking through the window you can see the world go past
Here's another 9 o'clock and here's another day
Wonder how the weather is and what the people say

So good, so far, slow down ha ha
Movie stars and ads
And radio define romance
Don't turn it on, I don't want to dance

Mr. Jones can turn you on and turn you off again
Mr. Jones is all of you who live inside a plan
Put your head upon the pillow never put it down
That would only wake you up and turn your head around

So good, so far, slow down ha ha
Movie stars and ads
And radio define romance
Don't turn it on, I don't want to dance
