Go!

Sick, am I sick?
And for these last five years
I've been stuck up in here
Inside this brain that drains into society
Inject it in your veins

Give me hand grenades
Give me razor blades
Give me anything to make the pain go away
'Cause these pills don't work
Sometimes they make it worse
And now I'm slowly going down the fucking drain

The lights are on
But there's no one home
And I sit here in my dark place alone
Dark place alone

I, I don't mind the side effects of my so-called life
Now I bide, bide my time
To infect this world with my, with my fucking mind

The lights are on
But there's no one home
And I sit here in my dark place alone
Dark place alone

Now I'm sick in the head, in the head, motherfucker
Like the living dead, living dead, motherfucker
Now I'm sick in the head, in the head, motherfucker
Like the living dead, living dead, motherfucker

The lights are on
But there's no one home
And I sit here in my dark place alone
Dark place alone

The lights are on
But there's no one home
And I sit here in my dark place alone
Dark place alone
