Mother,
Don't let me down,
I've been away, but I'm here right now.
And mother,
Don't let the past hunt you down,
Cause I've been away,
Well I'm here right now.
I've been away, but I'm here right now.

And I will be here.

So this time,
We won't speak a word.
I'll swallow my pride, oh I know, I know you're hurt,
And this time,
We'll run till the sun begs the night,
To give up the trail that you once left behind,
Oh she'll give up the trail that you once left behind.

I will be here,
And I will not fade.
I will not ever fade.

So come out and trust in the mercy of love,
And drive out the ghosts, that you see when I'm gone.
And reach out,
Rise like the sun in the sky,
Light up the dark nights, light the hard times,
On your way now.
Light up the hard times,
All the way,
Till you see me again.

I will be here.
And I will not fade,
I will not ever fade.

Right or wrong,
Life goes on,
So trust in love
Always trust in love

I will be here.
And I will not fade,
I will not ever fade.
