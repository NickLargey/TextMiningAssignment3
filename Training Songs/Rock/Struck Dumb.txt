Misery
Is a little line
Or a little dash
It's a subtraction sign

Happiness
Is a little cross
So if you're feeling lost
Use it to add it up

For crying out loud
Stop following your brow
Start living in the clouds
Go and make your mother proud

[Chorus]
The negativity is ruining your sleep
It makes you wanna cry on your pillow
The negativity is controlling your dreams
So say, "hello there, something only I know
I'm struck dumb, but I give it a go"

All of us
Are genius
There's more than enough
To go between us

Everyday
You create
Everything in every way

Laziness
Come on and play
With ignorance
On a motorway

All of us
Are genius
There's more than enough
To go between us

For crying out loud
Stop following your brow
Start living in the clouds
Go and make your mother proud

[Chorus: x3]
