No matter what you do, no matter what you say
I've had enough of you I'm gonna break way
I'm off and I'm runnin' just as far as I can go
I've had it up to here and I want out

I'm gonna get my kicks I'm gonna have me fun
I gonna take your tricks my life has just begun
Well baby, I'm off and I'm runnin' just as far as I can go
I've had it up to here and I want out

Took my love for granted and you pushed your luck too far
Well, you play things underhanded and now I know just what you are
So baby, I'm off and I'm runnin' just as far as I can go
I've had it up to here and I want out, yeah

No matter what you do, oh no matter what you say
I've had enough of you I'm gonna break way
Oh baby I'm off and I'm runnin' just as far as I can go
I've had it up to here and I want out

Yes I am off and I'm runnin' just as far as I can go
I've had it up to here and I want out
Yes I am off and I'm runnin' just as far as I can go
I've had it up to here and I want out
