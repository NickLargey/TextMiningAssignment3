(R) Teenage groupie's true romance
Sitting on the sidelines cuz you can't dance
Buried to the knees
I know the city is vast, it's a parking lot
It's safe in the suburbs but you got caught
Hiding in the trees

You were turning their heads when you were young
Cherry stems on the tip of your tongue
And kissing everyone
You were left behind by the boys and girls
Now you're falling off the end of the world
Who's your Shangri-La?
(w/F distant backup:)
You're buried to the knees
And you're hiding in the trees

(F) Holding out for something more
Do you know what you're looking for 

(F/R) Holding out for something more
Do you know what you're looking for 

(F) Holding out 
for something more		(R) Who's your Shangri-La
Do you know 
what you're looking for	And who will set you free?

Holding out 
for something more		Who's your Shangri-La?
Do you know 
what you're looking for	Might as well be me

(R) Your high rise utopia
Maybe there's still hope for you
To find you Shangri-La
(w/ F) Or you'll be buried to the knees
And hiding in the trees
