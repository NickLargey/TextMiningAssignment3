The fire rages in me,
Never want to see the roses on your door.
The glass that separates our touch,
Soaring into the unknown skies
Fearing what we're fighting for.
This is a war we cannot win!

[Chorus]

Our last time to make stars collide
Right before our eyes!
Believe in everything,
Everything you've ever known
Reciting words we lost,
These years will never be untold
I won't be alone!
The fire rages in me,
Daylight fights through the night
With the cries of redemption
The sun ignites the light in our eyes.
And is this possible

[Chorus]

Our last time to make stars collide
Right before our eyes!
Believe in everything,
Everything you've ever known
Reciting words we lost,
These years will never be untold
I won't be alone!
This time we fight, side by side, you and I!
This time we fight, side by side, you and I!
The bringers of light, the teeth in the night
The teeth in the night
The bringers of light, the teeth in the night
The teeth in the night
I won't be alone
