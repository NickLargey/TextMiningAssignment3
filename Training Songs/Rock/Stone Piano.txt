Ten cent store is in my way
Just can't do what the captain say
There's not enough night
And too much day
Ain't got time to hear
That stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down
Wish I was a hired gun
Cruel shogun a poor man's son
One day I'd stop and click my heels
Turn around to see
My stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down
The troubador is in disguise
Bats and curious I use my eyes
My own two hands were on the keys
This is no mystery
My stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down
