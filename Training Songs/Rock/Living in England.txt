I didn't want to be so superstitious
I didn't want to say that I was wrong
But does New Orleans have voodoo
Does cocaine make you chew 
Are you acting like I wanted you to do 
Living in England 
I don't have to act like I'm having fun 
Sitting here in the sun 
In England 
In the jazz land I kept flashing to Angel Heart 
In the heat you'll watch the fans go round and round and round 
In that heart pumping south 
It knocks my head about 
Are you acting like I wanted you to do 
Living in England 
I don't have to act like I'm having fun 
Sitting here in the sun 
In England 
When I'm out and dreaming 
When I'm on my own 
When I'm out and dreaming 
Living in England 
I don't have to act like
I'm having fun 
Sitting here in the sun 
In England
