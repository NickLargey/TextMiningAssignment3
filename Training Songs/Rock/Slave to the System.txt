The road before you see it coming
Everything is there
A change is necessary
A better nation's in the air
All around you vicious barracudas
Tearing out your back
A sleazy manifesto
Feeds the revolution that you lack

Dirty hands are itching
Dirty eyes are glowing in your path
Weasel minds are working
Dreaming dollar signs that last and last
Promising the sky
Chasing the ambulance of plastic life

[Chorus]
They light the fires inside your brain
And what it is, I can't explain
You must believe in all you do
That better days are coming soon
So open up your very soul
And lay it out, they will behold
And if you do, you'll never be
A slave to the system

Speak in quips and phrases
Cryptic and distinguished, heart and soul
Now the backs are breaking
Feel the pressure and do as you're told
Crawling out of corporate vacuums
Now they've got you by the balls
Just another black hole
For believers like yourself to fall

[Chorus]

Now the world is listening
Tell them something that they may not know
The minions and their grand delusions
Always come and go
We're beaming down by satellite
This guerrilla warfare point of view
Manipulate the monster
Before it brings a change in you

[Chorus]

We're all slaves
Slave to the system
We're all slaves
Slave to the system
