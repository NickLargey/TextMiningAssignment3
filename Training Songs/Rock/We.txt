If there is anything
You need
You can get anything
For free
Out of the darkness comes
A tree
Even out everything you see
And rise

And rise
If you ever feel the need

To hide
Go with the honest answer
Inside
You can tell anyone you find
To rise

To rise
To rise
To rise
Goodbye...
