Put your pretty dress on 
It's time for you to go to the dance
Tie your hair in red buns and lace
And wear pearls around your neck

And all the pretty princes will see you
All the pretty princes will see you
Someday, someday

Put your red boots on 
It's time for you to walk home from school
Everyone will laugh, pointing fingers at you
They'll be cruel
But cover up your ears and don't say anything
'Cause you're much better than them

Someday, someday
And they'll wave to you
And they'll wave to you

Put your red coat on and walk with the light in the woods
If it gets dark don't get scared
There's so much waiting for you
Cover up your ears and don't show them
'Cause you're much better than them

Someday, someday
And they'll wave to you
And they'll wave to you
And we'll wave to you

'Cause they don't see you like I see you 
If they did they'd see that nice little girls grow up
To become homecoming queens

Put your red dress on
Put your red boots on
And they'll wave to you
And they'll wave to you
And we'll wave to you
And we'll wave to you

Put your pretty dress on
Put your red boots on
Put your red coat on
