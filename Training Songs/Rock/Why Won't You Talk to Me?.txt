Why won't you talk to me
I've done nothing wrong that I can see.
You know I can't take this silence, tell me what's wrong with you
If I'm supposed to feel guilty, tell me what did I do

It must be a reason for you acting this way
But I swear I won't know it 'til you come out and say.
Why won't you talk to me
I've done nothing wrong that I can see.

I don't know why I'm trying to break down this wall
That you build up between us or nothing at all
It feels like a bad dream, it feels like a game
But I swear this is one time that I'm not to blame.

Why won't you talk to me
I've done nothing wrong that I can see.
