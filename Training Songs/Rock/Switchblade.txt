Sittin' in the backseat
Suckin' on a switchblade
Whispering in my ear
But I can not hear what you say

Your mama should have loved you
But I know she's an animal
Even if she loved you, she's riding with her hands full
Sometimes all you need is just a taste
You did what you could to hide your deed
Even then, it could not be erased
And you found all you need is just a taste
(Yeah)

Walked into the bathroom
Suckin' on a switchblade
Your lips are made of rainbows
You're never gonna behave
You came into my basement,
Looks to me you're wasted
You said it was my last chance
To take you to the wasteland
(So I did)
Sometimes all you need is just a taste
You did what you could to hide your deed
Well even then, it could not be erased
You found out all you need is just a taste

Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Sittin' in the backseat
Suckin' on a switchblade
