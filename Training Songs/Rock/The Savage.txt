We both take the hardest punches
And collect black eyes just to prove it
Still we passed by just like strangers
And we speak just like the closest enemies
Enemies
Woah, in the shadows of our life
We can fall into the night unscarred
Woah, in the shadows of our life
We can never let it go this far
Somehow my words that are useless
Still I pull my lip down to my fuckin' chest
Yeah, my jaw is
Tired from waiting to say the things that you should hear
You should hear
Woah, in the shadows of our life
We can fall into the night unscarred
Woah, in the shadows of our life
We can never let it go this far
After all, still the same
These empty promises, seem to never change
There's a smile on my face and it's 2: 55 a.m.
And this cramp in my wrist
Puts me back asleep till it all comes around again
With a closed fist
With a closed fist
With a closed fist
With a closed fist
Woah, in the shadows of our life
We can fall into the night unscarred
Woah, in the shadows of our life
We can never let it go this far, woah
