How was I to know you'd just come along?
And funk my life up
Lips like debbie's, sing sex like strawberry songs
Just funk my life up
Never heard her coming, thought it was just another woman
With a shotgun in her hand
Funk my life up

She's the bass, she's the beat, she's the rhythm, she's the band
Just funk my life up
And that girl, so fine
Makes you wanna scream hallelujah

Sly hands, spinning wax lights, oh God
Beats are dripping on me like spider milk
And I never heard the warning when I woke up in the morning
With my sunshine on a drip

She's my rock, she's my but, she's the dealer trip
And that girl, so fine
Makes you wanna scream hallelujah

How could I refuse? I'm not fit to chose
Just funk my life up
Said the only way I win is the way I lose
Just funk my life up
And I never got the script, I unzipped
Got a little bit wet up there in my brain
She's your church, she's your sin, she's a comic, she's a
And that girl, so fine
You wanna scream

She gets me sinning, she's like a trick on me
Hell, I don't even know her name but yet she sticks to me
And in the climax she would scream with me
Yeah, she sticks to me
She gets me funny, she doesn't want none of my money
So I pour it over her like gasoline
Light a match and then I'm back in my teens
Me and super girl smoking my green
Me and super girl smoking my green

Oh, Lord, reload, ice bags, scream
Sweet thing, nose ring, jet pack, sing
That girl so fine, makes you wanna scream hallelujah
Hallelujah
Yeah, that girl, so fine you wanna scream
