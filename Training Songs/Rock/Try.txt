I gotta keep hold of this here feeling 
I have gotta keep hold of this here feeling ohohohohohohoh 

Loneliness don't come around here 
I've boarded up all the doors 
There's nothing to give no more 
I recall a time when I knew it all 
I wish some had done me wrong 
So I could then do no wrong 

But if you try to keep moving on 
And it seems like it's always so hard 
But if you left me 
Darling I know I'll be found 
And if you leave me don't you let me know it's alright 

Maybe I had to live and learn 
To realize 
All that I tried to give you 
Never ever ever be enough 

But if you try to keep moving on 
And it seems like it's always so hard 
But if you left me 
Darling I know I'll be found 
Oh and if you left me 

Oh and if you try 
Oh and if you try 
Oh and if you try try 
Oh and if you try try 
Oh and if you try try 
Oh and if you try
