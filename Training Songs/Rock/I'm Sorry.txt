I painted a picture of you
Your soul was red, and your mind was blue
Destiny laid a light on my creation

This dream I had made
A slave of my passion
Reality was always too far away
And we were happy
Until it came too close one day

And sudden I faced
The truth of my dream
My love had only been a picture, a scene
I suppose I needed too believe
Didn't want too see
You had never been close to me

I'm sorry, this illusion
Has caused you a lot of pain
And I have no solution
I'll try to never be back again
I'm sorry

Yes I painted a picture of youmy dream was a lie
And the lie became truth
Reality held it's breath too long
It's disgusting what dreams can do to you

And i'm sorry, this illusion
Has caused you a lot of pain
And I have no solution
I''ll try to never be back again

I'm sorry, this illusion
Has caused you a lot of pain
And I have no solution
I'll try to never be back again
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry 
I'm sorry
