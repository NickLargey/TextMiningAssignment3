I live a life alone
Inside a plastic hole
Inside a cage of stones
I dug myself this hole
I'm a freak
I'm a freak
Oh ho I'm a freak
Good Lord I'm a freak
Stacked-up on platfrom shoes
I tried so hard to be so cool
I dyed my hair in Spain
I look a mess and I feel the shame
Of the freak
I'm a freak
Oh ho I'm a freak
Good Lord I'm a freak
I walk the plastic streets
Just like a monkey
Just like a geek
My scraping knuckles bleed
I hear my Mummy crying out
He's a freak
I live a life alone
And all my friends are gone
It kind of turns me on
I hate them one by one by one
I'm a freak
I'm a freak
Oh ho I'm a freak
Oh Lord I'm a freak
I walk the plastic streets
Just like a monkey
Just like a geek
My scraping knuckles bleed
I hear my Mummy crying out
He's a freak
