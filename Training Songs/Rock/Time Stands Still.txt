Never gonna get stuck
Stuck on the past
Never lookin’ back
Let’s slow things down
Life’s moving too fast
Sand through the hourglass

Counting every minute, every moment we’re together
It could be five minutes or forever
Second hand on the clock
Workin’, workin' over time
Workin', workin', workin' over

Time stands still (Whoa)
Time stands still when it’s you and me together
Time stands still (Whoa)
The world keeps on spinning, it’s just the beginning
Everybody needs to love and be loved

Hard to believe
Where we are now
No regrets, I got no regrets
Don’t turn around

Counting every minute, every moment we’re together
It could be five minutes or forever
Second hand on the clock
Workin’, workin' over time
Workin', workin', workin' over

Time stands still (Whoa)
Time stands still when it’s you and me together
Time stands still (Whoa)
The world keeps on spinning, it’s just the beginning
Everybody needs to love and be loved

Everybody needs to love and be loved

Time stands still (Whoa)
Time stands still when it’s you and me together
Time stands still (Whoa)
The world keeps on spinning, it’s just the beginning
Don’t turn around
It’s just the beginning
Don’t turn around
It’s just the beginning
Everybody needs to love and be loved
