Last night was bad my doubts were all I had realizing I was alone 
And trying to think of someone to phone but no one came to mind 
There was nothing for me to say 
That just anyone would understand 
I was scared and afraid I was so alone

We're neurotic we've had it! 

Surround myself with people but I'm always alone human props small talk keeps silence from imposing my own mind my worst enemy it will destroy me slowly more coffee more coffee more coffee 
I'm going numb 

We're neurotic we've had it! 

It's hard for me to explain 
It's hard to understand all the fear and phobia that lays inside and traps this man when I'm surrounded I wanna scream and kick down the walls destroy what hold me I wanna smash it all 

We're neurotic we've had it
