Look around you 
Do you see what you've got
With something so beautiful
Afraid it would drop
Into a thousand regrets

And I bet you were left there
It's getting me down
And I can't understand
Why everyone Stares when I crash at the landing 
And around were they stand

Everyone talks again 

We try to say with confidence
That were picking up oblivion 
And I was tryin' to make some sense 
Speaking to you 

We try to say with confidence 
That were picking up oblivion 
Inside of you

All around you there's a feeling you lost 
That everything beautiful 
Is not what it was 
Whenever you were on top 

Of all you left up there 
It's getting me down 
To the place that I land
That hits me so hard
With a cruel understanding
That It might be the end

Everyone talks again

[Repeat Chorus]

I'll bury myself into the corner 
I can't even tell if I won't see anymore [2x]
