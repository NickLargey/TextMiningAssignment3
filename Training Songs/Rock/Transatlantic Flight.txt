I get to the airport
Around ten to three
Then I pass the border
Cigarettes and duty free

I find a fashion magazine
To pass the time
Now I really miss you
Girl but I still feel fine

I get on the airplane
With my old guitar
Someone's staring at me
Yeah it's true baby 
I am a star

Transatlantic flight
I'm alright
No gravity no night
Flying out of sight
Transatlantic flight
Hold on tight
No, I'm not scared of heights

uh uh uh uh uhhhh
Uh uh uh uh uhhhh

I look out the window
Watch the streets fade away
Now I'm almost crying
Maybe I should have stayed

I'm flying so high above
The clouds we got so far
Then I loose myself
Yeah it's true baby 
I am a star

transatlantic flight
I'm alright
No gravity no night
Flying out of sight
Transatlantic flight
Hold on tight
No, I'm not scared of heights

Uh uh uh uh uhhhh
Uh uh uh uh uhhhh
