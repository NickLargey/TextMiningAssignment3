Brandy and rye, the magpies are stirring
Lay down your last twenty dollars
Shepherds dead sober, whispering numbers
There's a star above the manger tonight

Devil gets wise when you start to win
Dead from your pleasure too soon
Horse flies are flying slow
Heavy from your remains

Silver green many mansions above us
Wash up your hands before you dive in
Sweet baby Jesus give me luck at the tables 
There's a star above the manger tonight
Turn down the lighthouse low
Let the lost keep staying lost
Shepherds dead sober, whispering numbers
There's a star above the manger tonight
