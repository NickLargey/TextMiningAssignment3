He counted his cards but there's nothing left in the deck
Drugs money and alcohol broke his hollow soul
Now he's on his knees screaming, self inflicted addiction
Too far gone, too far gone to take my helping hand

Generation, Generation, Genocide
Kamikaze casualties are falling by my side
It's a Generation, Generation, Genocide
Kamikaze casualties are falling by my side

I'll see the sun rising
Rising up again
I wish I could say the same for my fallen friends

Well I've been there, done that, and I've walked that line
Bloode knuckles and rumbles, it's love hate with this town
I said your own friends run around town, throwing your name on the ground
No back! No spine! Ain't no friend of mine!

Generation, Generation, Genocide
Kamikaze casualties are falling by my side
It's a Generation, Generation, Genocide
Kamikaze casualties are falling by my side
