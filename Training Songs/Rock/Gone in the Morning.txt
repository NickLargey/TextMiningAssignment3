Off to the land where no one's been before.
I'm gonna take my shoes of at the door.
I'm gonna go with dreams that will explode. (oowooh)
When the alarm goes off, I just won't know.

Wont you come with me? 
Wont you, come with me
Wont you, before they're

Gone in the morning, I wanna know why
Their gone in the morning, I feel alone when they're
Gone in the morning, I wanna know why they're
Gone in the morning and I

I don't mind, what's in store
Make it in my own sweet time
When I go, 

I'm gonna master all kinds of kung-fu
I'm gonna live inside a tiny zoo.
I'm gonna grow myself a giant Afro (incredible fro)
When the alarm goes off I just won't know.

Wont you come with me? 
Wont you, come with me
Wont you, before they're

Gone in the morning, I wanna know why
They're gone in the morning, I feel alone when they're
Gone in the morning, I wanna know why they're
Gone in the morning and I

I don't mind, what's in store
Make it in my own sweet time
When I go, oh I don't want to go

Wont you come with me? 
Wont you, come with me
Wont you, before they're

Gone in the morning, I wanna know why
They're gone in the morning, I feel alone when they're
Gone in the morning, I wanna know why they're
Gone in the morning and I 

Gone in the morning, I wanna know why
They're gone in the morning, I feel alone when they're
Gone in the morning, I wanna know why they're
Gone in the morning and I
