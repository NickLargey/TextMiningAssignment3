Show me a river that needs not an ocean to flow... 
No candle flickers without the first spark that entices the fire...to grow... 
You'll never see a man or woman... 
Without love how can they survive... 

(We all need, the strength of one) 
(We all need, the flesh and blood) 
(To feed our hearts, and fill our souls) 
(We're only human)... 

Show me a rainbow that shines through the eye of the storm... 
With each tomorrow, there is a new love that waits for a chance to be born... 
You'll never see a man or woman... 
Without love how can they survive... 

(We all need, the strength of one) 
(We all need, the flesh and blood) 
(To feed our hearts, and fill our souls) 
(We're only human) 

I need somebody who can share my whole life away... 
Give me something to believe... 
I need somebody who can make my life complete... 

Ooh.. yeah, you'll never see a man or woman... 
Without love how can they survive...

(We all need, the strength of one) 
(We all need, the flesh and blood) 
(To feed our hearts, and fill our souls) 
(We're only human).. 

(We all need, the strength of one) 
(We all need, the flesh and blood) 
(To feed our hearts, and fill our souls) 
(We're only human)... 

(We're only human) 
(We're only human)...
I'm only human....
