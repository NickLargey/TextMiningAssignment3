There's a king-size bed that ain't been slept in
Dinner on the table it's sitting there cold again
The front porch light just gave up and burned out

Here you are looking like something the cat drug in
With a worn out story 'bout a-where you've been
Sweet little words coming out of your mouth

You ain't gonna lie, lie here anymore
You ain't gonna break this heart
Baby, like you did before

You're a silver tongued devil that had me believin'
Every promise you were bound to break
But you ain't getting back through this door
You don't lie here anymore

You can beg and plead and say that you're innocent
That you don't know where the time went
But that trace of perfume is a smokin' gun

So you can turn right around
Go back to where you've just been
Take a look at all you'll be missin'
'Cause you won't be here when the morning comes

You ain't gonna lie, lie here anymore
You ain't gonna break this heart
Baby, like you did before

You're a silver tongued devil that had me believin'
Every promise you were bound to break
But you ain't getting back through this door
You don't lie here anymore

Hey, yeah you're a silver tongued devil that had me believin'
Every promise you were bound to break
But you ain't getting back through this door
You don't lie here anymore

You don't lie here anymore
You don't lie here anymore
