They don't make the future
Like they did in the past
Shedding scant light
On the darkness of life
It's like your making outrageous demands

And all my ancestors
Were primitive man
Just look what you've got
Admit you've lost the plot
It's something we can all understand

There's no turning back now
It's out of control
Take away history
You're left with a mystery
Life sentence no chance of parole

No need to be nervous
We'll never get caught
It's my advice
That if you've paid the price
Then don't forget to take what you've bought

See the sword of the people
A libertine angel
The sword of the people
A libertine angel
Be an angel
