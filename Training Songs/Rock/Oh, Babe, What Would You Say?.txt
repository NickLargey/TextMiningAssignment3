As I have hoped for half a chance
To even ask if I could dance with you...You oo
Would you greet me or politely turn away?
Would there suddenly be sunshine on a cold and rainy day?

Oh, Babe,
What would you say?
For there are you sweet lollipops
Here am I with such a lot to say, Hey Hey

Just to walk with you along the Milky Way
To caress you through the night time
Bring you flowers everyday
Oh Babe,

What would you say?
Just so, Baby I know
I know I could be so in love with you

And I know that I could make you love me to
And if I could only hear you say you do oo oo oo oo
But anyway,
What would you say?
