I have finally found the way to live
Just like I never did before
And I know I don't have much to give
But I can open any door

Everybody knows the secret
Everybody knows the score
I have finally found the way to live
In the color of the Lord

I have finally found the pace to live
Just like I never could before
And I know I don't have much to give
But He can open any door

Everybody knows the secret
Everybody knows the score
I have finally found my place to live
In the presence of the Lord
In the presence of the Lord

I have finally found the way to live
Just like I never could before
I know I don't have much to give
But I can open any door

And everybody knows the secret
Everybody knows the score
I have finally found my way to live
In the color of the Lord
In the color of the Lord
