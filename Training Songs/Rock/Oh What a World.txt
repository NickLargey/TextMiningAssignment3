Cried a lotta blues up and down the street 
(I'd) lose everything I had but I would not lose the beat 
Oh yeah, oh no! 
Had a lotta lovin', bitter and the sweet 

Bring you up in glory, drop you in defeat 
Oh yeah, oh no! 
Oh what a world! 

[Chorus] 
Oh, what a world we live in 
But it's the one we're given 
Stand up and face the trouble! 
Baby, I'm gonna love you 
And you can try to love me too 
Oh, yeah, oh, no! Oh, what a world! 

Middle of the night, wake up in a sweat 
The devil's gonna get me but he has not got me yet 
Oh yeah, oh no! 
Reach out and I hold you and we double up our love 

If I wind up down below you will you watch me from above? 
Oh, yeah oh, no! 
Oh, what a world! 

[Chorus] 

Oh, yeah! 
Baby keep hangin on 
Oh, no! 
don't you ever let go 

Oh, yeah! 
There's a wind comin' up 
Oh, no! 
And the sun's bound to show 

Take you to the races, put our money down 
Pick up all our winnings, dance all over town 
Oh, yeah! oh, no! 
Oh, what a world! 

[Chorus]
