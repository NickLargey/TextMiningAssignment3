Raindrops, raindrops fallin' up
A rich man livin' in a shed
A big bald eagle with plenty of hair
And a hat tryin' on a head

[chorus] Very unlikely, isn't it
Most improbable too
And it's just as unlikely that I'll ever fall
For anyone else but you

Morning glories growning down
A French cook cookin' from a can
And four square wheels on an automobile
And a pair of pants tryin' on a man

We may break up in a hundred years
There's always that possibility
But before that happens to you and me
I guarantee that we will see
(What'll we see?)

Raindrops, raindrops fallin' up
(very unlikely!)
Morning glories growning down
(couldn't be!)
And it's just as unlikely that I'll ever fall
For anyone else but you

Chestnuts, chestnuts, roasting cold
(very unlikely!)
Ice cream sodas freezing cold
(couldn't be!)
And it's just as unlikely that I'll ever fall
For anyone else but you

Raindrops, raindrops fallin' up
Raindrops, raindrops fallin' up
