What'll I do for satisfaction
Honey who'll take care of me now
If you leave I can't make it
Darlin' please don't you put me down

'Cause what'll I do for satisfaction
If you take away your heart
What'll I do for satisfaction
When that funny funny feelin's gone
Oh what'll I do

I can't take no more of missin' you
I don't know just what I'm gonna do
How can I have another
You don't know just what you mean to me

What'll I do for satisfaction
If you take away, away your heart
What'll I do for satisfaction
When my nights start to getting' long

Boy I love you
Want to hold you

Your love's strong that's no lie
And I hate, I hate to put to down
But if you, If you leave me now
You won't want, want me hangin' around

"Cause What'll I do for satisfaction
When that funny feelin' gone
Oh I need you now
