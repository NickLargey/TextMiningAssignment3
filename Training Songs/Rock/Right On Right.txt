I'm not alone with this lie we all use; 
I can't compete with the truth. 
No one feels exactly like I do. 
They just don't feel like I do. 
Right on Right, I know I can't be wrong; 
Right on Right, Right on, Right on. 
I got sails on my shoes; 
I got wind in my sails... 
Right on, Right on, Right on, Right on. 
Down in my bones, I can't change my mind; 
I'm just not the spineless kind. 
A picture comes to me George Lucas syle, 
I cop a digital smile. 
Right on Right, I know I can't be wrong; 
Right on Right, Right on, Right on. 
I got wind in my sails... 
I got sails on my shoes; 
I said Right on Right, Right on, Right on, Right on. 
Right on, Right on, Right on, Right on, Right on. 
Right on Right, I know I can't be wrong; 
Right on Right, Right on , Right on, 
I got some wind in my sails... 
I got sails on my shoes; 
Right on Right, Right on, Right on, Right on. 
Right on, Right on, Right on.
