Good is good and bad is bad
But you don't know which one you had
She put your books out on the sidewalk
Now they're blowing 'round
They won't help you when your down

Love's on your list of things to do
To bring your good luck back to you

And if you think that everything's unfair
Would you care
If you're the last one standing there

And everytime you hear the rolling thunder
You turn and run before the lightning strikes
And does it ever make you stop and wonder
If all your good times pass you by

I don't hold no mystery
But I can show you how to turn the key

Good is good and bad is bad

They won't help you when you're down

Love's on your list of things to do

If you're the last one standing there

And everytime you hear the rolling thunder
You turn and run before the lightening strikes
And does it ever make you stop and wonder
If all your good times pass you by

I don't hold no mystery
But I can show you how to turn the key
Cause all I know is where I started
So downhearted
And that's not where you want to be

And everytime you hear the rolling thunder
You turn and run before the lightening strikes
And you could find a rock to crawl right under
And let your good times pass you by

When the day is done
And the world is sleeping
And the moon is on its way to shine
All your friends are gone
You thought were so worth keeping
You feel you don't belong
But you don't know why

And everytime you hear the rolling thunder
You turn and run before the lightening strikes
And does it ever make you stop and wonder
If all your good times pass you by

Everytime you hear the rolling thunder
And you turn and run before the lightening strikes
Well does it ever make you stop and wonder
If all your good times pass you by

When the day is done
And the world is sleeping
And the moon is on its way to shine (shine)
And all your friends are gone
You thought were so worth keeping
You feel you don't belong

Neither do I
