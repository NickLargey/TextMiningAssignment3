Long Red, drifting through my mind
Dream here, dreamin' there
Two pieces all the time

Bright Red, yeah
Wisdom's in my dreams
Bits and pieces in my arms
Ain't always what it seems

Long Red, am I gonna find a way
Bright Red, when you gonna name the day

(all right)
Long Red, yeah
You have changed me too
Stranger now it seems somehow
My bread has turned to glue

Bright Red, yeah
Tears and shades of grey
I found you I vouch
Forever for today

Long Red, am I gonna find a way
Bright Red, when you gonna name the day

Long Red, yeah
Tears and shades of grey
I found you I vouch
Forever for today
