She said baby baby 
I know what you want and I'm sure
That it's time for you to try 
And get yourself the things that are yours

'Cause it could be gone in the blink of an eye
It could be dawn in the blink of an eye
Isn't it time that you reached for the sky
And let yourself go

I been crazy baby 
I know what you mean and I swear
That if there's a song in the night
You know I've gotta hear it out there

'Cause it could be gone in the blink of an eye
It could be dawn in the blink of an eye
Isn't it time that you reached for the sky
And let yourself go 

There's a fire deep inside
I said baby baby
Let's steal the moon and let love have its way
Burning like a falling star until we are

A million miles away 
It could be gone in the blink of an eye
It could be dawn in the blink of an eye
Isn't it time that you reached for the sky

And let yourself go now
There's a fire deep inside
Let yourself go now
And forget the fears you hide

Let yourself go now
And forget the tears you cried
And when you needed me
Did I just turn away

And when I spoke my heart
Is there something I forgot to say
