Honey, your junkie ass is fryin'
Honey, why don't you stop your whinin'
Your barn door opens and you don't say black
The sidewalk swallows don't you step up on the crack
H-h-honey, I know what worth was waiting for

You got your white coat mama
You got your heart of soul
I see some crucifixion behind those two eyeholes
Gonna take your white trash
Better take your white trash home

I see you hardon for the black girl
Keep your bloody hands off me
And now, take me to your white trash party
Leave me swinging from a tree, yeah

Take out your white trash
Take out your white trash, take out your
Take out your white trash
Take out your white trash, take out your
