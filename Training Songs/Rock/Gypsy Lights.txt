Hear me callin? out your name
I'll be wondering ?till the end of time
Would it still have been the same?
Put that smile on me and you?ll remain

Come back baby, come back
Come back baby, come back
To me
Come back baby, come back
Come back baby, come back
To me

I?ve seen things I should not see
On a moon at night, all oceans wide
I?ve seen Gypsy?s Lights on fire
(Flying silently across the sky

Come back baby, come back
Come back baby, come back
To me
Come back baby, come back
Come back baby, come back
To me

Lead 
On some moon at night they?ll come
Take me where true love will never die
Maybe then you?ll will return
We can fly away on Gypsy's Lights

Come back baby, come back
Come back baby, come back
To me
Come back baby, come back
Come back baby, come back
To me

Come back baby, come back
Come back baby, come back
