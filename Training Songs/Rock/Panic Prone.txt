Gave in again
The bastard
Can't keep refusing rights
So he'll loan the cash
But the sin
Is on the hands of you

So to care or
Plead silence, weak hands are calling

There's close enough
And there's too far
It won't change an empty stare
But I can't seem to end
These images
Hauntingly looks like hell

So to care or
Plead silence, weak hands are calling

Come, enter the foreign.
Face, all that's shameful.
Cheat, may the past find
Out, separating

So to care or
Plead silence, weak hands are calling
