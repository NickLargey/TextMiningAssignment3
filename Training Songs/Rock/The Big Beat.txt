I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat
I get on down

I hear the big beat
All through the town
I got the big beat
I get around

There's no time for hesitation
We got all we need to know
Don't deny the situation
Find it everywhere you go

Life it's the big beat
Roll to the sound
I got the big beat
Oh gather 'round

I got the big beat
Down in my shoes
I got the big beat
I'm gonna give it to you

It's the line of fascination
It's the rage both near and far
Synchronize a generation - yeah
It don't matter who you are - oh yeah

I got the big beat
I'll show you how
I got the big beat
You got it now - oh yeah
