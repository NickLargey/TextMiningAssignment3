I've got you
(I've got you)
And I don't need nobody else
I've got you
(I've got you)
You are all my happiness

Come what may
You brighten all my darkest days
And for this
I wanna thank you

Just to spend
One day or night alone with you
Ooh, does make all
(Does make all, ooh)
My plans, my schemes and dreams come true

Just your smile
That's made all my livin' years worthwhile
And for this
I wanna thank you, baby

Let me tell you why
Before you, life was a sad song
Every love affair I tried
Always turned out wrong

But, darling, that's that day you came to me
And you changed it, you changed it
You changed it to ecstasy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You have changed
(You have changed, ooh)
All my sorrow into endless joy
And ooh-hoo, you have made
(You have made, ooh)
A man out of a lonely boy

And there's no one else
There's no one else in this world
Can make me feel the way you do, baby
And for all of this
I wanna thank you
(I wanna thank you)

For being so sweet to me
I wanna thank you
(I wanna thank you)
You've been good to me
And I wanna thank you, yeah, yeah
(I wanna thank you)

You didn't have to love me, but you did
And I wanna thank you, baby
(I wanna thank you)
Thank you, baby

I'd like to take time out
I wanna thank you, girl, yeah, yeah
(I wanna thank you)
For being sweet to Billy
I wanna thank you
(I wanna thank you)
