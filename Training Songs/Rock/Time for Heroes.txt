Did you see the stylish kids in the riot?
Shovelled up like muck and set the night on fire
Wombles bleed, truncheons and shields, you know I cherish you my love

But there's a rumour spread nasty disease around town
Caught round the houses with your trousers down
A head rush, in the bush?. You know I cherish you my love

Tell me what can you want? You've got it all ah the scene is obscene, 
time'll strip it away a year and a day and 
Bill Bones ? Bill Bones know what I mean

He know's it's eating, it's chewing me up, it's not right for young lungs to be 
coughing up blood
It's all, it's all in my hands
And it's all up the walls? now the stale
Chips are up and they hop stakes are down
It's these ignorant faces they bring this town down how I sighed and sunken 
with pride I passed myself down on my knees

Yes I passed myself down on my knees

Now tell me what can you want see you've got it all the whole scene is obscene 
time will strip it away a year and a day and Bill Bones - Bill Bones know what 
I mean

He knows there's fewer more distressing sights than that of an Englishman in a 
baseball cap now we'll die in the class we was born
That's a class of our own

Did you see the?
