This is a song about power,
the power that you and I have in our hands.
The power of the people.
`Cause you know all over this world,
people finally get it together,
get the courage together,
they use the general strike.
It's one of the strongest things they got.
In Eastern Europe, Central America, in North America,
believe it or not,
cause it's power to the people.
Come on!

We're tired, yeah tired of working'
We're tired of working, yeah working for nothing
We all want, what we got coming
All we need is a break
Come on, make no mistake

Everything is not all right
And there's no end in sight
You can call it what you like
Come on, stand up for your rights

(Chorus)
Stand up, stand and unite
It's time for a general strike
Stand up, stand and unite
It's time for a general strike

We been out breaking our backs
Been out working, getting no slack
All week long just paying those bills
That's just the people that still got a job
What about the rest of us - on the soupline

(Chorus)
Stand up, stand and unite
It's time for a general strike
Stand up, stand and unite
It's time for a general strike

Everything is not all right
And there's no end in sight
You can call it wht you like
Come on stand up for your rights

(Chorus)
Stand up, stand and unite
It's time for a general strike
Stand up, stand and unite
It's time for a general strike
