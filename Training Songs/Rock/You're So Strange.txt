How can I survive without you in me
It hurts to let you go, I've been watching the time
I'm here waiting, fading
You and I we always had the right time together
It's crazy how we socialized
But now you've gone and kissed yourself goodbye
Oh, why

[Chorus:]
Cause you, you're so strange
You're so strange
Sometimes I try to forget all those things that we said
But baby, I'm so tired
And you girl, you're so strange

All I think about is making music
And all she thinks about is making music to me
I'm her melody
But things keep changing key
You and I we always sang the right song together
It's crazy how we harmonized
But now you've gone and kissed yourself goodbye
Oh, why

[Chorus:]

Look out, it's so heavy
There's this feeling we get
When all those things in our head
Get left inside

[Chorus:]
Oh baby, you're so strange
