Woke up with a shoe in my mouth
Should I head north or south?
You got me out on the lake
And I bank all my dreams on an earthquake

And I felt love coming through my windowpane
Tripping up the high road, tearing down the low
And I saw life chant, shouting out the window
If you want it, let it go if you want it, so

Oh, come in through my windowpane
Won't you come in through my windowpane?
Come in through
