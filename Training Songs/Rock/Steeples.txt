I heard a story about a boy
Who was swept off the deck
The sweeping tide swept the sea over his neck
But it did not end there, the boy began to swim
And dared to the sea that dared to invade him

[Chorus]
Did you ever want to know me
And did you ever feel like I could
And did you ever want to know me
And did you ever feel like I could

It's a silent steeple
That carries us down
It's a silent steeple?

But the sea would not so much as reply
So the boy yelled to the ships that were fated to die
Red sky at night, sailors take delight
Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning

[Chorus]

It's a silent steeple
That carries us down
It's a silent steeple
Sail on, take it back, sail on, take it back, sail on, take it back,
Sail on, take it back, sail on, take it back, sail on, take it back,
Sail on, take it back

We were going with the wind in our hair
And we didn't want to look back 'cause if we did
Well We would not care
And if we all were to die now
Well it wouldn't be that bad
Cause that boy in the waves said
He'd give us everything
Everything he had
To go on, and trace that scar
Like we did ten years before

[Chorus]

It's a silent steeple
That carries us down
It's a silent steeple
Sail on, take it back, sail on, take it back, sail on, take it back
Sail on, take it back, sail on, take it back, sail on, take it back,
Sail on, take it back, sail on, take it back, sail on
