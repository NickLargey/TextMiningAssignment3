She probably works in a restaurant 
That's what her momma did 
But I don't know if she ever really 
Could put up with it 
Or maybe she sings in a nightclub 
'Cause sometimes she used to sing 
But I don't know if it ever 
Amounted to anything 

But listen honey, 
Wherever you are tonight, 
I wish you the best of everything, in the world 
And I hope you found 
Whatever you were looking for 

Yeah and it's over before you know it 
It all goes by so fast 
Yeah, the bad nights last forever 
And the good nights don't ever seem to last 
And man, we never had the real thing, 
But sometimes we used to kiss 
Back when we didn't understand, 
What we were caught up in. 

Wherever you are tonight, 
I wish you the best of everything, in the world 
And I hope you found 
Whatever you were looking for 

Wherever you are tonight, 
I wish you the best of everything, in the world 
And I hope you found 
Whatever you were looking for
