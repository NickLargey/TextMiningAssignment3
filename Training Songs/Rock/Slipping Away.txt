Everything goes slipping away
In your eyes, I see the day
Everything begins to fade
What you say, slipping slipping away

Somebody take my hand
And make me understand
Here in the light of day
Everything slips away

Everything goes slipping away
Hard to find the words to say
Everything begins to fade
You give and then take it away
Everything goes slipping away
Higher and higher, closer each day
In my hands, time and again
Everything, slipping slipping away

Somebody take my hand
And make me understand
Here in the light of day
Everything slips away
