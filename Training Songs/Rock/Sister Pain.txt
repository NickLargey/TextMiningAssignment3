Hey little sister pain
Scarred with the taste of angels
My little keeper of pain
Hanging over my dark craddle

Shoot
Can I be forgiven
Shoot
Can I be forgiven
Stay with me
Stay with me, yeah
Stay with me
Stay with me, yeah

Out in the blessed remains
Stung by a passing danger
Mark's looking for a plane
I'm looking for a stranger

Just shoot
Can I be forgiven
Shoot
Can I be forgiven
Stay with me
Stay with me, yeah
Stay with me
Stay with me, yeah

Hey little sister pain
Scarredt with the taste of angels
My little keeper of pain
Hanging over my dark craddle

Shoot
Can I be forgiven
Shoot
Can I be forgiven
Shoot
Can I be forgiven

Stay with me
Stay with me, yeah
Stay with me
