Do you suffer in silence?
Do you live your life in your dreams?
Do you walk in defiance?
To escape from reality
Are you caught in the headlights standing still?
Don’t you wish you could run away?
Have you lost your desire waiting for
Someone to save you?
But no one came.

What’s your proof of life?
You can’t deny the truth that hits you right between the eyes.
So just name your price.
I’ll give anything to justify the reason I’m alive
What’s your proof of life?
What’s your proof of life?

Are you playing the victim
When you know that you volunteered?
No excuse for your sickness,
It’s your choices that got you here.
Are you caught in the headlights standing still?
Don’t you wish you could run away?
Have you lost your desire waiting for,
Someone to save you?
But no one came.

What’s your proof of life?
You can’t deny the truth that hits you right between the eyes,
So just name your price.
I’ll give anything to justify the reason I’m alive

You’re the proof of life
