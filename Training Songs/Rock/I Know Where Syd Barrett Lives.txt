There's a little man in a little house
With a little pet dog and a little pet mouse
I know where he lives and I visit him
We have Sunday tea, sausages and beans
I know where he lives
'Cause I know where Syd Barrett lives

He was very famous once upon a time
But no one knows even if he's alive
But I know where he lives and I visit him
In a little hut in Cambridge
I know where he lives
'Cause I know where Syd Barrett lives

And the trees and the flowers are so pretty, aren't they?

He was very famous once upon a time
And no one cares even if he's alive (we do)
But I know where he lives and I visit him
In a little hut by the edge of the wood

Oh shut up!
