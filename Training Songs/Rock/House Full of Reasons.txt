This is the room
Where I sat and waited till the morning
Watching the door
You slammed so hard it broke the windows
Up and down
I've climbed these walls
It seemes I'm trapped inside this

House full of reasons
I should be moving on
You had me believing
This is the way love goes
Off and on among normal people

Down in the hall
The pictures of a happier couple
Just hang on the wall
And smile away through all the trouble
Side to side
The clock on the wall
Reminding me by the hour

There's a house full of reasons
I should be moving on (moving on)
You had me believing
This is the way (the way)
Love goes (love goes)
Off and on among normal people

All day
When it's dark
(When it's dark)
It seems there's nothing here but
(Nothing here but)

A house full of reasons
I should be moving on
You had me believing
This is the way (the way)
Love goes (love goes)
Yeah, a house full of reasons
I should be moving on
You had me believing
This is the way (the way)
Love goes (it goes)
Off and on among normal people
