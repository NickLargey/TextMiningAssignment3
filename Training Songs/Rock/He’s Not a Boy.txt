He's not a boy that you can change, nor should you want to
He's not a boy that you can tame, don't let it taunt you
Don't even try to to run away, he wouldn't stop you
He's not a boy that you can chain, I know you want to
And you can wait all night
You can wait all day but
He's not a boy that you can change

We were up all night, talking trash and wasting time
When he says you're beautiful, it's not a line
But in the morning you might find that
He might have changed his mind
He can only fall in love for just one night

He's not a boy that you can change, nor should you want to
He's not a boy that you can tame, don't let it taunt you
Don't even try to to run away, he wouldn't stop you
He's not a boy that you can chain, I know you want to
And you can wait all night
You can wait all day but
He's not a boy that you can change

Even when he lies he means every word he says
His delusions find their way inside your head
And he knows that beauty lies
But he likes it by his side
Just to take it for a ride until the mystery dies

You may say "why, don't you realize
I could give you everything?"
But, you see he can't be tied
Contained, or satisfied by all
You could bring

He's not a boy that you can change, nor should you want to
He's not a boy that you can tame, don't let it taunt you
Don't even try to to run away, he wouldn't stop you
He's not a boy that you can tame, I know you want to
And you can wait all night
You can wait all day but
He's not a boy that you can change
He's not a boy that you can save
He's not a boy that you can change
