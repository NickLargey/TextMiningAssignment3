Exiled and pushed away, 
Lost in time,
Always I'll be
This bitter person, 
Who's stuck right here, 
Disillusioned

Don't stand by,
If you don't like what you see,
So unsatisfied, 
No I won't take what you say to me

Give me some time, 
Give me some reason
Make up your mind and cool down the fever,
(The) drama must die, 
So give me some way to salvage this life,
Finally it's over

You ought to stay away,
'Til you see,
What runs through me,
Unless you get this game,
The only one I wanna play

My promise is cold,
You never been told,
There's nothing to hide,
I never did lie

There's no way to win,
When love is in vain,
I won't take what you say to me

Give me some time, 
Give me some reason
Make up your mind and cool down the fever,
(The) drama must die, 
So give me some way to salvage this life,
Finally it's over

Dead End, Countdown
Dead End, Countdown
Dead End, Countdown
Dead End, Countdown

I know we're stuck inside a Dead End, Countdown,
With no communications,
Straight down,
We're drowning in our desperation,
We're lost beneath the surface

Give me some time, 
Give me some reason
Make up your mind and cool down the fever,
(The) drama must die, 
So give me some way to salvage this life,
Finally it's over

Give me some time, 
Give me some reason,
Now we're stuck inside

Give me some time,
Give me some reason,
I know we're stuck inside

Dead End, Countdown
Dead End, Countdown
Dead End, Countdown
Dead End, Countdown
