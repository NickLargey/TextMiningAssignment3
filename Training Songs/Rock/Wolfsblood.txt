You don't know who I'm talking to
Why? Because...
No one ever did
I feel it coming down my head

It's wolfs blood
It's pumping like it's fucking in my veins
And I feel my vertebrae shaking

And I feel my heart is dead
And I feel my muscles twitch
And I feel my stomach split
And I know I'm not a man
And I know inside my head

It's wolfs blood
It's pumping like it's fucking in my veins
And I feel my vertebrae shaking

And I feel my heart is dead
And I feel my muscles twitch
And I feel my stomach split
And I know I'm not a man
Oh

You don't know who I'm talking to
Why? Because...
No one ever did
I feel it coming down my head

It's wolfs blood
It's pumping like it's fucking in my veins

I'm gonna get it up
And I'm gonna break it up
And I'm gonna break his head
With my arms

Oh, hey
Know why you're dead
