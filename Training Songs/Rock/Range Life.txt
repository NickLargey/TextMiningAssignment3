After the glow, the scene,
The stage, the set
Talk becomes slow
But there's one thing I'll never forget
Hey, you gotta pay your dues
Before you pay the rent

Over the turnstile turn out in the traffic
There's ways of living
It's the way I'm living
Right or wrong,
It's all that I can do,
And I wouldn't want to let you be
I want a range life,
If I could settle down,
If I could settle down,
Then I would settle down
I want a range life,
If I could settle down,
If I could settle down,
Then I would settle down

Run from the pigs, the fuzz,
The cops, the heat
Pass me your gloves, there's crime
And it's never complete
Until you snort it up or shoot it down
You're never gonna feel free
Out on my skateboard
The night is just hummin'
And the gum smacks are the pulse
I'll follow if my walkman fades
But I've got absolutely no one,
No one but myself to blame
Don't worry
We're in no hurry
School's out,
What did you expect?
I want a range life,
If I could settle down,
If I could settle down,
Then I would settle down
I want a range life,
If I could settle down,
If I could settle down,
Then I would settle down

Out on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins
Nature kids, I/they don't have no function
I don't understand what they mean
And I could really give a f*ck
The Stone Temple Pilots,
They're elegant bachelors
They're foxy to me
Are they foxy to you?
I will agree
There isn't absolutely nothing
Nothing more than me
Dreamin' dream dream dream
