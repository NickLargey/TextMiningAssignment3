You have so many opportunities I never had
Don't push so hard nothing is ever easy
And this talent that you take for granted 
Its a gift from god
Don't pass tit up
Nothing is ever easy
Are you ready to work real hard
Are you tired its just the start
Listen to me son ill take you far
You can call it anything you want the fact remains the same 
I never got to be your Fred Astaire 
You can lie to yourself and all your friends and pretend that you don't care 
But circumstance gets in the way 
Heel, toe, heel, toe, side to side again, 
Gonna get it right 
Don't push so hard,
Nothing is ever easy 
Don't forget your please and thank you's, 
Don't forget to smile 
Don't pass this up, 
Nothing is ever easy 
Are you ready to work real hard
Are you tired its just the start
Listen to me son ill take you far (take you far)
You can call it anything you want 
The fact remains the same
I never got to be your Fred Astaire
You can lie to yourself and all your friends
Pretend that you don't care
But circumstance gets in the way
Their pushing these children for all the wrong reasons 
So far man you're crushing down their spirits 
Suffocate, emancipate, turn their backs and walk away eventually eventually
Suffocate, emancipate, turn their backs and walk away eventually eventually
Seeking seeking,oh one of these one of these 
Seeking seeking,oh one of these one of these PATHS
You're wasting time, I call it living 
To the world what are you giving 
You're wasting time, I call it living 
To the world what are you giving 
You're wasting time
