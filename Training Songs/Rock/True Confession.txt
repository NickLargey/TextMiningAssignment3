True Confession

Oh well I heard a true confession
From a boy and girl in love in love
Oh well I heard a true confession
From a boy and girl in love
The love was with honor
That always be enough be enough
He said he wanted to get married
But he guess he'll wait a while
Wait a while
He said he wanted to get married
But he guess he'll wait a while
She said she wasn't worried
And all she did was smile was smile

Oh when I heard their story
It made me feel good inside inside
When I heard their story
It made me feel good inside
I was so happy
It really made me cry made me cry
