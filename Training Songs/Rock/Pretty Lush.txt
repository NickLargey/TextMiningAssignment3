I draw them on reckless, 
Etched in, 
Scratched in like resurrection. 
Your sins are killing you 
And you can bet they'll get me too. 
I've got to give some to get some. 

Mining in the river 
Standing in the rain. 
Down on your knees 
As you heave at the drain. 

You can lead a whore to water 
And bet she'll drink and follow orders. 
And I said, "Is this what you wanted?" 
"Is this what you needed?" 
Give it some more time. 

Tonight I'm going to a party, 
But it's already started without me. 
I aced philosophy 
And mastered the art of spiritual phase. 
I've got to give some to get some. 

The disco ball spins away another year. 
I wish you a broken heart and a happy new year. 

Only three words come to mind.
