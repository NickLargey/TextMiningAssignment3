Good versus evil a classical tale
But a dreadful fact that evil prevails
A nation of destruction
A nation of death
And a crazed leader
Marches us to our death
In this country of blood and power
Is this reason to start a war
You try to deny the truth of this matter
Stop the war you fucking whore
Wake up it feels like a dream
But the nightmare continues now...
