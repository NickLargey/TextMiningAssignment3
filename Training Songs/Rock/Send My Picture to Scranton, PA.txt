Send my picture to Scranton, PA
Write them and say I'm the kid they used to laugh at
Send my picture along with the news
Of all the good things I've done
Since they said

Nothing good ever would become of me
They were so sure
Let them know just how wrong they all can be
Get someone to

Paste my picture all over the walls
In all the halls of the school I used to go to
I was mixed up and kind of confused
No one around to took the time to find out

What was wrong and to try to understand
They ignored me
Maybe now they'll give kids a helping hand

That's how it really ought to be
Not like the way it was with me

Well, no one there ever tried to understand
They ignored me
Maybe now they'll give kids a helping hand
I hope to God they cast aside
So I went out and really tried
Now they can point to me with pride.
