Stand in a line like a parking meter
Am I all alone (he's all alone)
A vision of mine is becoming clear
Its all so new it can't be true
Sometimes the words appear in my head
Sometimes I'm falling out of my bed

Oh, is it a dream
What does it mean
Oh is it a dream
What have I seen

I know a man he's really awful nice
He isn't here
We whiled away an evening maybe two
But what did that man really do
Sometimes I feel like walking away
Sometimes there's something I've got to say

Oh, is it a dream
What does it mean
Oh is it a dream
What have I seen

Then suddenly
Like a fly in a cup of tea
I'm stirred and no longer free
To fly away
I think back to the other life
That was borrowed the other night
Could It be that it just might
Drive me wild

Oh is it a dream
Oh is it a dream
Oh is it a dream
Oh is it a dream

Am I dreaming?
