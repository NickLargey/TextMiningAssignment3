I got drunk and fell asleep
Atop the sheets but luckily
I left the heater on

And in my dreams I wrote the best
Song that I’ve ever written
Can’t remember how it goes

I stayed drunk and fell awake
I was cycling on a plane
And far away I heard you say you liked me

We drifted to a party, cool
The people went to arty school
They made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonade

[Chorus]
In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name

I found an Ezra Pound
And made a bet that if I found
A cigarette, I’d drop it all and marry you

Just then a song comes on:
"You can’t always get what you want"
The Rolling Stones, oh woe is we, the irony

The stones became the moss
And once all inhibition's lost
The hipsters made a mission to the farm

We drove by tractor there
The yellow straw replaced our hair
We laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth

In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name

You said, "We only live once"
So we touched a little tongue
And instantly I wanted to

I lost my train of thought
And jumped aboard the Epping as
The doors were slowly closing on the world

I touched on and off
And rubbed my arm up against yours
And still the inspector inspected me

The lady in the roof
Was living proof that nothing
Really ever is exactly as it seems

In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name

We caught the river boat downstream
And ended up beside a team
Of angry footballers

I fed the ducks some krill
Then we were sucked against our will
Into the welcome doors of the casino

We drank green margaritas
Danced with sweet senoritas
And we all went home as winners of a kind

You said "I guarantee we'll have more fun
Drink till the moon becomes the sun
And in the taxi home I’ll sing you a Triffids song"

In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name
