Kelly and I meet secretly
We stay out of sight
When we're in each others arms
We know it isn't right

We are so in love
But he loves you too
How can I tell my best friend
That I'm in love with you

He's told me of your sweet caress
And of your lovely eyes
Just how long can we go on
Telling him all these lies

We are so in love
But he loves you too
How can I tell my best friend
That I'm in love with you

Oh, Kelly, please, please tell me
We gotta find a way
Tell me what can we say
Oh, Kelly

He's coming home tomorrow
He's been gone so long
We could get away tonight
To run would be so wrong

We are so in love
But he loves you too
How can I tell my best friend
That I'm in love with you

Oh, Kelly, please, please tell me
We gotta find a way
Tell me what can we say
Oh, Kelly
Oh, Kelly
Oh, Kelly
Oh
