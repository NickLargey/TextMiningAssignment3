In my darkest state of mind
I am riddled with despair
When I try and close my eyes
Your voice is all I hear
I will think of you tonight
I will hold back all my tears
I've waited all these years

Please don't go away
You're making a mistake
You and I were meant to be
You opened up my eyes
And made me realize
Now its changing everything
It's crazy how I feel this way
I can't explain don't go away

I see your shadow all the time
I see your face inside my mirror
Like a sunset in the sky
You distract me from my fears
I keep holding it inside
And I wish that you were near
It's better when You're here

Please don't go away
You're making a mistake
You and I were meant to be
You opened up my eyes
And made me realize
Now its changing everything
It's crazy how I feel this way
I can't explain don't go away

All the things you said
And all the games we played
Will come back to you
See the look in your eyes
Oh, don't go away

Please don't go away
You're making a mistake
You and I were meant to be
Please don't go away
You're making a mistake
You and I were meant to be
You opened up my eyes
And made me realize
Now its changing everything
It's crazy how I feel this way
I can't explain why I feel this way
It's hard to say
I want to make you see
What you mean to me
Don't go away
