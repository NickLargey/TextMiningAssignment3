Certain my heart, too much impaired
My life was falling into disrepair
I was beginning to despair
Of finding love at all

No one gave me a second look
Fewer still knew of a good book
She said, "I would if I didn't
Have to work so hard"

And her eyes turn green
When she's feeling love
When she's feeling bad they
Turn blue

They're hazel when she works
Until she sees
That my love can change her
Grey eyes, back to green for me

Told me I caught her at her worst
Saw the confusion and the hurt
She felt that she'd been living
With this curse for far too long

But in the twinkling of an eye
Something between us laughed and cried
As we began to see
Indeed together we could fly
