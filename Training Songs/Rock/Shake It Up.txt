Dance all night, play all day 
Don't let nothing get in the way 
Dance all night, keep the beat 
Don't you worry 'bout two left feet 
Just shake it up 

Dance all night, get real loose 
You don't need no bad excuse 
Dance all night with anyone 
Don't let nobody pick your fun 
Just shake it up 

Dance all night go go go 
Dance all night, get real low 
Go all night, get real hot 
Shake it up until you pop 
Dance all night whirl your hair 
Make the night cats stop and stare 
Dance all night go to work 
Do the move with the quirky jerk 
Just shake it up.
