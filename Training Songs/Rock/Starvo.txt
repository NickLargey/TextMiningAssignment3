Never been so low
Half the world is dying while I'm waiting by the phone
Never want to be alone
Half the world denying what everybody knows
They want you to think that you always owe
While they make a killing selling greed to those who can afford
They'd take you down if you ever show
In living you believe not what you own
Start the fire
Never take me down
