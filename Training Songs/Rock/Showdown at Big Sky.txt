Soldier of fortune
He's a man of war
Just can't remember
What he's fighting for
Start a revolution
Right before your eyes
When you hear the big bang
Don't you be surprised

Showdown at Big Sky
Darkness at high noon
Showdown at Big Sky
That day may be soon

And people, people
Can you hear the sound
From every village and every town
Let the bells ring out
Hear the bells ring in
Let the bells ring out
Keep them ringing, ringing

Can't predict the future
Can't forget the past
Feels like any moment
Could be the last
All you believers
Standing inside this room
Can't you see it coming
Shooting out across the moon

Save this place
In the valley of tears
By the river of time
From weapons race
In the Book of David
In the holy night
When it's laid to waste
It will be written
By the children of Eden
I said save this place
And the Holy Ghost

Showdown at Big Sky
Darkness at high noon
Showdown at Big Sky
That day may be soon

And people, people
Can you hear the sound
From every village and every town
Let the bells ring out
Hear the bells ring in
Let the bells ring out
Keep them ringing, ringing

Save this place
In the valley of tears
By the river of time
From the weapon's race
In the Book of David
In the holy night
When it's laid to waste
It will be written
By the children of Eden
I said save this place
And the Holy Ghost
And the Holy Ghost

Showdown at Big Sky
Darkness at high noon
Kiss tomorrow goodbye
That day could be soon

Give us the strength
Give us the wisdom
And give us tomorrow

Let the bells ring out
Hear the bells ring in
Let the bells ring out
Keep them ringing, ringing

Let the bells ring out
Hear the bells ring in
Let the bells ring out
Keep them ringing, ringing
