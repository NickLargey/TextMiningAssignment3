I've met so many people who look the same
Most were forgotten but you still remain
Most of the time I don't care
But London so far away n when your there
And so it saddens me to say I'm only happy when I move away

I am young and I am lost
Every sentence has its cost
I am young and I am lost
You react to my ripost
We look out upon the sea
We look out upon the sea the coast is always changing
Ill bring my camera out to sea
The coast is always changing

Age makes a difference till you open your mouth
Use your time just to work things out
I no that you can't understand
When I tell you that this wasn't planned
And so it saddens me to say
I'm only happy when I move away

I am young and I am lost
Every sentence has its cost
I am young and I am lost
You react to my ripost
We look out upon the sea
We look out upon the sea the coast is always changing
We'll take the train out to sea
My heart is always changing

It won't be long before you've gone
I can't imagine leaving
I can't imagine leaving
I can't imagine leaving
I can't imagine leaving

We look out upon the sea
We look out upon the sea the coast is always changing
Ill bring my camera out to sea
My heart is always changing
We'll take the train out to the sea
My pulse is always racing
As we look out upon the sea
The coast is always changing

And though it saddens me to stay
I'm still waiting for that day
