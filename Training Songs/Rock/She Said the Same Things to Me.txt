You know she talks like ev'rybody in the room
Was gonna listen in
Carries on a conversation
Like some others call their children in
Tho you can't believe one sentence
Man you hang on ev'ry word
Til the line of trash she's talkin'
Just gets more and more absurd
Well I give it to you brother
She said the same thing to me 
It was at another party
But to her I guess they're all the same
You know she'll ask you for a lite
And pretty soon she wants to know your name
When she drops her tone to sweetness
Man you know she's zeroed in
There's another sucker waitin'
Even as she reels you in
Well I'm here to tell you brother
She said the same things to me 
"Do you drive a nice car
And are you goin' far
Are you man enuff for me"
Yes I am All night All night 
Once you get her out the door
Man she just wants you to take her home
You thought that you were Mr. Cool
Ma this chick has got a heart of stone
Before you need a cold shower
Take a tip friend if you please
This rap she's layin' on you
Is just a bogus strip tease
Well I'm here to tell you brother
She said the same thing to me
