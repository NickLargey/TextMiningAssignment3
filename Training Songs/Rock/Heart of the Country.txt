I look high, I look low
I'm lookin' everywhere I go
Lookin' for a home
In the heart of the country

I'm gonna move, I'm gonna go
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
Lookin' for a home
In the heart of the country

Heart of the country
Where the holy people grow
Heart of the country
Smell the grass in the meadow
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Want a horse, I want a sheep
I wanna get me a good night's sleep
Living in a home
In the heart of the country

I'm gonna move, I'm gonna go
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
Livin' in a home
In the heart of the country

Heart of the country
Where the holy people grow
Heart of the country
Smell the grass in the meadow
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Want a horse, I got a sheep
I'm gonna get me a good night's sleep
Livin' in a home
In the heart of the country

I'm gonna move, I'm gonna go
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
In the heart of the country

Heart of the country
Where the holy people grow
Heart of the country
Smell the grass in the meadow
Whoa, whoa, whoa
