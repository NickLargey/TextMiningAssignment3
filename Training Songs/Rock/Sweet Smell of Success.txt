You get a taste it ain't enough
To eat your fill you need the stuff
You think you're there about to land
But is the trip just what you planned

You're falling, yes you're falling
For the sweet smell of success
You're gambling like everyone
Who cares who wins you're having fun

And you'll be back another day
You think you'll win next time you play
You're falling, yes you're falling
For the sweet smell of success

You check your hand you're looking good
You see a paath within the wood
She beckons you what can you do
But follow her to somewhere new

You're falling, yes you're falling
You're falling, yes you're falling
For the sweet smell of success
