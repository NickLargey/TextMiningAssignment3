I should not be out tonight 
I should see the morning light
I should know what's wrong or right
I should be at home tonight
But instead I'm goin' outta my head

I should not be out tonight 
I should be in bed by nine 
I should try to stay inside
I should be at home tonight
But instead I'm goin' outta my head
But instead I'm goin' outta my head 

But I feel fine when I'm with you
Yeah I feel fine when I'm with you
