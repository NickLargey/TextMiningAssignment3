If I were made of stone could you shake my soul
To its very core like no one could before
Now you turned me into such a fool and you know it's true
And if I never make it back to you, just know I wanted to

If I were made of stone could you shake my soul
To its very core no one could before
It was easy to block the thought of you
But you get right through and I'm glad you do
Now you turned me into such a fool and you know it's true
And if I never make it back to you just know I wanted to

I don't know how I can tell you straight
Its gotta be just the right time anyways
I swear to god one day I'm gonna say it to your face

Yeah, one day

If I were made of stone could you shake my soul
To its very core like no one could before
Now you turned me into such a fool and I don't know if you know it's true
But if I never make it back to you just know I wanted to

Just know I wanted to, just know I wanted to

And I don't know if you know it's true
But if I never make it back to you just know I wanted to
