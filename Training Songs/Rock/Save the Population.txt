History's so strong
History's so strong
History's so strong
History's so strong

Sing another drinking song the honky tonk will do
Make another breaking bomb your favorite ingÃ©nue
This the distant dawn
This the distant dawn

I put my cards up on the table
I do this speak cause I am able
One pixie's broken down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Shine at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down

Stay all night, we'll save the population 
Pistol and its pawn
Sail it through the lexicon
Pistol and its pawn
Blood and borderlines be drawn

Take another bottle down the brothel and the shrew
Make another awful sound, a rather gothic brew
History's so strong
History's so strong

I put my cards up on the table
I do this speak cause I am able
One pixie's broken down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Shine at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down

Stay all night, we'll save the population
