If you'd only take some time tonight
To my name
Then maybe I'd reach to grab
Or throw a hand out to you

And even though it'll cause you more pain
To look back
You ask...
That's part of the past

You ask...
To live the past

Live the end again
Live the end again
Live the end again

If you ask me, I would love to follow
I'd help you pack
Or would the things I pack
Be might too much aghast

And then everything you ask forever never last
So you ask...
To live the past...
Live the end...
The end again

Live the end again
Live the end again
Live the end again

Live the end again
Live the end again
Live the end again
