Mine, (mine, mine, mine)
Mine, (mine, mine, mine)
Mine
Mine

All the years
All the nerve
It's the least I deserve

A paper prison
Within white walls
Brown upholstery armour all

Stop me, don't touch me, don't stop, cause I'm such a creep
Stop me, don't touch me, don't stop, cause I'm such a creep
Stop me, don't touch me, don't stop, cause I'm such a creep
Stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me

Mine
Mine
Mine
Mine
Mine

Family business
Nice and neat
Like a cover on a toilet seat

You piss me off 
And I piss you off
A waste ends before it's won

Stop me, don't touch me, don't stop, cause I'm such a creep
Stop me, don't touch me, don't stop, cause I'm such a creep
Stop me, don't touch me, don't stop, cause I'm such a creep
Stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me

Stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me
Stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me
Stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me
Stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me 

Mine (mine, mine, mine, mine)
