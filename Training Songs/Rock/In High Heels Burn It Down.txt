Your windows face the stars
When everything's black
They tell us, they keep up

They calling me into the shadows
Lonely girls with trouble at home
They calling me to kick the shadows
Braze my knees and sing the motto
In high heels burn it down

You fear flashes back and scars
You're never in your heart
You're 24 and I'm not

You change your name and sleep in shadows
Lonely girls with trouble at home
Who change their names to creep in shadows
Braze my knees and sing the motto
In high heels burn it down

In high heels burn it down
