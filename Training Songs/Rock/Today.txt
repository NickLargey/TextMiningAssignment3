As you expect here as the keys
So come and go as you please
Whats mine seems to be yours
Welcome to my drawers

Today I heard them say a funny thing
They were happy you were clean
You were headed for success
In the mountains of excess

Today you fail them
Tomorrow more
Maybe I'll lend you some more cash
Don't have to pay it back

I can depend on you
Dependent on everyone
Why am I guilty of my bending back
Over to breaking

The object of some desire
Too late too late
Today I'm saving you
I must have finished my last care

With that beer
With some ideal I might win
While losing
That's some mentality I have

To finish talking
I finished talking
Today I heard a funny thing
They were happy you were clean

And you wont be looking back
To the one that helped you pack
