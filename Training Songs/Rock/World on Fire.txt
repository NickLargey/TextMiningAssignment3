Wait, waiting for a sign
Crying to the sky
For love to come around
So hope won't let me down

Shadows carry on
The light is all but gone
Your promise calls to me
A love so rescuing

There is a hope beyond this night
There is a Savior in the sky
Giving His life to set this world on fire

Here before the flames begin
May passion burn within
Our anthem as we wait
For love to save the day

There is a hope beyond this night
There is a Savior in the sky
Giving His life to set this world on fire

So as the darkness closes in
Know that the sun will shine again
Bringing salvation to a world on fire

As our King, You will bring Your truth
To guide and keep us
All of hell could not prevail against Your love

May Your light
(Waiting for a sign)
Take my life
(Crying to the sky)

Set my heart
(For love to come around)
On fire
(So hope won't let me down)

There is a hope beyond this night
There is a Savior in the sky
Giving His life to set this world on fire

So as the darkness closes in
Know that the sun will shine again
Bringing salvation to a world on fire

World on fire, world on fire
World on fire, world on fire
