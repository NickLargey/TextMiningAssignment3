By the way he looks across his shoulder
And the way he sees things through his eyes
It's impossible to disguise
He's a mama's boy

So confusing to my sense of humour
Is the way he hurts so easily
Anyone can see he's a mama's boy

Firstly he holds me too softly
Then he touches me barely
Mama's boy
Then he loves me too quickly
Always everything but manly
Mama's boyMama's boy

It's a funny kind of situation
Can't relate to what is happpening
I'm tired of making time with a mama's boy
It's an insult to my sense of living
When it seems I'm doin' all the giving
I can't waste one more night
He's a mama's boy

Well she tied him to her apron strings
Now he needs her advice on everything
Oh anyone can see he's a mama's boy
Don't know why he gets involved with women
He's a closet case with all the trimmings
He's such a pretty thing
He's a mama's boy
