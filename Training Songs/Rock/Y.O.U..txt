You said, it wouldn't bother you but I know better than that
You told me that your love was true but your love was not a matter of fact
And honey when you get home, I won't be here tonight
You hurt me I know that's why I'm lettin' you go

But I been thinkin' of you babe, I been thinkin' of Y.O.U
'Cause I been thinkin' of you lady, thinkin' of only you
Well, I been thinkin' of you now, baby, thinkin' of Y.O.U

Oh girl, I can't believe that you did the nasty things that you did
And the way that you played with me well you must think that I'm just a kid
Oh, but I'm not your boy and I won't be nobody's toy
You hurt me I know that's why I'm lettin' you go

But I been thinkin' of you babe, I been thinkin' of Y.O.U
Yes, I been thinkin' of you lady, thinkin' of only you
Well, I been thinkin' of you now baby, thinkin' of Y.O.U

You hurt me I know that's why I'm lettin you go

But I been thinkin' of you babe, I been thinkin' of Y.O.U
Well, I been thinkin' of you baby, I been thinkin' of Y.O.U
Well, I been thinkin' of you now baby, you now baby, you now baby, Y.O.U
