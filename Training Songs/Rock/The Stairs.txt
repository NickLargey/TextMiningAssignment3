Who sleeps in beds when you've got the sunrise
Wasting time watching infomercials live on channel 9
Us and Billy Mays, nowhere else to rile
Stealing blankets, sleeping in a pile

They made the sunrise for people like us
So we have an excuse as to why we're still up
Just so we can feel a little bit better
About the neighbor's angry letter on our door step
On our door fucking step

Went to the house of some friends that I just met
Didn't feel okay so I bought some cigarettes
Tonight everyone's with everyone else getting it on
I'm alone asleep with my clothes on
Maybe still awake

They made the sunrise for people like us
So we have an excuse as to why we're still up
Just so we can feel a little bit better
About the neighbor's angry letter on our door step
On our door fucking step

Woke up with raccoon eyes and crackled face paint
From a night of campfires and MDMA
The sun comes over the hill in Joshua tree
Let's grab a bottle of wine, some of Jamesy's weed
If it's okay

They made the sunrise for people like us
So we have an excuse as to why we're still up
Just so we can feel a little bit better
About the neighbor's angry letter on our door step

They made the sunrise for people like us
So we have an excuse to watch it come up
It comes up
