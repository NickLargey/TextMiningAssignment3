I saw you rushin' down the street
People were pushin' in the heat
Well, I was stuck behind the wheel
I guess y'all know how it feels
Well, I was tryin' to keep your pace
You kicked me flat out on my face
You sent me cravin' on the moon
Up to the air like a balloon
How come you're lookin' so good?
How come you're lookin' so fine?
I wasn't ready for you
Well, I was just passin' time
Do you do you do you do you
Do you wanna be my baby?
Do you do you do you do you
Do you wanna be my baby?
I really gotta know, oh oh
I really gotta know, oh oh
It's really tricky to explain
It's really crazy to stay sane
Some things they happen really fast
Some things are born and bred to last
How come you're lookin' so cool?
How come you're lookin' so fine?
No one is ready for you
I'm only passin' my time
Do you do you do you do you
Do you wanna be my baby?
Do you do you do you do you
Do you wanna be my baby? (wanna be my girl)
I really gotta know, oh oh
I really gotta know, oh oh
I really have to know, oh oh
Really wanna know, oh oh
