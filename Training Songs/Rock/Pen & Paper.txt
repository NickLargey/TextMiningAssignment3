This whole routine is getting old
So am I
And so are you
My reputation lets me know
I can do whatever I want to
Though it seems that you believe
You can do whatever it is you please,
Not before, not before you wind up on your knees

[Chorus]
Don't cry to me no more
You like the way the people stare at you
And now you look so fake
Just thought that you should know
Your all the same
And when the curtain drops down
You'll be replaced by something typical

You set yourself up to be sold
And that's OK cause that's your role
Manipulation takes its toll
Will you do, no body wants you
Though it seems that you believe
You can do whatever it is you please,
Not before, not before you wind up on your knees

[Chorus]

I know I stood so long beside you
And I know I should have left you right where I had found you
I know I stood so long beside you
And I know I should have left you right where I had found you

[Chorus: x2]
