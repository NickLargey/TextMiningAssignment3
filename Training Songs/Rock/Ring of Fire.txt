Love is a burning flame.
It makes a fire of rain.
Bound by wild desire, I fell into a ring of fire.
Taste my love is sweet, when hearts like ours meet.
I fell for you like a child.
Oh, the fire went wild.
I fell into a burning ring of fire.
I went down down down, the flame it swept higher.
It burns burns burns, that ring of fire, that ring of fire.
