I'm having dreams about you
I wanna scream about you
I'm having dreams about you
I wanna scream about you

everything you have done
You were the girl
Who seemed to own the world
Everything was about you

I took a chance to call you my own
I didn't know a thing about you

thought you could love
What a fool I was

what's going on 
I was just singing my song
There's something mad about you

I took it wrong
You like my song
Why couldnt I have you
Crazy dream you done me wrong
You left me long
I couldnt stand to chance without you

you said the love was dead
And in my head
I just couldnt believe it

and on the phone you said
You never knew me at all

thought there was love
What a fool I was

and everything was in hyper-jinx
Just like an old time movie

you don't understand
Can't comprehend

I guess it doesn't really matter

and every dream a nightmare
And nothing really matters

I thought I was Loved
What a fool I was

having dreams about you
Having dreams about you
Having dreams about you
Having dreams about you
