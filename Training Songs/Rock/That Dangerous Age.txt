(Shoop... Shoop)
And when he wakes up in the morning
It takes him time to adjust
So sick and tired of the money
(Shoop, he's at that dangerous age)
And all the life that is lost
(Shoop, he's at that dangerous age)

If you could only get it back
How high the whirl
Could start to stack
And every chance you gets to fly he goes far
In his car

He likes 2 sugars in his coffee
(Shoop, he's at that dangerous age)
He wants a chick in the office
(Shoop, he's at that dangerous age)
He's touching straight up bay
(Shoop, he's at that dangerous age)
He's on a much higher rage
(Shoop, he's at that dangerous age)

And he will seconds of a frame
He starts to see
And takes the blame
And any chance he gets to run he goes far
In his car, very far

She wears her skirt so much higher

She has the heir for high flyer
(Shoop, she's at that dangerous age)
She gets down on the student range
(Shoop, she's at that dangerous age)
And all her friends think she's trying
(Shoop, she's at that dangerous age)
She's at that dangerous age
(Shoop, they're at that dangerous age)
She's at that dangerous age
(Shoop, they're at that dangerous age)

(Shoop, she's at that dangerous age)
(Shoop, she's at that dangerous age)

And when he wakes up in the morning
It takes him time to adjust
He's so sick of the money
And all the life that is lost
