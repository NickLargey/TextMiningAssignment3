Silver wings
Shinning in the sunlight
Roaring engines
Headed somewhere in flight
Their taking you away
And leaving me lonely
Silver wings
Slowly fading out of sight
Don't leave me I cry
Don't take that airplane ride
But you locked me out of your mind
Left me standing here behind

Silver wings
Shining in the sunlight

Roaring engines
Headed somewhere in flight
Their taking you away
Leaving me lonely
Silver wings
Slowly fading out of sight
Silver wings
Shining in the sunlight
Roaring engines
Headed somewhere in flight
Their taking you away
Leaving me lonely
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight
Slowly fading out of sight
