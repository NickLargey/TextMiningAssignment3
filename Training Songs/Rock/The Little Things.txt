The little things you do to me
Are taking me over; I wanna show you
Everything inside of me
Like a nervous heart that is crazy beating
My feet are stuck here against the pavement
I wanna break free; I wanna make it
Closer to your eyes, get your attention
Before you pass me by

Back up, back up; take another chance
Don't you mess up, mess up; I don't wanna lose you
Wake up, wake up; this ain't just a thing that you
Give up, give up; don't you say that I'd be better off
Better off sitting by myself and wondering
If I'm better off, better off without you, boy

And every time you notice me
By holding me closely and saying sweet things
I don't believe that it could be
You speaking your mind and saying the real thing
My feet have broke free and I'm leaving
I'm not gonna stand here feeling lonely, but
I don't regret it and I don't think it
Was just a waste of time

Back up, back up; take another chance
Don't you mess up, mess up; I don't wanna lose you
Wake up, wake up; this ain't just a thing that you
Give up, give up; don't you say that I'd be better off
Better off sitting by myself and wondering
If I'm better off, better off without you, boy

Don't just leave me hanging on
Don't just leave me hanging on

The little things you do to me
Are taking me over; I wanna show you
Everything inside of me
Like a nervous heart that is crazy beating
My feet are stuck here against the pavement
I wanna break free; I wanna make it
Closer to your eyes, get your attention
Before you pass me by

Don't just leave me hanging on

Back up, back up; take another chance
Don't you mess up, mess up; I don't wanna lose you
Wake up, wake up; this ain't just a thing that you
Give up, give up; don't you say that I'd be better off
Better off sitting by myself and wondering
If I'm better off, better off without you, boy

Don't just leave me hanging on
Don't just leave me hanging on
