New Favorite
They all say it
I'll say it too
You've got a new favorite

You're old standby
Your right hand guy
Is nothing new
You've got a new favorite

Why do you lie about love?
I saw the light go out

And should I go
You won't say so
I know its true
I know you've got a new favorite
I know you've got a new favorite

You've got a new favorite
