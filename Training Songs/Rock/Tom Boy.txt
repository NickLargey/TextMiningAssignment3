From where I stand, i can see 
They've got the upper hand of me 
Reminds me of this world at last 
Simply changes much too fast for me 

And when they call out, will I hear them 
And when they fall out, will I see them 
This yellow light, on the crowd 
And colours way to loud to see 
Reveal their drive, we could change it 
Try to rearrange it 

They call me a tom boy and I let them 
Cause only a tom boy could forget them 
And simply change it 
They call me a tom boy and I love it 
Cause only a tom boy could stand above it 
By simply changing
