You believe in what nobody else does
In your mind there's no time and a constant buzz
So disregard the master plan
It's a disaster man you better ride it out

I can see it all in your eyes
Your future fades, your minutes are few
When the angels make contact with you

You believe in what nobody else does
And things ain't the way they was
A fool like you is a freak to me
It's unique to me, what you seek to see

I can see it all in your eyes
Your future fades, your minutes are few
When the angels make contact with you

I've seen the future isn't pretty
Killer instinct, love a surprise
Make a stop, build a fire
Hold you breathe, cover your eyes
The tides are turning crimson
Nightfall growing like a cancer
Feeding on your broken body
Isolations not the answer
Listen what the wind says softly
Sound of traffic, smells like paper
Kisses on your worried eyelids
Sleepless nights turn into vapor
Like a dream and as the crow flies
Must reject the pain your trapped in
Give me all your hard earned beauty
Now I'll tell you what will happen

Your day will fade and your thoughts will jade
And you'll wake up in the middle of a dream
Coming up on hard luck, with a moment of silence
And no time to kill, no reason to care
Beware

I can see it all in your eyes
Your future for a dime, anytime
I can see is all in your eyes
Your future for a dime, anytime
I can see it all in your eyes
Your future for a dime, anytime
Your future fades, your minutes are few
When the angels make contact
