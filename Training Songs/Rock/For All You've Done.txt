My Savior, Redeemer
Lifted me from the miry clay
Almighty forever
I will never be the same 'cause You came near
From the everlasting
To the world we live
The Father's only Son

You lived and You died
You rose again on high
You opened the way
For the world to live again
Hallelujah
For all You've done
