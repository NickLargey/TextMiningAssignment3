Times like these when the temperatures freeze
And the little girls they want you
Times when it's hard to find
A parking spot on this avenue

So you shoot in the dark
And you're blessed with a spark
Right in front of you

So you continue the journey
You investigate all possible possibilities

Soon I'm gonna leave my rags 'n' run
I'm gonna leave my rags 'n' run
And the big times they're talking about
Well now I know
They have not yet begun
Have not even yet begun
Yet begun

Times like these when the temperatures freeze
And the little girls they want you
Times when it's hard to find
Anything or anyone close to you

There is no room service
No sign of food in the kitchen
And the luggage is gone

We need more strong mommas in this town
Too much monkeys putting each other down

Soon I'm gonna leave my rags 'n' run
I'm gonna leave my rags 'n' run
And the big times they're talking about
Well now I know
They have not even yet begun
Have not even yet begun
Yet begun

Oh oh oh, ow, I'm betting on a miracle again
Oh oh oh, I'm betting on a miracle again
Oh oh oh, I'm betting on a miracle again
