Woke up this morning.
I suddenly realized 
We're all in this together.

I started smiling 
Cause you were smiling.
And we're all in this together

I'm made of atoms. 
You're made of atoms
And we're all in this together

And long division 
Just doesn't matter
Cause we're all in this together.
Yeah.

I saw you walking 
In the city.
We're all in this together.

The city's changing
Cause we are changing
And we are all in this together.

Every 12 seconds 
Someone remembers that
We're all in this together.

In the kitchen
Of your rent control apartment,
We're all in this together.

Come on, baby.
I don't mean to rush you.
I only wanted to reach out and touch you.
I gotta start to open my heart.

I know you think about 
Jumping ship before it sinks,
But we are all in this together.

Ask a scientist.
It's quantum physics. 
We are all in this together.

And on the subway
We feel like strangers,
But we're all in this together.

Yeah, I love you and 
You love her and she loves him
But we are all int this togehter

You know, baby, 
There's never been protection
In all the history of human connection,
Come on, darling,
It's all right to show me.
You don't ever need to be lonely
Once you start to open your heart.

I saw you crying.
I started crying.
Cause we're all in this together,
And then religion
It's a big decision,
But we're all in this together.

We are all in this together.
We are all in this together.
We are all in this together.
We are all in this together.
We are all in this together.
We are all in this together.
We are all in this together.
We are all in this together.
