Everything is alright and awful
Get yourself another
We'll stay up all night
And toast to friends we never had
Stranger angels have swung around this table
But they disappear
So how did we end up here?

I might be another night
Keep the couch pulled out leave a key inside the mailbox
I might be a parasite
If you feel sucked dry then I grabbed too tight
If you feel sucked dry then I grabbed too tight
If I ever let go
You'd stroke my disease

take some time to think it over, slower
You're only getting older
Take all day
Let your rationale rash away
Meanwhile, ill stay, imprisoned by your mistakes
Persistence - its the anchor that will drown me

I might be another night
Keep the couch pulled out leave a key inside the mailbox
I might be a parasite
Sucker and dry with a kiss goodnight
Sucker and dry with a kiss goodnight
If I ever let go
They'll suffocate me

they will suffocate me
