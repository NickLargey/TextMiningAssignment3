Only you can help yourself
So try not to mislead her
You've done many foolish things
But deep inside you need her

Ooooh!

You've got to believe me, just open your mind
My tangled emotions I need to unwind
'Cause baby, though you know I'll never leave you
Never wanted to deceive you, although I do
But I don't want our lovin' to die
And I'm so tired of livin' a lie
Though I know I've been weak I can try
Yeah, I'll try

You've got to believe me, I mean what I say
I try not to wander when you go away
But, baby, though I never make advances
Seems there are no end of chances to go astray
But I don't want our lovin' to die
And I'm so tired of livin' a lie
Though I know I've been weak I can try
Yeah, I'll try

Yeah, I'll try (I'll try)

No, I don't want our lovin' to die (Why, oh, why)
And I'm so tired of livin' a lie (No, no)
Though I know I've been weak I can try
Yeah, I'll try
