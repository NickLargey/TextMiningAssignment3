Darkness, darkness, hungry to the bone
Darkness, darkness, take my body home
God I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
She like a pooka
She holy roller, love me like a song
She like a lightning
She roller coaster, 'till the break of dawn
She like a shadow
She all around me, nasty hearted dream
She got the sexy
She do it to me, wake me when I dream
God I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Now I lay me down to sleep, goodnight
Pray the Lord my soul will keep tonight
If I die before I wake, in your arms my love can't break away
Darkness (she like a shadow)
Darkness (she all around me)
Nasty hearted dream
Darkness (she got the sexy)
Darkness (she do it to me)
Wake me when I scream
God I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
