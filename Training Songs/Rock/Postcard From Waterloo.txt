Well there was something in that look of yours
Something like a play on words.
I see your horse, he's reared up his head
Could it be something he's read?
Now, we must say adieu
I'll send a postcard from Waterloo
You always said that I'd really like the view.

Oh, those great plains so quiet and still
Tell me who belongs and I'll tell you who will.
We stood apart from everything
where no wind blows, no birds sing.
So now we must say adieu
I'll send a postcard from Waterloo
You always said that I'd really like the view.

And now you ask me do I need a shield
What I need is an open field.
l recall the actor's advice
That nothing happens until it happens twice,
So now we must say adieu
I'll send a postcard from Waterloo
You always said that I'd really like the view.
