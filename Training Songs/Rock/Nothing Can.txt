Can't sit with you, talk for a while
You know you make me feel life
You know you make me wanna try harder

Can't tell you â€˜bout the kick inside
How the stupid mess brings out your eyes
And all those cities inside

And how, nothing can make me cry
A landslide's brought me to a straight road empty
And now nothing can make me cry
The city lights behind me, I know you're with me in here

Well I go to the country to find myself
Crawl back to the city to lose myself again
Under lights this joke is wearing thin
Well it's easy to be a winner when you don't know what you've lost
It's easy to be a believer
In you

When nothing can make me cry
A landslide's brought me to a straight road empty
And nothing can make me cry
The city lights behind me, I know you're with me in here

Now nothing can make me cry
A landslide's brought me to a straight road empty
And nothing can make me cry
The city lights behind me, I know you're with me in here

Brought me
Here
Brought me
Here
Brought me
Here
