You say you know her
Well I know her too
You say you kno-ow-ow-ow-ow her
But you don’t know her like I do
You say you love her
Once upon a time I loved her too
You say you lo-o-o-o-ove her
But you don’t love her like I do
You’ve got to give me that girl
Or I, will take her from you

Woo Woo, Love me like you say you do
Woo Woo, Love me like you say you do
Woo Woo, Love me like you say you do

You you’re over
I say over who
It’s gonna be over my dead body
The day she finds someone new
You’ve got to give me that girl
Or I will take her from you

Woo Woo, Love me like you say you do
Woo Woo, Love me like you say you do
Woo Woo, Love me like you say you do
Woo Woo, Love me like you say you do

You know that I want you
And if I can’t have you
Then no one can
But I need you
And when I find you

You’ve got to give me that girl
Or I

Woo Woo, Love me like you say you do
Woo Woo, Love me like you say you do
