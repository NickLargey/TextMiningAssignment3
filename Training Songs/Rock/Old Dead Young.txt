You can live on the past
With a beach and a mouth that fills you up
This is what I know
They can see all the signs and the needs
And the guards that wanna come and f*ck you up
God is what they show

I'm ready to die so I feel you out
No no no no no, I'm filled with doubt
Don't want to be a shadow of the sun
I'm old, I'm dead, I'm young

You continue the size of the fee's
And the worlds that wanna come and f*ck you up
I don't wanna go
Every night they repeat with a line that says
You should come out and give me up
God, I think I know

I could be inside you every night
Smashed to pieces, man I should really cry
Where do we go to find those simple times
I'm old, I'm dead, I'm fine

Oh, in the kindest hours
I feel my heart
Oh, in the kindest hours
I feel my heart

You can live on a past
With a beach and a mouth that will fill you up
This is what I know
All the timed out leeches coming down
And trying to slowly f*ck you up
Baby let's just go

Like I'm ready to die so I'll take you out
No no no no no, I'm filled with doubt
Don't want to be a shadow of the sun
I'm old, I'm dead, I'm young
