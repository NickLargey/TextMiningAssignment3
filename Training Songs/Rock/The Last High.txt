I am alone
But adored by 100,000 more
Then I said when you were the last.
And I have known love, like a whore
From at least 10,000 more
Then I swore when you were the last

When you were the last high
High
High
High

You were awake,
And I should have stayed, but wandered.
I was only out for a day.
Out for a day.
It was Chicago for a moment,
And then it was Paris and London for a few
Days.

Well, I am alone
But adored by 100,000 more
Then I swore when you were the last.

When you were the last high
High
High
High

Well I was the first to have spoken
And I said just about all of the things you shouldn't say.
So maybe you loved me, but now maybe you don't.
And maybe you'll call me.
Maybe you won't.

So, I am alone
But adored by 100,000 more
Then I said when you were the last.
And I have known love, like a whore
From at least 10,000 more
Then I swore when you were the last.

When you were the last high
High
High
High

When you were the last high
High
High
High
