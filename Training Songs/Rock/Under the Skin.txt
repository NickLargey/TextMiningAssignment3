I hear your heart 
As you pass through
I know the pain that you feel 
I'll shepherd you

Under the skin
Everything shows
Under the skin

Anything goes 
For the asking
Under the skin

I know it's hard
Been so hard to find
Your passion swallows you whole
Deaf dumb and blind

Under the skin
Everything grows
Under the skin

Anything goes 
For the asking
Under the skin

When the shout is thrown
From the side of the wall
And you feel so small
Where do you belong

When you're so far out
And you're filled with doubt
And the silhouettes shout
Where do you belong

Lay your head down 
No one will see
Cry me a river of new dreams
Float just so free

Under the skin
Everything shows
Under the skin

Anything goes 
For the asking
Under the skin

Under the skin
Everything grows
Under the skin

Anything goes 
Long live the Queen
Under the skin
