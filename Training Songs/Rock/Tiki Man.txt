Gone down to Haiti on vacation
In the jungle, I found me a tiki man
Well, you can understand my elation
When the natives, well, they all shook my hand
The head of the village said, "Destroy it,"
But I'm a fool, I kept it anyway
Now, to this day, I regret it
When I found you, you little tiki man

Tiki man
Got nothing to do with you
Tiki man
Our partnership is through
Tiki man
I'll tell you right now
You're never gonna leave it alone

Soon, I discovered my special powers
Me and my old friend, the tiki man
I could float around my room for many hours
And make some certain people disappear
But there was something terribly disturbing
My eyes turned ruby red, like a tiki man
Now, I tell you, I'm cursed forever
Thanks to my friend, the tiki man

Tiki man
Got nothing to do with you
Tiki man
Our partnership is through
Tiki man
I'll tell you right now
You're never gonna leave it alone

Tiki man

Tiki man

You're never gonna leave it alone
