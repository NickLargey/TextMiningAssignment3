I think of her in the sunken blue
I think of her

Living in a plastercine of colored dream
Fire me up with acetylene
She's the rust in my gun
Fire me up I'm done

Peace love hang ten California
Dreaming of the perfect wave
Yeah yeah yeah

Floating down stream of unconscious
Waiting for a girl on a train

The train of thought falling off the track
Radios and Cadillacs
Satellite in the sky
Kiss me first before I die

Peace love hang ten California
Dreaming of the perfect wave
Yeah yeah yeah

Son now take care don't they warn ya
Man there's going to come a rain
Yeah yeah

Mm mm California
Waiting for a girl on a train

I think of her in the sunken blue
In the month of may
I wait for her as the storm comes screaming through my veins

Peace love hang ten California
Dreaming of the perfect wave
Yeah yeah yeah

Floating down the stream of unconscious
Waiting for a girl on a train
Yeah yeah

Peace love hang ten California
Dream long of the perfect wave
Yeah yeah yeah

Son now take care don't the warn ya
Man there's going to come a rain
Yeah yeah

California
Wearing yourself thin California
Wearing yourself thin California

Waiting for a girl on a train
