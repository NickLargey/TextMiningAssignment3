Don't be afraid to stand in the shadow of love
The hour is late and you know that time waits for no-one

See the glow of the soul in her face
Then you know that you're caught in the shadow of love

A brief embrace and fear and restraint have all gone
Innocence burns yes a fire that burned all along

See the doors about to swing both ways
See the answer mirrored in her gaze
Then you know that you're caught in the shadow of love

Every night, every day
I experience the most exquisite pain
A thousand whispers seem to say
I light a candle to you and I pray
I kneel to pray

Now don't be afraid to get caught in the shadow of love
Play the game take a chance or you haven't the power of love

See the glow of a soul in her face
See the glow of her saving veil of grace
Then you know that you're caught in the shadow of love
You're caught in the shadow of love
