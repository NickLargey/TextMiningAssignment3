Embryo, grew up missing out on most stuff
But weeds know, just where and when to crop up
Ursula, what's inside your jar of mayo?
Expire, cover it all up with tinfoil

It seems so
Corrode, me so slow
Turmoil in tinfoil
So we don't spoil
Corrode
Corrode
Me so slow
It boils, won't spoil
In tinfoil

Purple
Everything shines like chrome this sumer
Enthrone
She wrote "beautiful ain't so divine"
Ursula, what's inside your jar?
Want to know
She said "Bold, I will win all yours and drop it in!"

It seems so
Corrode, me so slow
Turmoil in tinfoil
So we don't spoil
Corrode
Corrode
Me so slow
Won't spoil
Don't boil
In tinfoil
In tinfoil
