I guess I'm finally giving up
I have to let you go
Guess you made it perfectly clear
It's hard for me to know

Guess it was a false alarm

You came along and made me smile
And wrote between the lines
You opened up my heart and soul
And made me feel alive

Guess it was a false alarm

If I could wave a magic wand
And make my dreams come true
I'd make my feelings go away
And make you want me too

Difficult to tell the truth
Actions contradict
Hanging on to every word
There's something that I missed

Guess it was a false alarm
