(Chorus:)
Standing in the midnight rain, all alone with the pieces of my heart again
Knowing one of us is right, and one of us is gone into another night
You've gone running all alone, running all alone

Into another night, you've gone running all alone
I've still got these feelings left, living in my heart and in my head
Breaking from the past, I've come to know at last
Only a fool would stay, stay and pretend, until the very end
Only a fool would stay, to the very end

I need you more than anyone or anything under the sun
Don't leave me lonely here, I get so lonely here

(chorus)
(Solo)
I need you more than anyone or anything under the sun
Don't leave me lonely here, I get so lonely here

(chorus)
Into another night, you've gone running all alone
Standing in the midnight rain (repeats out)
