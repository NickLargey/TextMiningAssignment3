I don't wanna watch the street on TV
I don't wanna hear about your day
I've got no time to hear, about how much you care
Shut your mouth and come this way

I'm the widow in you bedroom
And I can see you in the dark

Tonight's the night I shed my wicked soul
Take it out on you and watch you loose control
Tonight's the night I shed my
Tonight's the night I shed my
Tonight's the night I shed my wicked soul
My wicked soul

Let's disconnect all communication
I've told your mother not to call
So lay down on the bed
Coz now I've locked the door
And you don't live out there no more

I'm the widow in you bedroom
And I can see you in the dark

Tonight's the night I shed my wicked soul
Take it out on you and watch you loose control
Tonight's the night I shed my
Tonight's the night I shed my
Tonight's the night I shed my wicked soul
My wicked soul
My wicked soul

Tonight's the night I shed my wicked soul
Take it out on you and watch you loose control
Tonight's the night I shed my
Tonight's the night I shed my
Tonight's the night I shed my wicked soul
My wicked soul
My wicked soul.
