Mona Lisa, stay a while
I'm a match you, make you smile
Hard to please 'em, only child
I could meet her, life's a trial
Okay okay

Constantine, play a while
Make me happy, life's a trial
Entertainer, past denial
Portrait painter, can you make my eyes less red

Created by mistake, there's no free will or fate
Do not do what I have done do what I say

Were you just born an asshole, rage in exile
What you have lost you can't replace
Were you just born an asshole, rage in exile
You are that dish you can not ta-a-a-a-aste

Every actor, imitates
Every boxer, needs a break
I was born to, entertain
Motivated, physi I can't face away

Got a message in pathway, beyond myself that day
Don't do what I have done do what I say

Were you just born an asshole, rage in exile
What you have lost you can't replace
Were you just born an asshole, rage in exile
You are that dish you can not ta-a-a-aste

I think I finally cracked your cord
I've hacked, your system from withing
You get what you put in
Some say these things I've, caught in the best for God 
I hope this message finds, you floating at the top
Depends which way is born an asshole, rage in exile
What you have lost you can't replace
Were you just born an asshole, rage in exile
You are that dish you can not ta-a-a-a-aste
