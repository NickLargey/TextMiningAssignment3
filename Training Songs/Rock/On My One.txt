I'm just a poor boy from Nottingham
I had my dreams
But in this world they're gone, they're gone
Oh, I'm so lonesome on my one

Three years on the road, 400 shows
Where do I call home?
No place to go
Where do I belong?
Oh, I'm so lonesome on my one

Every town a stranger when I'm around
No sins forgiven, hell spit me out
Where's God, where's God?
He's even left me on my one
Where's God, where's God?
He's even left me on my one

I'm just a poor boy from Nottingham
I had my dreams
But in this world they're gone, they're gone
I'm oh so lonesome on my one
Oh, I'm so lonesome on my one
