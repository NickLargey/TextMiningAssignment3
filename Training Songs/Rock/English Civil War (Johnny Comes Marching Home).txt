When Johnny comes marching home again
He's coming by bus or underground
A woman's eye will shed a tear to see his face so beaten in fear
It's just around the corner in the English civil war
It was still at the stage of clubs and fists
When that well-known face got beaten to bits
Your face was blue in the light of the screen as we watched the speech of an animal scream
The new party army was marching right over our heads
Alright

There you are, ha, ha, I told you so
Says everybody that we know
But who hid a radio under the stairs and who got caught out on their unawares?
When that new party army came marching right up the stairs
When Johnny comes marching home again
Nobody understands it can happen again
The sun is shining and the kids are shouting loud but you gotta know it's shining through a crack in the cloud
The shadows keep falling when Johnny comes marching home
Alright Johnny, okay Johnny, okay John go home, home, home, home
Guess who's catching a plain when Johnny comes running home
