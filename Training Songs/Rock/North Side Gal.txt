I pulled a match game all around the north side 
Chasing the sweet thing so satisfied 
Every time I try 
Crazy about a north side gal 

I got some good talk 
But not enough game 
Wooing the sweet thing 
Oh ain't it a shame 

Every time I try 
Crazy about a north side gal 
Well she gets colder 
Every time I try to hold her 
There's a little saying "no" to 
All the younger gentlemen 

All of 'em try 
They're crazy 'bout a north side gal 

I got some money 
And some wheels to drive 
Old beat up guitars 
And old ZZ Top 

Every song I sing 
It screams about a north side gal 

Well she gets colder 
Every time I try to hold her 
There's a little saying "no" to 
All the younger gentlemen 
All of 'em try 
They're crazy 'bout a north side gal 

Well I said they're crazy 'bout a north side gal 
Crazy 'bout a north side gal
