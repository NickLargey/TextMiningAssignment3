Yeah!

Do you really care?
It's not like it matters anyway
What's going to happen here?
We'll laugh about it all one day

Hey! Hey! What do you say?
It doesn't really matter 'cause it's all the same
Hey! Hey! What do you say?
They're just gonna blame us anyway

Hey! Hey! What do you say?
It doesn't really matter 'cause it's all the same
Hey! Hey! What do you say?
They're just gonna blame us anyway

Oh! Oh! Oh! Yeah!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

When everything goes down
It's all going to seem like a waste of time
Nothing is so special
'Cause they're just chemicals in our minds

(Hey! Hey! What do you say?)

Hey! Hey! What do you say?
It doesn't really matter 'cause it's all the same
Hey! Hey! What do you say?
They're just gonna blame us anyway

Hey! Hey! What do you say?
It doesn't really matter 'cause it's all the same
Hey! Hey! What do you say?
They're just gonna blame us anyway

Oh! Yeah! Oh! Oh! What do you say!
Oh! Yeah! Oh! Oh! What do you say!

Tonight these favorite memories
We get together while it last sleep with fire
You've got to mean it
You've got to see it
How can we never leave when we look straight in their eyes

Hey! Hey! What do you say?
Hey! Hey! What do you say?
Hey! Hey! What do you say? Yeah!

Hey! Hey! What do you say?
It doesn't really matter 'cause it's all the same
Hey! Hey! What do you say?
They're just gonna blame us anyway

Hey! Hey! What do you say?
It doesn't really matter 'cause it's all the same
Hey! Hey! What do you say?
They're just gonna blame us anyway
