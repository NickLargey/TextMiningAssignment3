Don't want to live in a prison cell 
Don't want to live in a smoking room
Independence just won't come to you 
In the brief of a diplomat

Say your prayers for the future 
Say your prayers for the past 
It might be round the corner
It might be all we have
Say your prayers 

Don't want to live with a compromise 
Don't want to live with hypocrisy 
Bureaucracy doesn't have to win 
Breaks the cage of the beast within

Say your prayers in the boardroom 
Say your prayers on the stairs
It might be catastrophic 
It might be too damn bad 
Say your prayers 

I got the cure for compassion fatigue 
Spend a week with the Timorese
Running scared from the military 
You can share you can share your disease

Now we don't live with an absent master 
We don't live on an island divided
Don't want my kids to grow up in shame 
In a country with a different name 
Had to throw them out, had to break the chains

I got the cure for compassion fatigue 
Spend a week with the Timorese 
Running scared from the military 
I come to you with a plaintive plea
