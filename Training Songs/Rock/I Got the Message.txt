[Chorus]
I got the message and the message is clear
I really really really really wish you were here
It was written on the back of a carton d'allumettes
It says I don't really miss you but I haven't tried yet
I got the message and the message is proof
There really is a thing they call the rhythm of youth
It will pick you up and it will make you wiggle this way
Et see'est facile a dire and it's easy to say

Well it's mine (They got this thing they call the rhythm of life)
Not Yours (It says to settle down and get a dog and a wife)
Get down (And everybody's doing it all over the land)
On all fours (Et oui je ne comprends pas oh yes I don't understand)
It's long (I got the message and the message is clear)
And hard (I really really really really wish you were here)
This road (It was written on the back of a carton d'allumettes)
To mars (I don't really miss you but I haven't tried yet)

Got a good thing, yeah, got you going
Everybody's moving, watch out it's showing
I have done a good thing I've got you dancing, everybody's happy
I have done a good thing, I've got you moving, everybody's dancing
They're really grooving
I have done a good thing don't dansez moderne
Everybody's happy

[Chorus]

See'est mon (They got this thing they call the rhythm of life)
See'est toi (It says to settle down and get a dog and a wife)
See'est nous (And everybody's doing it all over the land)
See'est cool (Et oui je ne comprends pas oh yes I don't understand)
See'est long (i got the message and the message is clear)
See'est dur (i really really really really wish you were here)
Frappons (it was written on the back of a carton d'allumettes)
Nos tetes contre les murs

Me, you, us cool, long, hard, hit our heads against the wall

(I don't really miss you but I haven't tried yet)

I got a good thing yeah, got you going
Everybody's moving, it's really showing
I have done a good thing I've got you dancing, everybody's happy
I have done a good thing, I've got you moving, everybody's dancing,
It's really groovy
I have done a good thing, don't dansez moderne
And Everybody's happy

[Chorus]

It's mine (they got this thing they call the rhythm of life)
Not Yours (it says to settle down and get a dog and a wife)
Get down (and everybody's doing it all over the land)
On all fours (et oui je ne comprends pas oh yes I don't understand)
It's long (i got the message and the message is clear)
And hard (i really really really really wish you were here)
This road (it was written on the back of a carton d'allumettes)
Road to mars (I don't really miss you but I haven't tried yet)
