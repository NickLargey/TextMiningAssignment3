Trust me to open my mouth, now everybody knows
Trust me, now I've let you down, I'm a big mouth I suppose

This was our secret, our meetings were so discreet
I promised to keep it from the ears out on the street
This was our secret, we were having an affair
I couldn't keep it, now the secret's everywhere

Trust me to open my mouth, now everybody knows
Trust me, now I've let you down, I'm a big mouth I suppose

One cup runneth over, loosening a jaw
Trust me to open my mouth, it's not a secret anymore
We had a secret, what a terrible thing to do
I couldn't have seen it, I was so in love so in love with you

Trust me to open my mouth, now everybody knows
Trust me, now I've let you down, I'm a big mouth I suppose

I need a gobstopper to keep my trap shut
Should have kept my nose clean
Why's it me that gets the bad luck?

Trust me to open my mouth, now everybody knows
Trust me, now I've let you down, I'm a big mouth I suppose

Trust me, to open my mouth (got a big mouth)
Trust me, to open my mouth (keep it shut)
Trust me, to open my mouth
Trust me, to open my mouth
Trust me, to open my mouth
