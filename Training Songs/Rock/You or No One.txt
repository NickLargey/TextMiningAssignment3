This lonely heart’s been yearning
The skies above’ve been turning
Feels like the universe just grew,
Aah – Aah.

I’ve waited for so long
Aaahh, I’ve waited for so long.

I just wanna be with you a-always
I wanna be around you a-always
I just wanna be with you or no one
Making it you or no one.

And when the night starts falling
Even the stars are calling
Spinning and spilling out your name
Aaah, now that’s what I call faith
Aaah, spilling out your name
Forever and ever.

Love is a hurting thing
It doesn’t go away
Forever is a long time
To wait for you to say

I just wanna be with you a-always
I wanna be around you a-always
I just wanna be with you or no one
Making it you or no one.

Please stay. Never go away.
Please stay. Never go, never go away.

I just wanna be with you
I wanna be around you
I just wanna be with you or no one

You always
I wanna be around you always
Just wanna be with you or no one
Baby, you or no one.

You or no one.
Every day you or no one.
You or no one.
You or no one.
