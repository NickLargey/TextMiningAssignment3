Here we stand hand in hand
Watching the stars shine
Watching the stars shine
I'll remember tonight

If I do understand
Tonight you are mine, mine
Tonight you are mine, mine
I'll remember tonight

How long I've waited for a night like this
Come to me, I want to kiss you now, now

You're holding me in your arms
Saying you love me
Saying you love me
I'll remember tonight

How long I've waited for a night like this
Come to me, I want to kiss you now, now

You're holding me in your arms
Saying you love me
Saying you love me
I'll remember tonight

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
