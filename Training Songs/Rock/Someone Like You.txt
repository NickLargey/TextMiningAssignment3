Your earthquake hit when I was living so peacefully
My mind was busy I had something to do
My world was planned and I was living so tranquilly
You turned me round just like a whirlpool

[Chorus]
Someone like you (makes me dizzy)
Someone like you
Someone like you (drives me crazy)
Someone like you

Your hurricane was blowing like there was no today
I was asleep alone with nothing to do
My roof was raised as I was snoring so comfortably
You shooke me up just like a twister

[Chorus]

Alone at night I lie without any air
Then you arrive and always take me somewhere
What else can you do?

[Chorus]

Alone at night I lie without any air
Then you arrive and always take me somewhere
What else can you do?
Someone like you
