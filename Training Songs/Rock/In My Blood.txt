I've got a thing for self destruction
Since I found out my dysfunctions,
Were what made us part,
You and me.
I've got thing for major crises.
Total f*ck ups are
What my life is all about
Since I made you leave.

It's in my blood, being mean...

Yea, please, yes please.
Sure I'll have it
More please, more please.
It's a habit that I've worked out
To sort things out.
Burning, burning I deserve it.
I deserve to face the fire
Pure shite and clean,
The opposite of me.

It's in my blood, being mean...

Wondering around further down
Asking why I wasn't happy
While we still had it.
It's a tragic habit that I have,
That I happen to have.

It's in my blood, being mean..
