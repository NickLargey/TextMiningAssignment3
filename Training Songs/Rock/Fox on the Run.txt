She walked through the corn leading down to the river. 
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun. 
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her 
And left me to die like the fox on the run. 

Like the fox (like the fox, like the fox) on the run. 

Everybody knows the reason for the fall 
When woman tempted man down in paradise's hall. 
This woman tempted me all right, then took me for a ride 
But like the lonely fox I need a place to hide. 

Like the fox (like the fox, like the fox) on the run. 

Come take a glass of wine and fortify your soul. 
We'll talk about the world and friends we used to know. 
I'll illustrate, a girl put me on the floor. 
The game is nearly up, the hounds are at my door. 

Like the fox (like the fox, like the fox) on the run
