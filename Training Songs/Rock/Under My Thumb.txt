Under my thumb
A girl who once had me down
Under my thumb, oh yeah
A girl who once pushed me around

It's down to me, oh, what I say
The difference in the clothes she wears
To me, here she come,
Under my thumb

Under my thumb
The squirmin' dog who's just had her day
Under my thumb, oh
A poor dog, yeah yeah, She just changed her ways

It's down to me, oh, what I say
The difference in the clothes she wears
To me, here she come,
Under my thumb

Under my thumb
A siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb
She's the sweetest, oh yeah, pet in the world

It's down to me, oh yeah
The difference when she's spoken to
To me, here she come,
Under my thumb

Under my thumb
Her eyes are just kept to herself
Under my thumb, well I
I can still fool around with somebody else

It's down to me, oh that's what I say
The difference when she's spoken to
To me, here she come, she come
Under my thumb

Take it easy baby and do you go
Take it easy baby and do you go

Under my thumb
