I was sitting with the band
A drink in each hand
There wasn't much to say

He asked me for my name
Said he was glad he came
He wished that he could stay

I said the only thing I've got more of is time
This isn't what you think, and it's not what I thought it would be
You've got a lonely face, do you want my place
Where there are all the answers 
Do you want to join the race, can you keep the pace
Or stay and take your chances

I was sleeping on my couch
I was really out
I didn't hear you leave

They asked me for some words
To clear up all their hurts
They wished that they weren't them
The world is at your feet
Try and make something happen
