This is how it started
As a teenage omen
One night at a rockin' roll dance
Was a date once a week

Good night kiss on your cheek
I'll go home so happy
But my heart givin' peace
Two years I have passed her

Anything had been changed
The neighborhood be so ugly
They don't look the same
Even the playground

Where we used to play
Just around the corner
Where we used to stay
We could have been married

And a long saddle down
But you went away dear
And you couldn't be found
I ask so many people where to find you

They all say they didn't know
So if you see my baby
Tell her I love her so
Tell her I love her so

Tell her I love her so
