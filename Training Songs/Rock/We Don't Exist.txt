We don't exist
We eat our time
We don't resist
It's not alright

What I want out of this
What I need out of this
Cayenne, Cayenne, Cayenne, Cayenne

We don't exist
Night after night

What I want out of this
What I need out of this
Cayenne, Cayenne, Cayenne, Cayenne

We don't exist
Night after night
We fall apart
It's quite alright

What I want out of this
What I need out of this
Cayenne, [Repeat: x2]
