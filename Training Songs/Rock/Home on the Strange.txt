He sleeps with a chain saw
Got eyes like an outlaw
He takes a two smoke walk
He don't like to talk

and he don't like change
And he don't like change
You may think he's deranged
But he'd rather be home,
Home, home on the strange

he's a Canadian icon
He's sleeps with his clothes on
He likes to work with his hands
He's an apolitical man

and he don't like change
And he don't like change
You may think he's deranged
But he'd rather be home,
Home.. home on the strange

one in a lifetime
One in a world
One in a life time
One in a world
One in a life time
One in a world

he sleeps with a chainsaw
He sings fa fa fa fa fa
He likes to work with his hands
He's an apolitical man

and he don't like change
And he don't like change
You may think he's deranged
But he'd rather be home,
Home, home on the strange

and he don't like change
And he don't like change
You may think he's deranged
But he'd rather be home,
Home, home on the strange
