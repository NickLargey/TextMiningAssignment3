On the seventh hour
of the seventh da
the seventh song was looking for a 
seventh day getaway
\'

The word came down
from the blinding light
You\'ve got one chance baby
ba ba be baby better do it right

Well I was driving down 
on the 101
It was late at night 
and I was thinking bout the things I done

All of my regrets
and baby all of my fears
I was slipping the car
from gear to gear to gear

Man I really got going
I started picking up speed
I hit one thirty five
and I had everything I need

Starting shaking bad 
fearing for my life
I let go of the weel 
and I blew into the night

LOTS A GUITAR

God bless the child 
and god bless his soul
God XXX the idea that he
die before he\'s old

Yeah you gotta be cool
You gotta behave
Ther are times
When I lying in my grave

You gotta watch your step
or you\'ll loose your way
take xxx of he others
and do everything they say

Now you gotta watch out

But if I fear for the devil 
and I fear for myself
Lord I am going to XXX 
for everybody else

to wonder why 
but I\'m gonna live
to the day I die

until the day I day
