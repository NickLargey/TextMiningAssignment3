Don't you walk out that door
Don't even pet the dog on the floor
Just take your things in the yard
And throw your keys anywhere

After all the things I've done for you
Year after year after burnin' year
I'm sorry for wastin' all your time
And I'm sorry for losin' all my life
And I think that I'm lost and hard to find
But I feel like I'm livin' a darkness lie

And I'm heel over head
Jet black skies is painted white again
And I'm heel over head
Leave my eyes in the clouds again

You don't see me at all
You don't see me at all
You don't see me at all
You don't see me

Don't you walk away from me
I'm givin' up everything
But I think that I'm rippin' apart at the seams
And I'm findin' it hard, hard to believe

And I feel like I'm livin' inside a dream
And no one believes and no one sees
That I'm sorry for wastin' all your time
And I'm sorry for losin' on the line

And I'm heel over head
Jet black skies is painted white again
And I'm heel over head
Leave my eyes in the clouds again

You don't see me at all
You don't see me at all
You don't see me at all

You don't see me or hear me or touch me or bring me
Or think that I'm rippin' apart at the seams
You don't see me at all
You don't see me at all
You don't feel me or touch me

I'm sorry and I'm sorry for wastin'
I'm sorry and I'm sorry for wastin'
I'm sorry and I'm sorry for wastin'
I'm sorry

And I'm sorry you don't see me
Hear me, touch me, bring me
Think that I'm rippin' apart at the seams

You don't see me, hear me, touch me, bring me
Think that I'm rippin' apart at the seams
You don't see me at all
You don't see me at all
You don't see me at all

You don't see me or hear me
You don't see me or touch me
You don't see me or hear me or touch me or bring me
Or think that I'm rippin' apart at the seams

You don't see me at all
You don't see me at all
You don't see me at all
You don't see me at all

You don't see me or hear me
You don't see me or hear me
You don't see me at all
