Six thousand miles away, the first thing on my mind
I've not been to bed, my thoughts are racing
My heart is lagging behind

Desperate times call for double measures
The drinks are going down alleviating the pressure
Just to see you for a second now, if only I could
Just to breathe the same air, then you know that I would

A needle in the heart from a silhouette
She could've been you but for the cigarette

When back, will you dig your heels in?
Dig your heels into my back?
Scratch your name upon my lips
Take the belt from off your hips

A needle in the heart from a silhouette
She could've been you but for the cigarette

A needle in the heart from a silhouette
She could've been you but for the cigarette

When will I see you again? When will I see you again?
When will I see you again? When will I see you again?

When will I see you again? When will I see you again?
When will I see you again? When will I see you again?

Scratch your name upon my lips
Scratch your name upon my lips
Scratch your name upon my lips
Scratch your name upon my lips
