I had a dream last night
A nightmare to be exact
We couldn't take the heat
And the sweat dripped from our backs
I didn't go I waited for the
Midnight sun
I didn't want to leave you
Cause I don't have anyone

Don't paint the sun anymore
Paint the moon, and the stars
In an autumn sky
Paint me cool blue waters, with
Shades of gray, just don't let me
Live my life this way
Without you

Let it go, let it go
Let it fall down from the sky
And leave this world behind

I saw you suffering, so I knelt
Down by your side, I saw that you
Were fading, that you were leaving
Your own mind
I gave you water just to soothe your
Failing heart and take away the fear
Of what we both know we will find

Don't paint the sun anymore
Paint the moon, and the stars
In an autumn sky
Paint me cool blue waters, with
Shades of gray, just don't let me
Live my life this way
Without you
