Feeling lonely, it's desperation
I've got nobody, only one place to go
Down to the rivers of glory
Surrounded, but I'm still alone

There are faces, I still remember
All the times, that I hoped for more
Down to the rivers of glory
Will I ever know for sure, you keep saying

Give me your heart tonight
I need someone to talk to, someone to fill my life
Give me your heart tonight
Don't tell me that you love me, 'cause it hurts me inside

Home is always where your heart is,
You smile and laugh, but you don't understand
Down to the rivers of glory

And I can't turn this boat around, so baby baby

Give me your heart tonight
I need someone to talk to, someone to fill my life
Give me your heart tonight
Don't tell me that you love me, 'cause it hurts me inside

Give me your heart tonight
I need someone to talk to, someone to fill my life
Give me your heart tonight
Don't tell me that you love me, 'cos it hurts me inside

I tried to swim against the stream and leave it all
Behind
Had to fight the pain inside, but it got me every time,
Baby baby

Give me your heart tonight
I need someone to talk to, someone to fill my life
Give me your heart tonight
Don't tell me that you love me, 'cause it hurts me inside

Give me your heart tonight
I need someone to talk to, someone to fill my life
Give me your heart tonight
Don't tell me that you love me, 'cause it hurts me inside

Give me your heart tonight
I need someone to talk to, someone to fill my life
Give me your heart tonight
Don't tell me that you love me, 'cos it hurts me inside
