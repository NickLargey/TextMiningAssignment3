Well I'm so glad, my baby's coming home
Don't know what to do
I'm so glad, my baby's coming home
All of my troubles are through

And I'm so happy, gonna tell my family
I'm gonna bring 'em the news
No more sighing, no more crying
No more singing the blues

Cause I'm so glad, my baby's coming home
Don't know what to do
I'm so glad, my baby's coming home
All of my troubles are through

And I'm so happy, gonna tell my family
I'm gonna bring 'em the news
No more sighing, no more crying
No more singing the blues
