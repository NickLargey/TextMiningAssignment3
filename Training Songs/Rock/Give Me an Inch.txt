Give me an inch, girl
Give me an inch, girl
Give me an inch, girl
Give me an inch, girl

My eyes show me more than I've seen
But unlike my poor heart they're not cautious
I got to thinking love was a dream
Misunderstanding my fortunes
I should have taken more heed of my heart
Telling me how to live

But if you give me an inch, girl
I'll give you a mile
Oh, I'll make it all worth while
And I'll make you see
Just how much you mean to me

Well ain't it easy to go head-over-heels
When you need the right person
You got to learn to smile about it
Nothing you do will feel certain
Here I stand with my heart in command
And it's you I want to be with

Give me an inch, girl
I'm in need of you
Don't leave me in the cold
When I want to trust in you
Don't turn me away
Life can be a worry
When it's all work and no play

Give me an inch, girl
I'll give you a mile
Oh, I'll make it all worth while
And I'll make you see
Just how much
Just how much you mean to me
Give me an inch,
I'll give you a mile
And I'll make you see
Just how much, just how much you mean to me
Give me an inch, girl
Oh, I'm in need of you
Don't leave me in the cold 
When I want to trust in you
