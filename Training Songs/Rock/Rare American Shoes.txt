He used to be too nice to you
Now he's got nothing left to lose
He's got a whole new attitude
And he's got rare American shoes
It isn't hard to do sorrow
Or say 'I love you'
We all use these words we borrow
To make our version of the truth

You hoped for sweeter sorrow
But he found someone new too soon
Don't let him leave tomorrow
In those rare American shoes
You'll miss his conversation
He'll miss your living room
A disappointed expectation
You'll be disappointed to live through

It isn't easy to see him
But you'll still find some excuse
And you won't be forgiven
You'll see those rare American shoes
You'll try to stop him leaving
He'll get another chance to refuse.
