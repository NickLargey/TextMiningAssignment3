Ice, baby
I saw your girlfriend and she was
Eating her fingers like they're just another meal
But she waits there in the levee washes
Mixin' cocktails with a plastic-tipped cigar

My eyes stick to all the shiny robes
She wear on the protein delta strip
In an abandoned house, but I will wait there
I'll be waitin' forever

I'm waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin'
Waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin', go

Minerals, ice deposit daily
Drop off the first shiny robe
I've got a lot of things I want sell, but
Not here, babe 
You took 'em all

Every time I sit around, I find I'm shot
Every time I sit around, I find I'm shot
Every time I turn around, my friend
Every time I sit around, my friend
Every time, every time, every time, every time
Every time, every time, every time

You're my
Summer babe
Summer babe
Summer babe
Summer babe
