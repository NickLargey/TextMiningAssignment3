Git yer head down to the ground 
Shake it all around, a dirty sound.
Git yer knees into yer face 
And see if you can race real slow

It's a slow dive 
When ya dive slow.
Aw it's a low jive 
Do the Slowdive.

Git yer head down to the ground 
Shake it all around  a dirty sound.
Git yer knees into yer face 
And see if you can race real slow

Now ya jump back like a hound 
Emit a howling sound 
Dig those limbs into the floor!
And holler out for more!

And ya revel in the dips 
When yer backbone slips 
Takin' honeysuckle sips 
From yer rollin' hips 

It shifts and shifts
It's a Slow Dive!

Slow dive!
When ya dive slow!
It's a Low Jive!
Do the Slow dive!

It's a Slow Dive!
Slow dive!
When ya come alive 
It's a low jive 
Do the Slow Dive!

Slow dive!
Slow dive!
Do the Slow Dive

Slow dive!
Slow dive!
Do the Slow Dive

Slow dive!
Slow dive!
When you dive slow 
When ya come alive!
It's a low jive 
Do the Slow Dive
Do the slow dive

Slow dive!
Uh
Git yer head down to the ground 
And shake it all around a dirty sound.
Git yer knees into yer face 
And see if you can race real slow.
It's a Slow Dive 
When ya dive slow 
Awhh it's a low jive 
Do the Slow dive
