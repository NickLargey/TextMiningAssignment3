Down, let's take it down
Raise up the heads on a stake
We will show no mercy
On evolution's mistake

Change, will have to wait
If we can't decide on a fate
Self appointed profits
And a doomsday charade

You preach about love
And teach about fate
But all your beliefs are still rooted in hate

Crosses to burn
Axes to fall
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall 
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Stop, punch in the clock
Punch it with all of your rage
Put the men in office
For a minimum wage

Rats, fighting for scraps
Siphon the gas from your tank
Left your pockets empty
As they laughed at the bank

They speak about draws
But make no mistake
They shaking your head while they spit in your face

Crosses to burn
Axes to fall
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall 
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Now, the time is now
We can still turn it around
Raise your voice like a weapon
Til they fall to the ground

Light, let there be light
Without a shadow of doubt
We will fight tooth and nail until
Salvation is found

So how can you look
The world in the eyes
When all we can see is corruption and lies

And down on your knees you just don't look so tall 
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Crackin the whip on the backs of the poor
We asked you to stop but you still wanted more
The blood on your hands left a trail as you crawl
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Crosses to burn
Axes to fall
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall (x3)

Crosses to bend
Crosses to burn
Down on your knees, you don't look so tall
Open your eyes and the empire falls
