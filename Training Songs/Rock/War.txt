May your dad rest well down in hell tonight
I never liked him much, but he gave me a bite of his hot dog
When we went golfing
In San Clemente
With Richard Nixon

But I was bored
So I prayed to the lord
Ha, give me a war
'Cause I'm so bored
And I want more
In a real fucking war

Well I'm bored with iran and I'm bored with Iraq
Egypt and Israel and Yassir Arafat
The Falklands was cool but it was too damn short
I want a real war 'cause I built a bitchin' fort

May your sister rest well in her bed tonight
I never liked her much, but she made me feel good last Christmas
In your mom's station wagon
Behind 7-11
She was just fourteen

But I was bored
So I prayed to the lord
Ha, give me a war
'Cause I'm so bored
And I want more
In a real fucking war

Well I'm bored with the contras and Colonel Quadhafi
The ayatollah's dead, but he made really great coffee
With my rifle in my arms I feel really swell
I wanna join the army and kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill

May your uncle rest well in his cell tonight
I never liked him much but he took me down to Tijuana
We drank tequila
And watched your mom dance
At the bambi club

But I was bored
So I prayed to the lord
Ha, give me a war
'Cause I'm so bored
And I want more
In a real fucking war
