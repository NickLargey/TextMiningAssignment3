I love you, you know I do
Yeah, it's perfect
Well, it isn't and it is

I've been meaning to call you
I've been meaning to call you
Then I do

I've been meaning to call you
I've been meaning to call you
Then I do

Phone rings once
Phone rings twice
Phone rings three times

I, I am of you
And you are in everything I do
I do

I trust you and that makes you true
I don't care if it isn't the way it is

I've been meaning to call you
I've been meaning to call you
Then I do

Phone rings once
Phone rings twice
Phone rings three times

I, I am of you
You are always in view
Yeah, I am my will
But you are in everything I do

I do, I do, I do

Day eraser's dark of night
Excited states, gone in plain sight
Under the wave or by cave light
I lose, things change but never in your eyes

I, I am of you
You are always in view
And I, I am my will
You are in everything I do
