Four year of my life that I'm never getting back and it hurts so much to realize. The days, the years I can't never live again. Painstaking, heart broken, and filled with regret. Yea it's like the time is slipping through the cracks. But now, now I wish that I could take it back but it's never coming back. And I thought I knew a better way. I'd lose myself in anything that could take away the pain. Years spent running and I never knew the cost. But shattered mirrors and broken hearts finally showed me what I'd lose. Yea it's like the time is slipping through the cracks. But now, now I wish that I could take it back. We've all been lost before we've all been knocked to the ground. Let go of our regrets and find the strength to turn it around. I know it might seem far too late but we're just about to break these chains that have always held us back. We've made our own mistakes but now it's time to set it straight. And live our lives. Be who we need to be and let our hearts be free. Now we live our lives. Be who we need to be and let our hearts be free.
