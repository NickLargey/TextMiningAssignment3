She came shortly after I was born 
Now I can't go in the rooms I used to own 
My world is full of strangers and I spend the day in chains 
I just want to go outside and run around 
Help me, I'm burning, I'm burning 
Help me break a window 
For the lonely days, white fur hat, little red coat 
Sleep in the big bed like a king 
Sunlight through the window on my shiny brown head 
And love behind my ears and on my back 
On my back 
Lay my head down and try to forget her 
I was just somewhere else but now I find myself here 
Help me, I'm burning, I'm burning 
Help me break a window 
Help me crack the door open 
Help me, I'm burning inside 
Think about leaving, think about running away 
Beyond the backyard, beyond the highway 
Someone who'll kiss my face, let me sleep inside 
Do you think I'll get there, do you think I'll make it 
Do you think I'll make it 
Help me, I'm burning, I'm burning 
Help me break a window 
Help me crack the door open 
Help me, I'm burning inside
