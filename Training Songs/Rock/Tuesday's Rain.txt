Tuesday's rain falls like a river on my head
And who's to blame for the signal turning red
As I stand here all alone
And count the sands of time
I watch the sunshine yielding
To the night

There's nothing left for me
But my restless soul
My starring role
In a faded memory

Like Tuesday's rain
It's falling down on me
Tuesday's rain

The thrill is gone
I'm numb to the burning pain of love
And I can't explain why I held on so long

As I wait for my new high
And sit on my mood swing
And drift out like the tide
Into the deep blue sea
