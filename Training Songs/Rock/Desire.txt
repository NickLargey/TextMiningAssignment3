(verse 1)
Holy one, in your majesty and grace
There is none, to compare to you
I tried to run, to the corners of the earth
But your love brought me home 

(pre-chorus)
I thought I could leave you
But I could never deceive you
Into turning your face away
So I tried to ignore you
Other things before you
But oh,oh,oh I just got to say: 

(chorus)
I want you, I need you
I finally found the guts to say
I want you, I need you
I finally found the guts to say
I want you, I need you
I finally found the guts to see
I want you, I need you, I need you, I need you 

(verse 2)
Holy one, there are no words to describe
Your only son and his sacrifice
A perfect love that was fastened to a tree
A punishment, that was meant for me
