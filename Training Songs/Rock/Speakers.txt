Honey, don't talk to me about money
Your diamonds and guns and your bullshit
Vive la rock 'n' roll

Baby, f*ck M.T.V.
That ain't nothin', nothin' to me
Give me somethin', to liberate my soul

Where's the love? where's the love?
Inside the melody that's lickin' your speakers
Where's the love? where's the love?
I hope somebody's gonna stand up and teach us

People, the leaders are leadin' us nowhere
They're rapin' our world and we don't care
Vive la rock 'n' roll

People, it's time to stand up and start speakin'
Yeah shake up the devil you're keepin'
Before they take it all

Where's the love? where's the love?
Inside the melody that's lickin' your speakers
Where's the love? where's the love?
I hope somebody's gonna stand up and teach us
Some days I can't believe my eyes I'm so speechless

Honey honey honey honey
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Where's the love? where's the love?
Inside the melody that's lickin' your speakers
Where's the love? where's the love?
I hope somebody's gonna stand up and teach us
Where's the love? where's the love?
Inside the melody that's lickin' your speakers
Where's the love? where's the love?
Some days I can't believe my eyes I'm so speechless
