Blue-eyed bloody lullaby
Less a lesson than an alibi
Shot from only one side
Sanitize then canonize

Annex and index (annex and index)
Mirror too perfect (mirror too perfect)

Histories
I don't believe
I don't believe
I don't believe

Listened every day 'til three
I'm the bitter beneficiary
Illustrate the story
Advertise your dignity

Mirror too perfect (mirror too perfect)

Histories
I don't believe
I don't believe
I don't believe
 
Grains of sand
To mirror glass
Righteousness
Blazes back
Twist the past
And reward the arrogance

Grains of sand

Blazing back

I don't believe, I don't believe
