We lived in a time and a world of our own
Making up the rules as we went along
Just one coat between us and we never felt cold
We were never gonna get old

Playing cards 'till the sun came up, rollin' dice
Down to the club and listen to the blues all night
Girls out on the corner get lonely now and then
We'd never be that free again

It's been a long time since we laughed together
It's been a long time since we cried
Raise your glass for the comrades we've lost
My friend it's been a long, long time 

Workin' just enough to pay the rent
Money got made, baby, money got spent
Sleeping when we had nothin' left to do
Under the boardwalk and up on the roof

We never quite fit, baby, we never played the game
Came out explodin' like a runaway train
Up all night talkin' about dreams of better days
Ain't it funny how some things don't change?

It's been a long time since we laughed together
It's been a long time since we cried
Raise your glass for the comrades we've lost
My friend it's been a long, long time

We lived in a time and a world of our own
Making up the rules as we went along
Just one coat between us and we never felt cold
We were never gonna get old

It's been a long time since we laughed together
It's been a long time since we cried 
Raise your glass for the comrades we've lost
My friend it's been a long, long time
