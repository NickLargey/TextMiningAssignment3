He rocked his way through yesterday, lord he thought he had a chance
He played guitar and wrote some tunes, of love and romance
He did his share of travelin', like a dog without a home
A fugitive who would rather give, a star that never shone

Isn't it a pity, isn't it a shame
No one ever warned the boy
Rock n' roll is a vicious game, oh yeah

He said he wouldn't get led around, or caught up in the games
Or end up in a gallery, of faces with no names
And rock 'n' roll was in his soul, and music was a friend
He recorded a song that made us sing along, and he was on the road again

Isn't it a pity, isn't it a shame
No one ever warned the boy
Rock n' roll is a vicious game, oh oh, oh yeah, oh oh
Stage fright, ooh, and long black limousines
He's pushing himself a way too hard, or so it seems

He opened up his heart to us, he gave us what he could
We symphathized and harmonized, he made us all feel good
But it's funny how those things can change, and time can pass us by
Songs that moved us so easily, no longer make us cry

Now isn't it a pity, isn't it a shame
No one ever warned the boy
Rock n' roll is a vicious game, oh oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh, oh oh oh, oh, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
My my my, rock 'n roll is a vicious game, yeah
Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
