The oldest path beneath the grave
Lies a myth that's still the same
There ain't no way to make a change
Till Kings and Queens have walked in chains 

And the wind it blows them down
And the sea it takes them in
In their sleep you'll find the anwser
To everywhere they have been 

Sailors tossed by stormy seas
All in the name of slavery
Arm in arm, toe to toe
Sometimes your bestfriend is your foe 

And the wind it blows them down
And the sea it takes them in
In their sleep you'll find the anwser
To everywhere they have been 

Side by side their pasts in disguise
Together alone as he greeted the tide
And on the water knees lay the thoughts of
A hundred sunken shackle bound souls 

And the wind it blows them down
And the sea it takes them in
In their sleep you'll find the anwser
To everywhere they have been
