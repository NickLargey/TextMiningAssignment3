It's opening night
Let's give them their money's worth
May this show run and run
Till it falls off the edge of the earth
Put on your make-up
Powder puff adder of mine
Dusk is upon us
Switch on that shining sign

I am a major prophet
I'm heaven and hell bent strong
I am the height of a sign
Wide of the mark
Deep as the amazon

I must impress on them
This opportunity
It'll be too late
By the time they put me on tv
I feel sharp
I feel blunt
A precision instrument
I really gleam
Watch me bite on a bullet
And spit out a limousine

I am a major prophet
I'm heaven and hell bent strong
I am the height of a sign
Wide of the mark
Deep as the amazon

Feel my wild sadness blowing down
Feel my wild sadness blowing
All the way down

I stand before you
In full possession of the facts
I make no use of effects
No use for clever counterbalancing acts
I've broken every bone of meaning
In this body and this soul
I've bought knowledge
At the cost of a complete loss of self-control

All the truth you can bear
Is yours to take away tonight
- the longer you leave it
- the more there's to leave
Like you, I once saw
Those pretty colours in black and white
- you've got to get it over with
- stop being naive
Strangers to truth and to fiction
You will remain
- if I meet you at the fountainhead
- I'll win you downstream
Walk away if you like
You've only yourself to blame
- I'm not talking eyewash
- I'm talking strychnine

I am a major prophet
I'm heaven and hell bent strong
I am the height of a sign
Wide of the mark
Deep as the amazon

And I simply may be evil
I simply may be evil
