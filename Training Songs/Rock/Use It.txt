Say what you want, go
In the end it's all music
I don't care
You can tell me just what you want,
In the end we could all use it

Don't give a damn what what you say,
I can use it anyway
Give a damn what you say
Yeah

And here we go again man
And it's starting to sound all the same
Hip hop is in
We never tell you nothing
Fuckin leave
If it's not what you like, then shut the f*ck up and
don't listen to it
Maybe then we wouldn't have to listen to your bitchin
through it
Leave it alone and do it,
It's all about the music man
I pack a bong with a song and hit the minivan
Kickin live, writing rhymes
Thats all I've got to say
F*ck what they say in school
Just do it your own way

Say what you want, go
In the end its all music
I don't care
You can tell me just what you want,
In the end we could all use it

Don't give a damn what what you say,
I can use it anyway
You'll damn what you say
Yeah

See I don't give a f*ck, right, (something)
Kid in the slips with a stick (pop) into half time
I don't give a shit, right, to you, your funky sound,
with your crew
I've been here since 1982
And altho(something)
Sipping cognac
To these I'm just another rapper with my dick in my
hand
Master plan
And I don't care if you don't understand

We are not the same
We are not the same
We are not the same
We are not even the same

In the end it's all about the music
In the end it's all about the music
In the end it's all about the music

Say what you want, go
In the end its all music
I don't care
You can tell me just what you want,
In the end we could all use it

In the end it's all about the music
In the end it's all about the music
In the end it's all about the music
In the end it's all about the music
