Got a girlfriend running on soul
Gave her the big speaker stereo
Blastin' out rock and roll
Oh, yeah

Something hit her
Now she's out of control
She's coming over talkin' 'bout
Vacations to Mexico, oh, no

She must be dreaming
Somebody wake her

Just like a woman in love
(Woman in love)
She wanna get the best of me
(Woman in love)

A woman in love
(Woman in love)
She wanna get the rest of me
(Woman in love)

Spinning passion in her old man's car
She got a nasty way of racing
And making that Corvette talk
Oh, yeah

Well, sixteen days, I'm going out of my mind
She's got me runnin' out, jumpin' around
Tori girl, you're stealing me blind
Oh, yeah

I must be dreaming
Somebody help me

Just like a woman in love
(Woman in love)
She wanna get the best of me
(Woman in love)

A woman in love
(Woman in love)
She wanna get the rest of me
(Woman in love)

And those summer nights
You were so kind to me
(Love is blind)

And I knew inside
That we would never see
(Eye to eye)

I'm over loading
On this fantasy
(My, my, my)

But I'll play it all the way
If for just a minute
Won't you let me be me

I must be dreaming
Somebody shake me

Just like a woman in love
(Woman in love)
She wanna get the best of me
(Woman in love)

A woman in love
(Woman in love)
She wanna get the rest of me
(Woman in love)

Just like a woman in love
(Woman in love)
She wanna get the best of me
(Woman in love)

A woman in love
(Woman in love)
She wanna get the rest of me
(Woman in love)
