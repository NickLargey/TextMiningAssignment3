Some say love is borrowed time
A lonely loan only lovers find
It's got you down, you're on the line
I can read you like a book
Say I can read your mind

You been holdin' back the hands of time
Heaven sakes, you know you should be flyin'

You should be high love, you should be my love
You should be high love, you should be my love

You've been left to your own devices
Hand out, tongue out, compromises
You're the first to go but the last in line
And if you lose your love, you can lose your mind

You been runnin' outta borrowed time
Heaven sakes, you know you should be flyin'

You should be high love, you should be my love
You should be high love, you should be my love
If shadows should find you, put 'em behind you
You should be high love, you should be my love
You should be high love, you should be my love

It's all behind you, let the spirit find you
And the love light blind you

You should be high love, you should be my love
You should be high love, you should be my love
If shadows should find you, put 'em behind you
You should be high love, you should be my love
You should be high love, you should be my love
