I thought I needed redemption but I let that thought go
I guess, I'll cut my losses and turn my tricks at the magic show
You spin your wheels through time and get tired of the grind
I wanna find a good man but instead I settle for what I find

Get it in throw in your cheap shots, cheap shot,baby
Isn't that all life really is a bunch of have nots
And the gods will laugh when you think you've found
Your lot and take it all away

Redemption, redemption

There are no real innocents no matter whose side your on
Littered path to paradise, honey, that will always steer you wrong
Put your hands where I can see 'em, put your hands next to mine
I wanted something to believe in before I got sold on the lie

Get it in throw in your cheap shots, cheap shot,baby
Isn't that all life really is a bunch of have nots
And the gods will laugh when you think you've found
Your lot and take it all away

Redemption, oh, purgatory
Oh, redemption, oh, purgatory

Oh, isn't that all life really is a bunch of cheap shots?
And you give it what you've got, you give it what you've got
And the gods will laugh when you think you've found your lot
And take it all away, oh, they'll take it all away, you fool

Oh, they take it, take it all, all away
