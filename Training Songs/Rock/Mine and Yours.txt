Love my eternal mystery
Buried in an angel's breast
Fell down the stairs and kissed me
Smiled and forsook the rest

No calculated guesswork
Now that introduction's made
And oh what a thrill to hold her
An embrace beside a hand grenade

I'm a mess to be made this evening
With a cheap serenade so pure

What is mine and yours
Could never be unspoken
'Cause a love as pure
Scream to the ocean and sky
All the ways of boys and girls
Love the same is mine and yours tonight
Tonight

Sweet summer lilac romance
There upon the grocery shelf
Staring at your painted beauty
Flexing my painted self

Take off your dress don't worry
Take off your boxing gloves
There's nothing in your touch to hurt me
But the punishment I'm thinking of

I'm a mess to be made this evening
With a cheap serenade so pure

What is mine and yours
Should never be unspoken
'Cause a love as pure
Scream to the ocean and sky
All the ways of boys and girls
Love the same is mine and yours tonight

And if it's a promise kept
Or sweet enchanted sorrow
I will still be here tomorrow
As tonight

What is mine and yours
Should never be unspoken
'Cause a love as pure
Scream to the ocean and sky
All the ways of boys and girls
Love the same is mine and yours tonight
Tonight
