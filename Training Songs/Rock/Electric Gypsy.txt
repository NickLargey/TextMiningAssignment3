I need the highway wind blowin' in my hair
Five thousand miles I've roamed now,
I'm gettin' there
This is my destiny, the way that I choose
Don't need no one to talk about
About love and blues
Round, round, up and down
Moves so fast, never touch the ground
High, high, touch the sky
Don't come down, don't make me try
Lost in space or any other place
Living my dream on the moving train
Gypsy, electric gypsy, round I blow, yeah
I remember way back when, I was just like you
Yeah, I killed myself to live,
But I didn't have a clue
I got saddled in chrome and steel
750 reasons why I can't stand still
Oh no, here I go
Gotta keep moving, gotta let go
'Nother town, 'nother girl
Can't stand still till I've seen the world
Till I've seen the world, when I cry
Get in my spaceship, watch me fly
Gypsy, electric gypsy, round I blow, yeah, ooh, ah
Don't need no one to tell me to settle down
Life in the fast lane suits me to the ground
This is my destiny, the way that I choose
Don't need no one to tell me
About love and blues
Round, round, up and down
Moves so fast, never touch the ground
High, high, touch the sky
Don't come down, don't make me try
Lost in space or any other place
Puttin' my dream on the moving train
Gypsy, electric gypsy, round I blow
Gypsy, electric gypsy, oh oh oh
Gypsy, electric gypsy, round I blow
Gypsy, electric gypsy, (n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-no no no no no no) round I blow
Gypsy, electric gypsy, (oh oh oh oh oh) round I blow
Gypsy
