Hey hey
Oh I'm gonna play the horses
Play the lottery
Spin the wheel of fortune
Baby won't ya spin with me
Going down to Las Vegas
Atlantic City here I come
Dealer knows you're dealin' blows
And babe we're gonna have some fun
Working for love that's your biz
Gonna put my money where your mouth is

(Put my money where your mouth is)
Put My money where your mouth is
(I make a bet on you) I make a bet on you
(Put my money where your mouth is)
Put my money where your mouth is
(I make a bet on you) I make a bet on you

Lady luck look so pretty
Lady luck looks so fine
Red hot lips of an angel
Sending chills down my spine
Hits ya right in the kisser
Takes my breath away
Seeing stars sends me to Mars
Ooo I'm gonna pay to play
Working for love that's your biz
Gonna put my money where your mouth is

(Put my money where your mouth is)
Put My money where your mouth is
(I make a bet on you) I make a bet on you
(Put my money where your mouth is)
Put my money where your mouth is
(I make a bet on you) I make a bet on you

It's a business doin' pleasure with ya'

(Put my money where your mouth is)
Put My money where your mouth is
(I make a bet on you) I make a bet on you
(Put my money where your mouth is)
Put my money where your mouth is
(I make a bet on you) I make a bet on you

Make a bet on you
Make a bet on you
(Put my money where your mouth is)
Where your mouth is
(I make a bet on you) Make a bet on you
Where your mouth is
Make a bet on you - Where your mouth is
Make a bet on you
You - You - You - You - You - You
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
