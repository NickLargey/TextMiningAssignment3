I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you...
Green are my eyes, they've seen so much compassion
I couldn't have changed but too much suffering inside so now I'm said and done
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 'cause I have to
And now I spend most of my time playing computer games
And wishing I was loving like most of my friends oh I am so ashamed
I love you, I love you, I love you I love you 'cause I have to

I love you 'cause I have to 
Make everything OK
I love you 'cause I have to
Go away

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 'cause I have to
And now I make much noise reading, ficking through rubbish
Contribution is the solution to an endless black hole and through the malice
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 'cause I have to
Green are my eyes, they've seen so much compassion
I couldnt have changed but too much suffering inside so now I'm said and done
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 'cause I have to

I love you 'cause I have to 
Make everything OK
I love you 'cause I have to
Go away

Ohhhhh

I love you 'cause I have to 
Make everything OK
I love you 'cause I have to
Go away

Ohhhhhhhh

Ohhhhhhhh

Ohhhhhh

I love you 'cause I have to 
Make everything OK
I love you 'cause I have to
Go away

Ohhhhhh

I love you 'cause I have to 
Make everything OK
I love you 'cause I have to
Go away
