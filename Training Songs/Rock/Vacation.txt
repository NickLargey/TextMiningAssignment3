Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
If you don't like your life, then 
You should go and change it
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every singe day 'cause I love my occupation
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day, every every single day
Every single day, every every single day
Every single day, every every single day, ay
 
Everybody sour like a lemon tree
I'm just smiling down upon my enemies
Do this shit, I love it, on the daily
You say you hate your job, but you'll never leave, never leave
But that ain't gonna be me, that ain't gonna be me
My brother called me up, said he saw me on TV
I said it wasn't easy but right now I'm living breezy
Build this engine from the ground up
Now my hands they ain't so greasy, feel me
 
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day, every every single day
Every single day, every every single day
Every single day, every every single day, ay 
 
Illuminate, my future right, so thankful for everything
Rejuvenate my inner light as I work hard for all I need
Open arms, embracing life and all of which it gave me
Hard work it pays off, I'm happy now, it's paying me
Close my eyes, sometimes it feels as if I float away
I love the life I live, enjoy the ride along the way
I make a living at a living, yeah that's what I say
I got one life to live and I wouldn't live it no other way
 
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day, every every single day
Every single day, every every single day
Every single day, every every single day, ay 

Look, Van Gogh my ear lobe
I can't hear, I'm here though
I maybe a weirdo
But this is my year yo
My life may be crazy
My lack of the lazy
Has let me do shit
That I love on the daily
Daily, daily
Get to do this shit I love upon the daily
Daily, daily
Everybody go and live your daydreams up
 
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day 'cause I love my occupation
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
If you don't like your life, then 
You should go and change it
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every singe day 'cause I love my occupation
Ay, ay, ayy, I'm on vacation
Every single day, every every single day
Every single day, every every single day
Every single day, every every single day, ay
