You can go your own way
You can go your own way
It doesn't matter what the others say
'Cos you can go your own way
You can go your own way

You've got a ring on your finger
A chain around your heart and your soul
Searching for an answer
Looking for your own control

Walk away from the leader
Walk away form the books
Walk away from the TV
Take a long hard look
And you can go your own way
