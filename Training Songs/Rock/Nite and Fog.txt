If God moves across the water
Then the girl moves in other ways
And I, losing sight of either
night and Fog are my days
I wanted only to be gentle
But I gave her jealousy and rage
Who knows exactly what I'm after?
night and Fog are my days
Wise men want fame
Fools want gold
Sailors want water
But you want it all
I tried to guide my love by starlight
And soon my life became maze
Orian and Osirus were your favorites
night and Fog are my days
Vampires want darkness
Monsters want soles
Spiders want corners
But you want it all
She turns, half in to find me naked
But I can see she wants me in other ways
In the dark I've driven her to madness
night and Fog are my days
I hope you see your ship come in
May it find you and never lose its way
But I would make a poor captain
night and Fog are my days
Vampires want darkness
Monsters want soles
Spiders want corners
But you want it all
