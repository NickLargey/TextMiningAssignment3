Mesmerized by those eyes with bugs crawling on them, my breathing stops
My heart calms itself
The refreshing sun mixes in with sound of the rain

My slashed heart dances, and I question in vain
The white voice, the leaking of the breath in the sun

The obscene exposure of the wound
Disappears into nothing, the wind of dogma
Your melting heart

The dark morning, echoing goodbye

My slashed heart dances, and I question in vain
I just want to be alone right now

A single season of spring, even the tearful neck and you crawling the earth

Love me

Abandon hope
