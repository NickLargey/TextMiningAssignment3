We ain't got no place to go
So let's go to the punk rawk show
Darling take me by the hand
We're gonna see a punk rawk band
There's no use in TV shows, radio, or rodeo
want to get into the crowd
want to hear it played real loud

Repeat

Ain't got no money to pay
We'll get in anyway
Doesn't matter I don't care
If we do we should share
We're going to the punk rawk show

Repeat
