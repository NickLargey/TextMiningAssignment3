You said that I
Should look to the future
I've seen and I'll stay here
I don't know why
I am tied to the winter
Can't find the time to live

The smallest gentle gesture
Keeps the enemy at bay
All I needed was a word
Where are they now?
The sky seems a little lower
But for that a normal day
Do I ask too much
Where are they now?

You said that I
Take more than I offer
Yes, this is how I spend my time
You'll come undone
If you don't make the effort
Seek and ye shall find

So when disaster struck me
No heart left to offend
I only wanted friends
Where are they now?
Will you be there forever
And say I'll never be without?
Don't blame me for my doubt

You see I cannot stand alone
I'm incapable of breathing
Incapable of love
In my world
Make it safe
Take me home
I'm incapable of breathing
Incapable of love

You said that I
Should stop trying to call you
You've had it up to here
I know your sort
But I just can't ignore you
I'm lost in the fog
