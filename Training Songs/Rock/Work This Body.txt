It was a strange place and a tender age, I was just a babe in school
Saw them roll their eyes at me every time that I thought that I was cool
Well, uh, God knows I was no chosen one that just wasn't my prime
Yeah it's just a matter of time, honey, it's just a matter of time

And I will work this body, I will burn this flame
Oh, in the dead of night, and in the pouring rain
Yeah, I'm a workaholic and I swear, I swear
Yeah, one day I will beat you fair and square

(Yeah)
Show me what you got (yeah)
Work this body on the floor (yeah)
Who do you think you are? (yeah)
C'mon, meet me on the court

Que ferais-tu?
Putain, je ne sais pas!

It ain't no matter of "if", honey, it's just a matter of "when"
Ah, some sunday when it's my face in the newspaper again
All the rag magazines, black limousines, they'll be getting in line
Yeah, it's just a matter of time, honey, it's just a matter of time

And I will work this body, I will burn this flame
Oh, in the dead of night, and in the pouring rain
Yeah, I'm a workaholic and I swear, I swear
Yeah, one day I will beat you fair and square

(Yeah)
Show me what you got (yeah)
Work this body on the floor (yeah)
Just who do you think you are? (yeah)
C'mon, meet me on the court

Que ferais-tu?
Putain, je ne sais pas!
Ne viens pas pleurer vers moi

And I will work this body I will burn this flame
