I believe we're worlds apart
And I don't know if I'm getting through
Oh I
I believe we're worlds apart
And I don't know if I'm getting through

I don't wanna talk
And I don't wanna fight
I'm in the mood for attention tonight
But every time that I make a move
You turn and walk away

I get the feeling
That you're not accepting
This love I'm offering around
'Cause every time that I make a move
You just can't be found

And you're the only one
Who can make me feel the way that you do
You are the only one
Who can make me feel it too

And I'm not expected to be your intended
You just like to have me around
A week I've been planning to take you out
Now you won't come past your door

You are the only one
Who can make me feel the way that you do
You are the only one
Who can make me feel it too

And you know that I
I believe we're worlds apart
And I don't know
If I'm getting through
Oh I I believe we're worlds apart
And I don't know
If I'm getting though
And I don't know if I'm getting through 
To you
