Here's an easy target
With just one quiet pop
Shot to hell anyway
No reason to stop
In the streets and the gutters
The cotton fields in this land
Here's an easy target
With a trigger, in your hand

So, black lives matter
Who we trying to kid
Here's an easy target
Don't matter, never did
Crosses burning
Such a long time ago
Four hundred years and we still don't, let it go

Well let the poor be damned
And the easy targets too
All are created equal
Equally beneath me and you
Children crying
Under the time-keeping sun
The war on the easy targets
We won't ever, get this done

Easy targets
All along the avenue
Living here in Sucker Town
Baby me and you
Behind the bars
To keep each other apart
Easy targets
Our Country's broken heart
