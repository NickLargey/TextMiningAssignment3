People in love get fast and foolish
People in love get everything wrong
People in love get scared and stupid
People in love get everything wrong

[Chorus]
At least they're not lonely
At least they're not lonely
Never be lonely

B-b-b-b-b-b-b-baby
I think I'm going c-c-c-crazy
Why should I be sane without you?
They tell me to fight it
But they can bloody well just try it
I'll never be the same without you

People in love get special treatment
People in love get everything wrong
People in love, their hearts get eaten
And people in love get everything wrong

[Chorus]

Never be lonely
