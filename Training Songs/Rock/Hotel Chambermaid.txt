When the lights are low you know I'm going to go to my hotel chambermaid
I'm going to jump the garden and come on hard all right
While the river's rolling outside the window
Going to see her going to get love
Going to shut the bellboy out tonight

VERSE
When the world is dead I'm going to make the bed with that hotel chambermaid
She'll bring the coffee in the morning with a smile
She don't ask me where I come from
I crept in and I soon be done
I just want to hide here for a while

I ain't got a million dollars, no-one I can call mine
But I'll push on cushion me in some way
Ain't got no future at least that's what they say
This girl is going to take those kind of blues away for a day yeah
Uh uh uh uh uh hotel chambermaid hotel chambermaid

VERSE
Room service can you help me I want a hotel chambermaid
I didn't pay my bill but I had my fill all right
While the river's rolling outside the window
Going to see her going to get love
Going to shut the bellboy out tonight
While the river's rolling outside the window
Going to see her going to get love
Going to shut the bellboy out tonight (3 times)
