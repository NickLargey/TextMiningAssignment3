Life 
Will go on without me 
Take it and you`ll see it doesn`t matter 

Life 
I know what your game is 
You take it and trade it for another 

Life 
Before you`re over 
I want something to show for all my trouble 

Time come on in 
I want you back again 
Where`re you goin` now? 
I thought you`d know somehow...

Life 
If you keep goin` 
I`ll try to throw in a little love 
Life 
I can`t do without you 
There`s something about you that keeps me goin` 

Life 
I don`t want to stop now 
I`ve been through so much now because of you 

Tell me life... what are you here for? 
Tell me life... I want to know more 
Tell me life... what are we here for?
