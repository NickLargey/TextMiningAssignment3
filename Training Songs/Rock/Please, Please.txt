Please, please, Lindsay, please

Set the scene, I think I'm in love now
Your eyes are green, you've come from above now
Easy, girl, I think we're alone now
Let's get the motion in the ocean
So turn off your phone now

I want to put my hands on your skin 
Underneath the clothes that you're in
So kick off your shoes, let the fun begin
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Please, please, please
See-see-see-come home with me now
Please, please, please
M-M-M-Must be a dreamer
Please, please, please
I wanna get with you
Please, please, Lindsay, please

Sunsets, the color of fire
Your red hair, you're taking me higher

I'm not sure what's happening to me
If you were a God, then I would believe
You love yourself more than you love me
Oooh
