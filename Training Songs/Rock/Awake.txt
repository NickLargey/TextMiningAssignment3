I guess it's been a while
And a long time too
Everything's still the same
And so are you

It's only in this light
That I could see what you'd be like
If it took a million years well
This is what I am

You're awake and I'm asleep and
We are so complete that way
You're asleep and I'm awake
Everything is so great

Everything is so great
Oh yeah
Heavy

I wash my hands of you
I wash my dirty feet too
And when I wash my hair
The dust clouds disappear

You're leaning out the window
Beating down a path real slow
With your heavy plastic bags and
Heavy head

You're awake and I'm asleep and
We are so complete that way
You're asleep and I'm awake and

Everything is so great
Everything is so great
Yeah
Oh yeah

I wish we had a laugh
But you're just not funny
Baby I'm leaving out the irony

You're awake and I'm asleep and
We are so complete that way
You're asleep and I'm awake and
Everything is so great
Everything is so great
Yeah
