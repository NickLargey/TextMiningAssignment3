I'm trying to turn off, what is right for us
We don't give a f*ck anyway
Don't try to steal imagination from us
Things we believe and we will never betray, never betray

Those who have the power to 
Suck us dry, throw us away
Those who never could create
Destroy the music of today
Those devoid on any feeling 
Those who make the compromise
Betray themselves to make a deal
Sell their souls at any price

Sounds without feeling, energy or aggression
From money hungry brains and not from the heart
Fortune, fame and glory are their obsessions
Salesmen, deaf to music, blind to art

No honesty, just sterility
A cautious sound they make without creativity
It's still the same as another age
When they took the words of truth and put them to the flame

No more
Love us or hate us
No more
Love us or hate us

Some have eyes and still can't see
Their plastic noise is anything but music to me
Mechanized and computerized
Switch off your brain and make sounds that dehumanize

No more
Love us or hate us
No more
Love us or hate us

Don't try to take our dreams away from us
We will never be like you
Love us or hate us, it doesn't matter to me
We don't want to be a part of this sick society

Those who have a passion to 
Will never change our way of life
We may not think the way you do
But we know that we are right
Those who want to form a world
Of trends and monotony
Will have to do it without us
'Cause we always will be free
