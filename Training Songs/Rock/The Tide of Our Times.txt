This is the tide of our times
The last time a war was on ratings or soot
The network of businessmen clamored for more
"The conflict and competition on TV
Will keep them all watching for weeks," they would say

[Chorus]
This is the story of territory
The target is taken
No one forsaken
Love take my hand if together we stand
Then we won't have to worry
This is the tide of our times

The minister of public surveillance found
The president of population control
The riots and regular robbing of stores
Have stopped coinciding with the call for war

[Chorus]
This is the story of territory
The target is taken
No one forsaken
Love take my hand if together we stand
Then we won't have to worry
This is the tide of our times

We all march along
Our mothers, our fathers
Our soldiers comply
While starving at home
Behind enemy lines
Without knowing why

[Chorus]
This is the story of territory
The target is taken
No one forsaken
Love take my hand if together we stand
Then we won't have to worry
This is the tide of our times
