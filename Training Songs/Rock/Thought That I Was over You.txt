Well I saw you at the opening
Somebody's hand was up your dress
You were showing off everything
Except your finesse
Thought that I
Thought that I was over you
Thought that I, thought that I
Thought that I was over you
In a shack one night in Brisbane
You said that I'd just missed my flight
Playing cards, raining hard
And holding on with all my might
Like a firework going off in my mind
I have to say it hurt me seeing you have a good time
I know you're there, you've got new friends
From my point of view, well it depends
I'm sure there was a reason
It's pretty clear to me
If he's got a hold on your heart yeah
I hope he shows some mercy
Can't you hear the phone ringing
Can't you see the train has come
Can't you hear the Seraphim is singing
Devil beating on his drum
