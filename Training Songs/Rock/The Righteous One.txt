Smoke in the air
I don't have a care
Double, double, double, double, double, double, double dare
Falling down the stairs

Ooh! 

But it's not fair
Don't touch your hair
It's not nice to stare
But it's not fair to let down your hair
Oh I don't know where?
Where, where, where, where?
I don't know where, where, where, where to go

Smoke in the air
I don't have a care
Double, double, double, double, double, double, double dare
Falling down the stairs

Ooh! 

But it's not fair
Don't touch your hair
It's not nice to stare
But it's not fair to let down your hair
Oh I don't know where?
Where, where, where, where?
I don't know where, where, where, where to go

Smoke in the air
I don't have a care
I don't have a care
