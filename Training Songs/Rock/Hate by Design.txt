Yeah

Born into this world of hatred

We are born free
From the restraints of this society,
Helpless to what is instilled
(Yeah)
To all those who raise us, mold us, and shape us
There is a time to separate,
From this

A reason why, a state of mind,
There's a disconnection
A judgement made
Fueled by hate, it's your mistake,
It's a choice you made
It's tearing us apart

Hate,
Hate by design,
Is destroying our lives
Seek to find,
Some understanding
Redefine your life

Consequence, effected
In a life that is rejected,
Anger misplaced
A burden on our hearts,
That's keeping us apart,
No love,
No understanding

What we design is hate inside,
A misconception,
A judgement made
(A judgement made)

It's our mistake,
We create,
When we lose compassion,
It's tearing us apart

Hate,
Hate by design,
(Hate by design)
Is destroying our lives
Seek to find
(We'll seek to find)
Some understanding,
Redefine your life

Redefine your understanding
Redefine your own life
Go!

Hate,
Hate by design,
(By design)
Is destroying our lives,
(Our lives)
Seek to find,
Some understanding

Redefine your life
