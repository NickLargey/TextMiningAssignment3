There's an old man on a city bus
Holding a candy cane
And it isn't even Christmas
He see's a note in the obituary
That his last friend has died
There's an infant clinging

To his overweight mother in the cold
As they go to shop for cigarettes
As the spends her last dollar
On a bottle of vodka for tonight
And I guess it struck a nerve
Like I had to squint my eyes

You can never get out
Of the line of sight
Like a barren winter day
Or a patch of unburned green
Like a tragic real dream
I guess it struck a nerve
Every day I wander

In negative disposition
As I'm bombarded by superlatives
Realizing very well that I am not alone
Introverted

I look to tomorrow for salvation
But I'm thinking altruistically
And a wave of overwhelming doubt
Turns me to stone

And I guess it struck a nerve
Send a murmur through my heart
We just haven't got time
To crack the maze

Like a magic speeding clock
Or a cancer in our cells
A collision in the dark
I guess it strunk a nerve
I try to close my eyes

But I cannot ignore the stimuli
If there's a purpose for us all
It remains a secret to me
Don't ask me to justify my life
