The girl said do you love me
The boy said I do
The girl said prove it
The boy said hoo dee hoo

I headed for the water tower straight to the top
With my spray paint can and I did not stop
I painted your name larger than life
About eight feet tall about twelve feet wide
I think that you believed me when I came back down
And for a couple of weeks we were the talk of the town

And the girls sang hoo dee hoo
And the boys sang hoo dee hoo
And everybody sang hoo dee hoo
Hoo dee hoo hoo hoo

Then I left town looking for the holy grail
You left the very next week with the jet set
Sailing for the Caribbean where the rich kids play
I missed you so much I fell down and prayed
I joined every church they claimed they knew my sin
They made me write the Lord?s Prayer on the head of a pin

(chorus)

Well one year it was the factory and one year the park
We heated with wood and the house caught fire
I reached for a figure through the smoke and the sparks
But which one did I save the girl or the guitar

Well I made a lot of money got a lot of good press
Writing paperback novels like a man possessed
Every name was changed every story was true
Every priest was me every stripper was you
And they danced like angels cast out for being lovers
I wrote their life story on a matchbook cover

(chorus)

I went home for Christmas to that little old town
I ate a big dinner and went walking around
I seen some other dumb kid had made that long hard climb
He wasted his paint wasted his time
But I know I?d do it all again if you asked me to
And I?ll take you with me this time singing hoo dee hoo

(chorus)
