Sand in my eyes sand in my hair
Sand in the places I never knew
People are cruel when they want to be
They turn into monsters
Out of the sea
You're not like all of the rest
You're always smiling and waving
When I was younger I was sure
I could fly above it all
I remember looking down
But I'm so tied up
To the ground now
You're not like all of the rest
You're always smiling and waiving
Can I be sonic too ?
Stars in my eyes stars in my hair
Stars and footprints in the air
Could I ever be that tall
Wrapped up in this mortal coil ?
You're not like all of the rest
You're always smiling and waiving
Who catches you when you're falling ?
