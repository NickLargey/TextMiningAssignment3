There can be a new tomorrow
There can be a bright day
There can be a new tomorrow
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

The days go passing by 
and we try to live life so carefree
Wond'ring what is real
Do you feel there's a change that should be?

In the end, what will win,
But let's hold on and keep love strong

We're living in a time where you find we must share our burden
It's a heavy load, on a road that is so uncertain.
It may seem we're chasing dreams, 
But let's hold on and keep love strong.
