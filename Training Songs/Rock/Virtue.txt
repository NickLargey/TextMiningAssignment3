Temptation hides
In the space between
Lord, help me fight
This desire for fire
Words can cleanse and purify
Or tear down a pack of lies
In your presence, consequence
I can't stop trembling

For all of my virtue
Why can I not hold the truth?
For all my good fortune
I would change my place with you
This path will lead us back
Will lead us back to ruin
For all of my virtue
Why can I not hold the truth?

This path will lead us back
Will lead us back to ruin
For all of my virtue
Why can I not hold the truth?

Once in a while
The urge resurfaces
So we split hairs
As rumours circulate
And there's a need to fertilise
Behind my lover's trusting eye
Like water drops on burning warts
I can't stop trembling

For all of my virtue
Why can I not hold the truth?
For all my good fortune
I would change my place with you
This path will lead us back
Will lead us back to ruin
For all of my virtue
Why can I not hold the truth?

I've fallen
I've fallen again
I've fallen
I've fallen again
I've fallen
I've fallen again
I've fallen
