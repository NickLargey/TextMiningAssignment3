Well you got that girl and she lives with you
And she does just want you want her to
And when I call you on the phone, she says you're not there
But I know you're home

You better tell that girl to shut up
Tell that girl I'm gonna beat her up
You better tell that girl, tell that girl, tell that girl

Well we used to be the best of friends
Now all that's gonna have to end
But there's just one thing that I can't see
That's she's got got you hanging up on me yeah 

You better tell that girl to shut up
Tell that girl I'm gonna beat her up
You better tell that girl, tell that girl, tell that girl

Well I'm better tonight and I'm awfully kind
It takes a lot for me to loose my mind
Don't you know that I don't care?
Maybe if I hit her, maybe if I pulled her hair
Oh oh yeah yeah yeah

Well, she likes to seem intellectual
And to be a musician she goes to school
And the way she acts is so uncool
I just can't stand her

You better tell that girl to shut up
Tell that girl I'm gonna beat her up
You better tell that girl tell that girl, tell that girl
