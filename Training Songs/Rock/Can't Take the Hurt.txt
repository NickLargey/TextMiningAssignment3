There's evil in your eyes
I can see the signs
Waiting for a chance to strike
What is it I have done?
You used to be such fun
Now all you do is kick and bite

Can't take the hurt any more
This love ain't worth fighting for
Can't take the hurt

Got malice on your mind
Gonna win this time
Feel you moving in for the kill
What happened to my world?
What happened to us girl?
Somehow I have lost the will

Can't take the hurt any more

This love ain't worth fighting for
Can't take the hurt any more
This isn't love, it's a war
I can't take it no more

Can't take the hurt any more
This love ain't worth fighting for
Can't take the hurt any more
This isn't love, it's a war
I can't take it no more
Can't take the hurt any more
This love ain't worth fighting for
Can't take the hurt any more
This isn't love, it's a war
I can't take it no more
