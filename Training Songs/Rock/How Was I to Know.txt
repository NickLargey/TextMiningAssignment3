Could it be that I'm demanding, could it hurt me later on?
I don't care I only have one life to live
I wanna take you in my arms so I can give
But I know that it won't be this way

Could it be that I'm too selfish, could it kill me later on?
I don't care I only have one life to live
I wanna take you in my arms so I can give
But I know that it won't be this way

I never thought how was I to know
That you would leave me now
I never thought that you would go

Could it be that I'm still hungry, hungry, could it hurt me later on?
I don't care I only have one life to live
I wanna take you in my arms so I can give
But I know that it won't be this way

I never thought how was I to know
That you would leave me now
I never thought that you would go

I don't care I only have one life to live
I want to take you in my arms so I can give you my heart
But I know that it won't be this way

I never though how was I to know
That you would leave me now
I never thought that you would go

I never thought that you would leave me this way
Hurt me this way, take me with you
I never thought
