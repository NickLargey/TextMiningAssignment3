Girl, I left the light on last night
But you didn't show
I tried to call till daylight
But you were never home, oh, no

Now you're knocking at my door
Saying it ain't what it seems
You tell me things I want to hear
Things I can't believe

Everything you do
Everywhere you go
My eyes see through

All this trash, you're talking
Got you hanging on the noose
And you still believe that I
Won't turn my back on you

You just keep forgetting
To remember all your lies
If you think, I still need you
You got amnesia

Took you to the red roulette
Where they all knew your name
I lost you for an hour, girl
And it's driving me insane

You're spinning me in circles
Trying to make a fool of me
And I usually ain't suspicious
But I'm not too blind to see

Everything you do
Everywhere you go
My eyes see through

All this trash, you're talking
Got you hanging on the noose
And you still believe that I
Won't turn my back on you

You just keep forgetting
To remember all your lies
If you think, I still need you
You got amnesia

All this trash, you're talking
Got you hanging on the noose
And you still believe that I
Won't turn my back on you

You just keep forgetting
To remember all your lies
If you think, I still need you
You got amnesia
