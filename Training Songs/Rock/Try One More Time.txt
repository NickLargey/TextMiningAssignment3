My glass is empty, but innocently
Just sittin here thinkin how much you mean to me
Thought about leavin, but you know you're one of a kind
And even though we tried it all
I'd like to try it more time..

Said tonight at the party, you wore your finest dress
You walked around in style lookin so much finer than the rest
And when you walked up to me, Lord
You know I was so proud
And even though we tried it all
I'd like to try it more time..
