I'd like to tell ya,
Like to tell ya
Tell ya everything
Cause nothing changes,
Ever changes
Doesn't seem the same these days
Dave's been a mess
Since Cheryl left
Just sits at home
And beats back death
And Beth still wears
His stupid dress

There goes Joe Caparo again
With Darren's girlfriend
They're asking where ya been
Like I know
Where ya been
Hey Summer,
Where ya been?

I tried to tell ya,
Tried to tell ya
Took a little bit too long
And now your phone is
Disconnected
And your shit's out
On the lawn
The Hardback Cafe closed down
Now we got Office Town
You shoulda stuck around,
('cause...)

There go Ross and Frank again
They're holding hands
Asking where ya been
Like I know
Where ya been
Hey Summer,
Where ya been?

I could take a train
Or fly away
Maybe write a book
And change my name
I could settle down

(ah.)
(yeah.)
(hell yeah.)

There goes Joe Caparo again
Hey!
That's Darren's girlfriend!
Ross and Frank are holding hands
They been asking where ya been
Hey Summer,
Where ya been?

And I
Could smoke a bowl with Caleb
Or fly away
Or settle down, but
Hey
Hey Summer,
Where ya been?

(oh yeah)
