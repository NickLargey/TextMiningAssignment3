Not since 1958
When Brazil would make our hearts break
But now that France has arrived
It feels so good to be alive
Lets not forget Gary Speed
He wore his heart upon his sleeve
And if he is looking down
Then our love is all around
So Come on Ramsey
Lets set the world alight
When Gareth Bale plays
We can beat any side
So come on Wales
So come on Wales
With Ashley Williams
We can win any fight
Joe Jordan won with his hand
Russia was Giggsy's last chance
Paul Bodin's penalty miss
That 85 night was so tragic
But now the past is all gone
The future is ours to be won
You're just too good to be true
We can't take our eyes off you
So Come on Ramsey
Lets set the world alight
When Gareth Bale plays
We can beat any side
So come on Wales
So come on Wales
With Ashley Williams
We can win any fight
Chrissy Coleman, Gunter, Chester
Hennessey, Allen, King and Collins
Davis, Ledley, Taylor, Richards
Hal Robson Kanu
So Come on Ramsey
Lets set the world alight
When Gareth Bale plays
We can beat any side
So come on Wales
So come on Wales
Together Stronger
We'll win if we unite
