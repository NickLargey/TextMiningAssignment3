I want tomorrow today
I didn't think that I'd
Have yesterdays all week on someone else's time

Yeah, I like that car
Suppose the color's OK
Fibre glass and rust are filling in my day

I want to see the sunrise in the night time
I'm gonna fake, an alibi

[Chorus]
Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)
Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)

Repossess my heart
I gave it away
A loan is all
But nothing lasts forever these days

Got a stereo, 100 watts a side
Its matt black face is laughing at my life

I wanna see the starlight, in the day time
I'm gonna fake, an alibi

[Chorus]

I want to see the sunrise in the night time
I'm gonna fake, an alibi

[Chorus: x2]
