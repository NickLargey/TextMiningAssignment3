The hospital is dark at times
It's been a hard week on my mind and inside
It's warmer this year
Still cold in this town
The sound of ghosts is in the air
I've never heard more than one siren out there

But now we all see how much is hollow
Can you save yourself now?
Since nobody else knows how
So I will wash my hands again
Slowly reminds me what I am
I was waiting for you to come down
Down like the blood goes down the drain
I was waiting for you

And I feel sick
I guess it won't wash away
And I feel sick
I guess it won't wash away

Try to keep my soul inside of me
A stabbing victim tells a different story
The body's a shell
A mess to be cleaned
Am I still alive now that I don't feel so down?
Am I still alive now that I don't feel so down?

And I feel sick
I guess it won't wash away
And I feel sick
I guess it won't wash away

Now is the time for us to remember the lies we said
And if you don't mind, well, please don't mind my head
Shot down, kept down, but you'll never learn
How did you survive your swollen eyes?
