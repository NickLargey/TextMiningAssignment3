Tell me again why I should give a damn
Tell me again why I should even care
I gave you everything I had and I swear
There's nothing left here to, but

All the anger you left behind
All the hatred I feel inside
For in the aftermath of the love that died (love that died)
Keep digging your grave (grave), keep digging your grave

Take your broken promises, and don't come back again
It's time to say goodbye, I'm gonna leave you where you lie
Take your broken promises, every one you ever said
It's time to say goodbye, I gonna leave you where you lie, lie
I'm gonna leave you where you lie

Dead and gone, just a memory
There's nothing left here for you to see
The ashes fall, burn it all down
Until there's nothing left around, but

All the anger you left behind
All the hatred I feel inside
For in the aftermath of the love that died (love that died)
Keep digging your grave (grave), keep digging your grave

Take your broken promises, and don't come back again
It's time to say goodbye, I gonna leave you where you lie
Take your broken promises, every one you ever said
It's time to say goodbye, I gonna leave you where you

Lie through my face, you're nothing but a lie
Lie through my face, you're nothing but a lie

Keep digging your grave, keep digging your grave

Take your broken promises, and don't come back again
It's time to say goodbye, I gonna leave you where you lie
Take your broken promises, every one you ever said
It's time to say goodbye, I gonna leave you where you lie, lie
I gonna leave you where you lie, lie
I gonna leave you where you lie, lie
I gonna leave you where you lie, lie
I gonna leave you where you lie
