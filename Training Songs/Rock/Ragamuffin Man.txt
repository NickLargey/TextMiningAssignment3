Born and raised as a rich man's son
You were always the restless one
Living high only made you low
So you packed up and hit the road

[Chorus:]
Hey, it's the Ragamuffin Man
Life was so grand, you used to stand
Holdin' your head up high
Look at you now, I wonder how
You can be satisfied

Stowed a ride on a westbound train
Called yourself by another name
Spent your nights in a mission home
Cast away the life that you'd known

[Chorus]

As you rise in the mornin' rain
Take a look down that road again
Does the thought ever grab your mind
For the life that you've left behind?

[Chorus]

Hey, it's the Ragamuffin Man
Ahhhhh, la la la la la la la
Hey, it's the Ragamuffin Man
