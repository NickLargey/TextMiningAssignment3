Why you so worried all the time?
It's like your head is upside down
You're like a goldfish in a bowl
But still your life goes on and on

It's like I'm running
Always running 'round
Yeah always running
Always running 'round

I was never reckless like them kids
Because my mind was never still
It's like an ocean running wild
Yeah always drifting from side to side

It's like I'm running
Always running 'round
Yeah always running
Always running 'round
Always running 'round

I'm always running
Always running
Yeah always running
Always running
