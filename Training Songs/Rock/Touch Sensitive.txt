Hey Hey Hey 
Hey Hey Hey 
I know, I know, I know 

In the cars or on the street
If you smile you are a creep
If you don't say it's very cold
You are drunk or too old

They say what about the meek?
I say they've got a bloody cheek
Vanity and presumption 

Living in the hard porn shop lately
I say Hey hey hey
Touch Sensitive

I know, I know, I know 
And you're dying for a pee
So you go behind a tree
And a Star Wars police vehicle pulls up
I say gimme a taxi

Touch Sensitive
Touch Sensitive

If you don't say it's very cold
You are drunk or too old
It's Touch Sensitive

In the cars or on the street
If you smile you are a creep
It's Touch Sensitive

If you don't say it's very cold
You are Touch Sensitive

Touch Sensitive
Say Hey Hey Hey

I know, I know, I know
