I've watched the way you store into the night
There's plenty out there and you need to see it all
There's something in you that doesn't like daylight
You'd better close your eyes and wait until you're called

What's it gonna be tonight?
What do ya wanna do?
So what's it gonna be tonight?
Whatcha gonna do?

What's it gonna be tonight?
What do ya wanna do?
So what's it gonna be tonight?

That's a most outstanding stamina you've got
And you push it 'til you get all that you came for
It doesn't seem to work until it's night for you
You're just sitting there all day until they call

What's it gonna be tonight?
What do ya wanna do?
So what's it gonna be tonight?
Whatcha gonna do?

What's it gonna be tonight?
What do ya wanna do?
So what's it gonna be tonight?
Whatcha gonna do?

Don't things look better in the night?
Don't things look better in the night?
Don't things look better in the night to you?

Don't things look better in the night to you?
Don't things look better in the night to you?
Don't things look better in the night to you?
