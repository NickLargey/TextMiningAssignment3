Yeah!
Line up!
Step right this way to see the last dollar on earth
Sign up!
The bus leaves today to see the last dollar on earth
Behold the wonder of the modern age
Displayed resplendent in its gilded cage
There's not another in the world today
And you just can't take it with you
All night!
There's a special tonight about the last dollar on earth
That's right!
And all the pundits were right about the last dollar on earth
It's always occupied a special space
We keep a guard around it just in case
Many have died to have its fleeting grace
But you just can't take it with you
Get set!
Only one pint of blood
To see the last dollar on earth
No sweat!
Only one ounce of flesh to touch the last dollar on earth
When we lose exposure in its permanent enclosure
Then you can be sure that we'll take it on tour
So when it comes to call at your local shopping mall
Though the crowds may be large
You can put it on your master charge
