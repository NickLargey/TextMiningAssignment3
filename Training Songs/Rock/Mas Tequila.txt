Mas Tequila 
All right now, here we go ... 
 Now we're gonna tell you a little story 
  About the way we like to party - take ya on a trip! 
HIT IT! 
That's right 
I'm goin' way down south where the big blue agave grow, 
Takin' a weekend trip down to Baja, Mexico! 
Where you can drink the water, but don't ya eat the ice, 
Take your vitamin "T" with salt 'n lemon slice ... 
I say, 
 One shot...Hey!  Mas Tequila- 
 Two shots...Hey! que veneno- 
 Three shots...Arriba!  Mas Tequila! 
 Hey! Hey! 
She did a mean macarena to the funky cold medina 
Behind a body shot and three margaritas. 
She'll drink it straight from the bottle, terra cotta jug, 
From a boda bag coppin' a major buzz. 
I say, 
 One shot...Hey!  Mas Tequila- 
 Two shots...Hey! que veneno- 
 Three shots...Arriba!  Mas Tequila! 
 Hey! Hey! 
Uno mas, bartender...one more...mas tequila! 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! 
Yo can drink the water, but don't ya eat the ice; 
Take your vitamin "T" with salt 'n lemon slice! 
I say, 
 One shot...Hey!  Mas Tequila- 
 Two shots...Hey! que veneno- 
 Three shots...Arriba!  Mas Tequila! 
 Hey! Hey! 
 One shot...Hey! more tequila! 
 Two shots...Hey! que veneno! 
 Three shots...Ay yi yi yi yi ... 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 Mas Tequila! 
No mas, no mas ....
