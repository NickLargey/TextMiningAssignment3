Here's the hope six demolition project
Stretching down to Benning Road
A well-known "pathway of death"
At least that's what I'm told
And here's the one sit-down restaurant
In Ward seven, nice
Okay, now this is just Drug-Town, just zombies
But that's just life

In the community of hope
The community of hope
The community of hope
The community of hope, hope, hope, hope

Here's the highway to death and destruction
South capitol is its name
And the school just looks like shit-hole
Does that look like a nice place?
Here's the old mental institution
Now the homeland security base
And here's god's deliverance center
A deli called M.L.K

And the community of hope
The community of hope
The community of hope
The community of hope, hope, hope, hope

They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
