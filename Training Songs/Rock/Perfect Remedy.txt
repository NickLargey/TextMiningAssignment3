I thought that you would leave my memory
I didn't think you'd stay in mind, I didn't think at all
At least I thought that with some misery
I'd find a way to have it all and with or without you

But it's all right, this or anyway
It's all right, which any other way
Any night or any other day
It's all right, put it another way

You do like, you do when, you do what, you do like I do
The day out, the day in you're only trying to fight for control

You thought you had the perfect remedy
A perfect remedy for me, a remedy for all
You say at last you tried so pleasantly
To find a way to have it all or have a drink on me

But it's all right, this or anyway
It's all right, which any other way
Any night or any other day
It's all right, put it another way

You do like, you do when, you do what, you do like I do
The day out, the day in you're only trying to fight for control

I guess it's just a faded memory
That comes along with certainty
Then goes and fades away

But it's all right, this or anyway
It's all right, which any other way
Any night or any other day
It's all right
