He's got the dirtiest shoes that I ever seen; 
Chew on a blunt wipe his butt with a magazine; 
Smokin' his crack wash it down with gasoline; 
Still he push the button, 
E.F. Hutton when he speaks to me; 
Oh you know he told me "Shake it, don't break it; 
It took too damn long to make it"
 
[Chorus]
Leroy is my mojo man; 
Leroy is my mojo man, 
He come he take me by the hand; 
'Cause Leroy is my mojo man tonight, alright!
 
He's just a pimp with a limp and some Vaseline; 
He told me to "Look, over there!" and stole my nectarine; 
Said, "Don't turn your back on me black, I'm a sex machine" 
Still he push the button E.F. Hutton when he speaks to me; 
Oh you know he told me, 
"Shake it, don't break it; It took too damn long to make"
 
[Chorus]
 
Oh you know he told me, 
"Shake it, don't break it, it took too damn long to make it"
