There's been a riot down on mainstreet tonight
They just went crazy set this whole damn town alight

Chorus
Whisky to water, turn water to wine
Run for your life run for your life
There's been a riot

The boy was running he had nowhere left to hide
They cut him down to the ground
Still they didn't find the knife
They say it's murder-murder in the first degree
They have no suspect, now those hound dogs follow me

Chorus
Whisky to water-turn water to wine
Run for your life run for your life
There's been a riot-nowhere to run
There's been a riot-nowhere to hide

They've got an innocent boy for an innocent crime
They cut him down to the ground when he
Didn't have nowhere to hide
You gotta fight to survive-run for your life

No way did I commit this crime
No way am I about to die
No way can I forgive myself
For the things I've never done
There's no way you're gonna make me pay
No way I'm coming back today
No way you're gonna bring me back alive
There's been a riot they say it's murder
There's been a riot
He's just an innocent boy for an innocent crime
There's been a riot no way you'll get me
To come back alive
