Love is but a song we sing
Fears the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or make the angels cry
Though the dove is on the wing
And you need not know why

Come on people let's smile on your brother hey
Let's get together and love one another now
Come on people let's love one another right now

Some will come and some will go
And we must surely pass
When the one who left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moment's sunlight
Fading on the grass

Come on people let's smile on your brother hey
Let's get together and love one another now
Come on people and love one another hey
Let's get together and love one another now
Come on people let's love one another right now

If you hear the song I sing
Then you must understand
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
One key unlocks them both you know
And it's at your command

Come on people let's smile on your brother hey
Let's get together and love one another now
Come on people let's love one another hey
Let's get together and love one another now
Come on people let's love one another hey
Let's get together and love another now
Come on people let's love one another hey
Let's get together and love one another now
