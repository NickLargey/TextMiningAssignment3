Outside in a winter world sits a woman all alone
It's not the air that seems so cold, it's the love she's never known
Outside in a winter world one lonely child roams
Will ever loving arms unfold to give this soul a home
So they're living on hopes and they're living on dreams
While the devil is pushing them to extremes
Can their spirits be strong, when for loving they long
For the day will come when they must move on
Where angels fear to walk, there you must walk, where angels fear

Outside in a winter world there's a man who's lost his love
So many secrets left untold should he turn and look above
Outside in a winter world one old man sits alone
He thinks of all the years gone by and what little love he's known
So they're living on hopes and they're living on dreams
While the devil is pushing them to extremes
Can their spirits be strong, when for loving they long
For the day will come when they must move on
Where angels fear to walk, there you must walk, where angels fear
There you must love, where angels fear (to love)
We all have troubles in our life that we must face
We're merely players in this game we call the human race, the human race
Where angels fear to walk, there you must walk, where angels fear
There you must love, where angels fear (to love)
