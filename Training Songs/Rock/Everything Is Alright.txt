Tell me that you're alright,
That everything is alright.
Please tell me that you're alright,
That everything is alright.

Give me a reason to end this discussion,
To break with tradition, to fall and divide.
Because I hate the ocean, theme parks and airplanes,
Talking with strangers, waiting in line..
I'm through with these pills that make me sit still.
"Are you feeling fine?"
Yes, I'm feeling fine.

Tell me that you're alright,
That everything is alright.
Please tell me that you're alright,
That everything is alright.

I'm sick of the things I do when I'm nervous
Like cleaning the oven or checking my tires
Or counting the number of tiles in the ceiling..
Head for the hills, the kitchen's on fire!

I used to rely on self-medication,
I guess I still do that from time to time.
But I'm getting better at fighting the future,
"Someday you'll be fine.."
Yes, I'll be just fine.

Tell me that you're alright,
That everything is alright.
Please tell me that you're alright,
That everything is alright.

Give me a reason to end this discussion
To break with tradition, to fall and divide,
So let's not get carried away
With the process of healing relations
I don't want to waste your time.

Tell me that you're alright,
That everything is alright.
Please tell me that you're alright,
That everything is alright.

Everything's fine.
