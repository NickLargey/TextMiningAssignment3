Well I don't tell jokes
And I don't take notes
You been sayin'
There ain't much hope

You got nothin' on me
I got friends uptown
And they don't talk down
They be keepin' me safe and sound

We got somethin' to be
So in case you hadn't noticed
I'm alright
Not like it was before

Things used to be so hopeless
But not tonight
Tonight I'm walkin' out that door
I'm not gonna cry

When wavin' goodbye
And I know this time
You got nothin' on me
Well it ain't that tough

Just more of the usual stuff
One heartache is more than enough
There ain't nothing to see
Nothing

I got friends uptown
And they still come 'round
They be keepin' me safe and sound
We got somethin' to be

So don't you try to save me
With your advice
Or turn me into something else
Cause I'm not crazy

And you're not nice
Baby if you do
Keep it to yourself
I'm not gonna cry

And I'm wavin' goodbye
And I know this time
You got nothin' on me.
(No nothin' on me)
