Take a ride on a riverboat
Gonna leave and that's all she wrote
Paddle wheel down to New Orleans
Gonna find me a brand new queen

In the spring when the leaves turn green
And a fever grip's your soul
Magnolia hits the air
Gonna make you lose control
You get weak down in your knees
And your heart just slips away

Delta nights are deadly
Delta women too
I'm gonna tell you by my witness
Oh, it's true

Take a ride on a riverboat
Gonna leave and that's all she wrote
Paddle wheel down to New Orleans
Gonna find me a brand new queen

When the eyes of a Cajun woman
Hit you like a storm
A hurricane ain't never blown
That could do a boy more harm
It's easy come and easy go
And like a fool you'll learn

Delta nights are deadly
Delta women too
I'm gonna tell you by my witness
Yeah, yeah, it's true

Take a ride on a riverboat
Gonna leave and that's all she wrote
Paddle wheel down to New Orleans
Gonna find me a brand new queen
