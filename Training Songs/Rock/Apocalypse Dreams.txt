This could be the day that we push through
It could be the day that all our dreams come true
For me and you
'Til we're at the end of just another day

Are you too terrified to try your best?
Just to end up with an educated guess
Like success
Like those times you wake up mystified

Oh it feels so real in my sleep
Never felt so good, so close I do with you
Into the day, the strangest feeling
Do you really live without the fear?

Everything is changing
And there’s nothing I can do
My world is turning pages
While I am just sitting here

Well, am I getting closer?
Will I ever get there?
Does it even matter?
Do I really need it?
Wish that I'd remember
And I'm on the outcome

Push it out the window
On and on we all go
Into another morning
It was only yesterday
Didn’t even know you
Now I’m gonna miss you

Nothing ever changes
No matter how long you do your hair
Looks the same to everyone else
Everything is changing
I guess I should warn my mum
But she’ll just be excited
