There's me and daddy out at Lunan Bay
Now looking dandy stepping out Saturday
I can still see the buses
Lined up to take the dancing home

That's me on the stairs suitcase in hand
Kidding on but knowing that one day he planned
To leave all that behind
And see what the big smoke's saying

These are just some photographs talking
Make it look easy
To imagine just walking
Back into someone's arms
And feeling
Homesick
Homesick
Homesick

Maybe you have a question too
You recognise a face in unfamiliar shoes
You don't see a man just someone broken down
Standing in front of you

This could be just a photograph talking
I make it look easy
To get up and start walking
Back out of these arms
And feeling
Homesick
Homesick
Homesick

I'm just
Homesick
Homesick
Homesick
