I got Elvis on my elbow
When I flex, Elvis talks
I got hula girls on the back of my leg
And she hulas when I walk.

Screeching cherry red,
Screaming 'lectric green
Purple mountain's majesty
C'mon, talk to me! Talk to me babe!

Swap meet Sally
Tramp Stamp Tat
Mouse-wife to Mom-shell in the
time it took to get that new tattoo,
Tattoo tattoo

tattoo tattoo
Show me your dragon magic!
tattoo tattoo
So auto-bio-graphic.

Best believe that needle hurt you.
Best to see these true colors
Than follow one of your false virtues.

A little secret to make you think:
Why is the crazy stuff we never say
poetry in ink?

Smokin' day-glow red;
Explodo pink!
Purple mountains majesty -
Show me you? I'll show you me.

It got a hold of me.

Put a spell on me

Uncle Danny had a coal tattoo.
He fought for the union,
Some of us still do.

On my shoulder is the number
of the chapter he was in
That number is forever like
the struggle here to win.

Everybody!
