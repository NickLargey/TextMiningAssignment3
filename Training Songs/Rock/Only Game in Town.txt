I'd walk those streets
I'd walk those streets alone
And though it was a long way
A long way from home
I didn't know many faces
Some they look like stone
Some hungry jackals
Ragged to the bone
I'd go on believing
It was only a state of mind
Then my love would appear
She would shatter my bitter mind

The only game in town
You are the only game

I would look forward
To the times I love the best
Now I treat each moment
As if it was my last
You can't lock your love away
Or hide your heart like a fool
You've got to always be afraid
Of letting the pistons cool

The only game in town
You are the only game
The only game in town
You are the only game

I wrote you a letter
Now I've come around
I hope you feel better
Didn't mean to bring you down
Because there is no hidden treasure
There is no pot of gold
There is no rags to riches
Only the rugged soul

The only game in town
You are the only game
The only game in town
You are the only game.

The only game in town
The only game in town
