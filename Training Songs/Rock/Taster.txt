Put out the word we need a new taster 
There's one king left and so much food to eat 
The interception by the last one was absolute professionalism 
If he's laying there saying he's sorry 

Tell him it's okay we learn this way 
Taster you're the automatic saint 
Taster you're the automatic one 
Rival sabotage a bad pot of duck stew 

With just one breath left he warned the dinner crew 
Selfless line of work the word that comes 
To mind with me is selflessness 
If he's laying down saying he's sorry 

Tell him it's okay we learn this way 
Taster you're the automatic saint 
Taster you're the automatic one
