Pre>intro a e d
A e a
It worked much better in a fantasy
D a e
Imagination's one thing that comes easy to me
A e a
Cause this is nothing else if not unreal
D a e
When I pretend to touch you, you pretend to feel

Chorus
F#m d e a d e
Passion is no ordinary word, passion is no ordinary word
F#m d c#m d
Passion is no ordinary word, ain't manufactured or just another sound
Bm e a e d
That you hear at night at night

Ain't got no idols for the screen today
Although they make a lot of noises they got nothing to say
I try to look amazed but it's an act
The movie might be new but it's the same soundtrack (repeat chorus)

Bridge
E a
Say how it feels real useless ain't it
E d e
Wait until it bites right down inside you
A e d e
The world is easy when you're just playing around with it
A e a e
Everything's a thrill and every girl's a kill
A e d e
And then it gets unreal and then you don't feel anything
A d e a d e a d e
You don't feel anything you don't feel anything

A d e a d e d (solo)

An object of desire you don't desire to be
I bet the shop window dummies give in just as easily
I try to stop but have to make you drop down to the floor
Moaning in the darkness as we fake some more

Repeat chorus twice

Just another sound that you hear at night
Ain't just another sound (repeat and fade on d chord) /pre>
