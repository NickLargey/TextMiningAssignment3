Another wishing stone to throw 

You try to protect me 
But just let me go 
And if you throw it out again 
You'll see my reflection come floating back in 

And I'm walking faster 
And losing my breath 
But it takes me farther than here 

Another stormy day I know 
The clouds turn to dust 
And the water to snow another messenger is dead 
He falls with an arrow in his heart instead 

And I'm walking faster 
And losing my breath 
But it takes me farther than here 

I'm falling over 
And wasting my time 
But it takes me farther than here 

Another messenger is dead 

And I'm walking faster 
Losing my breath 
But it takes me farther than here 

And I'm falling over 
And wasting my time 
But it takes me farther than here
