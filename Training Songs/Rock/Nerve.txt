There's a lot of nothing in the words, I know
But I keep on talking cause it feels like home.
It feels alright to be growing old,
But growing old is just letting go.
And it's just the reason I needed to leave this place,
I took to home, wanted to run away.
I had a different image on my mind,
This is the change that happens all the time.

And it comes as no surprise, it's like, oh
And I just don't know what you're doing wrong, yeah.
Wrong, wrong, man, you've got a lot of nerve.
And I just don't know what you're doing wrong, yeah.
Wrong, wrong, man, you've got a lot of nerve.

How come all my vices always breathe relief,
But a sip of gin saves an hour of speech
And yeah, it's fickle and it feels so cheap,
But I can rest and I can feel at ease.
Yes, my friends don't know, they're happy just listenin'
I'm at a loss cause I'm livin' it
It's not to say that I'm givin' in,
It's just that this is how it's always been

And it comes as no surprise, it's like, oh
And I just don't know what you're doing wrong, yeah.
Wrong, wrong, man, you've got a lot of nerve.
And I just don't know what you're doing wrong, yeah.
Wrong, wrong, man, you've got a lot of nerve.

I can't melt all of my worries in nothing, no
And I, I, I would.
And I keep trying but I always get let down, somehow
Man, you've got a lot of nerve.
