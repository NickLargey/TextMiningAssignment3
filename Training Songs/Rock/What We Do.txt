Don't do what I do, just do what I say!
"My door does what I say - I say 'open' and it does!"
"My lights do what I say - I say 'on' and they snap on!"
"My car does what I say - I say 'start' and it jumps out!"
"But my dog doesn't do what I say."
"My girl doesn't do what I say."
"My mind doesn't do what I say."
"I don't know what to do!"

What we do, is what we do
