You say your misunderstood I say you give it real good now you work your
Way back you're crawling
You say you've always been there I say I don't understand you say your
Back for good your crawling
But your time now is gone you try to hang on try to stay on your feet but
Now your crawling, crawling to me crawling, crawling crawling, crawling
Back to me crawling, crawling
Is this what you want take it right back to the start when you fall on
Your face your crawling
Try it all on your own give it all that you know but when you come up
Short your crawling
But your time now is gone you try to hang on try to stay on your feet but
Now your crawling, crawling to me crawling, crawling crawling, crawling
Back to me crawling, crawling
How you want all of my time I see what you are like enter into my life
Crawling
You know no words to say you always like to play when on your hands and
Knees your crawling
But your time now is gone you try to hang on try to stay on your feet but
Now your crawling, crawling to me crawling, crawling crawling, crawling
Back to me crawling, crawling
