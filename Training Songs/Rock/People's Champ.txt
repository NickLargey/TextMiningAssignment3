You've got no vision for the long run
You've got no sense of history
You've got the world at your fingertips
And now you have it crumblin'

But if you look back far enough
And find the place you started
Before you held a grudge
Or the highest office
You do nothing every year
But you're showin' up on the red carpet

I'm looking for the people's champ
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
I'm looking for the people's champ
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
I'm looking for the people's champ
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
I'm looking for the people's champ
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
And it ain't you

I said, "Give it to me straight!"
(Things are crooked)
I said, "Who's sticking around?"
(For all the heavy lifting?)
You ain't no Robin Hood (no)
Never been in this neighbourhood (no)
Thought you said this would be easy

But I can smell it on ya
You're some aristocrat
I said, "It takes a village"
And you can't handle that
Well I already know
How the history books will react

I'm looking for the people's champ
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
I'm looking for the people's champ
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
I'm looking for the people's champ
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
I'm looking for the people's champ
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
And it ain't you

All my girls say
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh
All my dudes go
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh

Now here's the official statement
We're street fighting on the pavement
I'm going dancing like I'm raving
There's no service in the basement
Now I don't mean to sound impatient
But I've seen the flag you're waving
And I can see through all this fake shit
This highest office's sitting vacant

But if you look back far enough
And find the place you started
I promise you no charlatan
Has ever died a martyr
You do nothing every year
But showing up on the red carpet

I'm looking for the people's champ
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
I'm looking for the people's champ
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
I'm looking for the people's champ
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
I'm looking for the people's champ
(I'm looking for the people's champ)

I'm looking for the people's champ (o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh)
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
I'm looking for the people's champ (o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh)
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
I'm looking for the people's champ (o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh) 
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
I'm looking for the people's champ (o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh)
(I'm looking for the people's champ)
And it ain't you
