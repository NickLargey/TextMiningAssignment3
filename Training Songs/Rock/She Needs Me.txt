When my days are rolling stones
When my memories ring like telephones
And I'll have somewhere I can go
I'll have comfort, this one thing I know

You pull another blanket round me
Yeah you, pull another blanket round me

This is where I want to be
This is where I want to be
She needs me
She needs me
She needs me
And it's okay

Silver thunder, turquoise stream
Leaves of amber, fields of emerald green
You sketch all those shades on me
I am yours, you can do what you like with me

Yeah you, pull another blanket round me
Yeah you, you pull another blanket round me

'Cause this is where I want to be
This is where I want to be
She needs me
She needs me
She needs me
And it's okay

This is where I want to be
This is where I want to be

I am yours, you can do what you like with me
I am yours, you can do what you like with me
I am yours, you can do what you like with me, with me

Faster than the setting sun
We'll run away
