We are the sons and daughters of a revolution, 
Revolutionaries walking us out of oppression 
And into a no-low promise land.

And this is leaves us with a great sense of sadness 
Dwelling inside our soul. 
No one can explain where it's coming from 
Or where its taking us. 

We just know that something is lost, 
But somehow we are lost, lost

And this my friend, is the great depression
