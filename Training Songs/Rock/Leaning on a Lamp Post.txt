I'm leaning on the lamp
Maybe you think I look a tramp
Or maybe you think I'm round to steal a car
But no, I'm not a crook
And if you think that's what I look
I'll tell you why and what my motives are

I'm leaning on the lamp post at the corner of the street
In case a certain little lady comes by
Oh me, oh my
I hope the little lady comes by

She's absolutely wonderful and marvelous and beautiful  
And anyone can understand why
I'm leaning on the lamp post at the corner of the street
In case a certain little lady comes by

She doesn't always get away she cannot always get away
But anyway I know that she'll try
Oh me, oh my
I hope that little lady comes by

This girl, oh, the girl I would wait for
This girl, I'd break any date for
I won't have to ask what she's late for
She'd never leave me flat she's not a girl like that

She's absolutely wonderful and marvelous and beautiful  
And anyone can understand why
I'm leaning on the lamp post at the corner of the street
In case a certain little lady comes by

I'm leaning on the lamp post at the corner of the street

I hope the little lady comes by
