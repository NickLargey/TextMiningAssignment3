He's just a stereotype 
He drinks his age in pints 
He has girls every night 
But he doesn't really exist 

He spends his weekends with a load of blokes 
He forgets the punchline when he tells a joke 
He wants to stay out, he don't want to go home 
'Til his nicotine fingers are stuffed down his throat 

He's just a stereotype 
He drinks his age in pints 
He drives home pissed at night 
And he listens to his stereo 

He blamed his fiancÃ©e when he caught VD 
The doctor said no drink for seventeen weeks 
He wants to go out but he has to stay home 
Sit in and watch colour TV on his own 

He's just a stereotype 
He drinks his age in pints 
He drives home pissed at night 
And he listens to his stereo 

The tablets are finished, the cure is complete 
He hasn't had a drink now for seventeen weeks 
Seventeen pints, tonight is the night 
It goes straight to his head, he ends up in a fight 

Police chase him home through the dark rainy night 
Fluorescent jam sandwich with flashing blue light 
His mums waiting up, she hopes he's alright 
But he's wrapped round a lamp post on Saturday night 

He's just a stereotype 
He drinks his age in pints 
He has girls every night 
He doesn't really exist
