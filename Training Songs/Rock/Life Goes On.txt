You get a thunderbolt from out of the blue
And it changes everything about the life you knew
Yes the storm breaks and your heart aches
And then life goes on
When a long time love just disappears
You need someone new to help you through those impatient years
And those sad days, all those mad days
While your life goes on

You know it's over but you can't let go
It's not easy when it comes to saying all those last goodbyes
In that moment when your dreams lie scattered in the dust
You find something you can trust
Love comes to meet you like a brand new day
Love comes to you all along the way
You're walking down the street but you're lost in space
And the future comes to meet you and you like its face

From a blue note comes a new note
And your life goes on
You don't need miracles to point the way
When you know that love is still the reason to believe
In that moment when you know you might have given up
Someone fills your lovin' cup
And lies beside you 'til the break of day
Love comes to you all along the way

A million stars shine in the darkest night
From across the universe there comes eternal light
From this blue world to a new world
Somewhere life goes on
Life goes on
Life goes on
