Since you've been gone I feel so much better
Cause I saw how mean you could be
I used to want some explanation
Now all I want is my Patsy Cline CD

How I've waited for today
When I could finally say

[Chorus]
You jerk
You jerk
You are such a jerk
There are other words
But they just don't work

Sometimes I wish I'd mailed you that letter
That said the things I dare not say
Instead I set the thing on fire
I had to say this out loud anyway

I'm so glad I found the nerve
To say what you deserve

[Chorus]

They try to be so cool
Insult you like a fool
Never take your call when you're nobody at all
Until you're somebody
And then they want to be your friend
How comes jerks don't know they're jerks
(I don't know)

So next time someone makes you feel little
Just sing this song inside you head
And like a great big cartoon bubble
These lovely words will dance above their head

How I've waited for today
When I could finally say

[Chorus]
