All roads lead the same direction
We all see eye to eye
Won't stand for a bad connection
We came to keep things tight

Prove this, prove that
Proving is nothing
Let's all just be ourselves
Focused with the right aggression

Turn to each other for help
People merge on state of mind from all
Different walks of life
Don't need any more stupid division
Don't need to feel uptight

Brother - I'll always look out for you
If I feel it back
Sister - we'll brave the outside world
Off the beaten track
When it's us vs. them
You can always count on me When it's us vs. them
It's a global unity

Open the extended family
The family is growing fast
Friendship will transcend the borders
The world is shrinking fast

Cities merge on state of mind
There's nothing wrong with that
Don't need any more stupid division
Don't fall for their trap

Brother - I'll always look out for you
If I feel it back
Sister - we'll brave the outside world
Off the beaten track
When it's us vs. them
You can always count on me When it's us vs. them
It's a global unity
