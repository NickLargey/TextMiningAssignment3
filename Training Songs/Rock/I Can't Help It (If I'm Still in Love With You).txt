Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side

And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealin'
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you

The-en suddenly I got that old-time feelin'
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (still in love with you)
(Today I passed you on the street)

Today I passed you on the street
(And my heart fell at your feet)

And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
(Somebody else stood by your side)

Somebody else stood by your side
(And he looked so satisfied)

And, ya know, he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Oh, it hurts to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold ya just the way I used to do
Oh-oh-oh-oh heaven only knows how much I miss, how much that I miss ya
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
(Still in love with you)
