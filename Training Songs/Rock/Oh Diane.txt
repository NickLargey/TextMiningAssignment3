Oh no
Here I go again
Fallin' in love again.
Love is like a grain of sand
Slowly slippin' through your hand.
Oh
Oh Diane
Oh
Oh Diane.
Will I love you
I will
Always.
Will you stand by me always?
'Cause love is like a grain of sand . . .
Talkin' 'bout Diane
Oh
Oh Diane.
Oh
Oh Diane
Oh
Oh Diane.
Talkin' 'bout Diane
Oh
Oh Diane.
