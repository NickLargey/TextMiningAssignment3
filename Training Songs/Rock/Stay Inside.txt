A suicide pact, a lit cigar
And a new way to sing along
In a dying culture that feeds on the blind
And waits for the lethal sickness

There's a boy out back with a gun to his chest
Like it's the only way to relieve stress
Then the culture dies and it leaves us blind
In the wake of our resistance

Boy, if you step outside
You'll never make it
The world could be a bitter place sometimes
It's better just stay inside

Boy, if you step outside
You'll never make it
The world could be a bitter place sometimes
It's better just stay inside

A case of hard facts and no one knows
Not a damn thing can be exposed
In this world of ours where we're living in hope
Despair is where we keep our wishes

Not alone or afraid, but afraid to recite
The words you hear and the wrongs you right
The world is ours but we're only in charge
Of our lives and how we live them

Boy, if you step outside
You'll never make it
The world could be a bitter place sometimes
It's better just stay inside

Boy, if you step outside
You'll never make it
The world could be a bitter place sometimes
It's better just stay inside

Today's abused
What is there for you
Just rise above the few
That lay in stone
Trying to obtain an idol to betray

Besides
There's so much on the line
Don't take a step back
Not one more step back

Boy, if you step outside
You'll never make it
The world could be a bitter place sometimes
It's better just stay inside

Boy, if you step outside
You'll never make it
The world could be a bitter place sometimes
It's better just stay inside

Boy, when you step outside
You gotta face it
The world could be a bitter place sometimes
But you're gonna be just fine, you're gonna be just fine

You're gonna be just fine
You're gonna be just fine
Boy, don't step outside
Boy, don't step outside
