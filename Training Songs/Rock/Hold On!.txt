Hold on, hold on
You've got a girl who really loves you
(you've got a girl who really cares)
She'll do anything you ask her to
Yet you treat her wrong
Oh you just string her along
Brother, if I were in your shoes

I would hold on, hold on, hold on tight
And make the whole world know she's mine
I would hold on, hold on, with all my might
A love like hers is very hard to find

She does her best to make you happy
(she always does her very best)
You do your best to make her blue
Buddy, you've got it made
But you'd rather go and play
I know one thing for sure, if I were you

I would hold on, hold on, hold on tight
And make the whole world know she's mine
I would hold on, hold on, with all my might
A love like hers is very hard to find

She's always there each time you need her
(each time you need her she is there)
She gives her love so willingly
But you just don't care
You know that she'll be there
How I wish she'd felt that way about me

I would hold on, hold on, hold on tight
And make the whole world know she's mine
I would hold on, hold on, with all my might
A love like hers is very hard to find

Hold on, hold on
