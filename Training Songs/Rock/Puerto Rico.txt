You say you want to take me down to Puerto Rico.
Crowded Puerto Rico.
Humid Puerto Rico.
You say you want to take me up to the mountains.

The boring mountains.
You say you want to take out to Las Vegas.
Viva, viva Las Vegas.

I heard it.
I did it.
I got the bill.
I lived it.
I paid it.
Paying still.

Compliments and promises can't fool me twice.
Spreading lies like that around isn't very nice.
You say I'm so fascinating like no one else you know.
No one else you know?

Your wife should know.
You say you want to put me on some tv show.
The johnny carson show?
Come on.

Let's go.
You say you want to buy me leather coats and cars.
Make me a star.
Take a trip to mars!

I did it.
I got it.
I got the jewel.
I made it.
I paid it.
And I'm no fool.

Compliments and promises can't fool me twice.
You're such a low-life schemer.
Beat it creep, dematerialize.
Beat it creep, dematerialize.
