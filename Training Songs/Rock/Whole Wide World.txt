When I was a young boy
My mama said to me
There's only one girl in the world for you
And she probably lives in Tahiti

I go the whole wide world
just to find her
I go the whole wide world
just to find her
(just to find her)
Yeah...

Well, maybe she's in the Bahamas
Where the Caribbean Sea is blue
Weeping in a tropical moonlit night
Because nobody's thought about you

Why am I hanging around in the rain out here?
Trying to pick up a girl
Why am my eyes filling up with these lonely tears?
When there are girls all over the world

I go the whole wide world
just to find her
I go the whole wide world
just to find her
(just to find her)

Ou est tu?

Well is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere
Underneath a tropical sun
Finding her way in a heat wave there
Hoping that I won't be long?

I should be lying on a sunset beach with her
Caressing her warm brown skin
And then in a year or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

I go the whole wide world
just to find her

Ou est tu?
Where are you?
I'm waiting
I'm weeping
I'm waiting
