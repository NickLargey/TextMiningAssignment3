I was having a drink
Down at the bar
I was worried 'bout my image
I can't wash my car
When a pretty little woman
Says "Hey there Joe,
Won't come along with me,
I'll take off your romeos."

She took off my romeos.
She took off my romeos.
Oh that pretty little woman,
She took off my romeos.

I lit up my pipe
We sat by the fire
It was there by the embers
I had no desire
To go back to the bar
And drink some Old Crow
I kept on my smoking jacket
She took of my romeos.

She took off my romeos.
She took off my romeos.
Oh that pretty little woman,
She took off my romeos.
