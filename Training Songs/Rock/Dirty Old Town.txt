I found my love by the gasworks croft
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
Kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town, dirty old town

Clouds a-driftin' across the moon
Cats and dogs prowlin' in their beat
Spring's a girl in the streets at night
Dirty old town, dirty old town
Dirty old town, dirty old town

Heard a siren from the docks
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the fall on the smokey wind
Dirty old town, dirty old town
Dirty old town, dirty old town

I'm gonna get myself a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
Gonna cut you down like a dead old tree
Dirty old town, dirty old town

I found my love by the gasworks croft
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
Kissed my girl by the factory wall
In this dirty old town, dirty old town
Dirty old town, dirty old town
Dirty old town, dirty old town
