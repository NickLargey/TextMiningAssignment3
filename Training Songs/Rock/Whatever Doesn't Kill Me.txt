Don't mistake the silences
There's so much I haven't said
It's not that quiet in my head
But I can't even tell you that

Whatever doesn't kill me
Doesn't make me stronger
But I'm not gonna give up yet
And if these walls should weaken
I'm still strong enough to know
I'm gonna build them up again

There's one more thing left to try
(And it just might work)
It scares me that you know why
(And I don't know what's worse)
Despite my only true desire
I just can't keep an open mind

Whatever doesn't kill me
Doesn't make me stronger
But I'm not gonna give up yet
And if these walls should weaken
I'm still strong enough to know
I'm gonna build them up again (now that I am strong enough to know)

I'm gonna build them up again (now that I am strong enough to know)
I'm gonna build them up again (strong enough to know)

There were walls and promises
And they've all broken down to bits
And it's exactly times like this
I found the words I should have said

Whatever doesn't kill me
Doesn't make me stronger
But I'm not gonna give up yet
And if these walls should weaken
I'm still strong enough to know
I'm gonna build them up again
