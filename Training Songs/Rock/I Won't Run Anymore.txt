Don't be afraid of the night
Only you hear the scream that you scream
Don't turn away from the light
Only you see the dream that you dream

I'm not gonna run anymore
I'm not gonna run away from this honeymoon
I'm not gonna run anymore
I'm not gonna run like a rat to a piper's tune

For you and I will show one another love
You and I, we owe one another love

We're not gonna lie anymore
We're not gonna lie in ignorant ecstasy
We're not gonna cry anymore
We're not gonna cry at a figment of fantasy

For you and I will grow together now
You and I will go together

We're not gonna run anymore
We're not gonna run anymore
Oh, no, no, no, no

I'm not gonna run anymore
I'm not gonna run away from this honeymoon
I'm not gonna run anymore
I'm not gonna run like a rat to a piper's tune

For you and I will show one another love
You and I, we owe one another love

We're not gonna lie anymore
We're not gonna lie in ignorant ecstasy
We're not gonna cry anymore
We're not gonna cry at a figment of fantasy

For you and I will grow together now
You and I will go together now

Don't be afraid of the night
Only you hear the scream that you scream
Don't turn away from the light
Only you see the dream that you dream
