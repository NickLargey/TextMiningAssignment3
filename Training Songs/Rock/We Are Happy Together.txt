Yeah they say the blues
Are hard to forget
I wouldn't know I haven't been there yet
I'm happy
Got the sunshine above me

The rent note is spent
And bills to pay
And I don't know if I'll find a way
But I'm happy 
And we're happy together

Now I don't know much about tomorrow
I only know that I love you today
Hey hey hey

So I don't care
Rain or shine
Cause a cup of rain
Will taste like wine
If you're happy
And we're happy together
You and I

Yes I'm happy 
And we're happy together

Now it take much to make me happy
Most times a smile from you will do
As long as I know you'll keep on loving me
I know that I'll get by
That'll see me through

So warm me up
And keep me tied
If this is how it feels to be satisfied
Cause I'm happy
And we're happy together
You and I

Yes I'm happy
And we're happy together
You and I

Yes I'm happy
And we're happy together
You and I
