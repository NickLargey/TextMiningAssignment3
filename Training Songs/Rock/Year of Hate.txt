Don't want nothing
But don't ask questions, so past caring
It's the year of hating everything
So align the cross-hairs
Protect the bubble, I know it's futile
I'm just trying to stay out of it

Placed your faith in celestial lies
Rat poison stars in candy colored skies
I know that feeling, I've felt it before
On the grass in front of the Fred Meyer store
And more

But don't ask questions, so past caring
It's the year of hating everything
So align the cross-hairs
Protect the bubble, I know it's futile
I'm just trying to stay out of it
Don't want nothing
But don't ask questions, so past caring
It's the year of hating everything

Drifted in and out of toxic sleep

While always Tiger town played on repeat
Dawn or dusk who knows what time is it?
When I look back now, yeah that was a trip
What if?

But don't ask questions, so past caring
It's the year of hating everything
So align the cross-hairs
Protect the bubble, I know it's futile
I'm just trying to stay out of it
Don't want nothing
But don't ask questions, so past caring
It's the year of hating everything

Privileged kids trying to say how it is
Now around here
The mating call of those who should never breed
Loud and clear
