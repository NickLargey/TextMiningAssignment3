i want someone to love
a girl that when i think of
will put a smile on my face
i want to hold her hand
want her to understand
there's got to be a better place

than this world cause this
is the best time of our lives
Should I be thinking about that now
She turns my world around
I let it happen everytime

i want a lot of things
selfishness always seem to bring
all the pain back in my mind
which way to go
answers to questions I don't know
there's better things that we can find
