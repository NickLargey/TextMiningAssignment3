One life with one love
Are the things dreams are made of
Two hearts a world apart
The music stopped before the dance could start

[Chorus]
So goodbye, now please don't cry
For now, all the words have been spoken
Time heals the heart that's broken
My love just walk away

We played those long days
You thought that we saw it the same way
You love as blind and if I seem unkind
Oh I wish for you that I could change my mind

[Chorus]
