Sometimes I'd like to quit you and find somebody
Who don't know me quite as well
Yeah, like a gypsy she would be my jewel
Spend my days in her lovin' spell

But baby, I fit you like a worn out glove
You know, I ain't going nowhere
There ain't nothing we can't rise above
We've still got a lifetime to share

Isn't it enough that I still love you
Isn't it enough to make you stay
Don't make me suffer, baby
Don't throw it all away

Now I know, you're tired and feelin' all alone
I know what you're going through
I'll satisfy your fire but I'm not made of stone
Tell me what more can I do?

Isn't it enough that I still love you
Isn't it enough to make you stay
Don't make me suffer, baby
Don't throw it all away

Now can you look in my eyes and tell me
There's nothing there, you know
I've compromised enough to show I care
So isn't it enough

Sometimes I'd like to quit you and find somebody
Who don't know me quite the same
But it took so long just to get this far
I'll be damned if I'll do it again

Isn't it enough that I still love you
Isn't it enough to make you stay
Don't make me suffer, baby
Don't throw it all away
