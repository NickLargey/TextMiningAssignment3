This is that morning,
It's waiting for you.
The face of destiny
Standing before you.
This is zero hour, now is for you.
Can you feel that power inside of you?
This priceless moment
In your possession.
Answers to mysteries
Stand in succession.
This is zero hour and there's no way back.
Can you feel that power? In its arms you're wrapped
All through the night-time
'Til the sun comes in.
Now Heaven's open.
Just fly right in.
Now you stand in that garden,
This is that vision.
Out on the world's edge,
It's your baptism.
This is zero hour and your hands are free.
Can you feel that power? It's ecstasy!
All through the night-time,
'Til the sun comes in.
Now Heaven's open.
Fly right in.
Waiting for night-time
'Til the sun comes in.
All through the night-time,
Let the blue sky in.
Heaven's open,
The sun comes in.
Heaven's open.
Let that blue sky in!
You know, sun comes in.
Now, heaven's open.
Fly right in.
