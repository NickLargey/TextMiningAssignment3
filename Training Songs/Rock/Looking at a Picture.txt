Here's my story written for you
A hidden story
Looking inside from the outside
I remember a time when I was young

I'm looking at a picture of another time
Of childhood days and summer nights

When I look back on how I loved you
Spent my fortune the way that young boys do

I'm looking at a picture of another time
Of childhood days and summer nights
I'm looking at the sadness in a young girl's eyes
The leaving's hard to do
But I can't wait for you, oh

Whatever I gave to you
The living's easy, loving's hard for you
Living's easy, loving's hard for you, oh

I'm looking at a picture of another time
The leaving's hard to do
And I can't wait for you
I'm looking at the sadness in a young girl's eyes
Oh, oh, oh
Looking at a picture of you
Oh, I can't wait, I can't wait for you
Looking at a picture of you
I'm looking at the sadness in a young girl's eyes
The leaving's hard to do
Looking at a picture of you
