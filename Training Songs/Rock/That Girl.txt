One, two, three, four
Went out with the guys,
And before my eyes,
There was this girl she looked so fine,
And she blew my mind,
And I wish that she was mine.
And I said hey wait up 'cause I'm off to speak to her

And my friends say
You're never gonna get that girl, never gonna get that girl,
I don't care.

You're never gonna get that girl, never gonna get that girl,
And I loved her long blond hair,
Love was in the air.
You're never gonna get that girl, never gonna get that girl,
She looked at me,
You're never gonna get that girl, never gonna get that girl,
And the rest is history.

Dude you're being silly cause your never gonna get that girl,
And your never gonna get the girl.

We spoke for hours,
She took off my trousers,
Spent the day laughing in the sun,
We had fun.
And my friends they all looked stunned,
(Yeah yeah)
Dude she's amazing and I can't believe you got that girl.

My friends said she's amazing and I can't believe you got that girl,
She gave me more street cred.
I took the book she read
How could I forget,
She rocks my world.
More than any other girl,
Dude she's amazing and I can't believe uve got that girl
And I can't believe you got the girl

She looked incredible
Just turned seventeen
I guess my friends were right
She's out of my league
What am I to do?
She's too good to be true
One, two, three, four

But three days later went round to see her
But she was with another guy
And I said fine but I never asked her why
And since then loneliness has been a friend of mine

My friends said such a pity
I let her slip away
They tell me every day
That it will be okay
Yeah she rocks my world
More than any other girl yeah

Dude its such a pity and I'm sorry that you lost that girl
And I'm sorry that you lost that girl
