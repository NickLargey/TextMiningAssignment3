They leave, it’s time for coming out
No use in life without sound
Patiently waiting alone and now
Follow the line to sort it out

Became aware of everything
Woke to a new surrounding
Saw what I’d done and who I’d be
I was uncomfortable with me

And part of what I've lost
Borrowed and turned to dirt
Because of what I thought
It’s people who should hurt

Feel right feel right feel right
Feel lighter

You give up what you know
Can't explain where to go
And you move in a world that moves on its own

Feel right feel right feel right
Feel lighter
