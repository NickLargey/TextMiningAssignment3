I'm sorry, but your cats just freak me out,
And the four of us don't fit in your apartment.

You like my accent, and I got drunk with your dad
And his best friend with a gun strapped to his ankle.

You fit me perfectly
So in the chorus, I'll sing what it's like to be

Going out and laughing at nothing,
Drinking, kissing pushing and shoving,
Staying in bed till we get sore,
Calling in sick, so we can lay there.

You and me
It's you and me.

Come to Europe. You can see where I come from.
When we get out of bed, you can meet my sister.

I really like you. Yeah, I really fucking do.
It's a good thing we both know that it's a good thing.

You and me, perfectly fit the chorus
So I'll sing what it's like to be

Going out and laughing at nothing,
Drinking, kissing pushing and shoving,
Staying in bed till we get sore,
Calling in sick, so we can lay there.

You and me
It's you and me.

Going out and laughing at nothing,
Drinking, kissing pushing and shoving,
Staying in bed till we get sore,
Calling in sick, so we can lay there.

You and me
It's you and me
