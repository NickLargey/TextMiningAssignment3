Came home last night
There was fire and smoke on the T.V.
Cops and the army
People running out in the street looting

I took off my clothes
And came four times
Could not leave myself alone

It was porno for pyros
Porno For Pyros
Porno For Pyros
Porno For Pyros
Porno For Pyros
Porno For Pyros

I got in my car
Saw the fire and smoke, headed to it
Just for this night
I believe it is good, just destroy it

Get back in the car
Let's drive on by
Everybody bump and grind

It was porno for pyros
Porno For Pyros

It was porno for pyros
Porno For Pyros

Oh, there's so much trouble
Oh, but I love it so much
Having the time of my life

It was a porno for pyros
Porno For Pyros
Porno For Pyros
Porno For Pyros
Porno For Pyros
