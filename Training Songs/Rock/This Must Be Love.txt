I didn't like you much,
‘Cant remember how we ending up getting back in touch
You made me change my hair
You made me change it back again, when fashions in the air

Don't get me wrong,
You weren't the first girl that I ever kissed with tongues,
But you were the best,
You let me touch your chest
I saved you twos on my last cigarette

I saw you on the underground,
You smiled at me and I turned around, now love
This must be love,
We got it on behind the station,
Lets avoid this situation love,
This must be love,

I couldn't work you out,
You threw my cd's away, Got out our photos cut me out
But you just carry on,
You tell all your mates, that you were right,
And I was always wrong,

Don't get me wrong, so wrong
You weren't the first girl that I ever kissed with tongues,
But you were the best,
You let me touch your chest
I saved you twos on my last cigarette

I saw you on the underground,
You smiled at me and I turned around, now love
This must be love,
We got it on behind the station,
Lets avoid this situation love,
This must be love,

You said that I was too fat,
I said that you were to thin
You kissed me right on the lips,
And kicked me right in the shin
You said “Well do you love me?”
I said “Well I think your fit!”
You said “We can't carry on, if you cannot commit”

I saw you on the underground,
You smiled at me and I turned around, now love
This must be love,
We got it on behind the station,
Lets avoid this situation love,
This must be love
