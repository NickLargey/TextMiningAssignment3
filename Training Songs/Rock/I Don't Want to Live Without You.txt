I don't think I could live without your love
Whatever I give you, I can't give you enough
Memories of you, girl, day after day
Make our love go stronger when you're so far away

Like a midnight rider on an endless road
I'm a sole survivor carrying a heavy load
I don't want to live without you
I don't want to feel the pain
I don't want to live without you
Nothin's gonna change it
Never wanna live without you
Don't think I could stand the pain
I don't want to live without you
I don't want to change it

Now I know you've been waitin' for so long
I've been lost for words so I'll give you this song
Livin' on a memory and a picture of you
Makes my heart skip a beat
It's the best I can do

Just a midnight rider on an endless road
I'm a sole survivor carrying a heavy load
I don't want to live without you
I don't want to feel the pain
I don't want to live without you
Nothin's gonna change it
Never wanna live without you
Don't think I could stand the pain
I don't want to live without you
I don't want to change it

It's just me and you and not a damn thing anyone else can do
Baby, baby, our love is true
Oh, don't you change me

Like a midnight rider on an endless road
I'm a sole survivor carrying a heavy load
Baby, I don't want to live without you.
I don't want to feel the pain
I don't want to live without you
Nothin's gonna change it

I don't want to live without you 
I don't want to feel the pain
I don't want to live without you
Nothin's gonna change it
Never wanna live without you
Don't think I could stand the pain
I don't want to live without you
Nothin's gonna change it

I don't think I could live without your love
Whatever I give you, I can't give you enough
Livin' on memories and pictures of you
Makes my heart skip a beat
It's the best I can do.
