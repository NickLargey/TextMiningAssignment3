Never good just the bad and the ugly
Laid infront of you
Nothing quite like seeing the world through the TV's we know
Feeling helpless I look for distraction
I go searching for you, wandering through our city to find some solace at your door

I can't stop thinking about it
I can't stop thinking about it
Tell me did you see the news tonight

Hold me in this wild, wild, world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Hold me in this wild, wild, world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Now draw me close

So come on let's forget the emotion
Tie the blinkers oh, hold both hands right over my eyes
Deafen me with music
'Till we're lost in the heat of the moment
And I move and you help me keep these hours alive
Help me chase those seconds

I just keep talking about it
But I'll do nothing about it
Tell me did you see the news last night

Hold me in this wild, wild, world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold you can get
Hold me in this wild, wild, world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Now draw me close

Hold me in this wild, wild, world

Hold me in this wild, wild, world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Hold me in this wild, wild, world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
So draw me close
Draw me close
