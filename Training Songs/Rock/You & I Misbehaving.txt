Oh Darci, Darci don't look so sad
Don't let the daytime get you down
Because we will be wild like children once the black has veiled this sky
No pushing buttons, no telling lies
No pointed fingers trying to keep you quiet
Just you and I misbehaving
Oh trying our best to feel alive
We won't ever let them win
When we are younger oh our hearts are so much bolder
The pressure is not as great
We floated weightless through the tops of trees
But as we get older oh our vision becomes blurred
And then the fog it slips right in
Now you're wondering how oh yeah, you're wondering how you ended up here
How you end up here
The hateful, hateful tough little boys
That move their lips whenever you're around
So smart just shouting answers (shouting answers)
I guess their fathers taught them well
So sit real still they've got to size you up
Don't move your mouth
They don't like when you talk
They're trying their best to define you (to define you)
They're trying their best to keep you down
We won't ever let them win
Because this world you know it can get so crazy
All these people talk a lot
They know this, they know it all
What a drag
But you know there will always be some oddball singing
Just remember to sing along, yeah you better start singing a long
This place could be so beautiful
You just can't let them pull that cloth over your eyes
Just keep on screaming
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
