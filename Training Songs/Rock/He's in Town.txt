He's in town
He's back in town

Girl I knew just what was wrong
When you weren't home 
Each time I phoned all week long
And now 
I see it in your eyes
The look that you have 
when you're thinking of him
Can't be disguised
I was afraid he'd come back some day
And I'd be the one to lose
I knew when you saw him 
you wouldn't ignore him
And he'd be the one you'd choose
So you don't have to tell me

He's in town
He's back in town

No you don't have to tell me
He's in town
He's back in town
He's in town
