What do I have to do for you to let me 
Lick you into something like paradise 
Let me grab your neck and taste you honey 
Pleasure without money 
I love you when you touch yourself 
Watch yourself express yourself with me 
Let me grab your neck and taste you honey 
Pleasure without money 

[Chorus:]

You never said anything about love 
I will never ever be true 
I don't want to waste my time on you 
Hey hey hear my pray 
I gotta get loose 

'Cause I use you as my ashtray 

Hey hey hear my pray 
I gotta get loose 

'Cause I sold my soul to rock n' roll 

I don't need no immediate relation 
Seems like a lot of women live close to desperation 
Let me look into your eyes 
Have you been around 
Promiscuous clown 
I don't want to repeat my life 
You were my Monday, tomorrow's Tuesday my love 
If no woman's around, a little sensation 
Endless masturbation
