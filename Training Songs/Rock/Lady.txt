Down low in a slow mode
I see things, oh, people
Stop steppin' around in my head
Please, tell me

I am a lady if you save me
I'm living alone if you find me
Everyone tells me
I'm in sorry shape but I'm not

I am a lady if you save me
I'm getting so old and
You don't know that I'm alright
'Cause I'm in sorry shape as they say

My thought of being
Someone's way to love
So pathetic, I don't even care
Please, tell me

Everyone tells me
I'm in sorry shape but I'm not
