Fevered the plastics that seal your body
They won't stop this way, hey, hey

I was your eye in the night when the prophets fell
I said, "it looks like you summer well"

But I want to stay magical
I want to stay yearning (nobody told you, nobody told you)
I want to feel up on your life
I missed you
But it looks like you summered well

All the while, the protests have shined the same
But you will never have noticed
It's alright

I rely on the process, don't mind the frame
They will never take this dream from me

It's alright
(I need you back)
It's alright
(It's all the way behind us)
It's alright

I miss you, babe
I want you back
The signs we gave
Weren't those signs supposed to last?

The rainy days
The Summer's back
The signs we gave
So what was that?

You know we have ways
To make the seasons touch these ones
So let me take this, cover your eyes
Look away
Until it fades

All the while all the protests that shined the same
But you will never notice
It's alright
I rely on the process, don't mind the frame
They will never take this dream from me

It's alright
(Dream from me)
It's alright
(You sent me)
It's alright
(You sent me)
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
(You sent me)
