Everyone's saying it's for the best
And I shouldn't be feeling so depressed
Everyone's telling me I'll be fine
And all that it takes is time

They say I should get my heart in hand
But nobody seems to understand

That you're not easy to forget, seems no matter what I do
I just can't seem to remember I'm not in love with you
You're not easy to forget, I've been trying everyday
But your memory keeps getting in my way

Ever since you've been gone I find
Not a day goes by you don't cross my mind
Then when I close my eyes it seems
There you are running through my dreams

When somebody tries to take your place
I just look at her and see your face

Cause you're not easy to forget, seems no matter what I do
I just can't seem to remember I'm not in love with you
You're not easy to forget, I've been trying everyday
But your memory keeps getting in my way

There's no getting into getting over you
After all we've been through
I just can't get the knack
Of not wanting you back

Cause you're not easy to forget, seems no matter what I do
I just can't seem to remember I'm not in love with you
You're not easy to forget, I've been trying everyday
But your memory keeps getting in my way

You're not easy to forget, seems no matter what I do
I just can't seem to remember I'm not in love with you
You're not easy to forget, I've been trying everyday
But your memory keeps getting in my way

You're not easy to forget, seems no matter what I do
I just can't seem to remember I'm not in love with you
