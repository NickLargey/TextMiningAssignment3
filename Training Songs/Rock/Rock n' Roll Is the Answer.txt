Seven o'clock and I'm feeling bad
I gotta pull myself together, yeah…
Cause twelve o'clock you know I wanna rap
I wanna get a better full of…
Everything is going wrong
Seven at night is gonna be alright
We'll go the break of dawn
Yeah! Baby, baby
We gonna have a ball
Ooh, come on baby
We gonna have it
We gonna have it all!

[Chorus]
Rock'n roll is the answer
Rock'n roll is the answer
Oh, oh, oh
Rock'n roll is the answer
Rock'n roll is the answer
Oh yeah!

My guy says
Momma baby, she's mad at me for ain't cooler than
The neighbors are complaining, I'm going in
Say close the door the telephone
Oh boy, it's seven in night, it's gonna be alright
We'll go… the break of dawn
Yeah! Baby, baby
We gonna have a ball
Ooh, come on baby
We gonna have it
We gonna have it all!
We gonna have it, we gonna have it all!

[Chorus]

My parents are always lecturing me
I tell them that it just don't matter
Take away my emptiness, cause you can't break the spirit
..you can't break the spirit, can't break the spirit, baby!
But you can't break the spirit, can't break the spirit, baby!

[Chorus x3]
