Ma cried like a lady
Pa cried like a man
1963 - one less kennedy
And I was too young to understand
And the years flew by in colours
Each one a little faster than before
And as the war caused some to cry
I'd identify
My tv keeping score
Growing up - in the shadow of the u.s.a.
Trying to find - the meaning of life today
America - it's a heavy kind of role you
Play
You're the hero - you're the villain
Your every move is on display

Ma cried like a lady
Pa cried like a man
1963 - one less kennedy
And I was too young to understand
We were all too young to understand
