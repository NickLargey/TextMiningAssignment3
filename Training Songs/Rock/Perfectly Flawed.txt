If you do this, if you do this
If you do this you'll never have a chance to try again
If you do this you'll never have a chance to try

It's the same sound, same sting
The same collapse of everything
It's the same size, same blade
The same lie, same old vein

My way, my face, my heart
My race, I'm a mistake
My way, my face, my heart
My race, I'm such a disgrace

You're perfectly flawed
You're perfectly incomplete
Like cracks in the glass
And flames full of grass

You're perfectly flawed
You're perfectly incomplete
Let them come near
When perfection's the key you need

Nothing left to lose
Just try again
Nothing left to lose
Just try again

It's the same doubt, the same dream
It's the same sabotage 'cause I'm the enemy
It's the same night, same day
It's the same parasite feeding on the betrayal

My way, my face, my heart
My race, I'm a mistake
My way, my face, my heart
My race, I'm such a disgrace

You're perfectly flawed
You're perfectly incomplete
Like cracks in the glass
And flames full of grass

You're perfectly flawed
You're perfectly incomplete
A work in progress
Perfection's the key you need

A disguise of self-deception
Hides my secrets perfectly
I'm rejecting my reflection
'Cause I hate the way it judges me

Don't you do it
You're not even you yet
Don't you do it
You're not even you yet

You're perfectly flawed
You're perfectly incomplete
Like cracks in the glass
And flames full of grass

You're perfectly flawed
You're perfectly incomplete
A work in progress
Perfection's the key you need
