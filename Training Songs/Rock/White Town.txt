I can't understand 
After everything that we planned, 
How you could turn around to me and 
whisper goodbye. Well I've been dropped before 
But not so high off the floor 
And I just can't seem to pick myself up 
again. If it's something that I said 
That made you feel this way, 
Then I take back every word from the first 
hello, But most likely I know. 
Your parents said baby no 
And the boy you told your friends about 
just had to go. Well it's a white town 
with green trees. And nothing in love is free 
So if it's not worth fighting for It's worth nothing at all.
