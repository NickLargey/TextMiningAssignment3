It ain't me
You were looking for
You stood upon it
And then you walked away
From the door

And I thought that bell would ring twice
but now I know for sure
that it ain't me
you were looking for

Welcome to my party for ya
Welcome to my party for ya
Welcome
x2
To my party for you

Cause you hooked by heart
until it tore
I had to burn the house down
just to get through the door

'Cause I thought that bell would ring twice
but now I know for sure
that it ain't me
you were looking for

Welcome to my party for ya
Welcome to my party for ya
Welcome...
x2
To my party for you

You gotta bleed your own blood
to get on through that fire
You gotta ways to go

Welcome x2
'Cause it ain't me, yea 
Well it ain't me, yea 
did you bait the love? 
Welcome...Welcome
'Cause it ain't me, yea
