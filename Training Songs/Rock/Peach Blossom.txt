Oh man, feel so nice
That was a long cold night
But then the sun came out to thaw the ice

Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the merry-gold
Oh look at her, she’s got something to say
And I cant wait to hear it
Won’t let her get away

Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the merry-gold
Oh yeah, oh my goodness
You gonna love what’s happening in here
There ain’t nothing for me to fear

Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the merry-gold
Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the merry-gold

Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the merry-gold
Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the merry-gold
