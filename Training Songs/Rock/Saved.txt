I used to smoke
I used to drink
I used to smoke, drink and dance the hootchie-koo
I used to smoke and drink, smoke and drink and dance the hootchie-koo
It's true
Now I'm standing on this corner
Praying for me and you

That's why I'm saved
I am saved
People, let me tell you about Kingdom come
You know I'm saved
Saved
I said I'm gonna preach it 'til you're deaf and dumb

I used to cuss
I used to fuss
I used to cuss, fuss and boogie all night long
I used to cuss and fuss, cuss and fuss and boogie all night long
Now I'm standing on this corner
I know right from wrong

Because I'm saved
I am saved
People, let me tell you about Kingdom come
You know I'm saved
Saved
I said I'm gonna preach it 'til you're deaf and dumb

I used to lie
I used to cheat
I used to lie, cheat and step on people's feet
I used to lie and cheat, lie and cheat and step on people's feet
Now I'm standing on this corner
Salvation is my beat

That's why I'm saved
I am saved
People, let me tell you about Kingdom come
You know I'm saved
Saved
I said I'm gonna preach it 'til you're deaf and dumb
