Get your master key...open up your doors
Set your servants free...they won't come no more
Wrapped my life in chains...gave my everything
Learned to feel no pain...now everyday I wake up

Angry...angry I said
Angry...angry I said

You pack me in your car...you drive my life away
But you only go so far...won't take me all the way
I tried so hard to please...take my place in line
Begged you on my knees...now all I got makes me

Angry...angry I said
Angry...angry I said

Your mantle's 'bout to fall
Your grip's gonna come undone
Nobody hear you call...no flowers from anyone
I'm gettin' down off the rack...i'm takin' this baby back

Angry...

I've wasted too much time
I'm gettin' down off the rack
I'm packin' up all my crimes...and I ain't comin' back
Your mantle's 'bout to fall...your mantle's bound to fall
No heaven after all...no heaven after all

Angry...no heaven after all
Angry...no one to break your fall
Angry...no heaven after all
Angry...no heaven after all
