There once was a ma that wanted her
There once was a pa that wanted her

I know shes confused, shes my blood sister
She told me the blues as she start to shiver
Only a child in the middle of a war
Shes a problem child now because of a divorce

Hey ma and pa
What the hell is wrong with y'all
Hey ma and pa
What the hell is wrong with y'all

Well there's a lot of money
For all the attorneys

Its just not a fight for child custody
cause ma and pas revenge
Is making little sister bleed
Fussin' and fightin' through a family life
Make her wanna take drugs and be out of line

Hey ma and pa
What the hell is wrong with y'all
Hey ma and pa
What the hell is wrong with y'all

Fighting for love on an angels feather
Why don't y'all get your shit together

Well its three the hard way
Doin' it the wrong way
Ma hates pa, pa hates ma
Little sister say
What the hey!

Well there's an evil streak there
With a righteous leak I fear

That's why a child goes astray
To live a life another day
Mom and pop in a family fury
Brother tried to say little sister, don't worry

Hey ma and pa
What the hells wrong with y'all
Hey ma and pa
What the hells wrong with y'all
Hey ma and pa
Why'd the family rise and fall
Hey ma and pa

Well its three the hard way
Doin' it the wrong way
Ma hates pa, pa hates ma
Little sister say
What the hey!

Hey ma and pa
What the hells wrong with y'all
Hey ma and pa
What the hells wrong with y'all
Hey ma and pa
What the hells wrong with y'all
Fighting for love on an angels feather
Why don't y'all get your shit together
