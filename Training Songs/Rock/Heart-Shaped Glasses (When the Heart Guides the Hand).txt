She reminds me of the one in school
When I was gutted, she was dressed in white
And I couldn't take my eyes off her
But that's not what I took off that night
She'll never cover up what we did with her dress
No
She said, "Kiss me, it'll heal but it won't forget."
"Kiss me, it'll heal but it won't forget."

I don't mind you keeping me on pins and needles
If I could stick to you and you stick me, too

Don't break, don't break my heart
And I won't break your heart shaped glasses
Little girl, little girl, you should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high
Don't break, don't break my heart
And I won't break your heart shaped glasses
Little girl, little girl, you should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high, making me low
That blue is getting me high, making me low

She reminds me of the one I knew that cut up the negatives of my life
I couldn't take my hands off her; she wouldn't let me be anywhere but inside

And I don't mind you keeping me on pins and needles
If I could stick to you and you stick me, too

Just don't break, don't break my heart
And I won't break your heart shaped glasses
Little girl, little girl, you should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high
Don't break, don't break my heart
And I won't break your heart shaped glasses
Little girl, little girl, you should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high, making me low

She'll never cover up what we did with her dress
No
She said, "Kiss me, it'll heal but it won't forget."
"Kiss me, it'll heal but it won't forget."

I don't mind you keeping me on pins and needles
If I could stick to you and you could stick me, too

Don't break, don't break my heart
And I won't break your heart shaped glasses
Little girl, little girl, you should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high
Don't break, don't break my heart
And I won't break your heart shaped glasses
Little girl, little girl, you should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high, making me low
