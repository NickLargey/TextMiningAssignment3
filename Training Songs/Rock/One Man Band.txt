Everybody knows down ladbrook grove,
you have to leap across the street.
You can lose your life under a taxi cab,
you gotta have eyes in your feet. 

You find a nice soft corner and you sit right down,
pick up your guitar and play.
Then the police come and says move along,
so you move along all day. 

I'm a one man band
nobody cares or understands.
Is there anybody out there who could lend a hand.
To my one man band. 

For three days now I haven't eaten at all
my my I must be getting so thin.
Soon my cap won't be large enough
to drop a half a crown in. 

So hey there mister don't you look so sad
don't look so ill at ease.
I can play you any song you chose
to cheer up the life you lead. 

Oh I'm a one man band
nobody sees nor understands.
Is there anybody out there who could lend a hand
to my one man band. 

And oh oh oh look at the rain falling
oh oh oh look at the rain 

Nobody hears the minstrel boy, as he sings his tale of woe.
Nobody sees him disappear,
and nobody sees him go.
So hey there mister don't look so sad,
don't feel so ill at ease.
I can play you any song you chose,
to cheer up the life you lead. 

Oh I'm a one man band
nobody sees nor understands.
Is there anybody out there who could lend me a hand,
to my one man band. 

Oh I'm a one man band
nobody cares nor understands.
Is there anybody here who could lend a hand,
to my one man band 

I'm a one man band
I'm a one man band
Ooo one man band
Ooo I'm a one man band
Oh I'm a one man band
Ooo one man band
