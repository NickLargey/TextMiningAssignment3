Take my name, I don't need it 
Nothing stays the same anyway 
Take my fame, I can't use it 
My girlfriend calls me lame, the game was over yesterday 

Tell me, what's my name? 
Tell me, what's my name? 
What's my name? 

Take this bass, I can't play it 
It only makes me wish for the way it used to be 
you could slap my face, but I got to say it 
you never would have drank my coffee if I had never served you cream 

Now tell me, what's your name? 
Tell me, what's your name? 
What's your name? 
What's your name? 
Come on! 

Do you dream in color or do you discriminate? 
Do you love others, do you love or do you hate? 
Do you worship fire or do you worship a dove? 
Do you live a liar or do you live for love? 

What's your name? 

What's my name? 
What's your name?
