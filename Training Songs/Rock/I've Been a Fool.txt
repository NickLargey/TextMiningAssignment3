I've been a fool thinking you cared 
Thinking you shared my love affair.
I've never knew what love could do
Till my poor heart till I met you
I opened up my heart to let you in. 
But darling from the start you broke it its a sin
Someday you'll find a love like mine. 
You'll never find well yes I've been (fooled.?)
I opened up my heart to let you in. 
But darling from the start you broke it its a sin
Someday you'll see a love like mine its so hard to find 
I been a fool
