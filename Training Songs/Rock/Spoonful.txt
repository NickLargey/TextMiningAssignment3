It could be a spoonful of diamonds, yeah 
Could be a spoonful of gold 
Just a little spoon of your precious love 
Satisfies my soul 

CHORUS: 
Men lie about it, ooo they cry about it 
Even die about it, everybody fights about it 
Ooo that spoon, that spoon, that spoonful 

Well t could be a spoonful of water 
Saved from the desert sand 
But just a little spoon of that 45 
Seedy from another man 

Well it could be a spoonful of coffee 
Could be a spoonful of tea 
But just a little spoon of your precious love, baby 
Is good enough for me
