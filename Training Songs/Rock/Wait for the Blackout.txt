Don't you ask me to come out
When the sun does shine
Let us stay here with curtains drawn
In darkness you'll be mine

Let's wait for the blackout
The light is too bright
Let's wait for the blackout
Wait for the night

Well welcome to my basement flat
No windows to see through
With darkness closing in my friend
We'll both know what to do

Let's wait for the blackout
The light is too bright
Let's wait for the blackout
Wait for the night

Come lay with me upon the earth
That keeps us both alive
No living thing has lasted here
Yet we shall both survive

Let's wait for the blackout
The light is too bright
Let's wait for the blackout
Wait for the night

In darkness there is no sin
Light only brings the fear
Nothing to corrupt the eyes
There is no vision here
At first you may find it strange
But do not go away
The darkness holds a power
That you won't find in the day

There is no vision here
There is no vision here
