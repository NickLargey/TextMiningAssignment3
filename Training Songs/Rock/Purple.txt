Purple washes over me 
Seeping through my open seams 
I'm stained all over 

You pretend we've started again 
Waiting for me to say when 
But I say purple 

She won't go 
Where I 
I would go for you 
I'd curse my heart 
For you 

Silence makes a girl talk fast 
Speeding but I'm gonna crash 
And burn for loves sake 

Duty keeps a lover loyal 
(But) is it really worth the spoils 
When I dream purple
