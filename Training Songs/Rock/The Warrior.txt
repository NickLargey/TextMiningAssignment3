You run, run, run away
It's your heart that you betray
Feeding on your hungry eyes
I bet you're not so civilized

Well, isn't love primitive
A wild gift that you want to give
Break out of captivity
And follow me stereo jungle child
Love is the kill
You're heart's still wild

Shooting at the walls of heartache bang, bang
I am the warrior
Well, I am the warrior
And heart to heart you'll win
If you survive, the warrior, the warrior

You talk, talk, talk to me
You're eyes touch me physically
Stay with me, we'll take the night
As passion takes another bite
Oh, who's the hunter, who's the game
I feel the beat call your name
I hold you close in victory
I don't want to tame your animal style
You won't be caged
In the call of the wild

Shooting at the walls of heartache bang, bang
I am the warrior
Well, I am the warrior
And heart to heart you'll win
If you survive, the warrior, the warrior
I am the warrior

Shooting at the walls of heartache (shooting at the walls of heartache)
The warrior
I am the warrior
And heart to heart you'll win
Heart to heart you'll win
If you survive, the warrior, the warrior

Shooting at the walls of heartache 
I am the warrior
Yes, I am the warrior
And victory is mine

Shooting at the walls of heartache 
I am the warrior
Shooting at the walls of heartache bang, bang
I am the warrior
