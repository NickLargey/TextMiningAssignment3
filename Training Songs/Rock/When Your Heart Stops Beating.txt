Turn it up, I never wanna go home
I only wanna be part of your breakdown
She got caught by the four on the floor
It picked her up, and she'll never get let down
And now I can't stop thinkin' about it
All you people at the top don't know nothin' about it
We don't give a f*ck what the price is
So just leave us to our own devices, and we'll leave you alone

I'll be there when your heart stops beating
I'll be there when your last breath's taken away
In the dark, when there's no one listening
In the times when we both get carried away

When we both get carried away

She says it all without a thought in her head
She says it all as she's pressed up against me
A little something just to take off the edge
A little more, and I'll fall off the planet entirely

I'll be there when your heart stops beating
I'll be there when your last breath's taken away
In the dark, when there's no one listening
In the times when we both get carried away

When we both get carried away

I'll be there when your heart stops beating
I'll be there when your last breath's taken away
In the dark, when there's no one listening
In the times when we both get carried away

When we both get carried away
When we both get carried away
(I'll be there when your heart stops beating)
When we both get carried away
(In the dark, when there's no one listening)
When we both get carried away
