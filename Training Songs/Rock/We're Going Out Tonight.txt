Twenty past four and we're feeling kind of bored 'cause there's nothing to record and we're poor
There's nothing on TV, how can that be? Not even bullshit I don't want to see

Spent all day in bed, throbbing in my head, my legs are made of lead
feeling dead, there must be something to do to loose this mood
I looked in the kitchen, there's not any food

Something must be done, I'm craving some fun

Put on my favourite band, yeah we need to make a plan
Well I really hope we can 'cause the situation can't be much worse today, nothing's OK
If I worked I probably wouldn't get paid
We start to fight
Then we decided that
We're going out tonight

Walk to the shop, CDs I can hock and that suck 'cause they never
give you much but I don't give a damn we're sticking to the plan we need to
buy some beer now the hour is getting near to the time that we know we've
really got to go, we're sitting in the park and it's getting pretty dark

We have a sup
now things are looking up
We're going out tonight

Now the time has come, we're going to have some fun
Now it's understood the night is looking good
Let's go out and find someone to shout we'll get to the pub and there's
going to be no doubt that
There'll be some trouble there, broken glasses and stupid hair
We'll be without a care all night
We're going out tonight
