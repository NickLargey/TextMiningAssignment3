Don't you feel so very pointless
In the feelings of the rain
And the violence of the sun

I must confess that I feel graciously
Bigger than the rain
And hotter than the sun

What did you do, what do you say
When the blood spilled is of your loved one
And the Kremlins of the world fall around you

We deal in dreams, yeah
We deal in dreams
We deal in structures
That grow cold in our hearts

Oh fearful crying people
The fool is by the river
Watching, but not swimming

It takes energy not to get used to it
And fall into this place
Where everything runs together and dies

This quiet kingdom she is now
Forever will she be
In silent celebration

We deal in dreams, yeah
We deal in dreams
We deal in structures
That grow cold in our hearts, yeah

We deal in dreams
We deal in dreams
We deal in structures
That grow cold in our hearts, yeah

But we deal in dreams
Dreams, dreams
Structures that grow cold in our hearts, yeah

We deal in dreams
We deal in dreams
Structures that grow cold
Structures that grow cold
Structures that grow cold in our hearts, yeah

Don't you feel so very pointless
In the feelings of the rain
And the violence of the sun
