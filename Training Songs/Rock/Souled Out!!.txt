The barrio starts two streets over
Miguel, he's a friend of mine
With brick weed, built a reputation
Like dry ice in the summertime

Now all you need's an electric razor
A magic bullet in a grassy knoll
The whole world's just a little oyster
To Snow White and the poison apple leaves

I woke up in the age of wires
I fell asleep at the dusk of man
Now I'm cold as Popocatepetl
Fingers crossed in the promised land

But you won't be getting in
(You know by now)
No, you won't be getting in
(You know by now)
No, you won't be getting in
(You know by now)
All sold out in heaven

The barrio starts two streets over
Montse, she's a friend of mine
Keeps a piece like a whistle blower
Flying kites in the wintertime

Magic carpet is the transportation
Went to the moon in a soda can
Not all my boys believe in science
Stretching truth in the promised land

But you won't be getting in
(You know by now)
No, you won't be getting in
(You know by now)
No, you won't be getting in
(You know by now)
It's sold out in heaven

Again? Or another one?
Another one, okay

El Popocatepetl esta dormido
Pero pronto despertara

You know by now
You know by now
You know by now

That you won't be getting in
(You know by now)
Yes, you won't be getting in
(You know by now)
No, you won't be getting in
(You know by now)
It's sold out in heaven

No, you won't be getting in
(You know by now)
No, you won't be getting in
(You know by now)
No, you won't be getting in
(You know by now)
To heaven

To heaven
(You know by now)
To heaven
(You know by now)
(You know by now)
To heaven
