Written by john lennon and paul mccartney.

Well, she was just seventeen,
You know what I mean,
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare.
I'll never dance with another
Since I saw her standing there

Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
How could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

We danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
I'll never dance with another
Since I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, she was just seventeen,
You know what I mean,
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare.
She'll never dance with another
Since I saw her standing there

Since I saw her standing there
