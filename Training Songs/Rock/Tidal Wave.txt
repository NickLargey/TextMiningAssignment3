The barometer is falling down, I feel so sultry
Something is simmering and boiling inside me
If I ignore it and squeeze out laughter
I charge up with a typhoon, hurricanes and storms

Einar
I just need the diesel, I just find the smell,
I just sniff it and I can feel the harbour just close by,
I just try to sniff the diesel but I can't, I just can't get enough, 

Björk
Theres danger, danger! 

A tide with an undertow, the sea is swelling
Impatience makes me foam
A wave inside me forces out big words
They splash and sprinkle
An angry torrent breaking loose, a flush or rushing joy

Einar
The diesel, just makes me feel,
It just fills my veins
I don't know why 
it just does 

The diesel is so.... 

Björk
It shouldn't gush out 

Einar
It just fills me up 

Björk
Don't want it to be fussy 

Einar
I can't have a cigarette 

Björk
It shouldn't gush out 

Einar
It just fills me up 
if i have a cigarette, it would make me go boom! 

Björk
And I can't help it, I'm exploding again
I'm calling weather stationNnomad
And satellite Nimbus
It's a blizzard inside me, a bomb ticking! 
This is the tidal wave 

Einar
The diesel! 

Björk
Here comes the tidal wave, ho-ho! 

Einar
The diesel! 

Björk
This is the tidal wave 

Einar
The diesel! 

Björk
Here comes the tidal wave. 

Einar
The diesel is so nice
