I've got ta cash a check
It's a promissory note
[?]
I've come to be to the right of you
It's taken a long, time to really know these things

So what's the matter, you don't like what you see?
What's the matter, you don't like what you see?
I can't believe you're even talking to me!

I won’t light myself on fire to keep you warm
Won’t carry you up that hill
Won’t light myself on fire
And I won't smile

And I don't care if you cry
And I don't care if you cry
I don't care if you cry
I don't care if you cry

Before you say hello
Can't fix you; f*ck you too
Before you say hello
I don't tread water to sip tea
And so I steal the watch
And so I steal the ring
And so I steal the watch
And so I steal the ring

What's the matter, you don't like what you see?
What's the matter, you don't like what you see?
I can't believe you're even talking to me!

Won’t light myself on fire to keep you warm
Won’t carry you up that hill
Won’t light myself on fire
I won't smile

I don't care if you cry
I don't care if you cry
I don't care if you cry
I don't care if you cry
