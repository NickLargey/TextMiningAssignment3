"You wanna feel/you're never walking
You see your feet/from off the ground
and when you leave/there's no one talking
you slowly breathe/and look around

I know/you're the lonliest person I know
just a flag in the wind that wont blow
just a tear rolling down the window

You cut your lip/and now you're freaking
Another friend/becomes a foe
You try to leave/but they offer candy
Another time/you wont say no

I know/you're the lonliest person I know
just a flag in the wind that wont blow
just a tear rolling down the window

You see that I know/you're the lonliest person I know
Just a blade in the grass/that won't grow
Just a hand holding on to let go

Time is a train...
Time is a train...
Leading you nowhere...
Leading you nowhere.

A second page/ you reach a chapter
You're on the phone/but no one's there
Another thing you can't keep after
Another time you're left alone

I know/you're the lonliest person I know
just a flag in the wind that wont blow
just a tear rolling down the window

You see that I know/you're the lonliest person I know
Just a blade in the grass/that won't grow
Just a hand holding on to let go

You see that I know/you're the lonliest person I know
Just a fly living in the back row
Just a slap in the face that wont show"
