Monday I go to watch Sumo wrestling.
It's an easy day to get a good ticket.
Tuesday my friends come to my house
and we play the Twister game.
Wednesday I play computer games all day.
My favorite's Jewel box.
Thursday I drive to a toy shop
and I buy a Barbie doll.
Friday I go to see the Kinks
dancing screaming and drinking beer.
Saturday I go ice skating
playing tennis is very good too.
Sunday, what movie do I want to watch?
How about the new Star Trek flick?
Monday to Sunday, one week has seven days.

One week, one week, one week,
one week, one week, one week, 
one week one week.
One week, one week, one week, 
one week, one week, one week,
one week one week.
One week, one week, one week, 
one week, one week, one week, 
one week one week.
One week, one week, one week, 
one week, one week, one week, 
one week one week.
One. Weak. Life.
