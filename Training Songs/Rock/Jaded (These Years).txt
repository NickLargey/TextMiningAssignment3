There's a time and place, for everything.
There's a reason why, certain people meet.
There's a destination, for everyone.
What's the explanation, when we're done?
All the summer nights spent wondering;
So many questions asked, but no one's answering.
Would it be okay if I left today?
Took my chances on what you said was wrong?
I'm jaded, stupid, and reckless.
Not sorry, and I'll never regret.
These years spent, so faded and reckless.
Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years.
I'll never regret these years.
Now here I sit, so far away.
Remembering all our memories.
Its times like these that I miss you most,
Remembering when we were so close.
I'm jaded, stupid, and reckless.
Not sorry, we'll never regret.
These years spent, so faded and reckless.
Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years.
We'll never forget the places we've been, you and i.
Our lives are slipping away.
Don't want to let time pass us by, by
I'm jaded, stupid, and reckless.
Not sorry, and I'll never regret. 
These years
Spent, so faded and reckless, 
Not sorry, and I'll never regret
I'm jaded, stupid, and reckless.
Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years.
