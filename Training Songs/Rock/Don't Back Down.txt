The girls dig the way the guys get all wiped out
With their feet in the air you can hear em shout
They're not afraid, not my boys
They grit their teeth, they don't back down

Don't back down - You gotta be a little nuts
Don't back down - But show now who's got guts
Don't back down - Don't back down from that wave

With their feet full of tar and their head full of sand
The guys know the surf like the palm of their hand
Hey're not afraid, not my boys
They grit their teeth, They don't back down

[Chorus]
When a 20-footer sneaks up like a ton of lead
And the crest comes along
and slaps them upside their head
They're not afraid, not my boys
They grit their teeth, They don't back down

[Chorus]
