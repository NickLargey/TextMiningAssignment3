Sleepy news in yesterday
I wrote it to you
Before I left I had to say
What does it mean?
I left my house at
Half past eight
What did I leave for?
And then I went into the town
Beneath my kingdom

There I am 
I'm dead and you
Killed me 

Sleepy news I paint the fence 
For all my people
I try so hard to not offend
But f*ck you too
Believe me when I try to say
The good I've done for you
The reason I forget to keep
The troubles in my mind

Sometimes I lie outside
