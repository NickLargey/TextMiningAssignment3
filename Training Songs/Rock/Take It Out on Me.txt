So tall, erase those worried eyes
Lay your trouble out beside me and sit
And so I'll sympathize
Leave it feeding there inside me

Oh take it out on me

I'm in love with the feeling
Oh take it out on me
Maybe hooked on the healing
Oh take it out on me
I'm in love with the feeling of
Being used

Dig deep where you're afraid to go
Pick the stitches and unbind me that kick
That pain I need to know
Every cut you feel defines me

Oh take it out on me

I'm in love with the feeling
Oh take it out on me
Maybe hooked on the healing
Oh take it out on me
I'm in love with the feeling of
Being used

Tell me, tell me
Tell me what is going wrong
Help me, help me
Now the nights are getting long
Tell me, tell me
Tell me what is going wrong
Help me, help me
Now the nights are getting long

Oh take it out on me
Tell me what is going wrong
Oh take it out on me
Now the nights are getting long
Oh take it out on me
Tell me what is going wrong
Oh take it out on me
Now the nights are getting long

Take it out on me
I'm in love with the feeling
Oh take it out on me
Maybe hooked on the healing
Oh take it out on me
So in love with this feeling
Oh take it out on me
Maybe hooked on the healing

Take it out on me
I'm in love with the feeling
Oh take it out on me
Maybe hooked on the healing
Oh take it out on me
So in love with this feeling
Oh take it out on me
Maybe hooked on the healing

Take it out on me
I'm in love with the feeling
Oh take it out on me
Maybe hooked on the healing
