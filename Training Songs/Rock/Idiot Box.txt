I can't turn you off
I just try and laugh you off
Tumbling you maybe are
But you sure ain't rock n roll

[Chorus]
People standing in the rain
Just to see a dream of him
Supersonic, oh come back soon
'Cause all we got is a marquee moon

Billy singer don't waste my time
Just turn on to "What's my line"
Richard Lloyd you hear us knock
You sure have wrote "The Golden Shot"

[Chorus]

Old Fred Smith works from a box
Oh what a haggard face
Hope he gets lots of shots
From his fender bass
