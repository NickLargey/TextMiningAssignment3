Reg and Coozy
Sitting on the couch
She wants to eat
The Cooze ain't no slouch
She says come on baby
I want a Sara Lee up my crack
The Cooze is getting hot
She wants some action in the sack
On his back
On his back
Run run starts to quack
He says, "stop! this ain't pop!"
And besides it's just too
Too animalistic
Too animalistic
French provincial
It's growing everywhere
His t-shirt's inside out
Peroxide fills the air
She says come on baby 
I want some donut up my rack
The Cooze is getting hot
She wants some action in the sack
