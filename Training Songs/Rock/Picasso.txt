What did we expect?
There's no way to keep things up like this.
Take me out of focus.
What did I expect?

This is a new life,
How could I have let this turn into my life? 

Now that we've finally focused 
We're running through and we're getting by.
Is that all we can say for ourselves?

Are you listening?
Are you with me?
