You got all the sugar you'll ever need
You're gonna give some of your sugar to me
You got all your demons held at bay
You're gonna drive some of my demons away

Sweet, sweet sugar to me
Please let me know when your kisses are free
Red, red light in the wine
Please let me know when you're gonna be mine

You got all your glory to find someday
Sit down with me and let the time pass away
When you're gone tomorrow very far
You can't remember me here where we are

Sweet, sweet sugar to me
Please let me know when your kisses are free
Red, red light in the wine
Please let me know when you're gonna be mine

You got all the sugar you'll ever need
You're gonna give some of your sugar to me
You got all your demons held at bay
You're gonna drive some of my demons away

Sweet, sweet sugar to me
Please let me know when your kisses are free
