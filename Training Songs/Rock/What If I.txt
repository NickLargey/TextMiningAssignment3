I've heard it all before
Could hear it all a thousand times more
Playing with me all the time
No one feels the same
And sanity is all a game
Locked up deep inside my mind

Hey die - you want an alibi
Hey quit - you want to get a fix
Hey try - you'll never make it tonight
You can feel it deep inside
All of the illusions for myself
What if I try to make amends for someone else
What if I try to change the way I'm feeling deep inside
What if I died filled with sorrow wanting another try

No one can face the truth
Was there nothing more that you could do
What would you do different next time
Keep turning from the past
The future's coming much to fast
Or is it all in my mind
