Up in the mornin' and out to school
The teacher is teachin' the golden rule
American history and practical math
You're studyin' hard and hopin' to pass
Oh, you're workin' your finger right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone.

Ring, ring goes the bell
The cook in the kitchen is ready to sell
But you're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you got time to eat
Well back in to class and open your books
Gee but the teacher don't know how mean she looks

Hail hail rock-n-roll [Repeat: x6]

As soon as three o'clock rolls around
And you lay your burden down
Throw down your books and outta your seat
You go down the hallway and into the street
Up to the corner and 'round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in

You drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear somthin' that's really hot
With the one you love you're makin' romance
All day long you've been waitin' to dance
And you feel the music from head to toe
Round and round and round and round you go

Long live rock n roll [Repeat: x4]

Rock rock rock n roll
