It's the coldest place on earth
Here in my heart tonight
With everything I'm worth 
I still want you 

I know words can never change
The way that you feel about me now
But I've just got to say
I still love you

Cause every night I lie awake
Going back in time
Playing it over and over again
I must have been out of my mind

Oh baby, love me like you used to do 
I'll do anything that you want me to 
Believe me I'll be good to you
There's a hole in my heart
Only you can fill
One more chance baby say you will 
Believe me, I'll be good to you

It's a mystery to me
Just who I was that let you go 
I can't believe I did it
Cause I still love you

Oh baby, love me like you used to do 
I'll do anything that you want me to 
Believe me I'll be good to you
There's a hole in my heart
Only you can fill
One more chance baby say you will 
Believe me, I'll be good to you

Remember me baby, remember my kiss
No one out there
Is gonna love you like this
I'll be good to you

I'm going in circles 
Stuck like a broken record
Goin' around and around
Playing it over and over and over again
Oh don't let me down

Oh baby, love me like you used to do 
I'll do anything that you want me to 
Believe me I'll be good to you
There's a hole in my heart
Only you can fill
One more chance baby say you will 
Believe me, I'll be good to you
