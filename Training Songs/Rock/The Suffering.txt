I saw the stars in your eyes 
And I knew it was puppy school love

You saw the twinkle in mine
Then we both knew it was time to hold our breath
And run and get committed

We got lost in a sea of love and lust 
With a galaxy of trust
We were soon committed
To each other like a mussel in a clam
To the movies to the mall glued together hand in hand

And we walked and ran through love land
Everything was fine
Until my baby took me for my very last dime

Bang, bang, shoot me dead
Thought my baby loved me
But I`d been mislead

My, my she sucked me dry
Now the little Ms. wants to say bye bye

Once I was a King
Now I`m wrapped around her finger
Like a diamond ring

The engagement ring
The wedding ring
The church bells ring
And the suffering

Understand I`m a man
Who believes in the glory of love
You`re a fool and a sucka
True love is the light shining bright
From the Heavens, The Heavens above
You cold motherfucker

I believe, I believe it is better to trust
Even when I`m wrong
Be careful you`re my brother
Than to let my fear drive me
From the home where I have belonged

She was my Queen to protect and serve
Then she threw me a curve
Skam skimmin` gold diggin`
Kick me to the curb

Bang, bang, shoot me dead
Thought my baby loved me
But I`d been mislead

My, my she sucked me dry
Now the little Ms. wants to say bye bye

Once I was a King
Now I`m wrapped around her finger
Like a diamond ring

The engagement ring
The wedding ring
The church bells ring
And the suffering

I know what they say on the street
She`s a cheat and a thief and a liar
And everybody knows it
But she`s my light and my love and my hope
And my only desire
You`re anger can`t control it

She broke the bank, then she took my car
That chick stole my heart

Should have known from the start
Bang, bang, shoot me dead
Thought my baby loved me
But I`d been mislead

My, my she sucked me dry
Now the little Ms. wants to say bye bye

Once I was a King
Now I`m wrapped around her finger
Like a diamond ring

The engagement ring
The wedding ring
The church bells ring
And the suffering
