Help me, Help me
Help me in this hour
Hold me, Hold me
Hold me in your power
Walk, walk, walk with me
And tell me everything you know
Walk, walk, walk with me
Tell me what I need to know
Cause I'm standing by the ocean
Waiting for my ship to sail

Cool me, cool me
Cool me from the flames
Tell me, tell me
Tell me what's your name
Walk, walk, walk with me
Tell me everything you know
Walk, walk, walk with me
Tell me all I need to know
'Cause I'm standing at the station
Waitin' for the train to roll

Guide me, guide me
Guide me thu this maze
Lead me, lead me
Lead me through the haze
Walk, walk, walk with me
Tell everything you know
Walk, walk, walk with me
Tell me all I need to know
Cause I'm stranded on this island
Waitin' for my love to show

Hear me, hear me
Hear me in this hour
Help me, Help me
Help me climb your tower
Walk, walk, walk with me
And tell me everything you know
Walk, walk, walk with me
Tell me all I need to know
Cause I'm standing at the crossroads
Waitin' for the guide to show

Let's walk
