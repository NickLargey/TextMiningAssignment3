Well, you've seen us before,
You're going to see us again, ya'll,
We're back in town now, We're playing to win.
Foot stompin' brothers, that's what we are,
No fancy pants, ain't no super star.
You say you came for the party, babe,
You came for the show.
The boys are feeling hot and I'm a ready to go.
So if you're feeling good, if you feel alright,
We're going to have a rock 'n roll time tonight.

[Chorus]
So c'mon people won't you free your soul,
c'mon babe, let's rock 'n roll.
I want that sweet little missy,
Down there on that front row,
She's looking real fine, babe,
She's ready to go.
She'll get you feeling good, if you feel alright,
Guarantee you good good rockin' tonight.

[Chorus]
So c'mon baby let's rock 'n roll,
Me and my boys we got total control.
So c'mon people won't you free your soul.
