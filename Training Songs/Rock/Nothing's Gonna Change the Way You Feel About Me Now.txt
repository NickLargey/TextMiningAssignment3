It's a shame baby 
Nothing that you could do 
Things change babe 
Such as my feelings for you 

Just look foolish when you put me out 
Is nothing gonna change then if you feel about me now 
You lay down the sleep the morning 
When you wake up alone 
And you still smell my
So drink up baby try to push me out 
Nothing's gonna change about the way you feel me out 
I know it's wrong I forgot to admit 
I shouldn't have said 

I never love you, I never love you 
I never love, never love, never love 

So today turn to weeks count to forget 
Broken heart you thought you'll always be
So pack up baby tryin' put me out 
Nothing's gonna change the way you feel about me now
