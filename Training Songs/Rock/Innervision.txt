Well, I have a home 
Longing to roam
I have to find you
I have to meet you

Sanctum your face
Slowing your pace
I need your guidance 
I need to seek my

Innervision
Innervision

My pupils dance
Lost in a trance
Your sacred silence
Losing all violence

Stars in their place
Mirror your face
I need to find you
I need to seek my

Innervision
Innervision
Innervision

It's never too late to reinvent the bicycle
Small breaks for the new
Giving you life
Giving you force

It's never too late to reinvent the bicycle
Small breaks for the new
Giving you life
Giving you force

Vision

There's only one true path in life
The road that leads to all leads to one 

There's only one true path in life (Innervision)
The road that leads to all leads to one (Innervision)

Your sacred silence
Losing all violence
