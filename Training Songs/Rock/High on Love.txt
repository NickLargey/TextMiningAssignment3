High on your love, just can't get enough
It's movin' too fast, makin' it last
You come to me at the right time
Mornin', noon and night time

Nothing can stop me
When my baby rock me

Ooh baby, feel like makin' love to you
Ooh baby, well, I never knew
What your love can do, oh

I'm high on love, I'm high on love
I'm high on your love
I'm high on love, I'm high on love
I'm high on your love

Playin' with fire, heat rising higher
Love's got me burning, good things I'm learning
I ain't seen the sun in a long time
Love keeps runnin' through my mind

Nothing can save me
But the love that you gave me

Ooh baby, hold me tight, move it slow
Ooh baby, I can feel the flow
Baby, don't let go, no

I'm high on love, I'm high on love
I'm high on your love
I'm high on love, I'm high on love
I'm high on your love, yeah

Ooh baby, hold me tight, move it slow
Ooh baby, I can feel the flow
Baby don't let go, no, no

I'm high on love, I'm high on love
I'm high on your love
I'm high on love, I'm high on love
I'm high on your love

Nothing can stop me
