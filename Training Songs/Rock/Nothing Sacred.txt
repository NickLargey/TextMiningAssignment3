It would take a wide net to drag that deep 
Through all the years, the years I believed you
And you'd be hard pressed to face the fact of all the lies
And the fears that deceived you

But you say "it doesn't matter now angel, there's nothing standing in your way
Did I forget to mention how I'm done with you, it's not my problem anymore"

To be true to be kind to never walk away
And it's true you were blind no matter what I would say to you
Is there nothing sacred, to you?

I will turn my back to the wind in your wake
To the cold shards of the lives strewn behind you
Your record's scratched but these lines will break
Through the drone of time 'til their meaning will find you

But I say "It doesn't matter now, Angel, there's nothing standing in your way
Did I forget to mention how I'm done with you, it's not my problem anymore"

To be true to be kind to never walk away
And it's true you were blind no matter what I would say to you
Is there nothing sacred, to you?
Nothing sacred, nothing sacred
