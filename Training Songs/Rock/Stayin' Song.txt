I stopped 'cause there was nothing else to do
And I thought I'd stick around for just a while
But I warned you like the west wind, I was only blowin' through
And no one could ever make me change my style 

'Cause I never sung no stayin' song before
I've done them blues and good-bye tunes a thousand times or more
And it seems a little strange that I ain't headin' for the door
But I never sung no stayin' song, I never thought I'd stay this long, I never sung no stayin' song before

I usually leave when all the words are said
But with you there's always more sweet things to say
And when my mind starts a wanderin'up that windin' road ahead
My feet don't seem to want to walk away 

And I never sung no stayin' song before
I've done them blues and good-bye tunes a thousand times or more
And it seems a little strange that I ain't headin' for the door
But I never sung no stayin' song, I never thought I'd stay this long, I never sung no stayin' song before 

Last night I heard an old freight whistle blow
As I was sleeping warmly in your bed
And it told me, boy it's time that you was packing up to go
But I smiled and shook the leaving from my head

And I never sung no stayin' song before
I've done them blues and good-bye tunes a thousand times or more
And it seems a little strange that I ain't headin' for the door
But I never sung no stayin' song, I never thought I'd stay this long, I never sung no stayin' song before

I never sung no stayin' song, I never thought I'd stay this long, I never sung no stayin' song before
(I don't think so)
I never sung no stayin' song, I never thought I'd stay this long...
