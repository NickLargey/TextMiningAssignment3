I’m fighting a war that I did not choose
I’m hosting the blame when my ego’s bruised
I’m pointing the gun towards my oldest friend
I’ll carry your heart till the bitter end

Now you own a lifetime, of woes,
But they ain't mine

You know I love you so,
Even though I can't let you know
You know I love you so,
Forgetting all of my trials
You know I left you lonely
You always leave me with doubt
You know I love you so,
And so, and so, and so, and so

I'm falling apart at my every seam
I'm chasing my tail whilst you chase your dream
Inhaling the stench of my love's betrayal
Keep ignoring the signs, darling you'll prevail

Cause you own a lifetime, of woes,
But they ain't mine
And you sold my life line
So I'm blue when the bell chimes

You know I love you so,
Even though I can't let you know
You know I love you so,
Forgetting all of my trials
You know I left you lonely
You always leave me with doubt
You know I love you so,
And so, and so, and so, and so

Do you know I love you so
In my heart, that's when you're home
I know you leave me lonely
I know you leave me lost
Still my heart goes
And so and so and so and so

You know I love you so,
Even though I can't let you go
You know I love you so,
Forgetting all of my trials
You know I left you lonely
You always leave me with doubt
You know I love you so,
And so, and so, and so, and so
