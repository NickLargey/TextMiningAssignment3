You ask me how I feel, well suddenly this is all for real
It hasn't seemed like that till now
I it's as if you almost were still mine somehow
I hope you've realized just how I'm being so civilized
But it's nearly time I went
We've got one last chance to have an argument
And watching you walk back to your car
Was the lowest point of my life so far
Don't stare into my eyes, I couldn't bear for you to realize
That I'm still desperately in love with you
And darling that's all I can think of
It'll get easier every day, well I'll be five thousand miles away
And I'm good at hiding pain but now I really should get on that plane
And watching you walk back to your car
Was the lowest point of my life so far
As if you still could ever do a single thing
That'd make me hate you
