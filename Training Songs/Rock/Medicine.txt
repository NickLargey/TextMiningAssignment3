You can find another country if you want
Somewhere you can hide yourself away
Find yourself another set of holes to haunt
Get yourself another debt that you can't pay

Yeah, you can try to run for cover everywhere
Add another letter to your name
Burn everything you ever used to wear
Get yourself another lover that looks the same

But sometimes it's the medicine
Sometimes it's the medicine
Yeah, sometimes it's the medicine itself
That makes the pain

Well, you can always make another move again
Another set of keys, a different town
And you can try to lose yourself in them
Till the truth it catches up and cuts you down

'Cause sometimes it's the medicine
Sometimes it's the medicine
Yeah, sometimes it's the medicine itself
That makes the pain

And you can always hide the wreckage
That you come from
But every new disguise
Is just another lie to run from

Yeah, you can only try to fool yourself so long
With any kind of measure you can find
'Cause every phony pleasure you've been on
Has lifted off and left the pain behind

'Cause sometimes it's the medicine
Sometimes it's the medicine
Yeah, sometimes it's the medicine itself
That makes the pain
