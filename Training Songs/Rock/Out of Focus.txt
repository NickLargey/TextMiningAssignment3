I saw a glittering dawn
I saw a beautiful morning
Shining on the hill
And I grabbed the cat by the tail
The future with my finger nails
But now I live in fear

It's all out of focus
It's all, baby, so unclear
It's all out of focus
It's all, baby, so unreal

I saw towering spires
I heard beautiful chimes
I heard them peal
I saw visions of grace
I saw a heavenly place
Then it disappeared

Maybe I lied a little bit too much
Maybe I cried a little bit too much
I saw the future just shatter like glass

It's all out of focus
It's all, baby, so unclear
It's all out of focus
And nothing is revealed

I was walking in clouds
Yeah and talking so proud
But I did not hear
Voices singing so loud
Saying you're tumbling down
To the streets of tears

Maybe I lied a little bit too much
Sometime I cried a little bit too much
I saw the future just shatter like glass

It's all out of focus
It's all, baby, so unclear
It's all out of focus
It's all, baby, so unreal

Sometime I lied a little bit too hard
Sometime I cried a little bit too hard
I saw the future just vanish like glass

It's all out of focus
It's all, baby, so unclear
It's all out of focus
And nothing is revealed
