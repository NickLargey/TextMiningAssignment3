If I had the wings of an eagle,
Over these broken dreams I will fly.
If I could be shot like an arrow.
Straight to you, in your arms I will lie.
Don't you know I love you?
Don't you know I love you so?
 
If I had the strength of a lion,
There'd be no one to keep us apart.
And if I was to crack just like thunder,
I would shout what I feel in my heart.
Don't you know I love you?
Don't you know I need you so?
 
Need you so much,
The melody's coming in clear. (so clear)
And with your touch,
The music keeps going around and around in my ears.
 
All right!
Don't you know I love you?
Don't you know I need you so?
 
If I had to live life without you,
I'd be lost like a ship in the night.
Your love never gave me no warning,
Like a bird I was shot down in flight.
Don't you know I love you?
Don't you know I love you so? 
 
Don't you know I love you?
Don't you know I need you so? (need you so)
 
Don't you know I love you?
Don't you know I love you so? 
 
Don't you know I love you?
Don't you know I need you so? (need you so)
 
Don't you know I love you?
Don't you know I love you so? 
 
Don't you know I love you?
Don't you know I need you so? (need you so)
