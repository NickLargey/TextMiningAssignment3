It's so hard that it's funny that a heart like yours could be empty of love
Someone's gotta in for you 
And it hurts so bad must be heaven above
I'm not gona tell you what to do
But for what is worth if I were you
I'd move on
Dance your little dance
Pick up the pieces 
Move on and keep dancing until you find emotion
It's so hard that it's funny when you love someone enough to get down and pray
Like a fool and his money
The harder you held on the more he slipped away
I'm not gonna tell you what to do
But for what is worth if I were you
I would move on and I would pick up the pieces
I can see that you need more than I can ever be
But you know that if I was your man I would never let you cry
Never let you cry again
He went a major cry
He left you high and dry
But in your mind's eye you still love him
I wish that I could be as half as rich as him
And have you loving me by some religion.
