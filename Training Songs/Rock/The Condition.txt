Curled up on the sofa with your tail between your legs
I won't pretend that I know you, but I wish just one time
I could get inside your head
All the treasures that you're hiding
All your secrets never safe
Are adding up to lines of frustration
I read it on your face

You know I love you even when you run away from me
But I don't want to chase you any more
So if you have to go away then I won't make you stay
Just lie awake and listen for the door

With a lack of direction
With eyes sad and red
In need of affection
You wind up on my bed
And all the treasures that you're hiding
You know they're never safe with me
Won't let you be my god
Won't let you be my slave
What else is there left to be

You know I love you even when you run away from me
But I don't want to chase you any more
So if you have to go away then I won't make you stay
Just lie awake and listen for the door
