It’s not a shame to be afraid
I know you’re trying to be brave
But I know that it’s okay
You can let your heart go
I can’t erase your pain
But I do my best to keep you safe
I know it’s hard to trust
But you can count on me
Oh

If I have to face the darkest night
Through the wildest storm
Just to let you know
I would give up everything
Just to keep you warm
Anything to show you
I’m here
I’m here

I don’t believe in destiny
But you mean everything to me
I’m not the kind to use a million words
Even if I’ll want it to

If I have to face the darkest night
Through the wildest storm
Just to let you know
I would give up everything
Just to keep you warm
Anything to show you
I’m here
I’m here

I could paint a picture
But I might get it wrong
And I could tell a story
But it might go on too long
And I could join an orchestra
Pretend to play along
Sometimes I might be lost for words
I’m here
I’m here

And if I have to face the darkest night
Through the wildest storm
Just to let you know
I would give up everything
Just to keep you warm
Anything to show you
I’m here
