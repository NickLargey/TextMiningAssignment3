What is it like to choke on every word you said.
What is it like to shit on everything you had?
Lowest of the low.
I'll never fucking be like you.
Lowest of the low.
Now sink into your fucking hell.
What is it like to become what you once despised?
What is it like to pile lies on top of lies?
Lowest of the low.
So now you sink into your hell.
All the people you used, it's coming back at you.
All the promise broke, on them you fucking choke.
