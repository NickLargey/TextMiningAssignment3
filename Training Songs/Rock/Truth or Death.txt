Lies, betrayal, lies
Truth or death.
Lies, betrayal, lies.

Who the f*ck can I trust
The whole fuckin' world is built on deception,
False perception, look you dead in the eye and lie,
Your best friend'll stab you in the back
Yo, what the f*ck is that.

Politicians lie,
What the f*ck is that
Your lover lies,
What the f*ck is that.
The police lies,
What the f*ck is that
The church fuckin' lies,
What the f*ck is that.

Somebody tell me where's the truth
Every holy book is written by man probably by a liar's hand
And if you feel that public schools are teachin'
Truth to the youth, motherfucka you livin' a lie too.

Lawyers lie, what the fuckis that
Doctorslie, what the f*ck is that
Doctors lie, what the f*ck is that
Your mother and father lie,
What the f*ck is that
You lie to yourself
Yo, what the f*ck is that

There is no truth only varaiations of lies.
Don't try to figure it out honesty is extinct and if
It ever did exist the human race took it out.
