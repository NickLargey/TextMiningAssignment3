Thirteen valleys he has wandered for her love
For he thinks he is the one that she dreams of
But her bed was made elsewhere
From the first day she got there
Now he wanders thirteen valleys crying out
Now he wanders thirteen valleys crying out

"It could've been me
I said it could've been me"
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on

Thirteen valleys she has gone since morning came
For she gave so much that only love remained
But her lover is long gone
With the money she sent home
Now she wanders thirteen valleys crying out
Now she wanders thirteen valleys crying out

"It could've been me
I said it could've been me"
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on

That broken heart will be forever and a lifetime
That broken heart will dry up love that's gone before
And you may fight and you may run
But what was past is now undone
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on

Thirteen valleys lie in silence in the haze
Filled with promises and spirits that we raised
But the spirits all are ghosts
Of the ones we hurt the most
And they wander thirteen valleys crying out
And they wander thirteen valleys crying out

"It could've been me
I said it could've been me"
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on
It could've been me
I said it could've been me
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on

That broken heart will be forever and a lifetime
That broken heart will dry up love that's gone before
And you may fight or you may run
But what was past is now undone
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on
