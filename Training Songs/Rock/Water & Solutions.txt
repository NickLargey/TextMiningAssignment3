When rumors of aliens were true
When I found out one of them was you
Bought fortunes from carnival seers, saw them through
Soon, a light on
Stand up, turn and face me

Believe what you believe
Don't just stand their suffering
Talking about your freedom
Soon, a light on
Soon my doubles will pull off all of my stunts

Water and solutions
Fires left ablaze, pleasure in the problems
If I could give them all away, what's left for me?
Define God is all I want
To treat my love as me
