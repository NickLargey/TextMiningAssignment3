Joey comes from a sacred part of town
Where sometimes you talk so tough
Your feet don't touch the ground
And the sidewalk soldiers sing the midnight blues
While the old men recite their story lines about when I was young like you
They say oh yeah we were cruising to the back beat
Oh yeah, making love in the backseats
We were wild, wild in the streets
Wild in the streets

A member of the boy's brigade had a date with the girl next door
You know it made her daddy crazy
It only made her want him more
They weren't looking for trouble
That boy didn't want a fight, not tonight
So she headed out thru her bathroom window
What her daddy didn't know was gonna be alright
They said oh yeah we were cruising to the backbeat
Oh yeah, making love in the backseats

We were wild, wild in the streets
Wild, wild in the streets
We were wild, wild in the streets
Wild, wild in the streets

Rock me
Sometimes this town ain't pretty but you know it ain't so bad
Just like a girl who looks so happy when inside she's so so sad
In here we got this code of honor nobody's going down
You don't walk in vain trough the kid's parade
'Cause this is my hometown

Wild, wild in the streets
Wild, wild in the streets
We were wild, wild in the streets
Wild, wild in the streets

We were wild in the streets
wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
We were wild, wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild
