You see things in me
That nobody else could see
Or had looked quite deep enough to find
You passed over all my faults
And still came through it all
When no-one else would have taken the time
And without as much as a word or a touch
You had me wanting you

Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
I love you like I do
Is it any wonder

In a world of fakery
Your touch of sincerity
I have come to depend upon
Seems you know just what to say
When the mood I'm in is gray
And your smile works like a magic wand
And on top of this, how could anyone resist
Wanting to be a part of you
