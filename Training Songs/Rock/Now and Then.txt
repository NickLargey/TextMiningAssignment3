Days pass and the weeks go by
Dream for hours 'bout the future
See the faces and the names go by
Between now and then
These days

Years pass and your life goes by
All the while you stop to wonder
Brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers lie
Between now and then
These days
Between now and then
These days
Do you walk all the way?
Carry all that weight
Do you walk all the way?
Now and then

Days pass and the weeks go by
Dream for hours 'bout the future
See the faces and the names go by
Between now and then
These days
Between now and then
These days
Between now and then
These days
