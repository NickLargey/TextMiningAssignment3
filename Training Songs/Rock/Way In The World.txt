I'm working in a retail store
It's not what I'm cutout for
I live for my breaks
I know there's something more
So much to explore
But it feels so far away

I'm not lost
I'm just finding
My way
In the world
I'm not lost
I'm just finding
My way
In the world
In the big old world

Do you ever, do you ever, do you wonder?
Wonder where your dreams go?
Do you feel like you're falling under?
Under it all?
Do you ever, do you ever, do you wonder?
Wonder where your dreams go?
Do you feel like you're falling under?
Under it all?

I don't know if it's bad or good
Walking down the street without you
I don't know quite what I want
But one thing I've got
Is a good idea of what I'm not

I'm not lost
I'm just finding
My way
In the world
I'm not lost
I'm just finding
My way
In the world
In the big old world

Do you ever, do you ever, do you wonder?
Wonder where your dreams go?
Do you feel like you're falling under?
Under it all?
Do you ever, do you ever, do you wonder?
Wonder where your dreams go?
Do you feel like you're falling under?
Under it all?

Ain't a store, not at work, can I take my seat
At the front of the bus and my headphones pleat
And right there in a flash with tears on my cheeks
I can suddenly see

We're not lost
We're just finding
Our way
In the world
We're not lost
We're just finding
Our way
In the world
In the big old world

Do you ever, do you ever, do you wonder?
Wonder where your dreams go?
Do you feel like you're falling under?
Under it all?
Do you ever, do you ever, do you wonder?
Wonder where your dreams go?
Do you feel like you're falling under?
Under it all?

Do you ever, do you ever, do you wonder?
Wonder where your dreams go?
Do you feel like you're falling under?
Under it all?
Do you ever, do you ever, do you wonder?
Wonder where your dreams go?
Do you feel like you're falling under?

I'm not lost
I'm just finding
My way
In the world
In the big old world
