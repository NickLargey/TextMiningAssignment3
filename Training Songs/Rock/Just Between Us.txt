U came like a silent breeze
Heaven sent like an angel
I knew I'd tear apart
2 hearts left 2 wander

Can 2 lovers 
Turn strangers
Pretend thru the nite
That love is alive...?

Oh, just between us
Lies can wait until the morning dawn
Oh, just between us
2nite we will B as 1

Fool's rain fallin' down on me  
As I walk alone
I'm dreamin' of that 1 day
U'll B back again

Can 2 lovers 
Turn strangers
Pretend thru the nite
That love is alive...?

Oh, just between us
Lies can wait until the morning dawn
Oh, just between us
2nite we will B as 1

Oh, just between us
Lies can wait until the morning dawn
Oh, just between us
2nite we will B as 1

Oh, just between us
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
Oh, just between us
2nite we will B as 1
