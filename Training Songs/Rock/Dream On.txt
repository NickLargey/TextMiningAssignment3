Pinch me darlin' I think I'm dreamin'
This is too good to be true
I've spent my whole life looking around
For a man I know now was you

Where have you been hiding yourself
All of my lonely nights?
If you're a dream, don't let me wake
Let me dream on

I spent a lot of years running around
Walking fast in little towns
I had a lot of men offer me love
And I didn't turn all of them down

I never knew a man like you
Never in my born days
If you're a dream, oh, don't let me wake
Let me dream on

Let me sleep if I'm dreamin'
Let me sleep on
Dreamin' of you

I've never been so close to heaven
Never felt so much at home
It's like an old-time forty's movie
Where nobody winds up alone

I knew somewhere there were dreams coming true
Finally one of them is mine
If you're a dream, please let me believe
That life could be so fine

Let me sleep if I'm dreamin'
Let me sleep on
Dreamin' of you
All of my life I've been dreamin'
Let me wake up here in this dream with you

Dream on
Dream on
Let me dream on
Dream on

Dream on
Dream on
Let me dream on
Dream on

Dream on
Dream on
Let me dream on
Dream on
