Fells like I'm going through the motions in the dark
In a worls that leaves me with an uninspired heart

All I know, is I'm so tired
Living life a barely feel
Give me hope, give me fire
Gimme something real

'Cause I don't wanna keep sleep-walking through
Endless days, I've had enough of
Going nowhere, God I want to
Wake up! wake up!
Wake up!

It's now or never come and pull me from this dream
Where everything is colorless and nothing is what it seems

I believe, only you can make me come alive
Help me be so consumed, open up my eyes

'Cause I don't wanna keep sleep-walking through 
Endless days, I've had enough of
Going nowhere, God I want to 
Wake up! wake up!
Wake up!

Half Asleep
I'm so bored
Counting sheep

'Cause I don't wanna keep sleep-walking through
Endless days, I've had enough of
Going nowhere, God I want to
Wake up! wake up!
Wake up!
'Cause I don't wanna keep sleep-walking through
Endless days, I've had enough of
Going nowhere, God I want to
Wake up! wake up!
Wake up!

Half asleep
I'm so bored
Counting sheep
Wake up!

Half asleep
I'm so bored
Counting sheep
