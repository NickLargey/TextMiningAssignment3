This one will not change, turn down that fad again
Complacency, overcome, overdone
Everlasting, I have won, second chance
It's just begun

This one will not change, turn down that fad again
Complacency, overcome, overdone
Everlasting, I have won, second chance
It's just begun

Stuck down in convenience tradition chosen way
Who describes, who decides our idea of fun
I will not become what I despise
I found a reason, your truth's a lie

Directed, attached, reason will overcome
The bounds of discomfort, we still are waiting
I will not become what I despise
I found a reason, your truth's a lie

Struggle to overcome generations of second hand liars
Struggle to overcome the past mistakes
Struggle to overcome generations of second hand liars
Struggle to overcome the past, the past mistakes

This one will not change, turn down that fad again
Complacency, overcome, overdone
Everlasting, I have won, second chance
It's just begun
