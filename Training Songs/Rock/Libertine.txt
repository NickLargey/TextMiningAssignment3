I don’t need your lies 
Cause you don’t impress me, you see
The ice is getting thin
Time to turn around and go home

I won’t fight this war for you
All I do is passing through in your life
I tell you it’s over tonight

Libertine, you are like stardust in the rain
Illusion fades
You’re just one shadow in this game
Libertine, you think you’re free
But your heart is chained
It’s just an illusion
A pale illusion of what life really is

I don’t need your bliss
Cause it’s not shiny
The nights are getting colder
When you’re alone
When you’re older
