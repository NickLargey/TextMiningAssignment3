Everybody get on your feet
You make me nervous when you in your seat
Take off your shoes and pat your feet
We're doing a dance that can't be beat
We're barefootin'
Barefootin'
Barefootin'
Barefootin'

Went to a party the other night
Long Tall Sally was out of sight
She threw her wig, and her high sneakers too
She was doing a dance without any shoes
She was barefootin'
Barefootin'
Barefootin'
Barefootin'

Hey little girl with the red dress on
I bet you can barefoot all night long
Take off your shoes and throw them away
Come back and get them another day
Barefootin'
Barefootin'
Barefootin'
Barefootin'

Lil John Henry he said to Sue
If I can barefoot, you can barefoot too
Sue told John, I can get out here and groove
I was barefootin ever since I was two
Barefootin'
Barefootin'
Barefootin'
Barefootin'
Take off your shoes and dance
Barefootin'
Barefootin'
Barefootin'
Barefootin'
