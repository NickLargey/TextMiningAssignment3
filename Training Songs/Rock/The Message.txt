I hope our message is clear
We haven't made contact in thousands of years
Surprised you forgot us so soon
And now you've got your own stance
You fly in our space without asking our guidance
We want you to know there ain't room
For two
[Ba ba ba]
We have always ignored you [Ba ba ba]
We can no longer afford to [Ba ba ba]
So we'll just have to destroy you [Ba ba ba]
You're such an arrogant crowd
To think you're the only species that counts
We want you to know how it feels
To know your rights have gone wrong
And ... yourself it's taking too long
Well have a step in a reveal
We're real
[Ba ba ba]
We have always ignored you [Ba ba ba]
We can no longer afford to [Ba ba ba]
So we'll just have to destroy you [Ba ba ba]
Satellites always get in our way
We simmer our sets and get crap from LA
Told you before in an underhand way
Orbital ... will go the wrong way
Ancient crafts just fly in our space
And 90 percent are left to this waste
90 percent are left to this waste
[Ba ba ba]
We have always ignored you [Ba ba ba]
We can no longer afford to [Ba ba ba]
So we'll just have to destroy you [Ba ba ba]
We have tried to ignore you [Oooh]
We can no longer afford to
So we'll just have to destroy you [Ba ba ba ba ba]
[Ba ba ba]
[Ba ba ba]
[Ba ba ba]
