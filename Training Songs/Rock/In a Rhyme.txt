Ticke ticke talking
Around my head
Voices everywhere
Covering my ears
And hope they will
Vanish in the air

Some precious moments hoping
They will last forever
Some precious moments

For a while I find everything I need
For a while I find everything I need

Ticke ticke talking
Within my room
Staring at the wall
Memories are passing
Through my mind
And I can recall
