You tell me that you love me, baby
Then you say you don't
You tell me that you'll come on over
Then you say you won't

You love me like a hurricane
Then you start to freeze
I give it to you straight right now
Please don't tease

Oh, please don't tease me
You know it hurts so much
Come on and squeeze me
You know I long for your tender touch

You come right out and tell me
You're out with someone new
You play it, oh, so doggone cool
I don't know what to do

You never seem to answer me
You just don't hear my pleas
I give it to you straight right now
Please don't tease

Oh, please don't tease me
You know it hurts so much
Come on and squeeze me
You know I long for your tender touch

You come right out and tell me
You're out with someone new
You play it, oh, so doggone cool
I don't know what to do

You never seem to answer me
You just don't hear my pleas
I give it to you straight right now
Please don't tease
