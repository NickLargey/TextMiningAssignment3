wish we'd end this suffering
And all this crazy ranting
Instead of weapon waving
There would be lives we're saving

Pushin' hard

Me fear is for the children
And for the lives they're building
I wish I knew the answer
We could avoid desaster

Pushin' hard

So let the sun stream on down from the sky
And let the moments slip on slowly by
Instead of pushin' hard
We wouldn't feel so lonely inside

I wish we end... [Repeat]
And all this...
I wish I knew the answer
We could avoid desaster
