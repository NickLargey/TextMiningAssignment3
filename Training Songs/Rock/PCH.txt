All along the beaches of the PCH
Quiet 'til I kiss you off
Looking at the mirrors 'til they fade away
Hoping that I'm not in love

The wind is in our eyes
Itâ€™s hard to see your face
Pull over to the shoulder (ah)
Some things people say put me in a spin
Some things people say keep me guessing
Keep me guessing

(Talk it up)
I heard this one before you
I'm still a sucker for it
(Talk it up)
You know I can't ignore it
I'm always falling for it

Tearing up the speakers of my GTO
Loud enough to piss you off
Adding all the words together one by one
Hoping that you're not in love

Who cares if that's the truth
I'm looking in the dust
I'm seeing what you're seeing (ah)
Some things people say put me in a spin
Some things people people say keep me guessing
Keep me guessing

(Talk it up)
I heard this one before you
I'm still a sucker for it
(Talk it up)
You know I can't ignore it
I'm always falling for it

I'm still a sucker for it

(Talk it up)
I heard this one before you
I'm still a sucker for it
(Talk it up)
You know I can't ignore it
I'm always falling for it
Falling for it

(Talk it up)
Falling for it
(Talk it up)
I'm falling for it
(Talk it up)

I heard this one before you
I'm still a sucker for it
