You sold your soul
When you drank the morning dew
Down on your luck
And so thirsty through and through
The crack in the mirror
Tells of seven years of pain
And you won't let me down again

Drive through the night
Just to see the ocean green
Race to the coast
There's no telling where I've been
Both eyes on the road ahead
Don't wanna look behind
And you won't let me down again

Ten miles of the city
And I lose you in the rain
So you won't let me down again

Aeroplane, aeroplane
Race across the fields
Taking me home
Was further from the deals
Your father was a weaker man
Give up without a sound
But you won't let me down again

Strength is in the solitude
I tried to obtain
But you won't let me down again

A head full of visions
I struggle to recall
Those ancient of wisdoms
Are poured into us all
Air will crackle in the heat
The harvest moon will reign
And you won't let me down again

And I don't look for pity
So if it's all the same
You won't let me down again

You won't let me down again
