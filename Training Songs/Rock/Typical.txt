She struts up to me 
She whispers my name as if I know her
But I never knew her

She asks me the time
A quarter to one, we go for a drive
I just don't know her

On the coldest night
In the darkest room
I will sleep alone
'cause it's better than you
Yeah, it's better than you

You can't play me like that
It's a matter of fact
You're nothing more than a typical whore
And I won't be your fool 
Anymore

I go to her house
Flip on the telly and lie on the couch
But I don't feel her
Anymore

She asks me to bed
This is the end of my disenchantment
Now that I'm walking out the door

On the coldest night
In the darkest room
I will sleep alone
'cause it's better than you
Yeah, it's better than you

You can't play me like that
It's a matter of fact
You're nothing more than a typical whore
And I won't be your fool 
Anymore

Maybe some day you'll get it
Perhaps you'll regret it
Or maybe you'll find someone else who accepts it
I won't be the one

You can't play me like that, it's a matter of fact
You can't play me like that, it's a matter of fact

On the coldest night
In the darkest room
I will sleep alone
'cause it's better than you
Yeah, it's better than you

You can't play me like that
It's a matter of fact
You're nothing more than a typical whore
And I won't be your fool 
Anymore

Maybe some day you'll get it
Perhaps you'll regret it
Or maybe you'll find someone else who accepts it
I won't be the one
