Samson was a comfortable racehorse
Samson was an easy ride
Samson was born to be a racehorse
Samson gave us a pony and died
And one day Samson he kicked to the left
Samson he kicked to the right
Samson he kicked out the door
Samson he kicked out his light
He was a thoroughbred
Who knew his time had come
So when the boy pulled the trigger he was ready to go
Here come Delila
She was screaming at the sun
But it's alright
He said it's alright with him
It's alright, it was alright with him
Delila, fell in love in the summertime
But Samson had too much pride
So she loved him
From a distance
She called him black electra-glide
And one day Samson, he turned to the left
Samson he turned to the right
Something was moving through the grass
Something spooky and tight
It was a rattlesnake striking out from the bushes
And Samson was a hero only just in time
Said Delila
I want to be with you forever
If it's alright
And it was alright with him
And it was alright
It was alright with him
They called him Samson
Because his mane was long
And he was carved out of muscle
He was big and strong
We'll build a statue
So he can be with us always
And it's alright
I know it's alright with him
It's alright
I know it's alright with him
Samson grew old in the winter
But Samson still lived for the racing days
But there were rumors
Flying round the racetrack
They were putting him out to graze
So one day Samson he kicked to the left
Samson he kicked to the right
Samson wouldn't wait for the doctor
Samson couldn't live through the night
He was a thoroughbred
Who knew his time had come
And a bullet would be quicker than a broken heart
And Delila, she was carrying his son
So it's alright
It was alright with him
I know it's alright
It's alright with him
He said it's alright
It's alright with him
