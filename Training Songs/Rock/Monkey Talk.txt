Monkey see, monkey do
Monkey want to talk to you
Monkey got a lot to say
Monkey must communicate

Day is night, night is day
Everything is cross connected
Its a crazy cuckoo race
I am almost glad its ending

Men and monkeys all are we
Swinging through eternity

Monkey see, monkey do
Monkey want to talk to you
Monkey got a lot to say
Monkey must communicate

Played so hard all the way
Broken bodies soon will mend
There?s no need for you to cry
This is just a game my friend

Men and monkeys all are we
Swinging through eternity

Oh when the stars come tumbling down
And we find ourselves once more upon the ground
There?s no time to mess around
Oh there?s such a lot to do
Me and you
