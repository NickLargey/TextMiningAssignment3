VOMITATION

May-be I will 
May-be I won’t
May-be I’ll do it 
May-be I don’t 
May-be I feel it
May-be I faint 
May-be I am
And may-be I ain’t
Remember beans 
Good for your heart 
The more you eat them
The more you’re fat
The more you’re fat
The better you feel
So eat them beans
Beans at every meal.
A mastur will 
May-be I won’t
May-be I’ll do it
May-be I don’t
May-be I feel it 
May-be I faint 
May-be I am 
Everything I ain’t

A masturbation
Will give you a thrill
The more you beat it 
The more you feel
The more you feel it
The better you like
So beat it beat it,
Beat it all the night

A vomitation
Is never fun
The more you vomit 
The more it runs
The more it runs
The better you feel
That vomitation
Sure will make you ill.

May-be I will 
May-be I won’t
May-be I’ll do it 
May-be I don’t 
May-be I feel it
May-be I faint 
May-be I am
And may-be I ain’t
