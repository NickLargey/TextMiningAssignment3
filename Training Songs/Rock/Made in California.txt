My girl is looking like Jane Bond now
my girl is looking like Jane Dean
she wants to be a superhero
and I`m in love with her indeed

she has a russian laser pistol
she fights the aliens from marsn
she works for the secret service
that`s why she often meets some stars

she is my girl
made in California
so take me to the place I long to be
she is the girl
living in Oklahoma
why are you so far away from me?

she goes to model competitions
don`t need no dresser of hair
she often leaves me feeling lonely
and keeps me waiting in despair

she is my girl
made in California
so take me to the place I long to be
she is the girl
living in Oklahoma
why are you so far away from me?

(shake it shake it I need some surfin` wax, Baby)

she is my girl
maid in California
so take me to the place I long to be
she is the girl
living in Oklahoma
why are you so far away from me?
