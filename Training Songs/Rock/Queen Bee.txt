Did you see her running down the hill
Away from love, away from me?
Oh Queen Marie, you always were the one
Who had the time to say no

What did you say? Hey, hey, girl
What did you say? Hey, hey, girl
What did you say? Hey, hey, girl

You ask me where the angels live
Look girl, I suppose they always hang in bars
Talking to the crazy folk and dancing
With the devils in their bright new clothes

What did you say? Hey, hey, girl
What did you say? Hey, hey, girl
What did you say? Hey, hey, girl

Yeah, see you some time
Yeah, see you some time
Yeah, see you some time

From London to the Ireland coast
This is the land I love, I love the most
You see me underneath the light
Or on the ground or in a fight
Don't pass me by

What did you say? Hey, hey, girl
What did you say? Hey, hey, girl
What did you say? Hey, hey, girl

Yeah, see you some time
Yeah, see you some time
Yeah, see you some time
