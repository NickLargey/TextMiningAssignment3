And I saw my old man
Exploding out of the tunnel
I knew what came next
Recognized that cruel scene
That brought the downfall
Of the distant gaze, distant gaze

Welcome in, a son of Clovius Boofus
Just another sheep boy
Duck call, swan song
Idiot son of Donkey Kong and I say

You don't have to be afraid, love
'Cause I'm a safesurfer, darlin'
You don't have to be afraid, love
'Cause I'm a safesurfer, darlin'

You don't have to be afraid, love
'Cause I'm a safesurfer, darlin'
You don't have to be afraid, love
'Cause I'm a safesurfer, darlin'

You don't have to be afraid, love
'Cause I'm a safesurfer, darlin'
You don't have to be afraid, love
'Cause I'm a safesurfer, darlin'

You don't have to be afraid, love
'Cause I'm a safesurfer, darlin'
You don't have to be afraid, love
'Cause I'm a safesurfer, darlin'
