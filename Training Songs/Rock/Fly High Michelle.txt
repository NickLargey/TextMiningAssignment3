Six o'clock in the morning 
Still sitting here pouring 
The drinks till they're gone 
We did everything together 
Would have done it forever 
How did we go wrong 
I know that what goes up comes down 
I didn't know you hit the ground 

Why'd you have to give it up (fly high, Michelle)
Ooh you were just a little girl (fly high, Michelle)
I'll never look into your blue eyes (fly high, Michelle)
Fly high, Michelle 
 
We did it just for a good time 
A misunderstood time 
We lived with a fear 
I wish we still could have done things 
And not overhung things 
I wish you were here 
And know I'll live a life of could have beens 
Until new life begins 
 
Why'd you have to give it up (fly high, Michelle)
Ooh you were just a little girl (fly high, Michelle)
I'll never look into your blue eyes (fly high, Michelle)
Fly high, Michelle

I'll say another prayer tonight 
And I'll see you in the light 

You have to give it up (fly high, Michelle)
Ooh you were just a little girl (fly high, Michelle)
I'll never look into your blue eyes (fly high, Michelle)
Fly high, Michelle (fly high, Michelle)

You have to give it up (fly high, Michelle)
Ooh you were just a little girl (fly high, Michelle)
I'll never look into your blue eyes (fly high, Michelle)
Fly high, Michelle (fly high, Michelle)
(Fly high Michelle)
Fly high, Michelle
Fly high, Michelle
Fly high, Michelle
