I'm going to let you down,
Like a thousand other towns.
I'm going to hit into your home,
I'm going to never let you go
Because I've been smoking on
The pop cigar
And it doesn't taste that bad.
It gives you funny boys and funny
Girls.

I'm going to let you down,
Like a thousand other towns.
I'm going to sneak under your skin,
I'm going to never let you win,
Because I've been smoking on
The pop cigar
And it doesn't taste that bad.
It gives you funny boys and funny
Girls.
