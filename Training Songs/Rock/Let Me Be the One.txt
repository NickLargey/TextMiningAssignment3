Tonight, tonight, tonight.
Let me be the one who's lovin' you tonight
Let me be the one who really holds you tight
I'll even bring along a magic moon
Just to make you feel alright
So let me be the one who's lovin' you tonight.
Let me be the one who takes you by the hand
Let me be the one who always understands.
Ev'rybody knows we've been good friends
But I think the time is right
So let me be the one who's lovin' you tonight.
You and I could have an affair
Make sweet music go anywhere
Building highways
Taking a bend
As long as I know you really care
Won't you show that you care-oh come on
Let me be the one who's lovin' you tonight
