what's a sweatheart like you doin'
In crummy dumps like those ?
Why do you do the things you do?
Sp- sp- sp spasm, baby

Ravin' comatose
Why do you do the things you do?
You slam to a different hardcore
Stoned to the bone

Why do you do the things you do ?
It makes me miss the ol' bee gees,
Sly & the family stone
Why do you do the things you do?

Come on everybody!
Shake your booty
On the dance floor!
All night long

Dance to the german disco!
Na-na-na
