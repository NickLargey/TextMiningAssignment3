My feelin' of bein' deceived
Well, there's no one that I can believe, no, no
It's all because I couldn't see
That the best friend that I have is me

But I'm just waitin' on you
Hoping that you'll be here soon
Still waitin' to see
If you really meant what you said to me

Waitin' on you
Waitin' on, waitin' on you
Waitin' on you
Waitin' on, waitin' on you
Waitin' on you

There's no need to play act for me
'Cause you grab what you can while it's free
Just come right out with what you mean
Are the roses as red as they seem?

But I'm just waitin' on you
Hoping that you'll be here soon
Still waitin' to see
If you really meant what you said to me

Waitin' on you
Waitin' on, waitin' on you
Waitin' on you
Waitin' on, waitin' on you
Waitin' on you

Thought that by now you'd have changed
But the name of your game's still the same
I ain't trying to say nothing new, no, no, no
Just to make you happy, well, more than you

But I'm just waitin' on you
Hoping that you'll be here soon
Still waitin' to see
If you really meant what you said to me

Waitin' on you
Waitin' on, waitin' on you
Waitin' on you
Waitin' on, waitin' on you
Waitin' on you
