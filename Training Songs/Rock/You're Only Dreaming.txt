Watching you sleep
You're wrestling with your memory again

I saw the blood rushing to your head
I saw a tiny tear drop streaming down your face
I heard the passion when you called his name

Oh Carry Sue like you do
How ya couldn't now how you choose 
I won't be lonely
Oh I couldn't stand the pain
I've got my pride
I'm a man inside
I won't roll up and die
You're only dreaming
And it's something you should hide
Deep down inside

He's in your mind
It gets you when your tired 
He's in your heart 
He's in your eyes

And he knows
You never ever could say no
In time you learned to love the way
I look at you
But something in my heart
Tells me that's not true... No

Oh Carry Sue like you do
How ya couldn't now how you choose 
I won't be lonely
Oh I couldn't stand the pain
I've got my pride
I'm a man inside
I won't fold up and die
You're only dreaming
And it's something you should hide
Deep down inside

I'm only dreaming
You're only dreaming
And it's something you should hide

You're only dreaming
You're only dreaming
And it's something you should hide
