When you were wrapped in tangles,
I was free
And when you were undecided,
I believed
It's alright tonight
On a deep blue mountain high
We're shapes that go together
You and I
When you were filled with longing,
I belonged
When you were weak from trying,
I was strong
But it's alright tonight
On a deep blue mountain high
*We're shapes that go together
You and I
We're shapes that go together
You and I
Child who'd wait in tears
Come to me
Whisper softly
And tenderly
I walked twenty-five miles to hold you
Just to find you'd moved away
When you were wrapped in tangles,
I was free
And when you were almost blinded,
I could see
But it's alright tonight
On a deep blue mountain high
(Repeat *)
You and I
You were wrapped in tangles,
I was free....
