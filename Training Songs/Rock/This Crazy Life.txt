Little sister a few months old 
Died in the crib it smelled so bad 
Survived on the neighbors' milk you stole 
Never knew mom and you never saw dad 
Lost in foster home confusion 
In your eyes, love's just an illusion 
Defensive all your life 
Wish I could make it all a lie 
And say its just OK 
And make it go away 

You, you can lay down mama 
Let me be your cover 
Let me be your mother 
You, you can break down 
Cause I know that you can take it 
Wish I could explain it 
It's just this crazy life 
It's just this crazy life 

Just 18 had your first child 
You were beaten, abused, and torn 
Five years on when the paper's filed 
Still you never knew when you were born 
So mama tell me a bedtime story 
Say a little prayer so not to worry 
Make a wish up in the air 
Say a word and I'll be there 
To make it all OK 
To make it go away 

You, you can lay down mama 
Let me be your cover 
Let me be your mother 
You, you can break down 
Cause I know that you can take it 
Wish I could explain it 
It's just this crazy life 
It's just this crazy life 

So sleep tight
