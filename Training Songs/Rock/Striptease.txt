In a house by the tracks
I want, I want you back
In a dress that's faded black
I want you back, I want you back

All the ways my mother taught me how
I want, I want you now
In any place you'll allow
I want you now, I want you now

It's never very hard stayin' true
When I'm stayin' true to you
And your kisses are all I think about
The proof is in your moves and your grooves
And the little things you do
And the silly things you laugh about

I called, you came
I called, you came
It seems to be our only way
I'll be dreamin' of the kissin'
that I'm missin'
Truly wishin' that you listen
When I sweetly ask you to

Striptease for me, baby
Striptease for me, baby
Striptease for me, baby
aaaah!

All the ways you never ever had
I want, I want you bad
You know I'll never make you sad
I want you bad, I want you bad

As if I never said the words
I want, I want you first
Only thing that can quench my thirst
I want you first, I want you first

It's never very hard stayin' true
When I'm stayin' true to you
And your kisses are all I think about
The proof is in your moves and your grooves
And the little things you do
And the silly things you laugh about

I called, you came
I called, you came
It seems to be our only way
I'll be dreamin' of the kissin'
That I'm missin'
truly wishin' that you listen
When i sweetly ask you to

Striptease for me, baby
Striptease for me, baby
Striptease for me, baby
aaaah!

In a house by the tracks
I want, I want you back

I want you back, I want you back

In any place you'll allow
I want you now, I want you now

The proof is in your moves and your grooves
And the little things you do

I called, you came
I called, you came
It seems to be the only way
I'll be dreamin' of the kissin'
That I'm missin'
Truly wishin' that you listen
When I simply say to you

Striptease for me, baby
Striptease for me, baby
Striptease for me, baby
raow!
