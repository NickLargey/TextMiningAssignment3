Can't fight! There's no escaping the facts
I tried to help but I failed
To solve the problems so much
Of good intentions

I want my wasted hours back
And I want my head to clear
And I have this bad taste in my mouth
From late nights and bad films

Get up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!
Get up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!

I'm drip fed these pictures
And now my words abandon me
The fraction that still me
Said this lives not all it could be

Now did you catch what I said?
Did you catch what I said?
One by one my ideas fade
And there's nothing left to say

Get up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!
Get up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!
Get up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!
Get up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!

Can't fight, decide a future
Let's dance, you're so robotic
Times up, refill the meter
This disappointment's so electric
(x2)

Get up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!
Get up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!
Get up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!
Get up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!
