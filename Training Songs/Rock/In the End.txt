We all start out as beautiful as spring
A midnight summers dream
So innocent we look upon ourselves
And we wish the whole world well
In the end we want it all
In the end we take it all
In the end apart it falls
In the end there's nothing
We bear no scar in our conscience
Clean and smooth

We kiss the breast of youth
As our eyesight fades with age
We put on horn-rimmed glasses
And we work our lives away
Buy the pearl
Sell the world
