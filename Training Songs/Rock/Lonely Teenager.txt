I want to go home
Where I belong
'Cause now I'm just a lonely teenager
When I was 16 ran away
All alone on a stray
What can I do what can I say
I'm a lonely teenager
Now I'm 17 still alone
Wondering if I should go home
Or maybe stay out on my own
I'm a lonely teenager
I'd love to go back home (back home)
Where I belong (back home)
I know I'd be alright
If I just stay out of sight
I want to go home
Where I belong
'Cause now I'm just a lonely teenager
(I want to go back home
Just let me go back home)
I'd love to go back home (back home)
Where I belong (back home)
I know I'd be alright
If I just stay out of sight
I want to go home
Where I belong
'Cause now I'm just a lonely teenager
(I want to go back home
Please let me go back home)
Lonely teenager...[Fade]
