We're so hung up
Like tiny pictures
Sentimental
Remember when 
We were heading for the ambush
A convocation
You let your tiger out

So what ? 
The territory of ? is everywhere 
And anywhere you sign your name

And so what ? 
You get it back
Let go of everything that you know
Don't hold back what you feel

Too cold
I got your hand tonight
Hand tonight 
Hand tonight 
Check, check it out
From you to neighbor

Across the ?
And let your player out
And it depends
On many greater
Higher number
Now let that leader bounce

Bounce!
Huh!
It washes over
Its pushing forward?
Like ocean ?
And every guitar
They covered you in song
Huh!

You let your tiger out
Let go of everything that you know
Don't hold back what you feel
Too cold
I got your hand tonight
Hand tonight
Hand tonight 

Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

Some kind of sound
Following your ?
Can be found
And later on
On, on, on, on ?
I've got your hand tonight

Hand tonight
Hand tonight
I've got your hand in mine 
I've got your hand in mine

Hand in mine 
Hand in mine 
I've got your hand tonight
Hand tonight
Hand tonight
