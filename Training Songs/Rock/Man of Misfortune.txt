See that man - I carry the world upon my back.
Talk to that man - there is no hope, I never talk back.
Sold my soul for a cheap ideal.
The price I paid? the spice of life.
Now I'm in a real dilemma,
I must keep myself alive ... alive ... alive.

Look at that man - what am I doing in a place like this?
Pity that man - I live my life like it's a crime!
The sun goes dim, the moon turns black.
What I gave away, I never got back.
Now I'm in a real dilemma.
I must keep myself alive ... alive ... alive.

I see junk to my left! freaks to my right!
Ain't no one laughin' - ain't nothing funny.
Ain't nothing happening. 'cause we ain't got no money!
Hey! hey! hey! ... misfortune!
Woe! woe! woe! .... misfortune!
Watch that man! everything I see goes into a book.
I said, watch that man! I live my life with a filthy look!

Sold my soul for a cheap ideal.
The price I paid? the spice of life.
Now I'm in a real dilemma,
I must keep myself alive.

The angels they came to visit me.
Some divine intervention ... they said
"are you the boy with the stars in your eyes?
Are you the boy that fooled the world? "
Flappin' their wings, tellin' me things.
Flappin' their wings, tellin' me things...
I said "I know what I like. I know what I want!
But I never seem to know, I never seem to know.
How to get that thing boy. how d'ya get that thing boy?
Can you tell me how you got, how you got that thing?
How d'ya get that thing boy? "

See that man! talk to that man!
Look at that man but don't ya pity that man!
I'm a man of misfortune! I'm a man of misfortune!
Look at that man! watch that man!
But na! na! no! don't talk to that man!
I'm a man of misfortune. I'm a man of misfortune.
I must keep myself alive. I must keep myself alive.
