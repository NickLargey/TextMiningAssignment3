Singles,
You & I are singles
Strangers
Trying to stay warm in the snow
Maybe 
We will wake as strangers
Or maybe we will find 
We have somewhere to go.

Couples
All start out as singles
Lovers
Like to walk alone now & then
Even 
Married folks act single
If they should feel the need 
To find themselves again

[Chorus: (x2)]
Singles,
All my loves were singles,
Like the dollar bills that slip away
Before you even know

Music,
Pourin' out on singles,
Finds a home
On someone's stereo
And like a stack of singles
We'll survive as singles
Trying
Hard to match one shoe with one glove

Lovers,
'Cause we share the same dreams
Dreams of what the world
Can't have too many of

Like singles
Doubled up with love
