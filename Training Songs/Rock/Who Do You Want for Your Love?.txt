(McNabb)

I'm not yet convinced that pride will come before a fall
I have seen you standing in your Sunday best and all
Waiting for a fool to take you further than you are
Given time you'll finish every heartache that you start

Chorus: Who do you want for your love
Better make up your mind 'cause time is passing
You'll be left behind
Who do you want for your love
Better make up your mind 'cause time is passing
Who do you want for your love

How can I deny that I would take you for my own
Love to play the loner till I find myself alone
Perhaps your indecision speaks of why I've tried for so long
Talk about you, sing about your brown eyes in a song

Repeat Chorus

Could you make that move embrace that certain moment
When you know you're on your own, lose those apron strings
Dance and sing
I know 'cause I've been there, let me tell you it's no party
When you're lost, count the cost, falling on someone is not the answer

Repeat Chorus
