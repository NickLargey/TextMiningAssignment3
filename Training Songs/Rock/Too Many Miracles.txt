Miracle rain makes snowballs falling slowing out of the sky
All you people wandering by
Make sure you don't get one in the eye
There's a new world forming out of the way
Future love that's born every day

Too many miracles happening here
It's the same old story, different year
Oh I'm glad you are here
Been this way since the day I was born

I'm ready to be in love again
I know we could be in love

Photographing snowflakes lately I'm slowly losing my mind
There's so many different kinds
Falling all the time
There's a rainbow forming without any rain
A new dimension again

There's too many miracles happening here
It's the same old story, different year
Oh I'm glad you are here
Been this way since the day you were born

The age of romance is dead and gone
Maybe a chance I'm wrong

People falling out of love I don't know whose side you were on
Got to call these people along
And tell them where they've been going wrong
There's no shame in changing and being alone
Just pull yourself one for the road

Hasn't it been a strange old year
Well too many miracles happening here
I'm so glad you are here
Been this way since the day we were born

Are you ready to be in love again
I'm ready to be in love
