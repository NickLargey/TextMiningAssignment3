Going on a vision quest, surf the mountain, ride the crest
(I've been looking in a new direction)
Starting down, I'm gettin in store
The world is clear from upper cores
(I've been looking in a new direction)

I want to laugh and I want to cry
I want to spit, but my mouth is dry
I want to run but I can't 'cause my legs don't go!
Where did they go?

Now and then I'm like a black bird
Setting in and giving cracker
(I've been looking in a new direction)
Face the mirror, start to change
I'm paranoid and feeling strange
(I've been looking in a new direction)

I want to laugh and I want to cry
I want to spit, but my mouth is dry
I want to run but I can't 'cause my legs don't go!
Where did they go?

Living like a pharisee, I walk around and lucid dream
(I've been looking in a new direction)
The day has past, the moon's a glow
I've lied awake, my eyes are closed
(I've been looking in a new direction)

I've been looking in a new direction
I've been looking in a new direction
I've been looking at a nude erection
