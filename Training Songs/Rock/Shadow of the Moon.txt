Shadow Of The Moon, Shadow Of The Moon
In the shadow of the moon
She danced in the starlight
Whispering a haunting tune
To the night
Velvet skirts spun 'round and 'round
Fire in her stare
In the woods without a sound
No one cared

Through the darkened fields entranced
Music made her poor heart dance
Thinking of a lost romance
Long ago
Feeling lonely, feeling sad
She cried it the moonlight
Driven by a world gone mad
She took fight
"Feel no sorrow, feel no pain

Feel no hurt, there's nothing gained
Only love will then remain"
She would say
Shadow of the Moon Shadow of the Moon
Somewhere just beyond the mist
Spirits were seen flying
As the lightning led her way
Through the dark
Shadow of the Moon
