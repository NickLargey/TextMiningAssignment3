Why must I love you so much?
Sandy, I long for your touch

A better luck the next time Sandy
I gotta tell you that we're through
A find a guy who's always handy
A listen girl I'm leaving you

A dumb dadida dumb dumb  dadida dida
Dumb dadida  dumb dumb da dida dida
A dumb dadida dumb dumb dadida dida
Dumb dadida dumb dumb dadida dida

I love a girl around the corner
Just found out that she's no good
I left her, didn't even want her
But I'd crawl back if I could

Why must I love you so much?
Sandy, I long for your touch
I never thought you'd put me down
I can't believe that you're untrue
And now the new is out around town
Yeah, what Ellis can I do?

Whoa o dumdidala dumdidala
La dal la dal la dal la dal

Oh it's worth this pain
I can't explain, Oh,and all those tears
I cry for you,(wop,wop,wop,wop,wop,wop
A better luck the next time Sandy
I've gotta tell you that we're through
A find a guy who's always handy
Listen girl I'm leaving you

Why must I love you so much?
Sandy, I long for your touch
I never thought you would put me down
Can't believe that you're untrue
And now the news is out around town
Sandy babe what can I do?

Dida dida dumb dumb da dida dida
Dumb da dida  dumb dumb da dida dida
Dida  dida dumb dumb da dida dida
Dida  did dumb dumb da dida dida
