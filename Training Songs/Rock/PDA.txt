Your mama was a doctor
Mama was a fire alarm
Eastern European, 
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone

'Cause you know I like the view
Every single time I look at you

They raised you kinda proper
Raised you like a soldier girl
But I know you're softer
Why you looking so concerned?

I know you don't like PDA
But just for now, I think that it's okay

So hold me close and kiss me now in the fake Grand Central
Your hair tied up with a broken pencil

Couple next to ya
Says "Go get a hotel room"
'Cause they never felt this way
So disapproving
They don't like what we're doing
We don't have no time to waste
It's just a little PDA
It's just a little PDA

Get you in the bedroom
Then you set the world on fire
But outside of your cocoon
It's like I'm just another guy

Because you're so preoccupied
Why you think that stranger's gonna mind?

If you come a little closer
Forget about your suitcase babe
'Cause you know when we're older
We're gonna laugh about today

Soon you'll be so far away
And I'm just gonna have to sublimate

If you can't say it, write a letter, kinda confidential
Sign your name with a broken pencil

Couple next to ya
Says "Go get a hotel room"
'Cause they never felt this way
So disapproving
They don't like what we're doing
We don't have no time to waste
It's just a little PDA
It's just a little PDA

So baby I just need a memory to sustain me
'Cause I get so crazy worried that you'll go and replace me
So show me with an action that on the train you won't get plastered
And hook up with some model slash actor in the bathroom
All that I need is a confirmation by making a scene in the station
Before they call
Tell the children to look away
You'll be on the train
Rollin' away, rollin' away

Couple next to ya
Says "Go get a hotel room"
'Cause they never felt this way
So disapproving
They don't like what we're doing
We don't have no time to waste
It's just a little PDA

Couple next to ya

'Cause they never felt this way
So disapproving
They don't like what we're doing
We don't have no time to waste
It's just a little PDA
It's just a little PDA
