There´s a fire in the heart of the young
Human temples - drawing power from the sun
Raising sails - navigating the dawn
Hear the thunder - now we´re a million strong

(Whoa) The lights shines in the heart of the young
(Whoa) We´re fighting for a new way to say 
"Carry on" and see behind this material illusion
The future of all is alive in the heart of the young

There´s a song in the heart of the young
Loud and clearly the band goes marching on
With the force of a thousand gods
Hear the music - now we´re a million strong

(Whoa) Put your trust in the heart of the young
(Whoa) The rise of the rebellion has only
Just begun, the trupets sound off the 
Countdown for a new day´s dawn, the 
Future of all will survive, it´s alive
(Show me you´re still alive)

And there´s fire in the heart of the young
See the lightning strike the curtain
With the force of a thousand gods
Hear the thunder - it´s in the 
Heart of the young

(Whoa) Can´t you feel it burn in the 
Heart of the young
(Whoa) We´re fighting for a new way to say
"Carry on", the trumpets sound off the 
Countdown for a new day´s dawn, the 
Future of all is alive in the 
Heart of the young

The future of all will survive, it´s alive....
