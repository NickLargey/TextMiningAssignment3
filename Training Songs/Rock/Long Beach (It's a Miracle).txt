Bee sitting you come undone
God at the wheel with a gun
Get down on the street
And call your friends

They're shootin' up a new path
To guide the first and last
So get down on the street
And call your friends

It's a miracle
And it's comin' your way
A miracle
And shinnin' all day

As bad as the night embers
Beat to another song
Sad 'cause you know her death
Will never fade

It's a miracle
And it's comin' your way
A miracle
And shinnin' all day

And so you come alive
At the perfect time
It's a perfect life

Okay, I know we're mates
Okay, it feels the same
But girl, you know your name
Will someday change

It's a miracle
And it's comin' your way
A miracle
And it's shinnin' all day

A miracle
Comin' your way
A miracle
And it's shinnin' all day
Your way, your way
