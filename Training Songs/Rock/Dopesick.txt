Enter in this black cloud.
Keeps looking over his shoulder.
No method to his madness.
Heavy is the world as he crashes down.

[Chorus]
Hands down this haunts you,
So dope sick, I'll remain.
Hands down this haunts you
So dope sick.

More then he could bare now
Some thought that he would come around
Screaming for his blank space
Could not wire this from his face

[Chorus]

Could never tell by 
The whites of their eyes

Hands down this haunts you,
So dope sick, I'll remain.
Hands down this haunts you,
So dope sick, I'll remain.
