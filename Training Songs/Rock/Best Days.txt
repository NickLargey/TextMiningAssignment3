With everything I've ever done 
I'd give it all to everyone 
For one more day 
Another night I'm waking through 
Another door I walk into 
I can't break 

And it's a winding road 
And it's a long way home 

So don't wait 
For someone to tell you it's too late 
Cause these are the best days 
There's always something tomorrow 
So I say let's make the best of tonight 
Here comes the rest of our lives 

I count the steps 
The distance to 
The time when it was me and you 
It's so far gone 

Another face, 
Another friend, 
Another place, 
Another end, 
But I'll hang on 

And it's a winding road 
And it's a long way home 

So don't wait 
For someone to tell you it's too late 
Cause these are the best days 
There's always something tomorrow 
So I say let's make the best of tonight 
Yeah, let's make the best of tonight 
Here comes the rest of our lives 
Rest of our lives 

And it's a winding road 
It's a long way home 

So don't wait 
For someone to tell you it's too late 
Cause these are the best days 
There's always something tomorrow 
So I say let's make the best of it 

Don't wait 
Cause no one can tell you it's too late 
Cause these are the best days 
There's always something tomorrow 
So I say let's make the best of tonight 
Yeah, let's make the best of tonight 
We'll make the best of tonight 
Here comes the rest of our lives
