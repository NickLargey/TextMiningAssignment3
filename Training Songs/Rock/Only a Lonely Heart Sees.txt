You
Soft and lovely are
Lighting my dreams like a morning star
Rocking my world with your open arms
I couldn't feel the sun
Looking for something so high above
Guess you could say I was blind to love

Only a lonely heart sees
Where love can be
Only a lonely heart sees
Where love can be

You
Magic in your eyes
Peaceful and clear as a summer day
Showed me the truth behind love's disguise
I couldn't hear a sound
Pure as the melodies ever sung
Two strings together that makes us one

Only a lonely heart sees
Where love can be
Only a lonely heart sees
Where love can be

Only a lonely heart sees
Where love can be
Only a lonely heart sees
Where love can be

You
Breezin' through my mind
Oh no my lady I can't deny
You know the way to paradise
Could this be torn apart
Standing in the pouring rain
Running from love when it brings you pain

Only a lonely heart sees
Where love can be
Only a lonely heart sees
Where love can be

Only a lonely heart sees
Where love can be
Only a lonely heart sees
Where love can be
