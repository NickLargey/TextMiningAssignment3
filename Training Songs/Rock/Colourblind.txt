Colour blind, risking your life
A brush stroke and a rooftop dive
Eccentric hero in a hookers bed
A dog without a leash, a sirloin fed
Breakable heart, I believe you said
If life's a shadow, gimme a shot in the head
If life's a shadow, gimme a shot in the head

Colour blind, slightly cock-eyed
The world at your feet in the city tonight
Burning like a flame instead of hanging
Like a puppet from a spiders' web
Unbeatable heart, I think you said
If life's a dream, gimme a shot in the head
If life's a dream, gimme a shot in the head

Welcome home baby, the skies are red
The clouds are blue and the streets are wet
Welcome home baby, the drinks are free
Your face is green in the neon-light
Welcome home baby, farewell goodbye

Colour blind, before the paint dries
Saturday night, one more time
Eccentric hero in a hookers bed
A dog without a leash, a sirloin fed
Unbeatable heart, I think you said
If life's a dream, gimme a shot in the head
If life's a dream, gimme a shot in the head

Welcome home baby, the skies are red
The clouds are grey and the streets are wet
Welcome home baby, the drinks are free
Your face is green in the neon-light
Welcome home baby, farewell goodbye

Welcome home baby, the skies are red
The clouds are blue and the streets are wet
Welcome home baby, the drinks are free
Your face is green in the neon-light
Welcome home baby, farewell goodbye
