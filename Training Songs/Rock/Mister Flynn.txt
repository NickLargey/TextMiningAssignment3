Wearing a crinkled coverall
Waiting by the backstage door
We're standing in the rain
You won't let us in
Until it's time for the show to begin

Up at sunrise ... travelled far
Just to be here early
But we're still sitting in the car
Let us in oh surely
We always like to set up early

We all know you Mister Flynn
Yes, we know you
We've met your frown in every town
No matter where we've been

We asked around and what we found
Made us all feel badly
We understand you had a band
But it ended sadly
You've entertained for many years
But you never made it
(Did you really try?)
And now you're holding back the tears
Totally frustrated
And now you're trying hard to hate it
But we know you Mister Flynn
But, we know you

We understand and sympathize
With the state of mind you're in
We all know you Mister Flynn
We all know you Mister Flynn
We all know you Mister Flynn

Dooo....
