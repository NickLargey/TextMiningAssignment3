(leaving terra, leaving terra, leaving terra)

If you're a thought you will want me to think you
And I did
Invited a guest up until you, you announced that
You had moved in

"what do you plan to do with all your freedom?"
The new sheriff said, quite proud of his badge
"you must admit the land is now in good hands"
Yes, time will tell that
You just lift your lamp

I will follow her on her path
Scarlet's walk through the violets
Just tell your gods for me 
All debts are off this year
They're free to leave, yes
They're free to leave

(leaving terra, leaving terra)

There was a time when I thought that her destiny 
Should've been mine
Big brave nation, but instead her
Medicine now forgotten

"What do you plan to do with all your stories"
The new sheriff said, quite proud of his badge
We'll weave them through every rocket's red glare 
And huddled masses
You just lift your lamp

I will follow her on her path
Scarlet's walk through the violets
Just tell your gods for me 
All debts are off this year
They're free to leave, yes
They're free to leave

(leaving terra, leaving terra)

If you're a thought you will want me to think you 
And I did, and I did..
