I took a ride in a smoking car
I lost the keys and I don't need a spare
I feel around for another soul
I look around for a place to begin

But ooh, I wont cut you out
But when I open up, I only cough
Ooh, I think I lost it again
But you never know, know where I been

You know my role
Do I really have to sell my soul
You know I will, because I have got to kill
Its golden here, but as much I thought, I feel
I think I lost it again
Said ooh, I think I lost it again

I said go, bring me something else
I said go, bring me something else

You know my role
Do I really have to sell my soul
You know I will, because I have got to kill
Its golden here, but as much I thought, I feel
I think I lost it again
Said ooh, I think I lost it again
