I'll wait by your bed for signs of light
They say that you're gone
But I know you're alright
I wanna be there when you open your eyes
It's been so long
You've been barely alive
When you sleep, what do you dream?
I need to know you're thinking of me

Going to bed alone again
Don't know when you're coming home again
Going to bed alone again
Don't know when you're coming home again

I'll wait by your bed for signs of light
They say that you're gone
But I know you're alright
I wanna be there when you open your eyes
It's been so long
You've been barely alive
When you sleep, what do you dream?
I need to know you're thinking of me
I need to know you're thinking of me

I should've called you to hold on
You gotta fix yourself up before taking off
'Cause it's you, it's you that you're running from
It's you, it's you that keeps hanging on

'Cause it's you, it's you that you're running from
It's you, it's you that keeps hanging on

I need to know you're thinking of me
I need to know you're thinking of me
