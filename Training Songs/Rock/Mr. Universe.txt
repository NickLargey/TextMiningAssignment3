Mr. Universe, can you help me please?
I'm only seven stone two
When I'm on the beach, the girls stay out of reach
They all want someone like you.

You've got to help me, now please Mr. Universe
Don't tell me that I'm just a hopeless case
Don't let me down now, please Mr. Universe
I'm sick of getting sand thrown in my face.

Mr. Universe, you know it's getting worse
I need your seven-day plan
I'm thinner every day, before I waste away
I need a muscle-bound man.

You've got to help me, now please Mr. Universe
Don't tell me that I'm just a hopeless case
Don't let me down now, please Mr. Universe
I'm sick of getting sand thrown in my face.

You've got to help me, now please Mr. Universe
