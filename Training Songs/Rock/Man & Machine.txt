When I'm driving in my car, I don't care about any thing
When I'm speeding in my car, I don't care about anyone
Man and machine, machine and man
We're always together they can't understand
Give anything for her velvet seats
Do anything just to hear her squeal
Man and machine, machine and man
We're always together they can't understand
My foot's on the pedal, such a crazy thing
I'm never gonna stop loving this machine
Wheels are rolling with a rockabye motion
And I love my car
Sirens screaming throught the city speeding
But I'll never stop
Go through girls like I do through fines
But I'll never leave my car
My car and me such a crazy thing and I'm...
When I'm driving in my car, I don't care about any thing
When I'm speeding in my car, I don't care about anyone
Judge on the bench made clear his demands
We're gonna have to have your license young man
Listen judge, don't you have a heart
I ain't a criminal, just in love with a car
Now I'm back on the streets behind the wheel
The papaer's gone but I still got the feel
A life of danger, life of speedm life of trouble for my
Car and me.
