I still remember, baby 
Those wild, desperate times
Making love in crazy places
While the town around us died

I played on broken stages
I watched the lonely cry
You danced in iron cages
For the boys with hungry eyes
All those wasted lives

Little by little, baby, we were going down
I swore I'd come back for you
Come back and buy this town

I'm coming back
Back for what's mine
I ain't gonna let nobody stop me this time
No more running baby, I paid for my crime
I'm coming back, baby
Back for what's mine

You were standing at the station 
That rainy night I left
You looked so fine, baby
I couldn't catch my breath

Once I started running
I never asked the cost
Too many years and miles
To find out what I'd lost
Some things can't be bought

Everybody's colder now
lt's everywhere I go
I'm getting tired of living
In a world that's got no soul

I'm coming back
Back for what's mine
I ain't gonna let nobody stop me this time
No more running, baby, I paid for my crime
I'm coming back, baby
Back for what's mine

I don't want to confuse you
If you found something else
But I don't want to lose you
Just when I found myself

Everybody's colder now
lt's everywhere I go
I just don't want to live
In a world that's got no soul

I'm coming back
Back for what's mine
I ain't gonna let nobody stop me this time
No more running, baby, I paid for my crime
I'm coming back, baby
Back for what's mine

I'm coming, baby
I'm coming, baby
I'm coming, baby
I'm coming, baby
