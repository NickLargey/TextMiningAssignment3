So many voices telling me which way to go 
So many choices come from those who think they know 
There's a way that seems right to a man 
But it only brings him death 
I want to go the way that leads to life 
Till I draw my dying breath 

[Chorus]
Don't want to be a man pleaser - I want to be a God pleaser 
I just want to have the wisdom to discern the two apart 
Don't want to be a man pleaser - I want to be a God pleaser 
I just want to do the things that please the Father's heart 

Some make a sacrifice and never let it show 
Some make a point of letting everybody know 
Some will live their lives as unto men 
And they have their reward 
I just want to do everything I do 
With all my heart unto the Lord 

I just want my life to glorify His Son 
To make my Father proud that I'm His child before I'm done 
No need to pat me on the back or stop the shake my hand 
I just want to hear my Father say "Well done, well done" 
I just want to hear my Father say "Well done"
