I want to thank you, Mr. Churchill
For making sure that I was born
Thanks for the innocence that made us feel secure
But time is wasting, hope is hungry now

It's a dream I'm talking here
Much closer to the poor
If we start waging peace
Instead of waging war

When I wake to see the sun rise
I know I'm poorer by the day
I know the world will keep on turning for a while
But time is wasting, hope is hungry now

It's a dream I'm talking here
Much closer to the poor
Information overload
It's harder to ignore
The day you do the things
I'll live with what's in store

Will there be peace on earth one day?
If so, I hope I will be near
'Til we're born with wisdom, war will still be here

It's a dream I'm talking here
Much closer to the poor
If we start waging peace
Instead of waging war

Information overload
It's harder to ignore
The day you do the thing
Or live with what's in store
