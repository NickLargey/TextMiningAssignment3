I don't know how to fit inside
All you do is try leave me behind
I don't know what to do
Because somethings killing me
I don't know how to turn you on
All you do is try lead me on
I don't know what to do
because something here is telling me to kill you

[Chorus]
Its all gone wrong, its all gone wrong 
Its falling perfect fumes
Its all gone wrong, its all gone wrong
Its broken

I don't know how to live this life
all i have is maybe suicide
I don't know what to do
because somethings killing me
I don't know how to reach the top
all you do is try scrape me off
I don't know what to do
Something here is telling me to kill you

[Chorus]

Never meant to hurt you, hurt you
Never meant to hurt you, hurt

[Chorus: x2]

All I can't lose such a life
