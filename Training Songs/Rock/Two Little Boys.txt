Two little boys had two little toys 
Each had a wooden horse 
Gaily they played each summers day 
Warriors both of cause 
One little chap then had a mishap 
Broke off his horses head 
Wept for his toy, then cried with joy 
As his young playmate said 

Did you think I would leave you crying 
When there's room on my horse for two 
Climb up here, Jack and don't be crying 
I can go just as fast with two 
When we grow up we'll both be soliders 
And our horses will not be toys 
And I wonder if we'll remember when we were 
Two little boys 

Long years past, war came so fast 
Bravely they marched away 
Cannon roared loud and in the mad crowd 
Wounded and dieing lie, up goes a shout 
A horse dashes out, out from the ranks so blue 
Gallops away to where Joe lay, then came a voice he know 

Did you think I would leave you dieing 
When there's room on my horse for two 
Climb up here, Joe we'll soon be flying 
I can go just as fast with two 
Did you say Joe I'm all a tremble, perhaps it's the battles noise 
But I think it's that I remember when we were two little boys 

Do you think I would leave you dieing 
There's room on my horse for two 
Climb up here, Joe we'll soon be flying 
Back to the ranks so blue 
Can you feel Joe I'm all a tremble, perhaps it's the battles noise 
But I think it's that I remember when we were two little boys
