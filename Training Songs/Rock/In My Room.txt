In my room
We're at the end of the harm
I sit and stare at the wall
Each day's just like the last
For I lived in the past
In my room
Where every night is the same
I play a dangerous game
I keep pretending he's late
And I sit and I wait
All the day is the picture
We took when he made me his bride
All the day is the charm way
He held me whenever I cried
All the day by the window 
The flowers he left...
...I won't die!
In my room
We're at the end of the harm
I sit at I stare at the wall
Hating how lonely I've growned
All alone 
In my room...
