By the time that we got there
It was already too late
They say death had come easy
I didn't see it that way

I guess they meant you'd stopped breathing
Left behind all that pain
But I barely remember
See my life was on stage

Living is lonely at best
Dying could bring me some rest

Did our best to deny it
The sun came up anyway
Tore across turtle island
On a highway of shame

Still it came without warning
Suppose it happens with age
Somewhere she took to believing
It would just be better this way

Living is lonely at best
Dying could bring me some rest

So I prayed for forgiveness
And I paid for the rest
Put a nail in his coffin
Put a knife in his chest

And I remembered that phone call
How I had nothing to say
I was crossing the border
I was slipping away

Living is lonely at best
Dying could bring me some rest

Our bodies stirred these waters briefly
Danced with a certain intoxication
Before the love of life and self
Dealt with a few strange ideas
Then submitted to the instruments of time
What can we say of this?
I occurred
I am not
Yet I occurred

Let every living thing shine its light on me every living thing
Let every living thing shine its light on me
Let every living thing shine its light on me 
Let every living thing shine its light on me
Let every living thing shine its light on me
Let every living thing shine its light on me
Let every living thing shine its light on me 
Let every living thing shine its light on me
Let every living thing shine its light on me
Let every living thing shine its light on me
Let every living thing shine its light on me 
Let every living thing shine its light on me
Let every living thing shine its light on me
Let every living thing shine its light on me
Let every living thing shine its light on me
Let every living thing, every living thing 
Every living thing, every living thing 
Every living thing, every living thing 
Every living thing, every living thing 
Every living thing, every living thing 
Every living thing, every living thing
