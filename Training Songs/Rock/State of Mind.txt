Fire burning in my heart
Tearing me apart
You're the fire
You
Knocked my defences down
Bare as the day I was born
You're the one
Oh you're the one

It's a state of mind
It's my state of mind
In my state of mind

Feeling
Things I can't control
Deep down in my soul
No control any more
Words
Words I can't express
Wash my fears away
Words of love
Oh words of love

It's a state of mind
It's my state of mind
In my state of mind
