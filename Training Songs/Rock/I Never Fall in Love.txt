I never fall in love, 
But sometimes I miscalculate
I phone and you're not home,
I worry when it's getting late
As many friends would does that apply to you?

I never fall in love, I tend to be affectionate
And if you see me cry, you shouldn't read
Too much in it
Men cry when they are young
I'm very highly strung

I never fall in love 
I never lose control like that
I'm happy as I am
I'd never give my soul like that
Because in time I've learned,
It never is returned
I'm through with getting  burned

And if I fell in love,
Of course it wouldn't be with you
Cause everybody knows
That real love only happens
To a heart that has a twin,
And you'd never find it in your heart
To care for me, but I don't care, you see
