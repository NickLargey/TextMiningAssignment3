Mother's waiting in the kitchen, 
The elephant's waiting in the zoo, 
The teacher's waiting in the classroom 
And I am waiting here for you. 
And the audience is waiting 
For the show that won't begin. 
The artist's waiting at the backdoor, 
Because nobody let him in. No no.

Why did she go?
She said there's no tomorrow. 
How did she know? 
Did anybody tell her? 
I can't explain, 
I'm sitting in the corner, 
Staring at the wall 
And she won't be back again. 

Louise was waiting for a lover, 
First he paid and then he came. 
Now she's cooking for a baby, 
The client wasn't seen again.
No no. 

Why did she go?
She said there's no tomorrow. 
How did she know? 
Did anybody tell her? 
I can't explain, 
I'm sitting in the corner, 
Staring at the wall 
And she won't be back again. 

It's time you started 
To think seriously about 
Your future and your dreaming, yeah.
She said and didn't leave no room for doubt, 
That if I took her meaning, 
There was no longer dreaming, 
It's just a perfect screaming.

Oh my God.

Why did she go?
She said there's no tomorrow. 
How did she know? 
Did anybody tell her? 
I can't explain, 
I'm sitting in the corner, 
Staring at the wall 
And she won't be back again. 

Why did she go?
She said there's no tomorrow. 
How did she know? 
Did anybody tell her? 
I can't explain, 
I'm sitting in the corner, and I'm waiting
Staring at the wall and I'm waiting
And I'm waiting waiting waiting
She's back again.
Ooh yeah.
