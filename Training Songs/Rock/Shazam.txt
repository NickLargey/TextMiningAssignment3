Hey you!
You never should've ran
You want to make something
That you can take you down again
This time you say your just fine
You need a little something
That can make you smile again
Come on. It won't take long
You're never going to need
It when you hear that sound again
It's a sin. You're looking kind of thin
You need a little bit so you
Can impress everybody
You're still in a daze
Hey you!
I know you like to prance so get up and
Dance so I can spin you round again
Take your time you're looking just fine
Let's do a little shuffle and that can make
You smile again
Come on. It won't take long
Let's sing a little song
Until the sun don't shine again
But every time you say your just
Fine you need a little bit so you can
Impress everybody
You're still in a daze
You can try hard but you never really
Had the time so take a look around see
Just what you're going to get inside
You never should've ran
