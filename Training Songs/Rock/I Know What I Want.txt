I've been around the world and met a million girls,
Still, I know I want to be with you.
You've got more than anyone else,
And I want you more than anything;

'cause I know what I want, and I know how to get it.
I know what I want, and I know how to get it.
I know what I want, and I know how to get it from you, from you.

I knew I'd meet you, I had a dream about you,
We were walkin' hand in hand,
We were talkin' 'bout love.
It was love at first sight,
When I looked into your eyes
I was blinded by the feelings in my heart.

'cause I know what I want, and I know how to get it.
I know what I want, and I know how to get it.
I know what I want, and I know how to get it from you, from you.

I know, I know, I know, I know what I want!
I know what I want!
I want it!

Well, ya knew I'd meet you,
Ya know I dreamt about you,
We were walkin' hand in hand,
We were talkin' 'bout love.
Love at first sight, when I looked into your eyes
I was blinded by the feelings in my heart.
I know you feel it, there's no doubt about it,
It's gettin' stronger every day.
It's a one in a million, I was shootin' for the stars,
You're the world's greatest lover and you're mine.

'cause I know what I want, and I know how to get it.
I know what I want, and I know how to get it.
I know what I want, and I know how to get it from you, from you.

I know what I want, and I know how to get it.
