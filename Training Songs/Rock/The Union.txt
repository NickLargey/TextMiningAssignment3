When we were kids
We'd throw rocks at cars
And smoke our mother's cigarettes
After dark, in the park
And I remember picking butts up off the
Dirty ground
Smoking them just the same as Ma's
When we ran out
And I ripped my heart from beneath my ribs
And lay there bleeding out in my hands
And I'd give a piece to each of my friends
Just to know they understand

That I'd never join the union
'Cause I never wanted it easy
No, I'd never join the union
'Cause I'd never wanted it easy

There's a pretty little city towering over the sea
And the little yellow house
Falling down on Inglis Street
There's a few good men who know who I am
And who I am not
And I rip my heart from beneath my rib
And I lie there bleeding out in my hands
And I give a piece to you my friend
Just to know you understand

That I'd never join the union
'Cause I never wanted it easy
Hell, I'd never join the union
'Cause I never wanted it easy

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Now I know why
Your daddy doesn't like me
Can't change it
I am a dirty, Rock 'n' Roller baby
Now I know why
Your daddy doesn't like me
I can't change it
I am a dirty, Rock 'n' Roller

And I'd never join the union
'Cause I never wanted it easy
Hell, I'd never join the union
'Cause I never wanted it easy

That I'd never
No, I'd never
No, I'd never join
That I'd never
No, I'd never
No, I'd never join
That I'd never join the union
'Cause I never wanted it easy
Hey!
