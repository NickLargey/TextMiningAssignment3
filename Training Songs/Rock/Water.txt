You and me
You know we're never going to die
Right or wrong
It still won't mend a broken heart

And I don't mind
The colors in your hair
You don't see
The water dancing with the dead

Pick it up again and realize
I'm never coming home
To lose it all again could capsize
My vessel on its own

Off to be
The one thing that I know I am
Stand alone
Beyond the reach of helping hands

Pick me up again and realize
I know not what I do
To lose it all again could capsize
My vessel on its

Stop me from drinking the water
In which I drown
Hold me in darkness
Beneath the water now

Water flows down
Upon your face
My love for you
Won't die

Out in the ocean
Far from any land
Sail to emptiness
The water's on my hands

Pick me up again, realize
I know not what I do
To lose it all again could capsize
My vessel on its

Only the ones in the water
Could be found
Hold me in darkness
Beneath the water now

Take me higher, take me, yeah
Take me to the higher lands
Take me, take me, yeah

Take me up to higher lands
Higher lands, I go
Take me up to higher lands
Higher lands, I go

Take me up to higher lands
Higher lands, I go
Take me up to higher lands
Higher lands, I go

Take me up to higher lands
Higher lands, I go
Take me up to higher lands
Higher lands, I go

Take me up to higher lands
Higher lands, I go
Take me up to higher lands
Higher lands, I go
Take me up to higher lands
