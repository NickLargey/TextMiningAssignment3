Yesterday I saw you
Not a word did I say
In the arms of somebody new
It took my breath away
I thought time had healed the pain
Damn I'm caught lying to myself again

If she gives you love
Like I never could
And takes you where we could never go
I hope you're happy
But I don't want to know
I don't want to know

No it's not jealousy
It's not that I want you back
What we had was so special to me
And I can't let go of that
I know we parted as friends
Excuse me if sometimes my heart doesn't understand

If she gives you love
Like I never could
And takes you where we could never go
I hope you're happy
But I don't want to know
I don't want to know

There've been times
When I wondered, baby
Did we give up
Too fast
Too easy
I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never know

If she gives you love
Like I never could
And takes you where we could never go
I hope you're happy
But I don't want to know
I don't want to know
