I'm not gonna let you down,
But I'm not gonna help you up
It takes so long to turn me around,
When I think nothing could be wrong
And then you can't hear me and I can't hear you,
And then you wander downtown 'bout a quarter to two,
Well with your head held low and not a thing to do you,
Gotta give me some time with those one's and two's
Oh-Oh!

You're like a puzzle that can't be solved,
Missing pieces never fill the gaps...
You got the salt and I got the wound,
But, all you gotta do is ask...
And there's a glint in your eye, you curl your lip
Now when you go to shut the door
And I can't see shit
And when you start I can't stop,
Nothing for me to grip
And when i try to get away,
You always give me the slip
Oh-Oh!
