Walking in my Sunday suit, eyes on fire
Came across you walking on the other side
"Hey there where you going, are you out of your mind?"
"Say there where you going, so out of your mind?"

You say "ooh, yeh yeh"

Off the curb he stumbles, he's high on amphetamine
Thoughts are disappearing through the cracks in his mind
"I see you're still straightened out, I'm high as a kite"
"I can't get myself together, try as I might"

I say "ooh, yeh yeh"
And I say "ooh, yeh yeh"

Ooh, yeh yeh
Ooh, yeh yeh

Walking in my Sunday suit, eyes on fire
Came across you walking on the other side
Mind is disappearing like water in sand
Thoughts are disappearing through the cracks in the land

I say "ooh, yeh yeh"
I say "ooh, yeh yeh"
