Strap on your safety belt
Blazing in the sky
Thinking of nothing
No disguise
What happened to the one
The one you thought you knew
Did he just take away
What is missing in you

Let him run
Till he sees what he has done
Let him go on
Having all his fun
Mm let him run

Take off your rocket shoes
And the straps from your wings
Wishing for miracles
Hear the young boys sing
What will you say to him
When he's back at your door
Got no time for users
I don't need you anymore

Let him run
Till he sees what he has done
Let him go on
Having all his fun
Let him cry
See the tears fall from his eyes
Let him run
Run run run run run
