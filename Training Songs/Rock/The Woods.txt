I can see night in the day time
Into the woods I quietly go
It takes all the strength I have in me
These are the woods
The night of the soul
Painful to see
Love without action
Painful to see years of neglect
Achin' to see all that they see
Still telling lies to the remains of respect
Creatures we are worth defending
It takes the right word said from the heart
Given to you without ending
Given to you, the purpose of art
Thousands of plans, I've made many
I wonder just how many plans I have made
Feelin' this mood overtake me
Finally to see the truth as it fades
Out of these woods will you take me
Out of these woods, out of the strom
Sinless child can you save me
Guilty man, freedom is yours
