Feel fine when I wake up in the morning.
I feel good when I see the sun rise
If I drink wonder wine before I go to bed.
Don't know the ingredients,
But it tastes so sweet. 
I feel fine when I have a funny dream.
I feel bad when I sweat at night
If I drink wonder wine just a bit.
I don't know where it's from,
But it tastes so sweet.

Wonder wine you gave me.
Wonder wine you know what it is.
Wonder wine you gave me.
Did you experiment with me?

Tell me your plan now
Before I go too far.
