Step right up and don't be shy
Because you will not believe your eyes
She's right here behind the glass
And you're gonna like her
'Cause she's got class
You can look inside another world
You get to talk to a pretty girl
She's everything you dream about
But don't fall in love

She's a beauty
She's one in a million girls
She's a beauty
Why would I lie?
Why would I lie?

You can say anything you like
But you can't touch the merchandise
She'll give you every penny's worth
But it will cost you a dollar first
You can step outside your little world
You can talk to a pretty girl
She's everything you dream about
But don't fall in love

She's a beauty
She's one in a million girls
One in a million girls
Why would I lie?
Why would I lie?
But don't fall in love
'Cause if you do, you'll find out she don't love you
She's one in a million girls
One in a million girls
Why would I lie?
Now, why would I lie?

(Step outside your world)

(But don't fall in love) she's a beauty
(She's one in a million girls) one in a million girls
(Why would I lie?) now why would I lie?

(But don't fall in love) 'cause if you do, you'll find out she don't love you
(She's one in a million girls) one in a million girls
(Why would I lie?) why would I lie?

(But don't fall in love)
(She's one in a million girls)
(Why would I lie?)
