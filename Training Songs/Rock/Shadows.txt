In case I never get to see you again
I don't get time to work things out
No time to make amends
Went to my soul chasm
Of the great words left unsaid
For you have been a part of me
But if it were to end

I'm talking 'bout
Shadows, filling my heart and
Swallows chasing the dark
I gotta
Find you before too long
I gotta
Tell you what's been going wrong
What's been going wrong

All these feelings welling up
In a silent reservoir
In the dark recesses of my heart
I'm not the same person anymore
I can't look you in the eyes
No longer hold your gaze
I've been living in my head for months
How come these things change?

I'm talking 'bout
Shadows, filling my heart and
Swallows chasing the dark
I gotta
Find you before too long
I gotta
Tell you what's been going wrong
What's been going wrong

Talking 'bout
Shadows, filling my heart and
Swallows chasing the dark
I gotta
Find you before too long
I gotta
Tell you what's been going wrong about
Shadows, filling my heart and
Swallows chasing the dark
I gotta
Find you before too long
I gotta
Tell you what's been going wrong
What's been going wrong
What's been going wrong
What's been going wrong
