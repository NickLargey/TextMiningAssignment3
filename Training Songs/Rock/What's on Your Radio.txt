What's On Your Radio

What's your problem? 
What's on your mind?
You're letting everything fall by the wayside
Check the program, stay on the line
The operator will be with you in no time

You've got your problems,
Well I've got mine
Lost transmition inside your mind

Check the station, tune in the dial
Make sure your keeping up with all of the new style
You say you find it, hard to decide
But you will never know until you try

What's the answer? 
Fucked if I Know!
But do you trust what's On Your Radio?
