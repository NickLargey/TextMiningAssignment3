I see the look disappearing from your eyes, eyes yeah
We complicate things every time we fight, fight yeah
Painting pictures in my mind, mind yeah
All this time I'm being blind, blind 

Well I tried so hard but it still goes on

If you're going to leave me, don't hesitate, don't believe me
Just say so, just say so
Lovers cant be leaders, they need to scream feelings
They say so, they say so

Damn feelings burning my spirit inside, inside yeah
I'm half the man you can barely recognise, recognise 
Love can take me for a ride, ride yeah
Turning tables changing times, times

Well I tried so hard but it still goes on

If you're going to leave me, don't hesitate, don't believe me
Just say so, just say so
Lovers cant be leaders, they need to scream feelings
They say so, they say so

If you're going to leave me, don't hesitate, don't believe me
Just say so, just say so
Lovers cant be leaders, they need to scream feelings
They say so, they say so

If you wanna feel like me, be like me yeah, me yea
If you wanna figure out me, be like me yeah

If you're going to leave me, don't hesitate, don't believe me
Just say so, just say so
Lovers cant be leaders, they need to scream feelings
They say so, they say so

If you're going to leave me, don't hesitate, don't believe me
Just say so, just say so
Lovers cant be leaders, they need to scream feelings
They say so, they say so
