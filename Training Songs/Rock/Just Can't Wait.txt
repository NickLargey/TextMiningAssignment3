Your daddy's tellin' you, I just ain't no good
And everything I try to do is just misunderstood

But I don't care if your daddy says it's wrong
I just can't stand to be away from you too long

I just can't wait, I just can't wait
I just can't wait, I just can't wait

The clock open my wall, it must be runnin' slow
Tonight when you're here next to me, I'll never let you go
I wish the day would hurry up and set us free
Because tonight with you is where I want to be

I just can't wait, I just can't wait
I just can't wait, I just can't wait

Ooh, girl, holdin' me so tight
Ooh, girl, I can't wait 'til tonight

But I don't care if your daddy says it's wrong
I just cant stand to be away from you to long

I just can't wait, I just can't wait
I just can't wait, I just can't wait
I just can't wait, I just can't wait
I just can't wait, I just can't wait

I just can't wait, no, no, my baby
I just can't wait, no, no, no
I just can't wait, no, no, my baby
I just can't wait, no, no, no
