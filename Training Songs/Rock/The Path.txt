Crawling, to the path of the righteous
Crawling, to you again, to you again
Crawling, up and down a mountain
Crawling, then up again, then up again

Could you ever admit to yourself
That you must walk in the light of the past?

Not invited, to cry out loud
I'm a brother, stone cold true
Love and suffer, Siamese gold
Left divided, so I trudge on out

Could you ever admit to yourself
That you must walk in the light of the past?

Not invited, to cry out loud
I'm a brother, stone cold true
Love and suffer, Siamese gold
Half divided, so I trudge on

Eyes wide to reality
Crawling, up and down a mountain
Crawling, to you again

Eyes wide to reality
Crawling, up and down a mountain
Then up again

Eyes wide to reality
Crawling, I'm
Crawling, I'm
Crawling, I'm
Crawling

I'm crawling to you
