What am I gonna do till you come home
What am I gonna do now that you're gone
What am I gonna do without you
What am I gonna do without a man

What am I gonna do
You do the best you can
What am I gonna do without you
What am I gonna do with all my time

I'll just drown my dreams in sweet wine
What am I gonna do without you
Now what are you gonna do without me
Who's gonna give you all the things you need

What are you gonna do without me
What are you gonna do it you come home
And the woman you thought was waitin' for you is gone
What are you gonna do it you come home

Now what am I gonna do till you come home
What am I gonna do now that you're gone
What am I gonna do without you
What am I gonna do without you
