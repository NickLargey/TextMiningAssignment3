And I don't care as long as you sing
And I don't care as long as we swing
And I don't care as long as you sing

I get everything right
And I want you to
Get everything right
I'm not playing rude
I get everything right
Get up and swing
You make me sing

So here we go it doesn't pay
It won't protect me no more
When I get up I break it down
I'll double back and for sure
I go back to zero

Get up

I swallow a lot
If the pressure is up
And the feeling I've got
Is I'm not gonna stop
We are back in the early morning
Back in the early morning

So here we go it doesn't pay
It won't protect me no more
When I get up I break it down
I'll double back and for sure
I go back to zero

So here we go it doesn't pay
It won't protect me no more
When I get up I break it down
I'll double back and for sure
I go back to zero

And I don't care as long as you sing
And I don't care as long as we swing
And I don't care as long as you sing

Get up

So here we go it doesn't pay
It won't protect me no more
When I get up I break it down
I'll double back and for sure
I go back to zero

So here we go it doesn't pay
It won't protect me no more
When I get up I break it down
I'll double back and for sure
I go back to zero

So here we go come on

I get everything right
And I want you to
Get everything right
I'm not playing rude
I get everything right
Get up and swing
