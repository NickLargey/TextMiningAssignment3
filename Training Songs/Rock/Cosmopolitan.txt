I'm okay, you're okay
Why remember when it wasn't this way
See my home, see my car
And the beach always used to seem so far

[Chorus]
And no one touches me
Unless it's the way I want it to be
I know I read the right magazines
I'm cosmopolitan
And I don't look back

I'm alright, sleep at night
Used to lie awake listening to cats fight
See my hair, see my shoes
And I used to be scared of the dark too

[Chorus]

Cosmopolitan

[Chorus]
