I'm growing tired of a mouth shut tight
When all I want to do is tell the whole world
About the Man sitting at the right hand of the One in Heaven
How could I sing about anything but Him

CHORUS
He is the answer to the question
He is the cure for the infection
He is all He says He is
He is the ultimate reflection
Of holiness and true perfection
He is all He says He is

How can I not cry watching as the world dies without a prayer
They look to their own construction
Bound to the living God of Earth and Heaven
How could they sing about everything but Him, yeah, yeah

CHORUS

I'm so tired of a mouth shut tight
All I want to do is tell the whole world
About the man sitting at the right hand of the One in Heaven
How could I sing about anything but Him

CHORUS
