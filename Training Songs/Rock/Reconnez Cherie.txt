On a convenient seat by the lavatories
In the sodium glare
We used to wait for the bus in a passionate clutch
And go as far as we dared
Do you remember 
When I passed my driving test
Took you to the pictures? 
Forget the rest 
Do you remember
All those nights in my Zodiac
Playing with your dress
Underneath your Pac-a-Mac?

Reconnez, cherie
Quand nous avons vive en ecstasy

And then a voice from afar in the back of my car
Whispered 'gay Paris'
And looking ever-so French the bohemian dream
You said 'bonjour mon ami'
Do you remember
When I moved into my studio flat?
Hot sticky nights
In the summertime in bedsitland 
Do you remember
When you sold your paintings in the gallery?
And they said 'mais oui ce soir
'C'est la vie c'est le tricolor'

Reconnez, cherie
Quand nous avons vive en ecstasy
