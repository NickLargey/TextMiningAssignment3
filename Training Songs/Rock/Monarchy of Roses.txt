The crimson tide is flowing through your fingers as you sleep
The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep
Do you like it rough I ask and are you up to task?
The catacombs of bet and bone where cultures come to clash

Several of my best friends wear, 
The colors of the crown
And Mary wants to fill it up, 
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The savior of your light
The monarchy of roses 
The monarchy of roses tonight

The cloth between my former queen, her legendary stare
The holy tears that I am in, the lovely cross to bear

Several of my best friends know, 
The secrets of this town
And Mary wants to raise it up, 
And Sherry wants to spit it all around, girl
The sailors of the night
The monarchy of roses 
The monarchy of roses tonight

Several of my best friends wear, 
The colors of the crown
And Mary wants to fill it up, 
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The savior of your light
The monarchy of roses 
The monarchy of roses

Hey yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said, hey yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will, and then say I'll want to
The story of love that I'll never taunt you

Hey yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said, hey yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will, and then I'll say I want to
The story of love that I'll always want you
Hey
