Speaking before you figure it out
Not always right but never in doubt
Stepping inside for now
Your mind is read
Fall down dead

Into the dark, out of the room
Out of the way, never too soon
Some of the ground you gain
Lost instead
Fall down dead

Don't listen to me, listen to yourself
Listen to yourself
Don't listen to me or anybody else
Listen to yourself

Some of the things you said
Stop my head
Fall down dead

Fall down dead
