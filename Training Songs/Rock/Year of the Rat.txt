June is on the run for so long
Pushed and pulled then shunned it was so wrong 
These 4 walls crashing in won't stop me now
Cause I'm alive, I'm out tonight, all night. 

Everybody needs to know it's the year of the rat
Everyday we've got to hold on
Cause if we hold on we could find some new energy 

Streets with flags unfurled like treasure
Thank me for my words it's a pleasure
Just don't ask me to stay cause I'll be gone
But it's alright, I'm okay, always

Everybody needs to know it's the year of the rat
Everyday we've got to hold on
Cause if we hold on we could find some new energy

One plus one is one together
One plus one is one forever
One plus one is one together
One plus one is one forever
