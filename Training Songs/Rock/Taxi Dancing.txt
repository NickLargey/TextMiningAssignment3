I think that it's high time we had a talk
I think that we're making a big mistake
I've been feeling lately the magic is gone
Are we just together for convenience sake, baby

I don't believe it (Feeling)
I don't think that's true (Tied down)
It'll just pass if we allow it to (Need to break free)
It's just a stage we're going through (They say clean cuts)
I think you're just restless for something new (Heal much faster)

Baby, feeling like we pay our dime
And all we get in return
Is a piece of each other's time

Are we just taxi dancing
Lost somewhere in a slow dance for two
And the band that was playing
Has finally stopped playing our favorite song

Are we just taxi dancing
You're paying for me and I'm paying for you
And are we holding on to a feeling with desperation

Don't know if you're right
Don't know if you're wrong
Seems to me we haven't danced for long

Don't make it hard (I won't)
Don't make it easy (Hold you)
We'll just walk away (If you)
At the end of the song (Must go)

Baby. put one last nickel in the jukebox
Give that love we once felt
Just one final spin around

'Cause we're just Taxi Dancing
Lost somewhere in a slow dance for two

And the band that was playing
Has finally stopped playing our favorite song
And we're just dancing
And the band that was playing
Has finally stopped playing our favorite song
Are we just Taxi Dancing
You're paying for me and I'm paying for you
And are we holding on to each other in desperation

Taxi dancing...
