Your car crash buckled up from heaven
Feeling like it's poison
When there's no one around

Your whole life sectioned up from red rose
Wishing you could see who
But you're stuck in the ground

With this minute sad show
Let the scenes go
It's obvious that you want
Would you say it feels smooth
Would you stay home
How do you feel
It's how do you feel suffocating

Breathe in
Breathe in
Breathe in
Look what's all around you
Breathe in
Breathe in
Breathe in
Look what's all around you

Taking off in circles
Wondering if it's worth it
You're innocent and ignored
But this main land system
Has a glitch in it
It's significance has been shown

When you realise it's payed for
Wondering where the story's gone
It's how do you feel
It's how do you feel suffocating

Breathe in
Breathe in
Breathe in
Look what's all around you
Breathe in
Breathe in
Breathe in
Look what's all around you

It doesn't matter if you run away
It doesn't matter if you've gone away
When you're taking off the road
And you're locked outside the block
It's OK

Life's a dizzy
Far to busy
Never stops
Feeling heavy
Try to steady
It's all you've got

Breathe in
Breathe in
Breathe in
Look what's all around you
Breathe in
Breathe in
Breathe in
Look what's all around you

Oohooo

You'd scream
