Come in base I've landed my ship on a planet here in space
This is the one they say is inhabited by the human race
And I'm going out to look around and see what's here
And I'll tell you what I find
Confirmation on the inhabitants they're running everywhere
And their technology is beyond what I've seen anywhere
But I'm trying to communicate and they don't hear me
It seems like for all I'm finding
I can't find the most important thing

Where are the signs, where are the signs of life
The love that proves there is a beating heart inside
Where are the signs, where are the signs of life
The compassion and concern that makes this world turn
Where are the signs of life

Now, I've got crayons rolling around in the floorboard of my car
Bicycles all over my driveway, bats and balls all over my yard
And there's a plastic man from outer space sitting in my chair
The signs of life are everywhere
But I've got questions rolling around in the corners of my mind
If it's true I live in a world where hope has all but died
And if I really have a living love alive in me
How am I letting it be known, how am I letting it be seen

These are the signs, these are the signs of life
The love that proves there is a living faith inside
These are the signs, these are the signs of life
The compassion and concern that makes this world turn
These are the signs of life
Signs of Life

These are the signs, these are the signs of life
The love that proves there is a living faith inside
These are the signs, these are the signs of life
The compassion and concern
That's gonna make this world keep turning
These are the signs of life
A love that's flowing from the heart
Where the grace of God has left its mark
These are the signs of life
The reaching out of a servant's hand
The giving that makes no demands
These are the signs of life
This is loving proof of the faith inside
These are the signs of life
