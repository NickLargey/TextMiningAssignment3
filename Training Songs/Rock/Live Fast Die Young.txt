I don't want to live
To be thirty-four
I don't want to die
In a nuclear war
Go on out
Get some more
Go on out
To the bar, the market or the liquor store

I don't want to live
To be forty-three
I don't like
What I see going on around me

Go on out
Get some more
Go on out
Get fucked up and pass out on the floor
Go on out
Get some more
Go on out
To your favorite liquor store
Go on out
Don't worry about it any more
Go on out
Get fucked up
I don't know what for

I don't want to live
To be fifty-seven
I'm living in hell
Is there a heaven?

Live fast, die young
Live fast, die young
Live fast, die young
Live fast, die young
