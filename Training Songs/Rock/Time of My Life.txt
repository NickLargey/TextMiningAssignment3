Sometimes I'm just thinking
That I got the best time of my life
I've been with my girl for seven years now
And I got the sweetest dog that
Trust me forever

After school I took my chances
Continued to do the things I love
And now I find that I was right
I'm twenty-six now still I
Do what I want to

And the days are passing by
And now I realize that I've got the time of my life

Time of my life
And the days are passing by

Now I sit here thinking
About the best time of my life
So many years I've been with my band now
And four of my best friends they still
Trust me forever

And still the days are passing by
Now I realize, still I've got the time of my life

Time of my life
And the days are passing by
