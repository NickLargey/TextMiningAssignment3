Standing on the shore watching our ship go down,
Sinking in the sand and I can't turn round,
The future's looking black and it's a sight to see,
Just a thousand grey waves crashing over me,
Just a thousand grey waves breaking over me.

How it's happening to me
Why can't I ever see?
Am I gonna let you leave without a sound?
Watching till you're out of sight,
Dreaming I did something right,
Standing on my own again.

Water in my lungs and it's a pain to breathe,
Salt is in my eyes and it's a pain to see,
I can't stand the pressure and you think I can,
Just don't wanna see you going down the pan,
Just don't wanna see you going down the pan.

How it's happening to me
Why can't I ever see?
Am I gonna let you leave without a sound?
Watching till you're out of sight,
Dreaming I did something right,
Standing on my own again.
