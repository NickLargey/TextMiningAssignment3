Saved all money for this Saturday 
Got all my work done on time 
Well finally kid, nothing can stop us now 
Coming rain or shine 

Every sweet thing on the street corner 
"Hey, can I give you a ride...?" 
Were just cruisin' and boozin 
Trying to have a good time 

That's right, baby 
Cruisin' and boozin' 
Out with some friends of mine. 
Someday, I'm gonna beat this race 

Be on top, you'll see. 
Step myself out across that line 
And be anything I want to be. 
But right now, everything's alright 

Out here in the streets. 
We've got JD in the back seat 
We drink nothin' but the best. 
Pop a buck in the gas tank, 

We drink up the rest 
Yeah, we'll drink up the rest!
