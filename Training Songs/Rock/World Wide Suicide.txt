I felt the earth on Monday 
It moved beneath my feet
In the form of a morning paper 
Laid out for me to see 
Saw his face in a corner picture 
I recognized the name 
Could not stop staring at the 
Face I'd never see again 

It's a shame to awake in a world of pain 
What does it mean when
A war has taken over? 
It's the same every day 
I heard my name 
What can be saved and
Who will be left to hold her? 

The whole world 
World over 
It's a world wide suicide 
The whole world 
World over 
It's a world wide suicide 

Medals on a wooden mantle 
Next to a handsome face 
That the president took for granted 
Writing checks the whole world pays 
And in all the madness 
Thought becomes numb and naive
Too much to talk about 
And nothing for to say 

It's the same every day 
And the wave won't break 
Tell you to pray while
The devil's on his shoulder
Laying claim to the take 
That our soldiers save
Does not equate, and 
The truth's already out there

The whole world 
World over 
It's a world wide suicide 
The whole world 
World over 
It's a world wide suicide 

Looking in the eyes of the fallen 
You've got to know there's another 
Another 
Another 
Another 
Another

Way

It's a shame to awake in a world of pain 
What does it mean when
The war has taken over
It's the same every day 
And the wave won't break 
Tell you to pray while
The devil's on his shoulder 

The whole world 
World over 
It's a world wide suicide 

The whole world 
World over 
It's a world wide suicide 

The whole world 
World over 
It's a world wide suicide 

The whole world 
World over 
It's a world wide suicide
