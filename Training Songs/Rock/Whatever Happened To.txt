Whatever happened to twin sets?
Whatever happened to hi-fi?
Whatever happened to TV sex?
Whatever happened to you and I?

Your passion is a product of highlight and detail
That come-hither look, bonus offer retail

Whatever happened to pick-up trucks?
Whatever happened to yellow pages?
Whatever happened to burning books?
Whatever happened to new ages?

Your emotions are cheap, cut-price cash-and-carry
You wear your heart on your sleeve for any Tom, Dick or Harry

Your love is a cashed-in cheque
Oh, oh, that's the way of all flesh

Whatever happened to Chairman Mao?
Whatever happened to God above?
Whatever happened to the cow?
Whatever happened to plug-in love?

Your pasteurized life so fit for consumption
Ooh, those undressing eyes, so strictly commercial

Your love is a cashed-in cheque
Oh, oh, that's the way of all flesh
All flesh
All flesh
