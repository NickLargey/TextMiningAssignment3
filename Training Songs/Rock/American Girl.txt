Well, she was an American girl,
Raised on promises 
She couldn't help thinking 
That there was a little more to life
Somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die
Tryin', she had one little promise 
She was gonna keep 
Oh yeah, alright, 
Take it easy, baby 
Make it last all night
She was an American girl.

Well, it was kind of cold that night, 
She stood alone on the balcony 
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by,
Out on four forty one like
Waves crashing on the beach,
And for one des'rate moment there 
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful 
When something that's so close 
Is still so far out of reach
