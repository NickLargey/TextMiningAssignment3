Woke like a baby
Woke
They took somebody from me
This time I think it was forever

Looks like a movie
Looks
Like they took somebody from me
I wish I could return to when I

Woke like a lover
Woke
And found somebody with me

I wish I wasn't me
I wish I wasn't me

Now I'm standing at the edge of my world
And I'm looking for a place to stay
Standing at the edge of my world

Joked for a minute
Joked
Get somebody for me
And all the time you've seen me I just

Spoke in a riddle
Spoke
Get somebody for me
I hoped that I could make it but I

Broke like a mirror
I Broke
And choked in the middle, indeed

I wish I wasn't me
I wish I wasn't me

Now I'm standing at the edge of my world
And I'm looking for a place to stay
Standing at the edge of my world
And that's OK

Sleep like a baby
Sleep
