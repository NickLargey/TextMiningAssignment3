I feel like I'm gonna drop real soon
My mind's hurting, I'm over the moon
Pulse is sagging, I'm losing pace
It's the way you feel and another way you taste

Rebel, rebel, I see you with a gun
If you gonna shoot, then I'm glad I'm the one
'cause it's the way you, hmm it's on the tip of my tongue
It's the way you chase and away I run

Bang bang bang bang
She points her finger at me
Pulls the trigger and I bleed
Now the argumental thing
Run baby as fast as you can 'cause you're not the man
Nah you wouldn't understand
I love the way she moves and plays
I want her dancing on my grave

Look past the trouble, now look past the gun
Pull me past, now pull me beyond
Watch you to the break of the day
My heart's a racing as I love the way

But if you need someone I'll give in
There's no need to pretend
My mamacita with her eyes looking at me
Like she never done wrong
Like you never done wrong

Bang bang bang bang
She points her finger at me
Pulls the trigger and I bleed
Now the argumental thing
Run baby as fast as you can 'cause you're not the man
But I just couldn't understand
I love the way she moves and plays
I want her dancing on my grave

Rebel rebel and a cold 45
Let's live the life, let's go out and jive
Let's leave town, let's leave town on the run
Go to california and burn in the sun

You gotta jive babe, come on and try babe
Drive it back and forth
You look so good I wouldn't lie
I need to hold you, come on and hold me
Oh I wouldn't mind if you the one and only baby

Keep it cool babe too cool for school babe
Jive it and a try it you don't have to make me buy it
You hurt my eyes babe give me a rise babe
Ever since the way you put the hurt I've been astray

Now bang bang bang babe you shot me dead babe
I love the way you play, I want you dancing on my grave
My mamacita, senorita na na na na na, na na na na na na na na

Shake it ah shake it ah, come on you gotta break it
Come on jive babe, come on and try babe
Drive it back and forth you look so good I wouldn't lie
I need to hold you come on and hold me
Oh I wouldn't mind if you the one and only baby

Keep it cool babe too cool for school babe
Jive it and a try it you don't have to make me buy it
You hurt my eyes babe give me a rise babe
Ever since the way you put the hurt I've been astray
Watcha I came to,  since you are the one
