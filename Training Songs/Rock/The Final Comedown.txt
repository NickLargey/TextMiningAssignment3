I've looted and I've begged
On the tubes of the Bec and Broadway
I've been run over by cars
And to prove it her's the scars
On my wrists
I've been cut
I've been stitched
I've been buggered, bewitched and abandoned

But nothing in Heaven or Earth
Prepared me for this
The Final Comedown
It's a victory worth sharing
We should celebrate I think
With the bloodiest of Marys
But I'm too fucked to drink
