Relapse 
Prevent trigger intent 
Now drown 
High strung 
Say X amount of words 

You're solar, bipolar 
Panic disorder 
Seems harder and harder and harder 
Still you try to control it 

You mold, you mold 
Yeah you shape to mold 
Oh you're bold you're bold 
But your shape is bold 

You're a symptom superficial 
To what they call knowing you 
Minus the speed, 
Could you imagine the phobia? 

Your brain is faulty wiring 
the reason for tiring 
Keep treating the curse, 
Imagine the worst 
Systematic, sympathetic 
Quite pathetic, apologetic, paramedic 
Your heart is prosthetic 

A plate of quite peculiar 
On a dish of my own 
A tablespoon of feather 
tickle me to the bone 
Give me recipes for happy 
with the chemicals gone 
Drinking freedom from a bottle 
to the tune of belong 

I'm sick of shaking 
never waking 
from the hell I achieve 
I never knew you till you left me 
with the crying disease 

Another curing, reassuring 
way to buckle the knees 
So mistreated, I repeated 
Never blessing your sneeze 

Now deleted and defeated 
I will stand on my own 
Yeah your memory that punches me 
has broken the bone 

Give me recipes for sorry 
I'm admitting I'm wrong 
Still your memory that punches me 
has broken the bone
