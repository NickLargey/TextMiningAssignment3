Snow on the railroad tracks 
Dogs in the moonlight 
Stoned out on Kerouac 
Tryin' to get it just right 

A phone in a dim lit room 
Rings out forever 
In a time that was still too soon 
But why should he care? 
He had a rambling soul 
He drank a bottle of cheap wine 
Turned up his collar to the cold 
And waited, he waited for a sign 

Fueled by amphetamines 
And visions of beauty 
As far as the eye could see 
Was all that he strived for 

A waitress in Tennessee 
Said he looked like Jesus 
He silenced her raging sea 
Then walked out the door 
He had a rambling soul 
He drank a bottle of cheap wine 
Turned up his collar to the cold 
And waited, he waited for a sign 

Under an open sky 
He stands with his eyes closed 
If anyone asked him why 
He would not know 
He's lost in America 
Hell bent for no place 
A rusty harmonica 
That won't even play 
He's lost in America
