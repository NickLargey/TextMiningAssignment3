I'm ready
Ready for the laughing gas
I'm ready
Ready for what's next
Ready to duck
Ready to dive
Ready to say
I'm glad to be alive
I'm ready
Ready for the push, uh huh

In the cool of the night
In the warmth of the breeze
I'll be crawling 'round
On my hands and knees

Just down the line
Zoo Station
Got to make it on time
Zoo Station

Ready
Ready for the gridlock
I'm ready
To take it to the street, uh huh
I'm ready for the shuffle
Ready for the deal
Ready to let go of the steering wheel
I'm ready
Ready for the crush, uh huh

Zoo Station
Zoo Station

Alright
Alright, alright, alright, not alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

Time is a train
Makes the future the past
Leaves you standing in the station
Your face pressed up against the glass

(Down the line), Zoo Station
(You know I'm under the sign) Zoo Station
No, no Zoo Station
You say no, no, Zoo Station
You say no, no, Zoo Station
I say no, no, Zoo Station
Ah
Ah, ah
Yeah, ah
Zoo
