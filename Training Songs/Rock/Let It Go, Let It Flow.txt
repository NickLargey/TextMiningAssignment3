When I'm alone, I sometimes get to thinkin'
How it's gonna be when we're gone?
Are we moving closer together
Or is it gonna take forever and ever?

Let it go, let it go, let it flow like a river
Let it go, let it go, let it flow through you
Let it go, let it go, let it flow like a river
Let it go, let it go, let it flow through you

Searching everywhere just tryin' to find a reason
A misunderstanding in doubt
Don't want to preach it, push it or teach it
Just take a good look all around

Let it go, let it go, let it flow like a river
Let it go, let it go, let it flow through you
Let it go, let it go, let it flow like a river
Let it go, let it go, let it flow through you

Was it gonna follow that angels gonna call on you
To help you on your way
Time spent together, like now, is forever
So, don't ever let this smile slip away

Let it go, let it go, let it flow like a river
Let it go, let it go, let it flow through you
Let it go, let it go, let it flow like a river
Let it go, let it go, let it flow through you

Let it go, let it go, let it flow like a river
Let it go, let it go, let it flow through you
Let it go, let it go, let it flow like a river
Let it go, let it go, let it flow through you
