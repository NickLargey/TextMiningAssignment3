Crave, crave
Crave, crave
Alright

The simple life, I will not have
It doesn't satisfy me
I don't believe in the status quo
I kinda leaves me bleak

A mountain high is what I climb
I swim a river deep
So if you crave the time of your life
Try to keep up with me, hey

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna soar, till the day I die
On the wings of a bird of prey
Hey, hey, hey

You're absolutely what I crave

You better believe thats a smile on my face
You know it don't come cheap
Sure I've lived the American Dream
Go ahead and crucify me, yeah

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna soar, 'till the day I die
On the wings of a bird of prey
Hey, hey, hey

You're absolutely what I crave, crave

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna soar till the day I die
On the wings of a bird of prey
Hey, hey, hey

I'm gonna live
(I'm gonna live)
I'm gonna fly
(I'll fly)

I'm gonna soar till the day I die
(On the wings)
On the wings of a bird of prey
(Hey)
Hey, hey, hey

You're absolutely what I crave
Crave, crave, crave
Crave, crave, crave
