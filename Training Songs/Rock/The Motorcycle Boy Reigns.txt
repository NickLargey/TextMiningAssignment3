Sing yourself to sleep
Because I don't know your name
To the ocean we will go
If the land won't stop us first

So kiss yourself for life
From the threats you can't bend
Oh, of all the things we have done
It doesn't seem good enough

So we sing at the source that we love
We were young and we don't know your name

Do you ever sit and stare?
The quickening of time
Is there something else for us?
Or a line we'll never cross

So we sing at the source that we love
We were young and we don't know your name
