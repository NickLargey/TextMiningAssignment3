I want you to see boats, so you took me to the sea
I felt like I could fly in this new sky you showed to me
Airplanes passed above us, so only i could hear
When you whispered "I love you" so sweetly in my ear
These are the best days (2x)
Night time on an empty shore - foggy like my head
Drifting off to sleep to all those silly things you said
Waking for a moment, to say that we'd be fine
You hid your smile with one hand and with the other you held mine
These are the best days (5x)
