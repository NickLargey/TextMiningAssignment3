You say you know me,
You really know me,
But you don't know me at all.
Thinkin' that I just don't care,
Any minute I'm not there,
Sittin' all alone, pickin' up the phone to call.

You say you need me,
But though you need me,
You wonder how did you fall.
But if you swear it can't be true,
That I should care the way I do,
Then you don't know me at all.

(Shoobi doo dam dam) I'm not foolin' around.
It's nothing new, I'm telling you,
This heart of mine beats just for you.
(Shoobi doo dam dam) you're the only one,
And there's no reason I should ever lie.
(oh-oh, oh-oh)

You say you need me, (ah-ah)
But though you need me, (ah-ah)
You wonder how did you fall.
But if you swear it can't be true,
That I should care the way I do,
Then you don't know me at all.

You don't know me, (ah-)
You don't know me, (ah-)
You don't,
(Shoobi doo dam dam)
(Shoobi doo dam dam)
You don't know me at all.

You don't know me, (shoobi doo dam dam)
You don't know me, (shoobi doo dam dam)
You don't know me, you don't know me at all.

You don't know me, (shoobi doo dam dam)
You don't know me, (shoobi doo dam dam)
You don't know me, you don't know me at all.

You don't know me. (shoobi doo dam dam)
