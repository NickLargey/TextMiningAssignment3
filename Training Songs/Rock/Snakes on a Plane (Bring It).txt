"That's it!
I've had it with these motherfucking snakes
On this motherfucking plane!"

Times are strange
We got a free upgrade for
Snakes on a plane.
F*ck em, I don't care.
Pop the cheap champagne,
We're going down in flames, hey.

Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it.
Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it.
Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it.
Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it.

So kiss me goodbye.
Honey, I'm gonna make it out alive.
So kiss me goodbye.
I can see the venom in their eyes.
Goodbye.

It's time to fly,
Tonight the sky's alive
With the turpentine
Lounging in their suits and ties.
Watch the whore's parade
For the price of fame, hey.

Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it.
Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it.
Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it.
Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it.

So kiss me goodbye.
Honey I'm gonna make it out alive
So kiss me goodbye.
I can see the venom in their eyes

So kiss me goodbye.
Honey, I'm gonna make it out alive
So kiss me goodbye.
I can see the venom in their eyes
Goodbye.

Ladies and gentlemen
These snakes are slitherin'
With dollar signs in they eyes
With tongues so reptilian
This industry's venomous
With cold-blooded sentiment
No need for nervousness
It's just a little turbulence.

So kiss me goodbye.
Honey I'm gonna make it out alive
So kiss me goodbye.
I can see the venom in their eyes

So kiss me goodbye.
Honey, I'm gonna make it out alive
So kiss me goodbye.
I can see the venom in their eyes
Goodbye.

Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it.
Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it.
Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it.
Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it.

We seem to be losing altitude
At an alarming pace
Midtown downtown
Snakes on a blog
I suggest you grab your ankles
And kiss your ass goodbye.
