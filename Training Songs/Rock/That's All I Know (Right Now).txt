My nerves are buzzin and my heart is gone
I think I once was different but I might be wrong
There's ghosts in the attic and bones on the wall
But it's all right I don't care at all

I'm yours, and you
You're mine and that's
That's all I know right now
That's all
That's all I know, right now

It's dark outside except for pinpoint light
Why a little gold tooth lost in a fight
I'll duck outside pick it up from the street
Stomp on it once and lay it at your feet

I'm yours, and you
You're mine and that's
That's all I know right now
That's all
That's all I know

Aw baby it's dark out there, but
Aw baby it's dark in here, but
Oh darlin' I don't care, no, no

The tv's up against the wall like a painting
While everybody here in the museum's fainting
Well I myself have got froth on my lips
It's delicious lady, won't you have a sip?

I'm yours, and you
You're mine and that's
That's all I know right now
That's all
That's all I know, right now

I'm yours, and you
You're mine and that's
That's all I know right now
That's all
That's all I know, right now
