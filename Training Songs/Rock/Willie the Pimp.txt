I'm a little pimp with my hair gassed back
Pair of khaki pants with my shoes shined black

Got a little lady walk that street
Tellin' all the boys that she can't be beat

Twenty dollar bill, I can set you straight
Meet me on the corner boy'n don't be late

Man in a suit with bow-tie neck
Want to buy a grunt with a third party check

Standin' onna porch of the Lido Hotel
Floozies in the lobby love the way I sell

Hot meat
Hot rats 
Hot zits 
Hot wrists
Hot ritz
Hot roots 
Hot soots

Hot meat

Hot chicks
