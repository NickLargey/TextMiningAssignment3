Reveal to me this ugly thing
I'm rusted metal by your head
It's gotten out of hand again, nobody sees it, but I can
You thought of everything, I bet, but did you think that I might die?
I haven't really smiled in I don't know how long, you know
Something's gonna give again
SOMETHING'S GONNA GIVE AGAIN

I tried to fight, but did you listen?
Even after you're gone, man, I'm finished
I could never be your god, but then I don't even think I want the job anymore

Say something, anything to me, I do believe, but I have doubts
So many reasons to hold on, conflicting interest isn't it
I guess I'm better off in the end, cuz you were always there to blame
I haven't felt so bad in I don't know how long, you know
I can't get away again
I CAN'T GET AWAY AGAIN

I tried to fight, but did you listen?
Even after you're gone, man, I'm finished
I could never be your god, but then I don't even think I want the job, you see  
I tried to fight, but did you listen?

Even after you're gone, man, I'm finished
I could never be your god, but then I don't even think I want the job anymore

What am I supposed to do now? 
How am I supposed to live now?
 All I ever did was try, but the story ends, so I guess I'll have to die
Where am I supposed to go now?

Go ahead and go away again

What am I supposed to do now? 
How am I supposed to live now?
All I ever did was try, but the story ends, so I guess I'll have to die
What am I supposed to do now? 
How am I supposed to live now?
What am I supposed to do now? 
How am I supposed to live now?
