She
She flys without no feathers 
A fool to try to catch her 
Well I don't know 
'Cause I don't know
I'm a fool 

Yeah, a visionary's daughter 
She don't care that you want on her
She'll kill you once, you won't mind 
You'll ask her twice 

Hey hey rocket boy 
Gotta lot of life behind her 
Hey hey mockingbird girl 
Gotta fly don't let him hold you 

You were born a lucid flower
A tulip and I pulled her 
I was born to play the fool, unlike you 

No sex 
I'm bored with anticipation 
This love song radio station 
I guess you'll sleep, I'll count sheep
And watch you dream 

So let's make a run and buy a rocket 'copter
I bought it from a crooked copper
Her breath it smelled like beer 
A warm beer
A warm beer

Hey hey rocket boy 
Gotta lot of life behind her 
Hey hey mockingbird girl 
Gotta fly don't let him hold you

Hey hey rocket boy 
Gotta lot of life behind her 
Hey hey mockingbird girl 
Gotta fly don't let him hold you

Hey hey mockingbird girl 
Gotta fly don't let him hold you down
