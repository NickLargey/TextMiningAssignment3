Lost boys and golden girls, down on the corner and all around the world
Lost boys and golden girls
Down on the corner and all around, all around the worldIt doesn't matter where they're going, or wherever they've been
'Cause they got one thing in common it's true
They'll never let a night like tonight go to waste
And let me tell you something, neither will you, neither will you
We gotta be fast, we were born out of time, born out of time and alone
And we'll never be as young as we are right now
Running away and running for home, running for home
Lost boys and golden girls, down on the corner and all around the world
Lost boys and golden girls
Down on the corner and all around, and all around the world
