Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer
Shined up his reindeer shoes
Put on a digital mix of his favorite tunes
Needed to hear a little Rhythm & Blues
Did a 4-step dance called The Reindeer Shuffle
Looked up at the open sky
He said I've waited all year for this one special night
Rudolph is ready to fly!

Ready for the big night'big night
Santa Claus is comin' to town
All over the world
Every boy and girl's
Heads are spinning round and round and round
It's the big night'big night

Jolly Old Saint Nick and Mrs. Santa
Woke up with the morning light
Santa checked his list & checked it twice
Making sure everything was just right
Mrs. Claus put on a pot of hot chocolate
And laid out the famous red suit
Joey Jo Jo Junior'Santa's favorite elf
Shined up the big black boots

Getting' ready for the big night'big night
Santa Claus is comin' to town
All over the world
Every boy and girl's
Heads are spinning round and round and round
It's the big night'big night

Once upon a time, we believe
Long ago and far away
A brand new mother laid her brand new baby
On a bed of freshly cut hay
Her heart was filled with wonder
And a sense of pure delight
As the heavens cried out with a mighty shout
This is The Big Night'Big Night

It's the big night'big night
Christmas is comin' to town
All over the world
Every boy and girl's
Heads are spinning round and round and round
It's the big night'big night

Yeah it's the big night'big night
Santa Claus is comin' to town
All over the world
Every boy and girl's
Heads are spinning round and round and round
It's the big night'big night
