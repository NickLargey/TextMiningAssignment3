Summer nigh is ending
We four become one
To tackle new endeavors
Our work has just begun

You may find us with a hard hittin' view
Leave us to our own devices
We've got our work to do

Fool for the plenty
That's what's been said
Worse luck to find your dreams
Drifting far away

You may find us with a hard hittin' view
Leave us to our own devices
We've got our work to do

The shape now of things run
These days it may seem
Strangled like their chords
With masks and chains they sell in vain
Yes, to please, the falling hoards
We become one
Now I have seen all the good that we breathe
Intent do no wrong
Just wait and see
Your wicked greed
It will fall
To our new song
We become one

Stopped in your tracks by alarming degree
Fleeing for their cause
Don't let them stop you or they'll find a way to destroy
What you have done

Summer nigh is ending
We four become one
To tackle new endeavors
Our work has just begun
