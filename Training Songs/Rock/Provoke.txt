A fraction of a fraction
Sets the new rules to follow
Bind the hands of those who resist
To gag the mouths of all the rest

Crush the fight out of the those who persist
Censor belief's not allowed to exist
Create a state of mass confusion
Provoke a response from the trapped victim

Last of the last of the last of the sane
Hated and scorned for the truth that's possessed
Last of the last of the last of the sane
Now the most persecuted

Last of the last of the last of the sane
Now the most persecuted

Created an illusion to trap the prey inside
Of the delusion that is forced into our minds
The thought police are winning, infiltrating the brain
To own the soul and body is the point of their game

Surest way to bring them down is
Beat the negativity into them
Watch them lock into self-destruct mode

The thought police are winning, infiltrating the brain
To own the soul and body is the point of their game

Last of the last of the last of the sane
Hated and scorned for the truth that's possessed
Last of the last of the last of the sane
Now the most persecuted

Crush the fight out of the demons
While there is still time
