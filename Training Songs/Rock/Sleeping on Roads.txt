Sleeping on roads, girl yeah and taking my time
Taking it easy while the sun it does shine
While out on the sideline there's a whisper in your mind
Watch for the road girl, it might just break your heart

You drink from the bottle yeah, you drink from the vine
Living is easy if ya got something to be

Sleeping on roads girl is fine
Sleeping on roads is fine for a time

I wrote you a song, cause I love the way you are
Wrote you a song, cause I love the way you act
Wrote you a song but I don't need you no more
So watch for the cars babe, cause they can f*ck you up
Watch for the cars babe, cause they can f*ck you up
