I know you're always alone
Looking for someone, a home
Don't wait for me
I'll be all right
In the ocean of your mind
I know I've seen better days
Walking through life like a maze
But I can see
You'll be alright
In the ocean of my mind
Turn on you light
Shining vacancy
With you I'm lost
Like a shell in the sea
But I'll pray for you
I hope you will pray for me
I know your always alone
Looking for someone, a home
I know you're always alone
Looking for someone, a home
Don't wait for me
I'll be all right
In the ocean of your mind
And you'll be alright
In the ocean of my mind
