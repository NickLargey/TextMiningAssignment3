If I break down all that I am
A field of wires we'll see what it's worth to walk
To break the lines
Of alternate steel
If I turn around what matters the most in time
We're going nowhere

Don't tell me now
The days I've had
To fill it up but spill instead
Talk to remind
Days weeks and hours

All in time will be
Later on we'll try
Hollow peaks we've climbed
All these things I've seen
How it feels to be something on

That's how the days go
If I break down all that I am
A field of wires we'll see what it's worth to walk
To break the lines
Of alternate steel
If I turn around what matters the most
In time we're going nowhere

Don't tell me god
The dreams I've had
To fill it up but spill instead
Talk to remind

All in time will be
Later on we'll try
All we gave to fly
Hollow peaks we've climbed
All these things I've been
How it feels to be something on
