One and a-two and a-one, two, three, four, all right

I took my baby to a party last night, ah-hah-hah
She was so beautiful, she made me uptight, ah-hah-hah
Up came a butcher with her ju jus alight, ah-hah-hah
It's all da-da-da-down to goodnight Vienna

Felt like a bohunk but I kept up my cool, ah-hah-hah
Green as a frog, man, I was back into school, ah-hah-hah
Zipped up my mouth 'cause I was starting to drool, ah-hah-hah
It's all da-da-da-down to goodnight Vienna

Get it up, get it up, get it up, get it up

She said she loved me but I knew she was lying, ah-hah-hah
Felt like an arab who was dancing through zion, ah-hah-hah
Don't call no doctor when you just feel like crying, ah-hah-hah
It's all da-da-da-down to goodnight Vienna

Get it up
(Keep it up)
Get it up
(Keep it up)

Get it up
(Keep it up)
Get it up
(Keep it up)

I took my baby to a party last night, ah-hah-hah
She was so beautiful, she made me uptight, ah-hah-hah
Up came a butcher with his needles in sight, ah-hah-hah
It's all down to goodnight Vienna
