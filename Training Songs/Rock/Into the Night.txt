Keep on talking, I'll start walking
Don't care about the things you say
I've had enough of your bad love
Can't take it for another day

Even though you had me thinkin'
Everything was all right
Why do I cry

Into the night
Come on baby
Check out everything in sight
Into the night
Where you gonna go, can you tell me
When you're running into the night

Everyday now, I don't know how
I fall into the same old thing
First you tell me sincerely
You're gonna be my every dream

Then you turn around like fire
Making sure the time's right
Then you're gone like the wind

Into the night
Come on baby
Check out everything in sight
Into the night
Where you gonna go, can you tell me
When you're running into the night

Then I see you walk to the door
Nothing can make you stay
Don't know what to say anymore
You just fade away
Into the night
