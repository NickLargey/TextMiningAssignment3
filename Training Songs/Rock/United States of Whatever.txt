Whatever

I went down to the beach and saw Kiki, she was all like 'ewhhhh' and I'm like whatever! 
Then this chick comes up to me and she's all like 'Hey, aren't you that dude' and I'm like yeah, whatever! 
So later, I'm, I'm at the pool hall and this girl comes up and she's all like 'uhh' and I'm like yeah, whatever! 
Cause this is my United States of Whatever 
And this is my United States of Whatever 
And this is my United States of Whatever 
And then it's three a.m. I'm on the corner wearing my leather and this dude comes up to me and says 'Hey punk' I'm like, yeah, whatever! 
Then, I'm throwing dice in the alley and officer Leroy comes up and he's like ' hey I thought I told you...' and I'm like, yeah, whatever! 
Then, up comes Zaphron and I'm like 'Yo, Zaphron, what's up?' and he's like 'nothin' and I'm like 'that's cool' 
Cause this is my United States of Whatever 
And this is my United States of Whatever 
And this is my United States of Whatever
