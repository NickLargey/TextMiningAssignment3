Dreaming 'bout the future and drinkin' on the past
Thinkin' 'bout the things that been forgotten
Tryin' to remember and tryin' to forget
That my life is empty without you
Sayonara, close your eyes now little girl
'Cause tomorrow hides a whole different world

Hold me now, you gotta guide me through the night
Hold me now, make my ice-cold blood turn warm

Talkin' 'bout our friends in love
our friends with broken hearts
The one's I always keep forgiving
That funny angel shot a poison pointed dart
tonight I want to keep on living
For your love, close your eyes now little girl
'Cause tomorrow's hidin' a whole different world

Hold me now, you gotta guide me trough the night
Hold me now, and make it last forever
Hold me now, be my guide just for a while
Hold me now and make my ice-cold blood turn warm
