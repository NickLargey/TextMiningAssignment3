Fast flo...paints her nails
And she looks bored
So far nothing scored
When she comes from people
Take it nice and slow
That's all it takes
You know
Movin' down life
Movin' with each other
Movin' down life
Movin' in another life
Movin' movin' down life
Truck stops then
Thinks everybody is a fool
That's why he dropped out of school
He drops them Bennies
And he sticks to the white line
I say he's doing fine
Movin' down life
One way or another
Movin' down life
Movin' with each other
Movin' down life
Movin' in another life
Movin' movin' down life
No one knows where the river start
Or where it goes
I'm jumping in leaving my clothes
Movin' down life
One way or another
Movin' down life
Movin' on with each other
Movin' down life
One way or another
Movin' down life
Movin' on with each otber
Movin' down life
One way or another
Movin' down life
Movin' on with each other
