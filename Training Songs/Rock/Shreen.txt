What do we do?
What do you think we should do, Shreen?
What do you think about me and you?

Today I heard the song that was playing
When I first kissed you
I woke up next to someone who wasn't you

I never thought I'd say this, Shreen
But I'm not happy
Today I'm driving to your house
And you're going to hear the truth

What do we do?
What do you think we should do, Shreen?
What do you think about me and you?

The passion we once felt has died
And it's not coming back
If we don't find a new one
Then it's all over for you and I 

So, talk to me, say something
See me through everything
(Your eyes say everything)
Yell at me, say anything
I see you in everything
(I can't look at you)
And Shreen,

No, we can't say goodnight
Until we know what's right
And we can't face the day 
Unless we find a way
And we can't solve it all
If we never see the fault

Today I heard the song that was playing
When I first kissed you
I woke up next to someone who wasn't you

What do we do?
What do you think we should do, Shreen?
What do you think about me and you, Shreen?
(What do we do?)
What do you think we should do, Shreen?
What do you think about me and you, Shreen?
(What do we do?)
What do you think we should do, Shreen?
(What do we do?)
