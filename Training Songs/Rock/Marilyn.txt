When he was about seventeen
He stole a magazine
'dancing queen'
The frontpage girl called marilyn
She looked pretty, lean
And quite obscene

He knew
She'd never let him down
Like every other one in town
She was the only one

Marilyn the dancing queen
Was smiling from his
Tv screen
Marilyn the dancing queen
Was always loving in his
Sweetest dream

He tried to call the magazine
Left a message on
Their answer machine
That his in love with marilyn
If she could phone him back
He would be keen

He knew
She'd never let him down
Like every other one in town
She was the only one

Marilyn the dancing queen
Was smiling from his
Tv screen
Marilyn the dancing queen
Was loving in
His sweetest dream
Marilyn, oh marilyn
Champagne, strawberries and cream
Marilyn, oh marilyn
Satin, lace and velveteen
Seet sweet dream
Seet sweet dream
