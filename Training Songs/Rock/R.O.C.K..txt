All of the kids where I come from
Tell the same old story
They want to be in a rock 'n' roll band
Get them a piece of the glory

You can feel it in a heartbeat
You can feel it like a soul beat
You can hear it in the bass line
You can feel it in the backbeat

R.O.C.K. rock
It's sweeping across the nation
R.O.C.K. rock
It's coming from my generation
R.O.C.K. rock
It's giving me a great sensation
R.O.C.K. rock
Wanna hear it on the radio station

It rescued me from a fate
That's worse than death
Just like a destiny
It gives me new breath

You can feel it... R.O.C.K. rock...

Turn it up
