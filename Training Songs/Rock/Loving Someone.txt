Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be

My heart is telling me the telly isn't telling me anything
I need but it needs to keep you selling me
Besides celebrities lacking in integrity
Holding up the status quo instead of showing your kids
That they matter, who're you gonna buy up next
Keep hold of their necks and keep selling them sex
It’s better if we keep them perplexed
It's better if we make them want the opposite sex
And this drives drunk through criminal minds
And you camp out beside where your man resides
You're not slow, it's just never been shown
That you should

Be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Oh, oh

We're all human, we're just like you man
We're sentient, we're something
You know I can't really remember, whatever
We shouldn't have people afloat
If it was safer underground, we wouldn't be on a boat
Shot of telepathy, exploiting insecurities, and preying on the purity
Of grief and it's simplicity but I know that maybe I'm too scared to call
Even Guy Debord needed spectacles, you see
I'm the Greek economy of cashing intellectual cheques
And now I'm trying to progress, but instead of selling sex
And I think I should be

Loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be

I am forever in alongside the boys in jumpers
On bikes from schools and cars
With autumn leaves fallen sparse across mid-afternoon
She blazed about how
‘Cultural language is an operation system
A simple interface rendered feeble and listless
When tested with a divinity or a true understanding
Of the human condition
I never did understand – the duality of art and reality
Living life and treating it as such but with a certain disconnect
To touch that cajoles at the artist with comfort and abandon
And between the spires and rolling roofs of the white city
That orange, English light cast only one, singular shadow
For you are not beside but within me

Loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Oh, oh
