One, two boys by the river
Down by the water tellin' riddles in the dark
With fireflies under the moonlight
Carvin' the insides of a tree with a knife
Ever hear the one about the boy's big sister
His best friend come along
He tried to kiss her

The only difference that I see
Is you are exactly the same as you used to be

One boy lives in a tower
With bow and arrow and the artificial heart
With his girl late in the summer
He loaded the cannon with a jealous appetite
They say that children now they come in all ages
And maybe sometimes old men die with little boy faces

The only difference that I see
Is you are exactly the same as you used to be
The only difference that I see
Is you are exactly the same as you used to be

You always said that you needed some
But you always had more, more than anyone

The only difference that I see
Is you are exactly the same as you used to be
The only difference that I see
Is you are exactly the same as you used to be
