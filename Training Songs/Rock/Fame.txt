Oh fame, babe, they've taken everything and just twisted it
Oh fame they say
You never could have resisted it
What's in a name?
And everybody's jaded by fame

Oh fame again
The press has gone and made another mess of it
Oh just because they got
So much invested in it
But they say you're to blame it's your own fault
'Cause you got mixed up in fame

Oh no don't believe none of that old Andy Warhol guff
It takes a lot more than 10 or 15 minutes
That's just not enough
To qualify you for

Fame, you went beyond the boundries of your sanity
And every day you defy
All the laws of gravity
You ain't got no shame
'Cause you're just addicted to fame

Well no don't you buy none of that old Andy Warhol stuff (rough)
It takes a lot more than 10 or 15 minutes
Man, (yeah) it's just not enough
To qualify you for

Fame, they're already settin' up, settin' up your own Watergate, Watergate
Oh fame, that stalker out there is just filled with hate
You'll never be the same
'Cause everyone's corrupted by fame

Oh fame, that took away, too away all my humanity
Oh fame got to fight
Every second of the day for my dignity
It's a spectator's game
And there ain't nothing fair about fame

Oh no, oh fame, say it again, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh fame say it again
Fame, say it again, fame, fame, fame
They say you're to blame 'cause you got mixed up in fame, fame, say it again, fame
