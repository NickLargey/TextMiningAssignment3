Since were feeling so anesthetized
In our comfort zone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home
We're running out of alibi's
On the second of may
Reminds me of the summertime
On this winters day

See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

Every step we took that synchronized
Every broken bone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home
You showered me with lullabies
Had you walking away
Reminds me that its killing time
On this fateful day

See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

From the time we intercepted
Feels a lot like suicide
Slow and sad, getting sadder
Arise a sitting mine
See you at the bitter end

I love to see you run around
And i can see you now
Running to me
Arms wide out
See you at the bitter end
Reach inside
Come on just gotta reach inside
Heard your cry
Six months time
Six months time
Prepare the end
See you at the bitter end
