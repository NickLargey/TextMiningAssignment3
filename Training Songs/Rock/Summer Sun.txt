Hot summer days
Remember the things you used to do
With nothing to lose
Driving into the sunset
You give yourself with no regrets
All the places have changed
But our hearts are still the same Jenny

Come into the warm summer sun
Makes you feel forever young
Together we?ll find what we want
On the streets of summer sun Summer sun

Remember the nights
You told me the secrets of your heart? your hungry heart
Now you?ve seen all that can happen
With lipstick and crimes of passion
And lying kisses of fate
That can fall along the way Jenny

Come into the warm summer sun
Girls are walking one by one
Together we?ll find what we want
On the streets of summer
Come into the warm summer sun
Jenny take my classic car
Together we?ll find what we want
On the streets of summer sun Summer sun
Summer sun

Just open your eyes
The kids on the street reach for their dreams
The silent screams
You see boys out there racing
A quick time for what they?re facing
And girls lost in love
Do you remember how it was ? Jenny?

Come into the warm summer sun
Jenny let your heart be owned
Together we?ll find what we want
On the streets of summer
Come into the warm summer sun
Bet the girls are walking on
Together we?ll find what we want
On the streets of the summer sun
Summer sun, Summer sun, Summer sun
