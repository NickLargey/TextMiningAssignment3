If you ever feel lonesome, 
And your down in San Antone,
Beg, steal, or borrow two nickels or a dime,
And call me on the phone.

I'll meet you at Alamo mission, 
And we can say our prayers,
The Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mother 
Will heal us as we kneel there.

In the moonlight, in the midnight, 
In the moonlight, midnight moonlight.

If you ever feel sorrow for the deeds you have done,
With no hope for tomorrow in the setting of the sun.
And the ocean is howling of things that might have been,
And that last good morning sunrise 
Will be the brightest you've ever seen.

In the moonlight, in the midnight, 
In the moonlight, midnight moonlight.

If you ever feel sorrow for the deeds you have done,
With no hope for tomorrow in the setting of the sun.
And the ocean is howling of things that might have been,
And that last good morning sunrise 
Will be the brightest you've ever seen.

In the moonlight, in the midnight, 
In the moonlight, midnight moonlight
