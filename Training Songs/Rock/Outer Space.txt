You said you wanted my love
To be your party your gain
But when I came from above
I looked around but you turned away
And now you are scratching and crawling
Your way up from the grave
You should have stayed in the dirt girl
It's like I told you

It's like a told you
I came from outer space
That's how I know your name
Just like a told you
I came from outer space
I wanna take you away

You took a drink of my sweet love
And then the poison took
You hooked me up to your sick machine
And then I blew you up
You were one in a billion
Before the button was pushed
You should have stayed in the dirt girl
It's like I told you

It's like a told you
I came from outer space
That's how I know your name
I'm sick and tired of the human race
I want to take you away
It's like I told you
I came from outer space
That's how I know your name
I'm sick and tired of the human race
I want you by my side

I want to take you to heaven
Take you away from this hell
I want to take you to heaven
Take you away from this hell

It's like a told you
I came from outer space
That's how I know your name
I'm sick and tired of the human race
I want to take you away
It's like I told you
I came from outer space
That's how I know your name
I've given up on the human race
I'm gonna blow 'em away.

So let me take you to heaven
Take you away from this hell
I want to take you to heaven
Take you away from this hell
I want to take you to heaven
Take you away from this hell

The Earth is rollin' a 7

This place is gonna be fine
