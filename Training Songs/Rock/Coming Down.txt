You Look So Good
When you're coming down
Like A Rocket To The Moon
When you're coming down
I want your spirit 
When you hit the ground

Well, It's six in the morning
And I'm feeling so good
Ain't got no clever words No More
So I won't be missunderstood

You Look So Good
When you're coming down

Sometime I got the blackest Spirit
Wants to hold you down
But the diamonds in your heart
Don't worry won't let you down

You Look So Good
When you're coming down
When you're coming down
When you're coming down
