Bring lovers down on 24
Break up the pieces find the floor
Breathe in the toxic air of love and give me
Back what I have owned

Getting you all believers showing me gates throught
Hell and fire no
What's the use in giving up
What's the point in gowing down

Give it up and search for more
Take me for a ride and bring me back safe baby
Give it up and search for more
Take me for a ride - sail beyond doubt

Ride my roller soul alone and 
Wear it out your poems broke
Go through the golden years again and you will
Be at ease my friend

Getting you all believers showing me gates throught
Hell and fire no
What's the use in giving up
What's the point in gowing down

Give it up and search for more
Take me for a ride and bring me back safe baby
Give it up and search for more
Take me for a ride - sail beyond doubt

Give it up and search for more
Take me for a ride and bring me back safe baby
Give it up and search for more
Take me for a ride - sail beyond doubt
