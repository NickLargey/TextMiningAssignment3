I've got holes
In my jeans
But what's worse
They're in my head too

I've got holes
In my jeans
But what's worse
They're in my head too

I'm so tired
With my holes
And I'm so sorry
I got you involved

I'm so tired
With my holes
And I'm so sorry
I got you involved

I'm so sorry
I got you involved

I take a walk
In the snow
Don't be alive
I'm not here

'Cause I take a walk
In the snow
