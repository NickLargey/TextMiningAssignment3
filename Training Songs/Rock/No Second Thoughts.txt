She threw down her golden band 
Crushed it with her feet into the sand 
Took her silent partner by the hand 
Yeah yeah ooh yeah yeah 

Somewhere near the edge of town 
She said she was torn and turned around 
"Can you help me cast this evil down?" 
Yeah yeah ooh yeah yeah 

We'll drive for the line 
Now there's nothing to be lost 
You and I will cross over 
With no second thoughts 

We'll drive for the line 
Now there's nothing to be lost 
You and I will cross over 
With no second thoughts 

Dreams fade hope dies hard 
She cups her eyes and looks out at the stars 
Says "I feel we've traveled very far" 
Yeah yeah ooh yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah ooh yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah ooh yeah yeah
