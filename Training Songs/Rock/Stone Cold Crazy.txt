Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning,
I was dreaming I was Al Capone.
There's a rumor going round, gotta clear outta town.
I'm smellin' like a dry fish bone.
Here come the law, gonna break down the door,
Gonna carry me away once more.
I never, never, never want it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, now.

Rainy afternoon, I gotta blow a typhoon,
And I'm playing on my slide trombone.
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, now.

Walking down the street shooting people that I meet,
With my rubber Tommy water gun.
Here comes the deputy, he's gonna come and getta me,
I gotta get me get up and run. They got their sirens loose,
I ran right outta juice. They're gonna put me in a cell,
If I can't go to heaven, will they let me go to hell?

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, now.
