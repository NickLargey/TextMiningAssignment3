You've been hurt and left for dead
Shot from the saddle
And your heart, it's been cut and bled
Run from the bottle

You've been shattered, battered, you've had it rough
But never, ever, never give up
Cause love will rise, love will rise

Love will rise again
You've got to fight like a true survivor
Love will rise again
Up from the ashes
Love will rise again and again

You better run and hide away
Lost in the shadows
You're alone, you wear the pain
Just like a medal

You've been shot down, brought down
You've had it rough
But never, ever, never give up
Cause love will rise, love will rise

Love will rise again
You've got to fight like a true survivor
Love will rise again
Up from the ashes
Love will rise again and again

Believe me I know where you've been
I used to be one of the wounded
There's something your heart can't defend
I'm back on my feet, I come back alive
Stand up and fight, never say die

Up from the ashes, love will rise

Love will rise again
You've got to fight like a True survivor
Love will rise again
Up from the ashes
Love will rise

Love will rise again
Love will rise again
Love will rise again

Yeah, yeah
