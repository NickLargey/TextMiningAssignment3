I've got the greatest friend he's a robot
He is my man and he's megawatt
He doesn't pretend, never lies, never cheats never steals from me
I trust nobody else with my secrets
I can depend on his sequence
Logical patterns I trust in his hard-drive relax I can unwind and 

I got a friend and he's a robot man
You know I got a friend he's a computer man

I know there is no human so techno
There is nobody so day glo
Constant companion who knows all the action can calculate fractions and
He is zero's and one's and I know this
He is not flesh and he can't kiss
But who needs humans when humans get angry and humans get ugly and

I got a friend and he's a robot man
You know I got a friend he's a computer man
I got a friend and he's a robot man
You know I got a friend he's a computer man

I got the greatest friend he's a robot
He's always thinking just non stop
Computing language while making a sandwich converting the average and
He is always such fun and he's number one
Taking the time and he can run
Right through the night and he never sleeps and he never lies down

I got a friend and he's a robot man
You know I got a friend he's a computer man
I got a friend and he's a robot man
You know I got a friend he's a computer man
