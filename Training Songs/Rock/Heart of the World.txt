I believe in strangers wherever they may be
All the souls who shape the world look pretty strange to me
I never met no president or shook a Gandhi's hand
But I believe we need a love that they may understand
Heart of the world, heart of the world is black
Without the love, love to bring it back
Heart of the world, heart of the world is blue
Without the love, love of me and you
I believe in heroes, whoever they may be
I never saved no universe or set Mandela free
Never sang with Lennon or played in Jimi's band
I believe we need a love that they would understand
Heart of the world, heart of the world is black
Without the love, love to bring it back
Heart of the world, heart of the world is blue
Without the love, love of me and you
I believe in strangers, wherever they may be
All the souls who shape the world look pretty strange to me
I believe in anyone, whoever they may be
Who feels the love that I feel and who sees the need I see
Heart of the world, heart of the world is black
Without the love, love to bring it back
Heart of the world, heart of the world is blue
Without the love, love of me and you
Heart of the world, heart of the world is black
I tell you, heart of the world, heart of the world is blue
Love of me and you
Heart of the world, heart of the world is black
Without the love, love to bring it back
Heart of the world, heart of the world is blue
Without the love, love of me and you
Heart of the world, heart of the world is black
Without the love, love to bring it back
Heart of the world, heart of the world is blue
Without the love, love of me and you
Heart of the world, heart of the world is black
Without the love, love to bring it back
Heart of the world, heart of the world is blue
Without the love, love of me and you
