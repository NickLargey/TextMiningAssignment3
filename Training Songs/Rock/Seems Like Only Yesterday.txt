I'll never forget that dreadful day
When I decided to run away
Little Sister was playin
With a kitten on the floor
Mama was rockin out on the front porch
And Daddy had gone to the grocery store
And Brother had left the day before

Packed my clothes when no one was lookin
Went out the back door and into the bushes
And down the holler and over the creek
Then up the hill and across the field
I jumped the fence and I thumbed a ride
Much too young to realize
That I'd regret all it by and by

And I wish I had the love that was offered to me
When I was just too young and blind to see
There was a whole lot of love in that old house
But I had to leave to find it out
And it seems like it was only yesterday

If I'da known then what I know now
I'da stayed right on my daddy's old farm
Just a young upstart
I thought I was smart
Tried to be a man when I was only a child
But many a time it comes to my mind
To pack my clothes and leave this town
And jump that fence and cross that field
And down the hill and over the creek
An up the holler and through them bushes
And in the back door when no one is lookin'
And accept the love that was offered to me

And I wish I had the love that was offered to me
When I was just too young and blind to see
There was a whole lot of love in that old house
But I had to leave to find it out
And it seems like it was only yesterday

And I wish I had the love I threw away
