If it were up to me you'd never be down
I got your telephone number from the lost and found
If you take my hand can you blow my mind
I don't really want to have to use revenge this time
But are you here to stay
Don't hesitate
Baby I'm leaving when the fun runs out
Don't you run out on me now

Ya know just give it a go, give it a go, give it a go
And when the going gets tough and the times get hard
These days will tear us apart, tear us apart, tear us apart
Yeah ya know they'll tear us apart
Don't let them tear you apart

And are you here to stay?
Don't hesitate
Baby I'm leaving when the fun runs out
Don't you run out on me now

Ya know just give it a go, give it a go, give it a go
And when the going gets tough and the times get hard
These days will tear us apart, tear us apart, tear us apart
Yeah ya know they'll tear us apart
Baby I'm leaving this time
