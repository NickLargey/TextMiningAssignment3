You don't have to take this crap
You don't have to sit back and relax
You can actually try changing it
I know we've always been taught to rely

Upon those in authority 
But you never know until you try
How things just might be 
If we came together so strongly

Are you gonna try to make this work
Or spend your days down in the dirt
You see things can change 
Yes and walls can come tumbling down

Governments crack and systems fall
'Cause unity is powerful
Lights go out, walls come tumbling down 
Yes they do, yes they do, yes they do, yes they do, hey)

The competition is a color TV
We're on still pause with the video machine
That keep you slave to the H.P.

Until the unity is threatened by
Those who have and who have not 
Those who are with and those who are without
And dangle jobs like a donkey's carrot 
Until you don't know where you are

Are you gonna get to realize
The class war's real and not mythologized
And like Jericho, you see walls can come tumbling down

Governments crack and systems fall
'Cause unity is powerful
Lights go out, walls come tumbling 
(Down) You'll be to week to fight it
(Down) oh unless we're united
(Down) oh will you deny it?
Ooh

Are you gonna be threatened by
The public enemies No. 10 
Those who play the power game
They take the profits, you take the blame 
When they tell you there's no rise in pay

Are you gonna try and make this work
Or spend your days down in the dirt 
You see things can change 
Walls can come tumbling down

Governments crack and systems fall
'Cause unity is powerful
Lights go out, walls come tumbling down
Governments crack and systems fall
'Cause unity is powerful
Lights go out, walls come tumbling down
Governments crack and systems fall
'Cause unity is powerful
Lights go out, walls come tumbling down
Governments crack and systems fall
'Cause unity is powerful
Lights go out, walls come tumbling down
