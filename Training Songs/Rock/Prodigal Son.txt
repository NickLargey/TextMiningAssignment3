You may be a star in your own mind but you're greatly deluded in my mine I heard reports that you drink and you take drugs most of the time and that your life is in danger 
And that you were involved in a crime Is it over is it over will you come home now is it over is it over don't you let me down you're the architect of your own excess join the queue 
At the start of the line In a wilderness with an empty sky the clouds are gone and the dessert is dry the prodigal son is returning he shouldn't be walking the streets they tell me that children are starving He's got everything that he needs is it over is it over will you come home now is it over is it over is it over is it over now Won't you come home now won't you come home now won't you come home now won't you come won't you come home won't you come home now Won't you come home now won't you come home now won't you come won't you come home
