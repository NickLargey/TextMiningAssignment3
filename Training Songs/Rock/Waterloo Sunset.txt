Dirty old river must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy make me feel dizzy
Taxi lights shine so bright
But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze at Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

[Chorus]
Every day I look at the world from my window
Jelly jelly's in evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Terry meets Julie Waterloo station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy I don't want to wonder
I'll stay at home at night
But I don't
Feel afraid
As long as I gaze at Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

[Chorus]

Millions of people
Swarming like flies round
Waterloo underground
Terry and Julie
Cross over the river
Where everything's safe and sound
And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze up Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise

[Repeat: x12]
Waterloo sunset's fine
