Sitting in your bedroom, ha!
In your private cell, hell!
Trying not to worry
You don't look too well
Oh it goes in one ear and out the other yak!
Writing fingernails and pulling out your hair
It was just this morning, bing! a-ing!
Hurting in your head
Took a sleeping pill
Spend the day in bed, ay
Distortion!
So out of proportion
Twisted and contortion
Talking about Distortion...
Sitting on your doorstep, yep
Watch the welcome mat
Great Imagination
Make you break down and cry
Everything you do
Seem to turn out wrong
No matter how hard you try
The agony so strong
Oh it goes in one ear and out the other yak!
Writing fingernails and pulling out your hair
Distortion!
So out of proportion
Twisted and contortion
Talking about Distortion...
Oh sometimes you don't act, and then you do
This times I get it mirrors is bliss
Eyes right!
Burn white!
In sight!
Eyh-light
Bu-ah!
Distortion!
Whoa-ah!
Distortion!
Di-di-di-di-distortion
So out of proportion
Twisted and contortion
Talking about Distortion...
Distortion!
So out of proportion
Twisted and contortion
Talking about Distortion...
