I live in the palm of your hand, down the stream, see
King of flowers off the floor and drinking tea

But you don’t love me, that’s news to me

I met your daughter the other day, that was weird
She had rhinoceros shaped earrings in her ears
But, hey man have a soda, it’s on the house
Remember what I told you, about the rooms inside this house

But you don’t love me, that’s news to me
That’s news to me, that’s news to
I begin and I begin, and I

If you believe in yourself you can free your soul
My heart is breaking in two, I don’t know what to do

But you don’t love me, that’s news to me
That’s news to me, that’s news to
I begin and I begin, and I

If you believe in yourself you can free your soul
My heart is breaking in two, I don’t know what to do
You were right with the words, you make it too loose
I’m happy if she’s happy
