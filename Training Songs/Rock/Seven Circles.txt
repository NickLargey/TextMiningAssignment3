Here, here we are
Shelterless souls
Lit by the stars
And here, here we stand
Divided by lines
We've drawn in the sand

As the world keeps turning
And we keep on searching
For seven circles twisting

Here, here and now
Something must be
Sentient somehow

Because the world keeps turning
And I keep on searching
For seven circles twisting
Around these moments of our lives
Dancing on the edge of night
Everything we've lost is coming back again
All I See
All I See
Will Always be

See what we are is limitless light
Reflecting the stars

Because the world keeps turning
And I keep on searching
For seven circles twisting
Around these moments of our lives
Dancing on the edge of night
Everything we've lost is coming back again
All I See
All I See
Will Always be
And I don't know why

She said come back
The world is waiting for you
Don't cry
I will still be here
Come back
Because the world is waiting for you
Don't you cry now
Because I will be there to hold you
