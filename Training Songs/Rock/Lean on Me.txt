Lean on me, Lean on me
You're the wind and I'm the sea
Oh, lean on me, lean on me               
Love's the boat out on the ocean
You're the wind that fills the sail

Oh, lean on me, trust in me
You're the wind that moves the branches
Lean on me, lean on me
You're the earth and love's the tree
Oh, lean on me
 
Love's an island, love's an ocean
Lean on me
Love's an island of emotion
Lean on me

Oh lean on me, lean on me
I will be there when you need me
Lean on me, lean on me
Love's the boat and you're the wind that fills the sail
