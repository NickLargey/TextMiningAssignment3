We huffed the sky into our mouths
We saw the ocean and drank it down
Because we were giants or maybe birds
We slept with lions, tucked into their fur

The world may seem cruel
The worldly may hate us
In time we will show the world why the world made us

Slip into epiphany
Oversee oversight
A good stumble's a symphony
A good drift takes drive

Quartz doesn't burn
Rust doesn't hum
Maybe we should blame it on the structures of the sun

Every machine
We've made must bow
To what the wolf and cub have found
