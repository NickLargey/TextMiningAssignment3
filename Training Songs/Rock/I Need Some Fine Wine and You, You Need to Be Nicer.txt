Sit
Good dog
Stay 
Bad dog
Woo
Down
Roll over

Well here's a good man and pretty young girl
Tryin' to play together somehow
I'm wasting my life
You're changing the world
I get drunk and watch your head grow

It's the good times that we share
And the bad times that we'll have
It's the good times and the bad times that we had

Well it's been a long slow collision
I'm a pit bull you're a dog
Baby you're found in clear conditions
But you're handsome in the fog

So I need some fine wine and you, you need to be nicer
For the good times and the bad times that we'll have

Sometimes we talk over dinner like old friends
Til I go and kill the bottle
I go off over any old thing
Break your heart and raise a glass or ten

To the good times that we share
And the bad times that we'll have
To the good times and the bad times that we've had

Well it's been a long slow collision
I'm a pit bull you're a dog
Baby you're found in clear condition
But you're handsome in the fog

So I need some fine wine and you, you need to be nicer
For the good times and the bad times we know will come 
yeah
I need some fine wine and you, you need to be nicer
You need to be nicer
You and me
For the good times and the bad times that we had

Sit
Good times
Bad times
Sweet wine
Bad wine
Good cop
Bad cop
Lap dog
Bad dog
