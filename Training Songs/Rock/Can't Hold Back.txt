There you go showin' off again
Don't you know the hold you got on me
You know I'm not complainin'
I'm just so tired of waitin'

I can't hold back
Though I'm tryin'
I can't hold back
I'm almost dyin'
I can't hold back
And it's all because of you

Don't you know what you put me 	through
Every night I'm sleepin' without you
You know I'm not complainin'
I'm just anticipatin'

I can't hold back
You know I'm tryin'
I can't hold back
I'm almost dyin'
I can't hold back
And it's all because of you

Can't hold back

You know I'm not complainin'
I'm just so tired of waitin'

I can't hold back
You know I'm tryin'
I can't hold back
I'm almost dyin'
I can't hold back
And it's all because of you

I can't hold back
Can't hold back
Can't hold back
Can't hold back
Can't hold back

I can't hold back
