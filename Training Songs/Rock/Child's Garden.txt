Not so long ago, when I was just a child
I never realized the way I felt inside
And how much you meant to me
How much you meant to me
And I don't think I've ever told you so
And I thought you'd like to know
That now I see and I can understand
I understand

I was unkind, I must have been blind to your sorrow
And night after night, trying to live with your sorrow
And I was a bastard and I was wrong
And I was lost in things I've done
And I was stealing just for fun
And it was breaking your heart

So long ago, when I was just a child
I never understood, never realized
How much you meant to me
How much you meant to me
And I don't think I've ever told you so
And I thought you'd like to know
That now I see and I can understand
I understand

I was unkind, I must've been blind to your sorrow
Night after night, tryin' to live with your sorrow
I was unsure, and lookin' for more, I was anxious
To be on my own, livin' at home I was restless
And I was a bastard and I was wrong
And I was lost in the things I'd done
And I was stealin' for fun
And it was breakin' your heart
It was breakin' your heart
