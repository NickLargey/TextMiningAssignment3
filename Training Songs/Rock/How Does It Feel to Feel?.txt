How does it feel when the day is over?
How does it feel when the dark comes down?
How does it feel when your room is black as sin?
How does it feel when you're scared by the dark?
How does it feel to feel?
How does it feel to feel?
How does it feel when a shadow moves you?
How does it feel rustled by your bed?
How does it feel when it finally holds you?
How does it feel when you're thinking you're dead?
How does it feel to feel?
How does it feel to feel?

How does it feel when you wake in the morning?
How does it feel feeling sun in the shade?
How does it feel when you slide down a sunbeam?
How does it feel bursting clouds on your way?
How does it feel now that the night is over?
How does it feel never to sleep again?

How does it feel to feel?
