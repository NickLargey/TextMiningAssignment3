The clown came down to meet me
With a smile upon his face,
He fired the starting pistol and
Began the human race
There were faces all around me
They were running everywhere
But everywhere is nowhere
And nowhere isn't there.

[Chorus]
It's a game a game, a game that we're playing
But I don't mind but I don't make the rules
It's a game, a game, a game that we're playing
Just a game for lovers and fools

Well there's snakes upon your ladder
And there's dice upon your skirt
There's lipstick on my collar
And there's sweat upon my shirt
The neighbors will start talking but
You know that I don't care
For the neighbors, they are nowhere
And nowhere isn't there.

[Chorus]
