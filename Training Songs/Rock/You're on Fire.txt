You're old enough to know it's not your fault
You're strong enough to face your darkest conflict
Now you've woken from your nightmare and now you're fighting back
Nothing will survive when you attack

This road to healing hurts more than anything

Now that you're on fire, you're voice is like the wind
Now that you're on fire, let life begin again
Now that you're on fire, a new day has begun
Now that you're on fire, you are like the sun

You've spent some time along this lonesome road
With no one waiting for you back at home
Just breaking hearts and living free and easy
The times have changed and now you're not alone

This road to healing hurts more than anything

Now that you're on fire, you're voice is like the wind
Now that you're on fire, let life begin again
Now that you're on fire, a new day has begun
Now that you're on fire, you are like the sun

More than anything I'd like to see
Better, brighter days for you, for you and me

Now that you're on fire, you're voice is like the wind
Now that you're on fire, let life begin again
Now that you're on fire, a new day has begun
Now that you're on fire, you are like the sun
Now that you're on fire, now that you're on fire
