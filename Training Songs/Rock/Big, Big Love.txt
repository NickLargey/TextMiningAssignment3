Can't you tell my love's a growing?
Can't you feel it, ain't it showing?
Well, you must be knowing
I got a big, big love

It's not the kind to be concealing
A just a kind to be revealing
It's not a little bitty feeling
I got a big, big love

I think it's time we done some walking
I think it's time we done some talking
Well, there's a great big moon above
And we've got a big, big love

This is not infatuation
Well, it's true love sensation
It's not my imagination
I got a big, big love for you
