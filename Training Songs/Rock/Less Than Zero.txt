You got a way
Of saying anything
You get away with saying to me
When you want to
And I let you
And you can 
Play the game
Like I never could
And even I am 
Not such a goody good
Like a weakness for chocolate 
I cave
In you and you think that I'm numb to it all
But I'm not so innocent baby
I don't want to play this game no more
If this isn't love I'm fighting for
And if it was 
Then why would you let me feel so less than zero
So it seems
Its all inside my head
It disappears when we get into bed
Turn the lights out
Close my eyes now
And I think silly me
To be so nonchalant
To make believe this is what I really want
Like a stranger with candy
You used it to handle me
Shame on you now
Your not so innocent any more baby
I don't want to play this game no more
If this isn't love I'm fighting for
And if it was 
Then why would you let me feel so less than zero
I don't want to play this game no more
If this is love then what is war?
And I've never felt so sure
I don't want to play this game no more
If this isn't love I'm fighting for
And if it was 
Then why would you let me feel so less than zero
Less than zero
