Once upon a time when I was in high school
I was in love with a lady she treated me so cool
I was driving an Chevy '72
It had four on the floor, 120 it would do
And I remember Marvin Gaye singing
Let's get it on

There was a war baby somewhere across the sea
I didn't want to go to fight girl 'cause you were all loving me
But I remember Martin Luther King
Lord he was the man baby that gave us all a dream
And I remember Marvin Gaye singing
Let's get it on
Lord he made me so strong
I remember Marvin Gaye singing
Let's get it on

We used to have sweet music in the park
Way up in Monterrey they sang througout the dark
And you used to wear girl that gypsy dress
When you stroll on by all the boys they want a chance
And I remember Marvin Gaye singing
Let's get it on
He made my love so strong
I remember Otis Redding
Sitting on the dock of the bay
Oh lord he went away
I remember Sam Cooke singing
Bring it on home to me
From your love I can be free
I remember Elvis Presley and the blues suede shoes
Lord they give me the blues
I remember Marvin Gaye singing
Let's get it on
