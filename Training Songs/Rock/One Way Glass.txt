Give me a window with one way glass,
Just look out on the world and watch people pass.
Give me a window to shield me,
Rock can't be seen, I don't wanna be free.

Give me a window to stop the sound,
And to keep out of the noise of the merry-go-round.
Give me a window with one way glass,
Save me from questions I might have to ask.
