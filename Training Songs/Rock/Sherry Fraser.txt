Oh I saw stars falling all 
Around her head 
Red  gold  and blue 
Sherry Fraser where are you 
'Cause I saw stars falling 
All around your head 
When we were young 
Sherry Fraser where have you gone 
We're all wondering 
When will you come back 
And play some day. 
Sherry yeah 
The mad hatter he waits for Alice 
To come to tea again 
He waits forever for his old lover 
And always wonderin' 
Will I see stars falling all around your head 
When you return 
Sherry Fraser what have you learned 
And we're all wondering 
When will you come back 
And play some day 
And please do come back 
And play some day 
Please do come back 
And play some day 
Sherry yeah
