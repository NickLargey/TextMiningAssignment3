I'm almost ready 
To let you know just how bad I feel 
I'm almost ready 
To let you loose and find another heart to steal 

My friends tell me that they see you 
Runnin around all over town 
Please don't make me out to be your fool 
Please don't make me out a clown 

I don't know who you think you're foolin 
I hope you don't think that it's me 
It's plain to see that you don't love me anymore
I'll say goodbye and you'll be free

I'm almost ready 
To let you know just how bad I feel 
I'm almost ready 
To let you loose and find another heart to steal 

Oh to let you loose and find another heart to steal 
Oh to let you loose and find another heart to steal
