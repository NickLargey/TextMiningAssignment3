This won't break your heart
But I just think it could
Cause I haven't tried as hard as I should
To separate you from everything I do
But I would never want to come between us two

[Chorus]
I'll keep your memory vague
So you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said
Sometimes so it reminds me

Now I'm thinking back
To what I said before
I hope your heart won't have to hurt anymore
Cause it's really not that sad from here
Because the moments I can feel you near
They keep you close to me my dear
And if they ever become too clear...

[Chorus: x2]

Now you've gone away
Don't worry it's OK
That you're gone away
Further than yesterday
But you'll never leave these scenes
My mind replays

[Chorus: x4]
