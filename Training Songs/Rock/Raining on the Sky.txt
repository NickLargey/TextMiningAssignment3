When the night falls on metropolis
Neon dissonance, warm lipstick
When the moon shines on the playground
I will find you in the tinsel town

Moving shadows in the shape of what you want to see
Painted fingers and the aromatic Jean Nate
And when they're spinning you can see them
do the strangest things
Building bridges from the slivers of another's dream

Whatever you want
I'll give it to you, I will
What ever the cost
I'll get it for you, I will

Let's go raining on the sky
Throw a kiss and wave goodbye
Let's go raining on the sky
And one kiss seals the tie

Riding home she falls asleep inside a Checkered Cab
In a dream she comes across Alice in Wonderland
The Maddest Hatter surely had her in the recent past
Now she hears him saying "Honey, you are home at last"

He'll be waiting there and you can start again
Rhinestone darling, know you're taken
You'll have a lot of laughs and Cadillacs and bubble baths
Just say the word and he'll forget about your past

What ever you want
I'll do it to you, I will
What ever the thought
I'll do it for you, I will

Let's go raining on the sky
Throw a kiss and wave goodbye
Let's go raining on the sky
And one kiss seals the tie

When your heart aches with horizon
Caked eyelash, torn nylon
When the light breaks through and frightens you
You'll hear the cry to come raining on the sky

Let's go raining on the sky
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
Let's go raining on the sky
And one kiss seals the tie
Let's go raining on the sky
Let's go raining on the sky
