had a woman, gave her all of my lovin' 
Gave her all that I had 
Kinda' woman she could make you believe her 
Nothing's gonna go bad 

Took awhile, and all the hurtin' 
Since she left and went away 
Behind her smile though I can't be certain 
But I thought I heard her say 

My heart's a hunter 
And love is a loser's game 
My heart's a hunter 
And love is a loser's game 

Little baby I won't give ya no heartaches 
I won't give ya no pain 
Sweet little darlin' can't ya see what is comin' 
Cause ya know me by name 

Used to be when I was a child 
I thought lovin' should be free 
And it's so hard to be reconciled 
That ain't the way it oughta be 

It's only lovin' when she's gone and she's left ya 
It goes to show it's always something 
That I felt when I met ya 
It comes and it goes 

I ride alone tonight 
So bittersweet 
I took a chance 
I tried to love her 
Someone whispered her name 
Heartbreaker
