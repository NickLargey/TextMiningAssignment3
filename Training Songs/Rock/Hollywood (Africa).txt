All right, take me back hold my hand
All the way back to the brotherland
Take me back I want to go back

Take me back and my funky ass band
All the way back to the brotherland take me back (let's go)

I want to go as fast as I can
Slidin' on back to the brotherland
Now children, take me on back
Take me on back, take me on back
Take me on back (east L.A.)

All the way back to the brotherland
Take me back (take me back)
I want to go back

Take me on back, take me on back
Take me on back, take me on back
Take me on back, take me on back
Where the women is the women
And the man is the man
