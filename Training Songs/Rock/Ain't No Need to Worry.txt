Ain't no need in worrying
what the night is gonna bring,
it'll be all over in the morning.

There's a fear of night fall,
when darkeness comes and covers all the day.
Sometimes we feel pain, 
but there are things that we can change, just pray.

Ain't no need to worry,
what the night is gonna bring,
it'll be all over in the morning.

Troubles come, but they do past,
heartaches, hurts, oh but, they don't last always.
Sometimes we feel pain, 
but there are things that we can change, just pray.

Ain't no need to worry,
what the night is gonna bring,
it'll be all over in the morning.

In the morning, the morning,
it'll be all over in the morning.

It'll be all over in the morning.

Makes no different how dark the night,
if you trust in God, it'll be alright;
(it'll be all over in the morning).

It makes no difference how long the day,
trust in God, He'll make a way;
(it'll be all over in the morning).

Weeping will last, but only for awhile,
but when the sun shines, you'll wear a smile;
(it'll be all over in the morning).

And I say, thank you Jesus,
in the presence of all those who hear my voice;
(it'll be all over in the morning).

In the morning, the morning,
it'll be all over in the morning.

It'll be all over in the morning.
