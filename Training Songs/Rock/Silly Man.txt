So you feel that I'll leave you
That I'll change my mind and walk away
But I found you
So I'll bake you
A chocolate cake
Do you know that I love you
By the way I look into your mind
I surrender my heart
With a teary eye
Take your hands
And place them all around my ears

Take my heart
And hook it up to your face
We're as one
You and me
A silly man

So my dear
Please forgive me
For the situation that I'm in
'Cause I promise
That it's over
It's in the wind
Reach for me
And I'll catch you
You can wings as long as I'm with you
Don't fly away
Not away
At least not alone
And we fly high
We fly higher than the highest kite
Over mountains
Where non-belivers in disguise hide
We're so silly
(Hahahaha)
Making faces just to make us smile
Yeah, ain't no doubt about it baby
Like no others
You and me
A silly man
Take my heart and use it
I want to give you
I want to love you
I'll be more than consistent
I'll make it better
If you will never
Never leave me
Oh, so we're friends
And we made a special commitment
So we're lovers
And we vow to never let it end
So in love with each other
So we make love like instruments
Under covers
We listen to
A silly man
