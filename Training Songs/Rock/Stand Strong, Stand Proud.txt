They'll tell you now you're old enough
You should settle down
They'll take away your dignity
So you'll always face the ground
Stand strong stand proud Chant your feelings loud
Stand strong stand proud Don't accept the crowd
Stand strong stand proud We'll rise and they shall fall
Stand strong stand proud One day we'll show them all

They'll offer an alternative
Promises that never end
But is it what you really want?
Their smiles are all pretense

They think they'll get you on the cheap
But who are they to tell?
It's time for you to up your price
You've only got yourself

They'll say that all you lived for
Has deserted you and died
Within you it will always live
Your source of strength and pride
