How many times will the clock go around
How many times can my hands hit the ground
How many coffins before there's a crown
How far will I fall 'til the alarm sounds
How come you love me when I am ugly
Guess I can only hope

Give me a second go
Don't let me go alone
You saw me at the worst
You caught me falling first
All I wanted to know
Give me a second go

No matter the weather there's never a break
Conquer a ladder then slip on a snake
Cried 'til my river turned into a lake
And I'm wondering now before it's too late
How can you save me when I am angry
Reasons I'll never know

Give me a second go
Don't let me go alone
You saw me at the worst
You caught me falling first
All I wanted to know
Give me a second go

One to five I'm half alive, six to nine I'm out of line
Ten to twelve I'm not myself,
By the millionth time, I cry.

Give me a second go
Don't let me go alone
You saw me at the worst
You caught me falling first
All I wanted to know
Give me a second go

Don't let me go alone
You saw me at the worst
You caught me falling first
All I wanted to know
Give me a second go
Give me a second go
Give me a second go
Again
Give me a second go
Don't let me go alone
