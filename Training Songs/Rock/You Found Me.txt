I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, "where you been?"
He said, "ask anything"

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
When all my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang and all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me
You found me lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

In the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am, who I'm not, who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me
You found me lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Early morning
The city breaks
I've been callin'
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
Ya never send me no letters
You got some kinda nerve
Taking all my world

Lost and insecure
You found me
You found me lyin' on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me
You found me lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
Why'd you have to wait?
To find me, to find me
