The days are gone when the girls 
Used to kiss his nose 
To wake him up in the morning 
He looks at his wife once she was young 
But now she's older 
Than himself and all that happend without warning 

Trapped today, trapped tomorrow 
Trapped in love, and trapped in sorrow 
Sorry my train, won't stop at your station 
Trapped today, trapped tomorrow 
Trapped in love, and trapped in sorrow 
Sorry my train, won't stop at your station 
And no explanations 

The days are gone when the boys 
Used to bring her flowers every night 
Just to please her 
There was this man, now she's his wife. 
They've got two kids 
He works from 9 to 5 
He put her in a freezer 

Trapped today, trapped tomorrow 
Trapped in love, and trapped in sorrow 
Sorry my train, won't stop at your station 
Trapped today, trapped tomorrow 
Trapped in love, and trapped in sorrow 
Sorry my train, won't stop at your station 
And no explanations
