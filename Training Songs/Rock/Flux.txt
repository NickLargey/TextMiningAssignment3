Stamped out the ember
That burned your skin
It wasn't easy-complication
You caught the glow
Of a flame past burning
Try to put it out-with desperation
Sit down with a flickering bit
Of what you thought would never burn
You never thought you'd ever catch fire
I never thought you'd ever learn.
