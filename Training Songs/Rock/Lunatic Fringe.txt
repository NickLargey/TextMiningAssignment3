See you on the other side

Lunatic Fringe
I know you're out there
You're in hiding
And you hold your meetings
I can hear you comin'
I know what your after
We're wise to you this time
(Wise to you this time)
We won't let you kill the laughter

Uh huh
Uh huh
Uh huh

Lunatic fringe
In the twilight's last gleaming
This is open season
But you won't get too far
Cause you gotta blame someone
For your own confusion
We're on guard this time
(On guard this time)
Against your final solution
Oh no

Uh huh
Uh huh
Uh huh

We can hear you comin'
(We can hear you comin')
No, you're not gonna win this time
(Not gonna win)
We can hear the footsteps
(We can hear the footsteps)
Way out along the walkway
(Out along the walkway)

Lunatic fringe
We all know you're out there
Can you feel the resistance
Can you feel the thunder
