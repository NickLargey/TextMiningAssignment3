Come take this badge off of me
I can't wear it any more
It's getting too dark to see
And I feel like I must be knocking on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door

Come take these guns off of me
You know I can't shoot them any more
It's getting too dark, you know it's much too dark to really see
And I feel like I must be knocking on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
