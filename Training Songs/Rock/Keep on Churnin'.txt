Layin' round makin' butter from the cream
I know that we seen each other in a dream
My heart starts yearnin' when I'm all alone
So keep on churnin' till the cows come home
 
Keep on churnin' and don't go slow
Keep on churnin' everybody knows
You got to keep on churnin'
Or it just don't mean a thing
 
Fryin' pan's goin' crazy on the stove
A blue sky's growin' hazy in the cold
If I'd quit now it'd surely be a sin
I got to keep on churnin' till the end begins
 
Keep on churnin' it ain't no lie
Keep on churnin' till the day we die
We got to keep on churnin'
Or it just don't mean a thing
 
Love is like honey from a bee
Found in the bottom of an old oak tree
It may sound funny but it's a shame
If you lose your honey, then you lose the game
 
Keep on churnin' it ain't no lie
Keep on churnin' till the day we die
We got to keep on churnin'
Or it just don't mean a thing
 
Layin' round makin' butter from the cream
I know that we seen each other in a dream
My heart starts yearnin' when I'm all alone
So keep on churnin' till the cows come home
 
Keep on churnin'
Keep on churnin'....
Go to keep on churnin'
Keep on churnin'
Keep on churnin'
Got to keep on churnin'
Got to keep on churnin
