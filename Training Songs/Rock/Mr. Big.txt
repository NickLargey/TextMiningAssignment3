I work hard everyday come rain or shine
Don't need nobody to tell me about a girl of mine
She's got so much love, saved it all for me
I would not be lying, it's the way it's got to be

So Mr. Big
Better watch out
And don't you hang around me now
That all for you, I would dig
A great big hole in the ground

I don't care who you are, so don't explain
Better get on out of here, and don't you come back again
I don't want a thing from ya', don't wanna give you nothing too
So get on out of here before I lose my cool

Mr. Big
Better watch out
And don't you hang around me now
That all for you, I would dig
A great big hole in the ground
