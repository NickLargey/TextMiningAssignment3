Stuck here out of gas
Out here on the Gaza Strip
From driving in too fast

Let's ride the Tire down river Euphrates
Let's ride the Tire
Let's ride the Tire down river Euphrates

Let's ride the Tire down river Euphrates

Dead sea make it float
One sip from the salty wine
Dead sea make you choke

Let's ride the Tire down river Euphrates
Let's ride the Tire
Let's ride the Tire down river Euphrates
