Things are still the same
Well I know, I know
Lost my seat again
Well I'll go, I'll go 

Pushin in the pin
Well I know, I know
We're gonna go back in
We're gonna go, go, go! 

I like to sleep with him
Pushin in the pin
I like to sleep with him
Well I know, I know
We're gonna go back in
We're gonna go, go, go!
We're gonna go back in
We're gonna go, go, go!
