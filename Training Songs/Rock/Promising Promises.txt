I wake up cold and sweaty
Is it morning already?
I hate the sun for setting on yesterday
When I wrote my feelings
On the walls and ceilings
Like drugs I'm dealing and you just walked away

The trees all sway and swing
The wind and I are both singing

I was giving you everything I had to give
Wasn't it enough?
All those promising promises were on your lips
But you wouldn't give them up

So let me just say for the record
That you can spare me the lecture
'Cause ever since I met you I've been lonely
Your smile, it don't hide you
I see the teeth that you lie through
Do I need to remind you that I'm only

Hanging by a string
I close my eyes and spin singing

I was giving you everything I had to give
Wasn't it enough?
All those promising promises were on your lips
But you wouldn't give them up

And I was giving you everything I had to give
Wasn't it enough?
And all those promising promises were on your lips
But you wouldn't give them up

And I was giving you everything I had to give
Wasn't it enough?
All those promising promises were on your lips
But you wouldn't give them up
