Today I write in my book
Dear God I need a change
I can't keep hiding
Wishing the mirror was lying

Show me where do I look
I know there must be a plan
Though I can't see one
I go through the motions anyway

Here I go again
Walking down a road I've never known

[Chorus:]
I want to go where lovers meet
I want to breathe the air they breathe
I want to touch the dreams they dream
When I find someone to love
I want to go where lovers
Where lovers meet

I know my faith is blind
I'll take my chances
I'm tired of just surviving
I 'm not wasting any time

Just like tears in the rain
No one can see
Inside my heart is crying
Telling me I can't lie any more

Here I go again
Walking down a road I've never known

I want to go where lovers meet
I want to breathe the air they breathe
I want to touch the dreams they dream
When I find someone to love
I want to go where lovers meet
Feel the wind beneath my feet
Oh, I want to feel that complete
When I find someone

I spent half my life
Wasting my time
I don't want to hear my heart beating alone
Oh

[Chorus]

I want to go
I want to go where lovers meet
