Lay there and hate me
Lay there and burn
One side to the other
You toss and turn
Never trust a woman, never trust a woman
Who loves the blues

Mistake number one, I made it three times a day
We'd best talk over how there is nothing left to say
I feel like an underpaid concubine
Who has overstayed her welcome

You gave me an eight-page letter front and back
Written in your favorite colors, blood and black
Choose your words as careful as you'd choose your own gravestone
You lay there and hate me, better than being alone
Had to fight your way in, you got to fight your way out
Ain't no fool like the fool you love
So let me hear you shout

Shake down, break down
Just can't sit still
You cut off your hair and sold it
For your pretty little pill
I've learned some things about myself I wish I didn't know

You gave me an eight-page letter from front and back
Written in your favorite colors, blood and black
You choose your words as careful as you'd choose your own gravestone
You lay there and hate me, better than being alone
Had to fight your way in, you got to fight your way out
Ain't no fool like the one you love
So let me hear you, hear you shout

Lay there and hate me
Cold as a stone
I just hope it's better than sitting alone
Never trust a woman who loves the blues

Gave me an eight-page letter front and back
Written in your favorite colors, blood and black
Choose your words as careful as you'd choose your own gravestone
Lay there and hate me, better than being alone
Had to fight your way in, now you got to fight your way out
Ain't no fool like the fool you love
So let me hear you, let me hear you shout
