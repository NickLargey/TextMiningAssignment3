Let's go down now
Into the darkness
Of your thoughts
Hurry up now
We're waiting for
Us to fall
I fall to pieces now (I fall to pieces now)
A broken mirror (I fall to pieces)
In your life

The silence in black and white
Falling forward as she walks toward the light

I know!
I'm outside of your window with my radio

I sleep with one eye open so I can
See you breathing (I sleep with one eye open)
I follow your chest bone
Until I, (so I can see you breathing)
I can see you, I can hear you breathe in exhale

The silence in black and white

I know!
I'm outside of your window with my radio
I know!
I'm outside of your window with my radio

Know! Know!

I'm outside of your window
With my radio (wishing you could be there)
I'm outside of your window
With my radio (wishing you could be there)
I'm outside of your window
With my radio (wishing you could be there)

I'm outside of your window with my radio
You are the only station
You play the song I know
You are the song I know
