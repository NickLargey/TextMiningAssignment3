I'd prefer to think of him as a man of many means
Of powers extreme, exposed to the extreme
Nature's so to demand, he may never change his mind
The only possible excuse for pretending to be blind

Petition for a life unknown
To all my friends, the censor's shown, no, oh, oh

Petition for a life unknown
To all my friends, the censor's shown, no, oh, oh

I can't 'member why are these more to sound mysterious
His anger extreme, exposed to the extreme
Has he a hidden past?
And memories that don't go back
And have to remember what I'm supposed to like

Petition for a life unknown
To all my friends, the censor's shown, no, oh, oh

Petition for a life unknown
To all my friends, the censor's shown, no, oh, oh

For those who've never had
You keep coming back
You take, take, take away
'Til the very last
For those who've never had
You keep coming back
Take, take, take away
'Til the very last
