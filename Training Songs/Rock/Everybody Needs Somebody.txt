EVERYBODY NEEDS SOMEBODY
(Jerry Eubanks, Doug Gray, George McCorkle)

Listening for a faint sound
Gazing out the window I see
Winds blowing clouds
Wish they were taking me
A lonesome song on the radio
Reminds me of where I'd like to be

CHORUS

Everybody needs somebody
To help them make it through life
Arms to hold, words to soothe
Someone to say that it's all right

Too many miles of road, I really can't complain
These LONELY hotel rooms are driving me insane
My life's a hard life, wouldn't have it any other way
Someday darling, I'll be coming home to stay

CHORUS

Songs of the highway, one night stands
It can take it's toll on any kind of man
Lord, I miss you and I ain't afraid to say
Someday darling, I'll be coming home to stay
