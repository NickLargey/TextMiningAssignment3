Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm staring at the ceiling
The clock, it won't stop ticking
I feel like I've been sleeping for too long now
It's like my heart stopped beating
And now I'm hardly breathing
And I'm afraid of leaving scared to break down

And what am I waiting for?
'Cause I don't wanna wait no more
And I'm the only soldier in this lonely world
And I don't wanna fight myself no more

Maybe I was meant to run
Maybe I was born to bleed
I don't know who I'll become
But I'll be going going gone
And even if it starts to hurt
I wanna feel it 'til my whole heart bursts
'Cause I will be forever young
So I'll be going going going going 
Gone, gone (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Take me like I've been starving
Kiss me without a warning
I don't care where I'm going
Throw a dart at the map
'Cause I'm ready to be reckless
Care more so I could care less
Got money in my mattress
It's a start, yeah

And what am I waiting for?
'Cause I don't wanna wait no more
And I'm the only soldier in this lonely world
And I don't wanna fight myself no more

Maybe I was meant to run (maybe I was meant to run)
Maybe I was born to bleed (maybe I was born to bleed)
I don't know who I'll become
But I'll be going going gone (going gone)
And even if it starts to hurt
I wanna feel it 'til my whole heart bursts
'Cause I will be forever young
So I'll be going going going going 
Gone, gone (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm staring at the ceiling
The clock, it won't stop ticking
I feel like I've been sleeping for too long now

Maybe I was meant to run
Maybe I was born to bleed
I don't know who I'll become
But I'll be going going gone (going gone)
And even if it starts to hurt
I wanna feel it 'til my whole heart bursts
'Cause I will be forever young
So I'll be going going going going 
Gone, gone
