Candy with a cigar between chipped teeth
Legs straddling the newspaper rack
The cars passed outside the cafe
She took off her new wave glasses to say

It's gonna be a long fall from here
Where did you go
I guess it doesn't matter now
Welcome home

I wanted to follow the sun this year
After too many soggy springs
But mayflowers bring June brings jealousy
And bad plans July brings me

Early sunsets and summer's end
Last chance for lake swimming
Dawn walking the old road by the dump alone
Welcome home

It's easier to disagree 
With what you're told
Than what you're shown
So they say
Welcome home
