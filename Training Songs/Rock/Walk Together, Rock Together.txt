It's not the way we look 
It's not our stance, our style, our hair 
Forget those stupid barriers 
Take down that "flag" you wear
Just people living on
With different hearts and different minds
If we lived in the same world 
Why can't we stand in the same line 

If we can walk together 
Why can't we rock together 
If we can walk together 
Why can't we rock together 

No I don't care 
If you're into different bands 
No, cause for so much hatred 
I'm just a different man 
Pull off the cover, I will too 
And learn to understand 
With music deep inside 
We'll make world our unity plan 

If we can walk together 
Why can't we rock together 

A label is a label 
Definition nothing more 
And because of labels we have placed 
We live in constant war 
Destroy all that tradition 
And live before you die 
Let's rock together from now on 
And never be denied
