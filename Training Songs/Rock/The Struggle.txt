They came alive when I sold my soul
I've been waiting at the crossroads 
Just hoping that they'd come
I've been pulling funny faces
I've been shooting evil stares
Getting too big for my boots
Oh ripping in the tear
I've been reading in the papers there's nothing to believe
I'm gonna chuck it now 'cause the black rats
Things are looking up, 
I'm looking good, 
I'm getting all audacious
Cos I'm not interested in patients, 
'Cause I have not got the patience

Well are you worth the trouble?
Well are you worth the struggle?
Are you worth the trouble?
Are you worth the struggle?

Sell a band, choose the signs, I'm gonna start a war
But for your first day they gave you absolutely nothing
To bed without your suffer
You can suffer on your own aha
You drink the juice, and I'll suck out the bone & marrows
Excuse slow/your hero, two zeroes, one zero

Don't blame it all on the devil
Don't blame it all on the devil
Don't blame it all on the de-de-devil

Now are you worth the trouble?
Now are you worth the struggle?
Well are you worth the trouble?
Are you worth the struggle?

No no no no 

Well are you worth the trouble?
Are you worth the struggle?
Are you worth the trouble?
Are you worth the struggle?

No no no
