The last song
The light that's in your eyes, like everyone wants it to be
Well can't you see that it must be this way
Who knows who's wrong or right
Just as long as you're here tonight
Just like my mother, always taking my likings away
When nobody's watching us

I missed the last song
I blame myself for just standing there too long
I missed the last song
I blame myself for just standing there

I miss the love, I miss the holidays
I miss my best friend, cheap cigars, stupid kids and movie stars
And just like my father, always taking my likings away
When nobody's watching us

I missed the last song
I blame myself for just standing there too long
I missed the last song
I blame myself for just standing there too long

Why does it feel like this world is just not for us
Why does it feel like this world's all they've got for us
Why does it feel like nobody's watching us

I missed her sweet smell, I miss it everyday
I miss my best friend, cheap cigars, stupid kids and moviestars
And I missed the last song and I miss you
And this time this one's for us

I missed the last song
I blame myself for just standing there too long
I missed the last song
I blame myself for just standing there too long
I missed the last song
I missed the last song
I missed the last song
I missed the last song
