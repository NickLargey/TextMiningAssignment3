Sadie made it down in hollywood
She worked real hard and she did real good
Now the years are finally coming down
Oh, though she owns this whole town

She's living and she's dying
She spent her whole time trying
Seems like even when you do it
Then you find out you can go right through it

Everybody needs a lover
Everybody needs a friend
Everybody needs a lover
To keep them moving 'til the end

Stevie won it all in rock and roll
Had it right down in his soul
Still has to face the day
Oh, some blues won't play

He's living and he's dying
He's spent his whole life trying
Seems like even when you do it
Then you find out you can go right through it

Everybody needs a lover
Everybody needs a friend
Everybody needs a lover
To keep them moving 'til the end

Buy the papers and i read them all day
Wonder when they're gonna blow it away
Working hard just to keep myself sane
But some days it's all pain

Everybody needs a lover
Everybody needs a friend
Everybody needs a lover
To keep them moving 'til the end
