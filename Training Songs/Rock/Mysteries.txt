Life, it has so many changes 
Streets, they have so many strangers 
Hearts, they have so many dangers , when in love
Mysteries of life I ponder
Here on earth with all its wonder

Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
So many memories in life to hold 
So many mysteries left to get old
So many miseries that we behold
As the mysteries in life all unfold
Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh

Love, is the biggest mystery
Immune, to it we will never be
Free, for all it will always be
Time, is what we can not capture
Even if we are in a rapture

Stars in the night, with lights lit so bright
Nights full of fun, with days under the sun
Seas far and wide, with sand on their side

Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
So many memories in life to hold 
So many mysteries left to get old
So many miseries that we behold
As the mysteries in life all unfold
Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
