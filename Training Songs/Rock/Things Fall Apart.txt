Do do do do do do do
Every tired second
Every heavy page
They fold into a nightmare
Almost turn to rage

I felt like I was dreaming
I should have been happy
I know I should need nothing
You never needed me

And its always raining
And its always raining
Californian girlfriend (Californian girlfriend)
I will call you from the end
Californian girlfriend (Californian girlfriend)
Things will fall apart again
Do do do do do do do

Everything you gave me
Everything you've known
Is the newest form of torture
The newest broken bone

Running out out of fortune
Running out of pain
And I'll benefit from sadness
The sadness kills my brain

Californian girlfriend
(Californian girlfriend)
I will call you from the end
Californian girlfriend
(Californian girlfriend)
Things will fall apart again

And its always raining
And its always raining
Californian girlfriend
I will call you from the end
Californian girlfriend
Things will fall apart again
