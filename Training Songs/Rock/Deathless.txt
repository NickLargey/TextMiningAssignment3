Driven off course
Embrace entropy, a life of chaos
So many diverging paths with so many dead ends
An oath of blood
A pact of the initiated
For this life we've been condemned

Free from the shackles of conformity
With reckless abandon we shun stability
Traversing day and night across expanses vast
We journey forth with the strength of the wind at our backs

Deathless, the fire burns on and on
Ceaseless, we ride into the dawn
No turning back, we're too far gone
Deathless, the fire burns

Night after night
Witness the decibel ritual
Sacrificing ourselves upon this altar of sin
Nocturnally devoted to the cause of blasphemy
Heathens awaiting the black mass to begin

Free from the shackles of conformity
With reckless abandon we shun stability
Traversing day and night across expanses vast
We journey forth with the strength of the wind at our backs

Deathless, the fire burns on and on
Ceaseless, we ride into the dawn
No turning back, we're too far gone
Deathless, the fire burns

It was never a choice
No glory for madmen
The blood of the insane boils in our veins
Through all the trials and tribulations
Still we remain

Let's ride

Deathless, the fire burns on and on
Ceaseless, we ride into the dawn
No turning back, we're too far gone
Deathless, deathless
