She's thinking about the prince and Cinderella
The outlaws the hustlers and the heroes
They never seem to fall
It doesn't matter it doesn't matter what
The outcome of the story is
Because in real life I try to tell her
It's not like that at all
Oh won't you please just hold out now
Cause there are some things I'd like you to forget
When you world is sinking like a sunset 

Tales of Don Juan they're very poetic babe
But out on the streets out there
The true verse of life is written
You know it's really a shame
When you've got to let go
Of all the things you love
Like a fighter he really bleeds
When he must hang up his gloves

No I am not a rock
And I can feel it now
But for a moment
I'd like to forget
That my heart is
Sinking like a sunset
Sinking like a sunset

Everybody has a story
Some are tragic some find glory
But it feels more real when you're here
Right next to me

You can walk too far out on that ledge
And you might lose your mind
You know I need you now
You're an angel that keeps me in line
The old sergeant has broken down
He's grown senile
He shouts "kill the bastards!" in the night
Cause he's all out of time

Don't hold out let's make love right now
Cause there's some things I'd like to forget
When our hearts are sinkin' like a sunset
Won't you hold me now
And make things right
Cause when you're with me here
The sun comes out at night
Making me forget
We're sinking like a sunset

Sinking like a sunset
Sinking like a sunset
