It didn't feel like Sunday
Didn't feel like June
When he met his silent partner in that lonely corner room
That over looked the marquee
Of the Plaza all-adult
And he was not lookin' for romance -- just someone he could trust

[Chorus:]
And it wasn't no way to carry on
It wasn't no way to live
But he could put up with it for a little while
He was workin' on something big

Speedball rang the night clerk
Said, "Send me up a drink"
The night clerk said, "It's Sunday man, ...wait a minute let me think
There's a little place outside of town that might
Still have some wine"
Speedball said, "Forget it, can I have an outside line"

[Chorus:]

It was Monday when the daymaids
Found the still made bed
All except the pillows that lay stacked
Up at the head
And one said, "I know I've seen his face
I wonder who he is?" 
The other said, "Probably just another clown
Workin' on something big"

[Chorus:]
