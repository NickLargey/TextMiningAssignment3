You need some time alone
I need some time to stop before I fall
Back to the part I hate
Back to the things I've done before

Still I walk along
With no sense of where I've gone
If it's more than what I hoped for 
Then I'd hope that I was wrong

It makes no difference 
To the things I'll never see
You might feel a change 
But I can't change the way I feel

"It's all been lost 
And I don't love you any more"
That's what she said 
As she's walking out the door
