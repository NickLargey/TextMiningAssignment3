Lately you've been acting strange
Getting further out of range
Seems to me there's been a change
We don't exchange the things we used to

You say it's nothing
Baby I doubt it
Can't you see we did better without it
Why don't you just tell me about it?
C'mon girl, stand up and shout it

Baby, let it out
(Let it out, let it out)
Tell me, what you're upset about?

Let it out
(Let it out, let it out)
Baby, you've got to let it out

Give me more than what we knew
Tell me more than I love you
Tell me something I can do
To prove us through
Baby, you've got to

Baby, let it out
(Let it out, let it out)
Tell me, what you're upset about?

Let it out
(Let it out, let it out)
Baby, you've got to let it out

Just care enough to let me inside it
Can't you see it's time you can fight it?
Can't you see it's time that you cried it?
C'mon girl, don't try to hide it

Baby, let it out
(Let it out, let it out)
Tell me, what you're upset about?

Let it out
(Let it out, let it out)
Baby, you've got to let it out

Let it out
(Let it out, let it out)
Tell me, what you're upset about?

Let it out
(Let it out, let it out)
Baby, you've got to let it out

Let it out
(Let it out, let it out)
Tell me, what you're upset about?
