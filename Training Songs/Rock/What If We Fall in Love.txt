All in love is fair
Young and free, so easy to care, without pain
We can laugh and we can cry
We can have it all without askin' why, without chains
But there comes a time when you feel so unsure, girl
But that could be more

What if we fall in love (tonight)
What if we fall in love
What if we fall in love, ooh

When I'm feelin' all alone
Those times when love turns out all wrong, you'll be there
And when you needed me you knew, we were friends
And friends will always come through, 'cause they care
And in our hearts, and in our own ways
We are the same, we both were afraid

What if we fall in love (tonight)
What if we fall in love
What if we fall in love

But there comes a time when you feel so unsure, yeah
That could be more
What if we fall in love (tonight)

Love is easier for some
In and out, they love on the run, without care
Should they break a heart or two
It's just a game, so easy to do, so unfair
But there comes a time when you feel so unsure, girl
But that could be more

What if we fall in love (tonight)
What if we fall in love
What if we fall in love
What if we fall in love
What if we fall in love
