Tell me who, who knows who's been having you
I know it's a guy, ah, but you're just not their type
You face it at the top, you flew into my eyes
Your soul it's a pearl, well, it should not be thrown to swine

Yeah, you're a treasure, I'll keep in my pocket forever, ever
Oh, yeah, you're a treasure, you'll keep in my pocket forever, ever
Oh, yeah, you're a treasure, you'll keep in my pocket forever, ever, oh, yeah

So the truth, when I look what they've done to you
You're under the knife, well, I'm gonna cut you loose
But you are the kind and we'll make it fit just fine
This tower's a frown, oh, but somehow you make me smile

Yeah, you're a treasure, I'll keep in my pocket forever, ever
Oh, yeah, you're a treasure, you'll keep in my pocket forever, ever
Oh, yeah, you're a treasure, you'll keep in my pocket forever, ever
Oh, yeah, you're a treasure, I'll keep in my pocket forever, ever

Oh God, you're a treasure, I'll keep in my pocket forever, ever
Oh, yeah, you're a treasure, you'll keep in my pocket forever, ever
Oh, yeah, you're a treasure, you'll keep in my pocket forever, ever
For ever and ever and ever, ever, oh, you keep it cool
