maybe now
maybe now
we can lay all the
weariness down

it was the hottest summer ever
and the traffic was a monster
it was keeping me from smiling
and I wished that it would end

you were sittin' right beside me
goin' nowhere on the BQE
but the traffic and the weather
didn't get you down

it was the hottest summer ever
when we got into the big park
I was thinkin' of an ending
and we were barely even friends

you were sittin' right beside me
with your hand on my hand
and we were makin' the kind of plans
that didn't mean anything

it was the hottest summer ever
and the traffic was a monster
it was keeping me from smiling
and I wished that it would end

you were sittin' right beside me
goin' nowhere on the BQE
but the traffic and the weather
didn't get you down

it was the hottest day on record
when we got into the big park
I was thinkin' of an ending
and we were barely even friends

you were sittin' right beside me
with your hand on my hand
and we were makin' the kind of plans
that didn't mean anything

not tonight
not ever
again
will I take you
not tonight
not ever
again
for granted

it was the hottest day on record
the traffic was a monster
tt was keeping me from smiling
tnd I wished that it would end

you were sittin' right beside me
with your hand on my hand
and we were makin' the kind of plans
that didn't need any words
didn't need any words
any words
any words

didn't need
any words
