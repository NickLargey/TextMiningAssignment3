I could be the tiger, I could be the snake
I could be the fire, I could be the lake
I could be the sky bird, waiting on the wind
I could be the devil waiting to begin

See I was the wounded master and I was the slave
My hands in my mouths are hungry was caught in the rain
And I was the holy lion and I was the cage
And I was the leading actor and I was the stage

Now you’re telling me my heart’s safe
And I’m telling you I know
You’re telling me lean in and I’m telling you to go
Not so sorry for the heartbreak but for each season left unblessed
A new terror in the canyon, a new tear in our chest

And I could be the terror and or I could be the place
I could be forever or just a couple days
I could be the morning that breaks upon your skin
I could be the devil and do it all again

See I was the wounded master and I was the slave
My hands in my mouths are hungry was caught in the rain
See I was the holy lion and I was the cage
And I was the leading actor and I was the stage

Oh  but now you’re telling me my heart’s sick
And I’m telling you I know
And you’re telling me you’re leaving
And I’m telling you to go
And I’m not so sorry for the heart-wreck
But for each season left unblessed
The new terror in the canyons
The new terror in our chests
