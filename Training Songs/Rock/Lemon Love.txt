My lemon love, why you gotta break on me?
Why gotta shut me slowly down? The road from here
My lemon love, you know I put my trust in you
What a selfish thing to do now leave me stranded here

How I thought that years would count for something good
But to erase the loneliness it warns me
Officially my kiss will miss you
My, my, my, my lemon love

The places we could be doing now
Unfortunate and shamed you're totaled out of touch from me

Did you ever know how much I felt for you?
But to defend the damage done
Outweighs the crush eroded, you're demoted
My, my, my, my lemon love

I long to breath you, don't understand
How to dream I'll never see you come again comes over me

I'd feel better never to accept the why
To know you know I'd give the sequence of my youth
For your affection, resurrection
My, my, my, my lemon love

My lemon love, I could never put a price on you
'Cause I could never sell my heart and still be alive enough
My lemon love
