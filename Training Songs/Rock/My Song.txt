I want to sing my song
It takes me home where I come from
I want to sing my song
For you, for everyone.

Still the fire burns
From deep inside of me
But when my heart is longing
Fear disappears

And so I wait in silence
Wait for a star to fall
I'll fly with the angels
As they carry me home

I want to sing my song....

Oh, I've left it all behind me
To travel the distant roads
So far from my homeland
So far from my shores

I want to sing my song....
