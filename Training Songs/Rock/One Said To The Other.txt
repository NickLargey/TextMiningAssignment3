One said to the other
You'll never find another 
Now that you're on your own
To discover
You're living undercover 
Now that you're on your *own

She's not really bothered by a riot in Milan
Only gets excited by the cheap shot brands
Dressed up in a number that she got from Japan
Powdered up, converted with solarium tan

You know that she won't leave here alone
(You know that she won't leave here alone)
She ain't ever gonna leave here alone

Now that you're on your *own

She's not really in touch with the government plans 
Much too busy looking for a one night stand 
You don't have to show her before you get to know her 
And she's the type who plays the fool I don't understand 

You know that she won't leave here alone 
(You know that she won't leave here alone)
She ain't ever gonna leave here alone

She's not really bothered by the riot in Milan
Only gets excited by the cheap shot
Dressed up in a number that she got from Japan
Powdered up, covered in solarium tan

You know that she won't leave here alone
(Know that she won't leave here alone)
She ain't ever gonna leave here alone
(Ain't ever gonna leave here alone)
Oh you know that she won't leave here alone 
(Know that she won't leave here alone) 
She ain't ever gonna leave here alone
