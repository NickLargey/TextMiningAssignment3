Just look at that girl
She knows the world owes her something and she's alright
Just look at that girl 
She knows she got that something and she's alright
She's got diamond rings from her dad
She's got fancy things from her dad
All the world, it wants this lady
All the world, it wants her

So nice in Nice (so nice in Nice) so nice and neat (so nice and neat)
So nice in Nice (so nice in Nice) so nice and neat (so nice and neat)

Just look at that girl
She owns the ground she walks on and she walks all over you
Just look at that girl
She smiles and breaks your heart, there's nothing you can do
She's got diamond rings from her dad
She's got fancy things from her dad
All the world, it wants my baby
All the world, it wants her

So nice in Nice (so nice in Nice) so nice and neat (so nice and neat)
So nice in Nice (so nice in Nice) so nice and neat (so nice and neat)

Do not tell me
Lies you can't support
I wouldn't believe you
I wouldn't believe at all
Even if I saw

Just look at that girl
Well, where once she wore leather jackets, now she's wearing furs
Just look at that girl
She walks around owning everything that's not even hers
She's got diamond rings from her dad
She's got fancy things from her dad 
All the world it wants my baby
All the world it wants her

So nice in Nice (so nice in Nice) so nice and neat (so nice and neat)
So nice in Nice (so nice in Nice) so nice and neat (so nice and neat)

She walks straight ahead (so nice in Nice)
Walks all over you (so nice and neat)
She smiles and breaks your heart (so nice in Nice)
But that's okay (so nice and neat)

(So nice in Nice)
(So nice in Nice)
(So nice in Nice)
