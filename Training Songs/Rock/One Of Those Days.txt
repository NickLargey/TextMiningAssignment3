Wait right here
Was all she said to me
And so right here I stay
Time has reached our home
And I've been left alone
It's carried him away

And everyone keeps saying
Nothing helps but time
Time is all I own
The timings stop replaying over in my mind
I watch the hours slow down

[Chorus]
So I crawl underneath my blanket
Where I can hide away
I know I can't take it
Cause I see now
It's just one of those days

Now a year has passed
Alone I stay inside
And I await the rain
To wash away your face
So I don't have to hide
The sight of you is painful

[Chorus]

I can't stop
Seeing your face
I can't stop
Seeing your face
Every place

[Chorus]
