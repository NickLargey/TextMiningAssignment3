Imagine your brain as a 
Canister filled with ink 
Yeah, now think of your body 
As the pen where the ink resides 

Fuse the two; KAPOW! 
What are you now? 
You're the human magic marker, won't you 
Please surprise my eyes? 

It's in your nature, 
You can paint whatever picture 
You like no matter what 
Ted Koppel says on channel 4 tonight 

So modify this third rock from the sun 
By painting myriads of pictures 
With the colors of one 
I'm sick of painting in black and white 

My pen is dry, now I'm uptight 
So sick of limiting myself 
To fit your definition 
Picture the scene, where whatever you thought, 

Would, in the blink of an eye, 
Manifest and become illustrated 
You'd be sure man that every 
Line drawn reflected a life that you loved 

Not an existence that you hated 
So, must we demonstrate that 
We can't get it straight? 
We've painted a picture, 

Now we're drowning in paint 
Lets figure out what the f*ck it's about 
Before the picture we painted 
Chews us up and spits us out 

I'm sick of painting in black and white 
My pen is dry, now I'm uptight 
So sick of limiting myself 
To fit your definition
