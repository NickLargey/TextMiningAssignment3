Come on, the sun will rise
Another time
The colors blind
Your virgin eyes
I'm so inclined
To make you mine
You're out of line
And out of time

And I float upon a shallow bay
Lift me up until the ground gives way
I'm a California castaway
I don't think you want to f*ck with me
Don't over kill
This painless thrill
It's bitter still
Your pretty pill
You wait until
You've had your fill
I know you will
I know you will

And I float upon a shallow bay
Lift me up until the ground gives way
I'm a California castaway
I don't think you want to f*ck with me
Don't over kill
This painless thrill
It's bitter still
Your pretty pill
You wait until
You've had your fill
I know you will
I know you will

A shallow bay
A shallow bay

And I float upon a shallow bay
Lift me up until the ground gives way
I'm a California castaway
I don't think you want to f*ck with me
Don't over kill
This painless thrill
It's bitter still
Your pretty pill
You wait until
You've had your fill
I know you will
I know you will

And I float upon a shallow bay
Lift me up until the ground gives way
I'm a California castaway
I don't think you want to f*ck with me
Don't over kill
This painless thrill
It's bitter still
Your pretty pill
You wait until
You've had your fill
I know you will
I know you will

You live, you learn
You live, you learn
You live, you learn
You live
