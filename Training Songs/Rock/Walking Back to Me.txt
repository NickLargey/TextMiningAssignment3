Slipping away 'til it's dim in the dark
The flame that was strong has become just a spark
But I'll wait for you

Now when we talk your eyes look away
The thing that we had has wandered astray
I'll wait for you
Further and further we're drifting apart
We knew this would happen right from start
But I'll wait for you

Caught up in troubles that don't mean a thing
You're ready to fly for a prayer on a wing
But I'll wait for you
Say you were never in love with me
But I'll still wait for you

Oh it's just the way it's meant to be
You tell me no but in won't be long before you see
You're walking back to me

The road you are following it's a dead end
And who will be there when you need a real friend
I will wait

How are we gonna get back to the start
They're too close to home these matters of heart
Say you were never in love with me
But I'll still wait for you

Oh it's just the way it's meant to be
You tell me no but in won't be long before you see
You're walking back to me
You're walking back to me

Ducking and diving
Sneaking and hiding
These worries
And these troubles
Don't you know
They'll catch up with you
You're walking back 
You're walking back to me

Oh it's just the way it's meant to be
You tell me no but in won't be long before you see
You're walking back to me
