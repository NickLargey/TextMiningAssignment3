Born crying 
Abnormized 
I was schooled by the devils child 
I did things you only dream of 
I was wild inside 

And he said I was evil 
Cause I am just an evil child 
Through the rain and sunshine 
They kept on calling me an 
Evil Child 

Cause I am just an evil child 
Miranda, Belinda for I found that they were all the same 
They come in hell fire and 
She burned like a flame inside 
And I called her my evil child 
I loved her 

She was magic pure magic 
Through the moon and star shine 
They keep on talking about us 
They call us together 
Evil Child 

Born Evil 
Die Evil 
Now I swing from a gallows pole 
I did things I dream of 
People said I was wild inside 
They said I was evil 
Evil Child 

Through the rain and sunshine 
They keep on talking about me 
They call me an evil child 

Through the moon and sunshine 
They keep on talking about me 
They call me an evil child
