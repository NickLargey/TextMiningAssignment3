I’ve no sorrow 
If I’m glad, oh! let me show it 

Did you see those birds take flight? 
She opened her hand and they flew across the room 

How the morning skies are high 
I watch them as they turn from black to blue 
I was dreaming of boats last night 
Boats in the desert and anchors and bridges and you… 

Oh, let’s get in the water 
Oh, let’s get in the water 
They said “no, don’t go near the water” 
You said “oh, let’s get in the water” 
You said “oh oh oh…”
