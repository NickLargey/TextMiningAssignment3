You've got too much
But not enough
It's not always such a drag
When you're around

But it seems like I might try to make it better

I tell you lies
I sympathize
With your demon
When he turns you inside out

I'll make you run away and you don't have to be sorry
I'll make you run so far, it's just a matter of time
You've got nothing to lose, wassh me out of your life

But it seems like I might try to make it better
It seems like I might try.

Your timing's stalled
But it's your call
If you think it's worth the pain
I'll give to you

I'll make you run away and you don't have to be sorry
I'll make you run so far, it's just a matter of time
I wanna take you down, but I don't hear when you're screaming
You've got nothing to lose, wash me out of your life

But it seems like I might try to make it better
It seems like I might try, but I know better.
