You sure looked good, bound for Shilburn Town
Tryin' to drive that car while the rain came down
And you sure looked fine
Oh yeah, you're readin' highway signs

And you sure looked good up on Crystal Beach
Reelin' in them fish, with your hair all bleached
And you sure looked fine
Hey, yeah, with your hooks and lines

La, da, di, dumb, da, la, da, di, dumb, day
Every move you make, everything you say
Well, you sure are fine
Oh yes, and you blow my mind

And you sure looked good out at Rainbow Falls
Pass the parking lots and all the crowded malls, yeah
And you sure looked fine
Um hum, underneath them pines

La, da, di, dumb, da, la, da, di, dumb, day
Every move you make, everything you say
Well, you sure are fine
Oh yes, indeed, and you blow my mind

You sure look good back in ol' Canton
With your new blue dress and with your lipstick on
And you sure look fine
Yeah, drinkin' the cheap red wine

And you sure look good back in Meisha-Shay
With your reindeer eyes on Christmas day
And you sure looked fine
Um hum, like a valentine

La, da, di, dumb, da, la, da, di, dumb, day
Every move you make, everything you say
Well, you sure are fine
Oh yeah, and you blow my mind
