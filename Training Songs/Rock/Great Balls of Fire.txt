You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much lovin drives a man insane
You broke my will but what a thrill
Goodness gracious - great balls of fire
I laughed at love cause I thought it was funny
You came along and moved me honey
I changed my mind - this loves's fine
Goodness gracious - great balls of fire
Kiss me baby - ooooooh! - feels good
Hold me baby
Well I want to love you like a lover should
You're so fine, so kind
Got to tell this world that you're
Mine, mine, mine
I chew my nails and then I twiddle my thumbs
I feel all nervous but it sure is fun
Come on baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious - great balls of fire
