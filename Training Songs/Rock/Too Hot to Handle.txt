Caught in the crossfire, warnin' fight
Legends make or break game
Swept up by the rolling waves of the night
The paper chase for fame

I was too, too hot, baby
Too hot to handle
Yeah, I was too, too hot
Too hot to handle

Wink of an eye, the feelings ran high
A real rock and roll molest
But I ain't no romance
And I ain't no slow chance
Won't get no quick change

*and I'm too, too hot, baby
Too hot to handle
Yeah, I'm too, too hot, baby
Too hot to handle

**sha la la la, roll you over
Turn you around and do it again
Sha la la la , keep on coming
Do it once but never the same

[instrumental]

**repeat

I'm in your town, won't fool around
I'll make some action stick
Just like the story says, these boys are bad
So keep out of shootin' range

* repeat
* repeat (ad lib)
