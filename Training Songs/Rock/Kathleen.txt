Strange to see, (orig.: it's plain to see) the sun don't shine today
But I ain't in the mood for sunshine anyway
Maybe I'll go insane, got to stop the pain
Maybe I'll go down to see Kathleen
Swallow comes, tells me her dreams
Says she'd like to know just what they mean
Feel like I could die as I watch her flying by
Riding the north wind down to see Kathleen
Stars hang high with the ocean roar

The moon has come to lead me to a door
It's crystal `cross the sand, the waves they take my hand
Soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen
Soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen
