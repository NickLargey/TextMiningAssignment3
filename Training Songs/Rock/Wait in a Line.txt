I will wait in a line
For the club lights to hypnotize
Move as one in the night
When the beats hit like we're alive
Like birds on a wire
We'll hold on that much

I will be compromised by a heartbeat laced
Attack my spine
Feel the mercury climb
When the club lets out
A quick decline
With confidence rise
As phoenix we fly
Unconquered we lie
Gravity catches up
