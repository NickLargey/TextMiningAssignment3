I do believe I have a plan
To steal the queen of Neverland
'Cause I was in her neighborhood
Feeling just like Robin Hood

With only our love to protect us
Hoping they won't detect us
Through the castle's open air
Sliding down the spiral stairs

I do believe I have a plan
To steal the queen of Neverland
I slipped into her room and said
"Come with me the king is dead"

In the name of lustful just rewards
As knights shall fall upon their swords
And grant this poor boy's wish tonight
To make the queen a noble wife

I do believe I have a plan
To steal the queen of Neverland
When I come breaking down her door
She's the one I'm looking for

Black and white
First you're here then it's cool
It's wrong, all right, all right

I'll do whatever I must do
Scale the walls to be with you
And word will spread throughout the land
He stole the queen of Neverland

I do believe I have a plan
To steal the queen of Neverland
And every boy to become a man
To steal the queen of Neverland

Steal the queen of Neverland
Steal the queen of Neverland
Steal the queen of Neverland
