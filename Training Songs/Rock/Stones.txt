It's just like you to cause a scene
It's just like me to tell tales
I know it weighs heavy
But it doesn't have to be this way
Just let the stones fall from their slings
You know you can throw sharper things
Just let the pain fold away
You'll slip your chains sooner that way
What comes down to burden you
Is just like a test that never fails
And I know It's hard for you
But you don't see the beauty that I see
Just let the stones fall from their slings
You know you can throw sharper things
Just let the pain fold away
You'll slip your chains sooner that way
And I will be the last one down
For I see more than just a noose
Allow me to show you what I mean
Just take my hand it's alright
I know you're weak from all you fight
Just let the fear of it all
Trouble you no more
