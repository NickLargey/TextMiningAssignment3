Had a dream
I was born
Took me naked in the eye of the storm
And now it's standing right in front of me
What's it gonna do to me?
Who knows?

Had a dream 
It was time
To be taken to the front of a line
Well, that is not a place you want to be
Sleeping with the enemy
You know

I don't care
What the future brings
Give a damn 
About anything
I'd be fine
If they'd only leave me alone

But it's time
Gotta take a stance 
'Cause I won't
Get a second chance
And I know
Now I have to make it alone

Had a dream
It was war
And they couldn't tell me what it was for
But it was something they could lie about
Something we could die about
You know

Anytime
Anyplace
When you look that man in the face
Well, it is not a face you want to see
Sleeping with the enemy
You know

Mary, can you hear me?
Can you tell me what it's all supposed to mean?
Holding out a photograph of all that I have seen
I wish I could hold you
I wish I could hold you

Had a dream 
It was time
To be a witness at the scene of the crime
Well, that is something you can analyze
Something you can criticize
Who knows?

So we wait
Hesitate
And we're making such a mistake
Oh, whatever can the matter be?
Sleeping with the enemy
You know

I don't care
What the future brings
Give a damn 
About anything
I'd be fine
If they'd only leave me alone

But it's time
Gotta take a stance 
'Cause I won't
Get a second chance
And I know
Now I have to make it alone

But, you wanna know 
But, you wanna know
