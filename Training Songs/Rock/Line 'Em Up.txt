You got nickels in your pocket, man
Your unconventional way of makin' money's sad
Call one of your sugar-babies when you get hungry
You goal's a lot bigger baby don't get funny
Got to
Take a look
Take a look at what ya got
All grown-up don't got a lot to show for
Take a look
Take a look to be sure
Don't let them tell you what to go for
Shake it up
Shake it up don't put down
You can be the one that you always dream about
Take a look
Take a look at what you got
You could be a star, ride in limousines

Line 'em up
And you knock 'em down
Line 'em up, watch 'em hit the ground
Line 'em up
And you knock 'em down
Line 'em up
And ya knock 'em

Wore out your shoes but that sho ain't no news
Cried out your blues like John Lee
John Lee Hooker croons
Howlin' at the moon like a rabid
Like a rabid circus clown
You need to line 'em up and you need to
Knock 'em down
Mister
