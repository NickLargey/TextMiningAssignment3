If this is really living
Why am I so unforgiving
Half the world is down the toilet
Half is on its way

Well if I had a dollar for
Every time he hollers:
"trust us with your hearts and minds"
Or I'll make you pay

Trust me

Ask me why you're feeling screwed
And I'll give you the answer
There's a colin, dick, and bush
Just a hammerin' away

Ask me why you feel deceived
And stripped of all your liberties
It doesn't take a genius
To explain that today

Trust me
