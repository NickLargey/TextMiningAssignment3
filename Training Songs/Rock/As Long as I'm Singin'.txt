As long as I'm singin'
There's a bell up in my brain that's ringin'
Makin' a crazy ding dong

And if this band don't desert me
Then there's nothin' in the world can hurt me
As long as I'm singin' my song

Give me trumpets, legato
Put some saxes with 'em
Bones, pizzicato
Gimme rhythm

As long as I'm singin'
Then the world's all right
And everything's swingin'
Long as I'm singin' my song

As long as I'm singin'
Then the world's all right
And everything's swingin'
Long as I'm singin' my
Long as I'm singin' my
Long as I'm singin' my song
