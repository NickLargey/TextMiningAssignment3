Prophet took my hand on all saints day
He preached the values of deception
Changing shadows by a shapeshifter rules
Tales are never just for fools

The court of conscience came before me
Presenting me with a heavenly angel
You took my hand and ask me, truth aside
To his questions I replied

Do you want the truth or something beautiful?
Just close your eyes and make believe
Do you want the truth or something beautiful?

I am happy to deceive you
He stood as tall as redwood trees
Drank tea from a seamstress thimble
Didn't want to speak, the honest truth
So I spit out lies that aimed to soothe

Do you want the truth or something beautiful?
Just close your eyes and make believe
Do you want the truth or something beautiful?
I am happy to deceive you

Secrets, lying, falling veils
I can be who you want me to be
Sacred, lies in, telling tales

I can be who you want me to be
But do you want me?

Do you want the truth or something beautiful?
Just close your eyes and make believe
Do you want the truth or something beautiful?
I am happy to deceive you
Sacred lies in, telling tales

I can be who you wants me to be
I can be who you wants me to be
But do you want me?
But do you want me?
