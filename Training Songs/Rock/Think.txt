All you men with aching greed
You don't realise that the people need 
The children need a helping hand
Life means nothing in your houses tall

You've never had your back's against the wall
Your backs against the wall
With a gun at your head
I see no fun in laughing all the time

All those ruby smiles and all those funny lines
They don't mean a thing to me
'Cause I don't have the time for that
Live your life in luxury

You don't know what its like out on the streets
Without a friend to help you through the night
First its there and then its gone
Then you realise it's not much fun, no it's not much fun

When you practice to deceive
I see no fun in laughing all the time
All those ruby smiles and all those funny lines 
They don't mean a thing to me, cause I don't have the time

They don't mean a thing to me, cause I don't have the time
For that
I said we've got no time for that, no, no, not anything
Well I've seen so many things

Knights of days and fallen kings
Times when everyone lies to you all the time
Time in our hands, it's going slow
Before to long, it's gonna blow

It's all going to blow up in your face
You've got fancy names for your evil men
They're going to take you in their world of sin, world of sin
Where you'll be all alone

You'll be all alone
Well I can see no fun in laughing all the time
All those ruby smiles and all those funny lines
They don't mean a thing to me, cause I don't have the time

They don't mean a thing to me, cause I just don't have the time
For that
No time for that, no time for that, no time for that
No time for that.
