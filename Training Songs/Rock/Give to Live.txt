Ooo I can see that you've got fire in your eyes
And pain inside your heart
So many things have come 
And torn your world apart

Oh baby, baby, baby 
Don't give up 
Don't give up 
Don't give up

If you want love 
If you want love
You've got to give a little 
If you want love

If you want faith 
You just believe a little 
If you want love 
If you want peace

Turn your cheek a little 
Oh you've got to give 
You've got to give
You've got to give to live

An empty hand reaching out for someone
An empty heart takes so little to fill
It's so much easier to push instead of pull
Oh baby, baby, baby 

Don't give up 
Don't give up 
Don't give up 

If you want love 
If you want love
You've got to give a little 
If you want love

If you want faith 
You just believe a little 
If you want love 
If you want peace

Turn your cheek a little 
Oh you've got to give 
You've got to give
You've got to give to live

Each man's a country in his own right 
Oh everybody needs a friend
One friend one God one country 
No man can defend 
Yeah

I believe in faith and destination 
But so much of that ties in our own hands
But if you know what you want 
Just go on out and get it 

Oh baby, baby just don't give up no, no
Ah don't give up, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
