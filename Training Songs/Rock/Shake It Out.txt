Shake it out, shake it out
God, I need another round, another round, another round, 
Another I could feel it now.
I felt the Lord in my father's house.
Well, I could see, I could see 
Standing we were seventeen make it clean
Are you the living ghost of what I need?
Are you giving me the best of me.
We, will see.

'Cause I'm done being done with the funerals at least for now
Are you tired of being alone, are you tired of being alone?

Shake it out, shake it out.
Tie it up another round another 
Wasn't really what I wanted so we brought it out.
Over the shore to my neighbors house.
I could see I could see
God I never should have seen, so complete
I am the living ghost of what you need
I am everything eternally, God just speak.

'Cause I'm done being done with the funerals at least for now
Are you tired of being alone, are you tired of being alone?

Just be clean

Oh god, you gotta shake it out, shake it out.
You gotta take it out, take it down
I gotta jump around, I needed that more then I ever have.
Oh god you gotta shake it out, shake it out.
You gotta break it down, break it out
You gotta jump around, I feel it now more then I ever have.

I felt the world begin
To peel off all my skin
And I felt the weight within
Reveal the bigger mess
That you can't fix

I felt I felt good
Repeat into my home
Don't fight don't ever go
I swear you'll never know
You'll never know

Oh god you gotta shake it out, shake it out.
You gotta break it down, break it out
