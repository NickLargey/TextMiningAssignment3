Late night call, and I'm at your door.
Teenage tears, on the kitchen floor.
I pull you close, hold my breath, feel your heart beat through your summer dress.
Shuffle our feet, slowly to the stereo.
And if your boyfriend suddenly appears, if your father comes home and finds us here. 
You would know we wouldn't need an alibi.

It's only dancing
It's only dancing

Mirrored ball and a cover band
Just for kicks, wont you take my hand
It's something that all good friends do
It's not like I'm in love with you
What a crazy idea, and where did you get that?
Let's tangle up our finger tips, and I'll rest a hand upon your hips
Nothing to see it's all so innocent

It's only dancing
It's only dancing
It's only dancing
It's only dancing

Clip on tie, and a sweater vest
You wear veil and a wedding dress
I watch you part a crowded room
A perfect bride and a perfect groom
As you float across the ballroom in his arms
And I wanna scream, I wanna burst, I wanna blame the whole damn universe, 
But the same three words I whisper to myself

It's only dancing
It's only dancing
It's only dancing
Yes it's only dancing
