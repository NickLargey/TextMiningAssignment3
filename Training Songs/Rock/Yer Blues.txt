Yes I'm lonely
Want to die
Yes I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ohhh girl you know the reason why.

In the morning
Want to die
In the evening
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ohhh girl you know the reason why.

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth.

I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ohhh girl you know the reason why.

The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so sucidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones

Lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ohhh girl you know the reason why.

Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so sucidal
Even hate my rock and roll

Want to die
Yeah
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ohhh girl you know the reason why.
