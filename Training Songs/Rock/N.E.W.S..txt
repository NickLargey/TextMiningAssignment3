N.E.W., N.E.W., N.E.W.S., North, East, West and South
Read all about it, read all about it
Neeeeeeeeeeeeews
I want to know about the weather tomorrow, I want to know what happened
today
I want to feel that I'm a part of the games, that all the other people play
I mean, being in touch with the actual thing, no matter how amazing
Oh I turn on my radio, switch on my TV, open a paper and a magazine
Let's see what they got, let's see what they got
Let's see what they got, to upset me
It's pitiful, shameful, all I hear and read and see
Four directions of the wind, and a four-way misery
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (2x)
Well once upon a time I was a sailor man, curious about my destiny
So I sailed away on a ship of slaves; the rest, as you know, is history
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (2x)
There's gotta be a lesson for you and me, I mean everybody
How come we never seem to learn, from the things that we all study
Let me hear you say:
North - Scandinavia, Alaska, Siberia
East - Japan, China and India
West - Europe and the US of America
South - Australia, South America, South Africa
Spell it out! N.E., Who, me? Yeah You! Double You and S for South
Jungle drum, word of mouth
We're gonna get it together, we're gonna work it out.
We're gonna get it together, work it out, work it out
So I turn on my radio, switch on my TV, open a paper and a magazine
Let's see what they got, let's see what they got,
Let's see what they got, to update me
It's pitiful, shameful, all I hear and read and see
Four directions of the wind and a four-way misery
North, East, West
We're gonna get it together, we're gonna work it out
We're gonna get it together, work it out, work it out
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
