Ever dance with the devil baby? Oh no,
Make my day
Do you feel lucky? Oh no,
Tomorrow's another day

Can you walk on water maybe? Oh no,
Turn water into wine?
Can I buy you a drink there lady? Oh no,
Can you tell me another lie?

[Chorus]
So be my Devil, Angel
Be my shooting star
Be my devil, Angel
Be my shooting star

Have I seen you somewhere baby? Oh no,
I need another line
Are you living the dream there lady? Oh no,
Can I tell you what's inside

[Chorus]

Stop the car there baby! Oh no,
You can't handle the truth
So what's the point then lady? Oh no,
If ya can't stand to play and lose

So be my Devil, Angel
Be my shooting star
So be my devil, Angel
Be my shooting star
Be my devil, Angel
Be my shooting star
Be my devil, Angel
Be my shooting star

Be my devil!
