I feel real now walking like a woman 
And talking like a stone age man  
I feel real now talking like Buddha and 
Doing it again 
I get kicks I rip it up  kick it up  
Take it like a teenage tough  
And I feel real now talking like sugar 
And shaking that stuff  
Singing "I can't get enough" 
Singing "I can't get enough" 

I feel schitzo everso psycho  
Kicking at an old tin can  
I feel real like a man  like a woman, 
Like a woman, like a man 
I make deadspace feel like a head case 
Take it like a teenage tough 
I feel real now watching those wheels 
And shaking that stuff, 
Singing "I can't get enough" 
Singing "I can't get enough" 

Singing "I can't get enough" 
Singing "I can't get enough" 

I feel real now walking like a woman 
And talking like a stone age man 
I feel real now talking like Buddha and 
Doing it again 
So gimme this and gimme that 
Smother me and gimme some of that bad stuff, 
I feel real now talking like sugar 
And shaking that stuff, 
Singing "I can't get enough" 
Singing "I can't get enough" 
Singing "I can't get enough" 
Singing "I can't get enough"
