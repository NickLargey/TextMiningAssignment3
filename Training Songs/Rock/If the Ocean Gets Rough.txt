Oh, babe I have a heavy heart
We're taking steps back every time we start
I'm on a rolling train downtown
Just trying to get back to my hometown
I took you in to my broken home
Then I got scared to leave you there alone
Here there are shadows that may lead you astray
I never realized they're all in my face
Sail on my love
If the ocean gets rough
Will you help me sing
Will you help me sing
When you first taught me how to stand up tall
So scared of heights I thought that I'd surely fall
I'm used to digging in the dirt
Down where there's no one for me to hurt
The windows whistle when the west wind blows
My head is pounding from these burning coals
I tripped and stumbled don't you know
And in all that dust our hands let go
Sail on my love...
