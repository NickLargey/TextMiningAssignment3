Now I’m expecting you to track me down
And yes I think I know what you’ll say
This place was dark but now it’s bright again
Oh no, don’t tell me it’s a new day
Need your tales of doom and gloom
So it can all be over soon
I wish that I could be The Last Man In Europe
Then would you fall for me, the last man in Europe
Don’t poison me with fear and jealousy
And all the secrets that I’ll never know
Deception hurts my brain like acid rain
So tell the truth and let the venom flow
Hurry up and block the sun
And maybe then I’ll be the only one
I wish that I could be The Last Man In Europe
Then would you fall for me, the last man in Europe
