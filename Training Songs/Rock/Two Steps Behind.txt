Walk away, if you want to
It's okay, if you need to
You can run but you can never hide
From the shadow that's creepin' up beside you

There's a magic runnin' through your soul
But you can't have it all

Whatever you do
I'll be two steps behind you
Wherever you go
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind
Yea, yea

Take the time
To think about it
Just walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
Take a look around you'll see what you can find
Like the fire that's burnin' up inside me

Now there's a magic runnin' through your soul
But you can't have it all, no

Whatever you do
I'll be two steps behind you
Wherever you go
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind
Yea, yea
Oh, ho

Oh, there's a magic running through your soul
But you, you can't have it all

Whatever you do
I'll be two steps behind you
Wherever you go
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind
Yea baby, two steps behind
Oh sugar, two steps behind
