Gone cast away in time
Evil yours, now evil mine
So I robbed you blind, the voices
In my head could just a less than
Peaceful side

The endless possibilities
Controlling every fight

You can't break me, crushed the
Fears of yesterday
You can't change me, barriers our trust will fade

I've stood in the dark, been
Waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm
Trying to survive, I'm not ready to die

Damned, watch the masses fall
Burn it down, control 'em all
Make me crawl, to daddy's little
Girl to read the writings on the wall

While cast into the nothingness
The final curtain call

You can't break me, crushed the
Fears of yesterday
You can't change me, barriers our trust will fade.
I've stood in the dark, been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm
Trying to survive, I'm not ready to die

Through the madness we find
Loyalty is no match for power
Save your body or lie, left to rot in
Your darkest hour
Friends won't help you now as long as your mine

You can't break me, crushed the
Fears of yesterday
You can't change me, barriers our trust will fade.

I've stood in the dark, been
Waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm
Trying to survive

And I'll control the world one
Person at a time
As I damn the dead I'm trying to
Survive, I'm not ready to die

Oh!

I'm not ready to die
I'm not ready to die
I'm not ready to die
I'm not ready to die
