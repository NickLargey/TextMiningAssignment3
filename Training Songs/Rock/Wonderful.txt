Be nice, say thank you
And please once in a while
It's a beautiful world we live in
So give your brother a smile
Turn to a stranger
And give him a pat on the back
It's not that hard to
Maybe the friendship will last

Wonderful! (Wonderful)
It's so wonderful! (wonderful)
Wonderful! (Wonderful)
It's so wonderful!

Don't smoke, don't litter
Don't step on a beetle or ant
Always walk on the sidewalk
Never tread on the grass
Be kind, be courteous
Open the door for your mom
Help an old person across the street
Give the bum something to eat

Wonderful! (Wonderful)
It's so wonderful! (wonderful)
Wonderful! (Wonderful)
It's so wonderful!

Wonderful! (Wonderful)
It's so wonderful! (wonderful)
Wonderful! (Wonderful)
It's so wonderful!

Be nice, say thank you
