She was my surfer girl,
W surfed in the sun.
Where are you surfer girl
Now our fun is done?

Angry sea, took my love from me.
No surfing today )no surfing)

Way out beyond the reef
They said don't go.
The under tide's so deep,
Drag you down below.
Drag you down below.

Angry sea, took my love from me.
No surfing today (no surfing_

Just yesterday
We felt the ocean's spray
While we were surfing side by side.

I'll never see her again
She's too far away.
I'll never ride the stand
What else can I say?
What else can I say?

Angry sea, took my love from.
No surfing today (no surfing)
No surfing today (no surfing).
