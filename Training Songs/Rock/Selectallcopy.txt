Everyone's interchangeable and we're all just horror to the core
Open the door and look down the hillside, these views are all you can afford
I wanna feel a good-time rave, get off the street, come down again

It's oh so sad to be happy all the time

Something like what the plants do in the wind behind your glass
Open the door and roll out to recess it's strange to lose your class
I wanna get their protocol, get off your head, come down the wall

It's oh so sad to be happy all the time
It's oh so sad to be happy all the time

All the signs have gone dark now
But the meaning lingers on
The square sky hangs above us
Punctured by the sun

Oh come on, feel that good-time rave, get off the street, come down again

It's oh so sad to be happy all the time
It's oh so sad to be happy all the time
It's oh so sad to be happy all the time

To be happy
All the signs have gone dark now
