So blue
So lonesome too
But still true

Rosie,
Haunt me
Make me think of you

You're the one Rose that's left in my heart, dear
I love you, adore you, I do
Each night through Loveland we'll wander
Telling love's story anew

But then from blue skies a black cloud came rolling
Breaking my poor heart in two
But we ought not to part, I've said from the start
That you're the one Rose that's left in my heart

But we ought not to part, I've said from the start
That you're the one Rose that's left in my heart

You're the one Rose that's left in my heart, dear
I love you, adore you, I do
Each night through Loveland we'll wander
Telling love's story anew

But then from blue skies a black cloud came rolling
Breaking my poor heart in two
But we ought not to part, I've said from the start
That you're the one Rose that left in my heart
