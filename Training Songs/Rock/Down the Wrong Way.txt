I have become what I criticize, oh, oh, oh
The porn queen in my deck of lies, oh, oh, oh
Where was you?
In a caravan next to a Phantom ride
You’re left here with nothing, but something to hide.

I am back o Gasoline Alley
Where the smoke looks like a misty valley
And those dotted hills where pills come down the wrong way.

And you can serve yourself a king and your kingdom, too

Oh, oh, oh,
I was the man and the woman, and the who knows who
The good news,
That made her an offer that she can’t refuse
The truth I have nothing to lose.

I am back o Gasoline Alley
Where the smoke looks like a misty valley
And those dotted hills where pills come down the wrong way

You could say,
I did it the only way, your own way
But life goes on and it’s another day!

I am back o Gasoline Alley
Where the smoke looks like a misty valley
And those dotted hills where pills come down the wrong way
I am back o Gasoline Alley
Where the smoke looks like a misty valley
And those dotted hills where pills come down the wrong way
