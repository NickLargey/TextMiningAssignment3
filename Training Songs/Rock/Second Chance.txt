Summertime and everything is sweet
Walking barefoot to the circle k
On the burning street
Summertime and everything's on fire
This town is a drive-by for the
Whole inland empire

But down on the boulevard
They take it very hard

but it's alright, it's OK
I was going to move out of here anyway
Don't look at me, I've got nothing to say
Countdown to ecstasy

They are very rich, those boys uptown
They got so much now they wanna
Let it trickle down

La la la la la la

Summertime and everything is chill
Cops and gangsters cruising
Everybody's dressed to kill

Summertime and everything is cool
In the halfway house for sex offenders
By the school

They're laughing, they're dancing
They're calling everyone

Step right up, don't be shy
Buy a second chance
You need a favor?
I got a guy
Who can buy you a second chance...

But it's alright with me
If they lock you up
Then I can be free
Six of you
Half a dozen of me
So count down...
Alright, OK,
I was gonna move out of there anyway
Don't look at me
I've got nothing to say
As you countdown to ecstasy
Countdown to ecstasy
