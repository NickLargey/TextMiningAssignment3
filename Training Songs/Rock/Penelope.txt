Oh, Penelope
Are you filled with air?
Swallowed oxygen that make you float up?

Is it dropsy?
Where your lungs swell?
It's depressing me to see you struggle.

Oh, Penelope
Are you filled with air?
Swallowed oxygen that make you float up?

Is it dropsy?
Where your lungs swell?
It's depressing me to see you struggle.

I'm treading water with my oars
Glass galleons anchored, ocean's floor
I'm diving down with all my gear
In search of treasure, para me corazon

Take you to the forest.
Let you feel the raindrops falling down
Seeping through your red scales
Eliminate the faucet
Eliminate the need for water
Replace it with a safe shell

Don't want to see you floating upside down
On the top of the bowl when I come around to visit you

Don't want to see you floating upside down
No, girl
Need you there
Need you there
Need you there
Release that air

I'm treading water with my oars ( Release that air )
Glass galleons anchored, ocean's floor
I'm diving down with all my gear ( Release that air )
In search of treasure, para me corazon

Take you to the forest.
Let you feel the raindrops falling down
Seeping through your red scales
Eliminate the faucet
Eliminate the need for water
Replace it with a safe shell

If they summon the rains now
Are you gonna rise?

If they summon the rains now
Are you gonna rise?
