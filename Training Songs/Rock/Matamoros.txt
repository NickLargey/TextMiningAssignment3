Now that the blood has begun
I'd like to see how it's done
Behind my back 
Up to my face

Every conversation, every little crime
That you hide, I will find
And if you ever do change your mind-

And your cast off ways defined
I'll cut you down, I'll stitch you up

They say that fate is a card
And that the sun is a star

I think I'll have a cigar
I got a number for real
There ain't no way it can fail
I'm so excited you decided
To come over and beg
