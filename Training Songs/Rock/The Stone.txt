I've been pushing stones away far from these shores
I pretend that it's all OK
Til on the brink of what can't be adored

[Chorus]
We survive
Well we can change
So let it fade
Just let it go
We pretend so nothing does change
We're flowers never breaking through the stone.

I pretended and prayed it all away, searching for a place to hide
But I don't need afflicted memories to fade,
I just want to feel something real inside.

[Chorus]

I've been pushing stones away
Far from these shores
I..
Pretend that it's all OK
Til on the brink of what (can be endured)

[Chorus: x2]
