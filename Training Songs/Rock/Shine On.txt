Shine on, Shine on me 

All I know is now
I want you close to me
I can't really tell you
What the future's gonna be
Just for now, little lady
Shine on me

Lean on, lean so me
Something tells me
That's the way it's gotta be
I can't really show you
What she future's gonna be
Just for now, little lady
Lean on me *To fall in love with love
Was maybe just a fantasy
And promises we made
Could be insane
Don't think of tomorrow
Yesterday is past
And if we could
You know we could make it last

Drink on, Drink on me
Slip and slide
So I'll forget reality
I can't really say
If I'll come on and get so free
But just for now, little lady
Drink on me

Shine on, shine on me 
Shine on, shine on me 

Just for now, little lady
Shine on me
Just for now, little lady
Shine on me
