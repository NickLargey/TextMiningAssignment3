Hey
There she goes again
She took your heart and traded it in
For another fool you've been just like me
Now you know
She's got a way with men
Getting away with everything
No one just gotta take 'em in
Just like that oh

Didn't I tell you from the start
You're not the only one
She's been leaning on
Didn't I know you'd fall apart
I knew it all along
She's got a way with men

There you are
On your knees again
I've been there once you've been there twice
You fell in love and for her lies just like me
Now you know
She's got a way with men
I should've told you she'd knock you out
Now you're coming for if you find out
There's no answer

Didn't I tell you from the start
You're not the only one
She's been leaning on
Didn't I know you'd fall apart
I knew it all along
She's got a way with men

Hey
There you go again
With your wounded pride and dazzled mind
You follow truth she left behind
Oh man
Won't you understand
I tried to warn you
But you were blind
Once again you were out to find
That you'd been fooled and

Didn't I tell you from the start
You're not the only one
She's been leaning on
Didn't I know you'd fall apart
I knew it all along
She's got a way with men
