State of pain like mercury
Hearing pink illusions
Gorgeous at eighty five
Older at twenty three

I drink the water out of time
I said has anybody seen
The whirlpool floating in my mind
I said has anybody seen
This is the low that I could find

And I'm on solitary sand 
And I've been stepped on by a man
But I've stood taller than I am
In parentheses

Beauty queens are very shy
More than lash than meets your eye
So she jumps
Then wants to fly
Well it's too late now
I'm in denial

I'll get medieval on boy bands
I said is anybody listening?
The way life makes the nice girls fast
I said is anybody listening?
It isn't just unlucky chance

And I'm on solitary sand
And I've had bullshit from a man
But found exactly who I am

I'll never be the vision of a girl who can write poetry
I'll never be the little black dress we've seen on Natalie B.
I'll never be five foot ten, I'm barely five foot three
I'm on solitary sand
But in parentheses
