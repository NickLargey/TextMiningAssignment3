Every single day
I think of the times
When you were still mine
And I'm blue

Got to get away
Get you out of my mind
I'm caught up in time
And I'm blue

I don't miss all the fun that we had
You were always around me

Where are you now
I need you now
If you were around
It would be alright

Living on my own
I know I'm to blame
I'm locked in my chains
And you're free

Fallen like a stone
I'm down on the ground
I'm tied up and bound
And you're free

I don't miss all the fun that we had
You were always around me

Where are you now
I need you now
If you were around it would be alright

[Repeat: x2]
Where are you now
I need you now
If you were around it would be alright
