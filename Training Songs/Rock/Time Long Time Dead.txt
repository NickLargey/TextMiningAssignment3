When I came down to your riverside
And saw you standing there
Pocketful of Moonbeams
You had henna in your hair
And I never felt so lonely
Got the feeling I can't shed
It might seem like a premonition
But you're a long time dead

Gonna be a long time dead
Misery the devil's in my head

The seasons had already turned
The wind began to howl
A change of fortune is what I need
And there was little doubt
That they had never heard my testimony
Not a single word I said
Well the judge he whispered in my ear
Gonna be a long time dead

Gonna be a long time dead
Misery the devil's in my head

When I came down to your riverside
And saw you standing there
Pocketful of Moonbeams

And I never felt so lonely
Got the feeling I can't shed
It might seem like a premonition
But you're a long time dead

Gonna be a long time dead
Misery the devil's in my head
