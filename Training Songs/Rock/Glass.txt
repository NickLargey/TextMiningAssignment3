Hearts fail, young hearts fail
Anytime, pressurized
Overheat, overtired
Take it quick, take it neat
Clasp your hands, touch your feet
Take it quick, take it neat
Take it quick, take it neat

Hearts fail, young hearts fail
Anytime, wearing down
On the run, underground
Put your hand where it's safe
Take your hand where it's safe
Do it again
Do it again and again and again
Do it again and again and again
Do it again and again and again
Do it again and again and again

Anytime, that's your right
Told ya we should do it again
Overheat, overtired
Told you we should do it again
Told you we should do it again
Told you we should do it again
Anytime, pressurized
Told you we should do it again
Anytime, pressurized
I bet you wish you'd do it again
I bet you wish you'd do it again
I bet you wish you'd do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
