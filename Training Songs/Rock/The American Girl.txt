You can see her walking down on a city street,
The American girl
She's got the passion in her eyes
She's got the blush on her cheeks,
The American girl

I love to watch her move, her body sways
She whispers then she laughs
Did you hear what she says
I wanna know if she's talking 'bout me
Doing things her daddy can't see

The American girl, out in the dark
She's looking for love, oh oh
The American girl, she breaks hearts
But that's not enough
She's such a mystery to me

Love is full of intrigue
And full of Bogart mystique, the American girl
She's got the promise in the night
The romance in the back seat, the American girl

I love to watch her move, her body sways
She whispers then she laughs
Did you hear what she says
I wanna know if she's talking 'bout me
Doing things her daddy can't see

The American girl, out in the dark
She's looking for love, oh oh
The American girl, she breaks hearts
But that's not enough
She's such a mystery to me

And she stares at herself
In the harsh white light
And she draws in her cheeks
Just like the model
So unsure of herself in the big wide world
The American girl

The American girl, out in the dark
She's looking for love, oh oh
The American girl, she breaks hearts
But that's not enough
She's such a mystery to me

The American girl, out in the dark
She's looking for love, oh oh
The American girl, she breaks hearts
But that's not enough

The American girl, out in the dark
She's looking for love, oh oh
The American girl, she breaks hearts
