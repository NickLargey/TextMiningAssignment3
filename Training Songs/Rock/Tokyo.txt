I am Tokyo
I am here
I am blazing lights
On your street.

I'm an upstart
Bound to cross you
I'm the hypocrite
By your side

She won't forget
And I won't forget

And no one around could tell us apart
Cause we want out something
And where something heart

I am Tokyo
I am here
I am neon signs
On your street

I'm an army
Of winter vines
Marching over your countryside

And she won't forget
And I won't forget

And no one around could tell us apart
Cause we ruined something
And where something heart.

There's never enough time
Only, only
Glove off, something bridge.

Pin prick to the heart
Can it go
I meant every spark

And no one around could tell us apart
Cause we ruined something
And where something heart.

We're burning through town
Like there's nothing to lose
Cause we something
Something by heart... oh!
