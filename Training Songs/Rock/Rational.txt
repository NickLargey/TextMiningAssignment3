Today I tried like hell to clear my head of troubled times
But I couldn't stop the desperation fighting for my life
Never held illusions, never fallen on pretense
While I worried how to make the rent, they put a bullet in your head
Saro-wiwa, when will this struggle end?
Losing faith in my convictions and the words that I have read
Saro-wiwa, each day so many lies
Conscience traded on the market while the poor are left to die
Today my courage failing as the bills replace the lines
That used to give me so much hope for stories to survive
Today I felt like dying as I read those lines again
Apocalypse or jubilee, I just want to see the end
Zapatista, they tried to tell us that
The future holds out no more promises and history's reached the end
Zapatista, when will this struggle end?
Losing faith in my convictions while I watch you lose your land
