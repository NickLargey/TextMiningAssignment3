Went down to a second hand store
To buy some clothes like I used to wear before
Curly haired sally says, "She likes me a little better this way"

And everything I wish for I know I could
Only if everything I could I didn't wish for
It's a good day in the U.S.A., stripped down to your uncle long Johns
But no thanks, I'm good here in my magenta radio
Here in my magenta radio

Can I say something just a little more
I bet you, we could talk into the morning honey
I bet you we never see the morning
Without a hornet buzzing around our door

'Cause every time I look in your mirror, I see smoke from your gun
We both got itchy triggers and we wear them for fun
And we got two stories to tell and one of them must be wrong
But no thanks, I'm good here in my magenta radio

Hold me my lady, 'cause we all love even when we try
Hold me my lady, 'cause we all love even when we try
Hold me my lady, 'cause we all love even when we try
Hold me my lady, 'cause we all love even when we try

And we don't know our name, when we try
But we don't know our name

I see us kissing the earth, lovers of our way to be
Trying on shoes that don't really fit our feet
All in a dream we got burnt, all in a dream we got hurt
But we try and we try and we try and we

Hold me my lady, 'cause we all love even when we try
Hold me my lady, 'cause we all love even when we try
We don't know our name, yes we try, we don't know our name

Hold me my lady, 'cause we all love even when we try
'Cause we all love even when we try
Hold me my lady, 'cause we all love even when we try
