Sitting in her class
Sophisticated, anti-social brat
She never speaks a word
That's why she's sitting in the back
No one knows her name
I never knew that she existed

Then one tragic day she came to school and went ballistic
With an ak in her right hand
She shot the cheerleading squad and ran
They're all dead, they're all dead

She's alone in her class
There's no one left for her to blast
She's always kicking ass
Masochistic, gothic, dressed in black
No knows her name
I never knew she was sadistic

On April 28th, she came to school and went ballistic
With a rifle in her left hand
She blew away the football team and ran
They're all dead, they're all dead

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
She's a bitch, she hates everyone
She's one of those anti-girls
Pessimistic and cynical
She's a victim of this lonely world, yeah

I know she hates me
She's a little insane
And she's crazy
She's kookie, ookie, dookie
They're all dead, they're all dead

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
