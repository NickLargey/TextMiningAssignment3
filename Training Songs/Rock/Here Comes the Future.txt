Keep telling myself that it don't have to be this way 
Yeah, I'm talking about life and everything that we do today 
I'm not falling for the same old lies that I did before 
I'm just telling you now so you know why I'm out that door 

Here comes the future 
I hope that you can, I hope that you can work it out 
Here comes the future 
I hope that you can work it out 

Don't want to do nothing that I did before
Deep down in my heart I know what I'm down here for 
I'm in heaven when you smile and when we feel this way
Keep telling myself that I'm just going to live for today

'Cause' here comes the future
I hope that you can, I hope that you can work it out 
Here comes the future
I hope that you can work it out
Mmm work it out, yeah

I keep telling myself that it's not going to be the same
Keep telling myself that it's not going to be the same, love
Keep telling myself that it don't have to be the same
Keep telling myself we can work it out

Like we did before
You got to give me some loving so I just don't want no more
I can't help myself when I know that I can feel this way
I been feeling very on so I just kinda wanted to say
That here comes the future

You and me together equals so much possibility
Really see that we can make it through the hard times
Where we draw lines, and we can't find the feeling that we share
That brought us there to the place that we grow
All the future has to show, and what I wanna know 
Is that we can work it out, learn what its all about
Bring the sun through the clouds and make each other smile
We can make it happen
Tapping into the future 

We can make it happen 
Just you wait and see 
We can make it happen 
We can work it out 

We can make it happen 
Just you wait and see 
We can make it happen 
We can work it out 

Here comes the future 
I hope that you can, I hope that you can work it out
Here comes the future
I hope that you can work it out
Here comes the future 
I hope that you can, I hope that you can work it out
Here comes the future
I hope that you can work it
Work it out

Many times I've been this way
Many times I've been lonely
Many times I've been hurting inside
When I feel this way
Don't you know that you can work it
Work it out
