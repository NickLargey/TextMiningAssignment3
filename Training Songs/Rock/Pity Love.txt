My heart is everywhere
Splitting out like thunder
Everybody
Everybody's cheating on each other

Oh, I was out for what you've never shown
Just 'cause I expect it doesn't make it so
Ain't too proud for kneeling
My pity, pity love
Almost stronger than the real thing

You said I was too nice
Thinking you could take it
Leaving in a huff
Wishing time was more spacious
Oh, you can try to keep the outside out
But I love you more than you'll allow
I have not, nor will be
I offer pity love
Sometimes so strong, you fear me

My mind was everywhere
And my worry came too
Mistake my pity love
For the kind that needs you
Collecting all the pieces that I found
I oughta take you right back to the pound
I wish you'd not have me
Defective to the point
That always left your boyfriends laughing
