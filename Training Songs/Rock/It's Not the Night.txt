It's not the night
For foolin'
It's not the night
For crazy eyes

I get the feelin'
You want to stay
I get the feelin'
You're givin' it all away

But I know
I know you take it well
And for you
For you I always fell

It's not the night
(It's not the night)
For, for sweet revenge
It's not the night
(It's not the night)
To spend

The time is right
To take it out
The time is right to tango

Got a feelin'
You're runnin' out
Before your last fandango

It's not the night
(It's not the night)
For sweet, sweet revenge
It's not the night
(It's not the night)
To spend

It's not the night 
For sticky boots ?
It's not the night 
For tango

I get the feelin'
You're the spark
That's dancin' in the dark

I get the feelin'
You're the one
A rushin' on the run

It's not the night
(It's not the night)
For sweet revenge
It's not the night
(It's not the night)
To spend

It's not the night
(It's not the night)
You're lookin' for sweet, sweet revenge
It's not the night
(It's not the night)
Night to end

It's not the night
