I know nothing seems to excite you anymore
I know it feels like you've got nothing to look forward to
But it's OK - everybody feels like that sometimes
It's just a phase we're going through, that's all

Put your coat on - we're going out
Put off your trip to America - we're going out
Put off your trip to work or wherever - we're going out
Hey hey!

I know how you feel about me
And it's true you can still make me happy

Everybody's got something they're trying to get over
And sometimes it shows through
Everybody's got something they've had to live through
And sometimes for me it's you

Put your coat on - we're going out
I know there's nothing to celebrate - we're going out
Forget the money, we'll manage whatever
We're going out
Hey hey!

I know how I feel about you
It's true - I've taken you for granted

Sometimes I feel I've seen everything
And sometimes I'm just bored
But everybody feels like that sometimes
We've just spent too long indoors

Put your coat on - we're going out
Put off your trip to America - we're going out
Put off your trip to work or wherever - we're going out
Hey hey!
