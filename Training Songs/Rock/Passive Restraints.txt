My father was Black, my mother was Decker
Believe me my friend, it doesn't get any better
Than rack and pinion reasoning, add a little seasoning
Cook at ninety eight point six degrees
Let me be the bull, and you be the pen
Such an easy way to glorify sin
If I am a horse, you're a Venus in spurs
Everything I have is yours, so take it
I come fully loaded with an option to buy
I've got a stick shift disposition and a four wheel mind
I'll give you endless mileage and unlimited speed
Total satisfaction absolutely guaranteed
Turbo boost libido and passive restraints
And as of yet I haven't heard even a single complaint
I've got the tools of the trade and a fuel injected heart
Efficiency is beautiful, efficiency is art
