I pick her up outside the station
(Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh)
She's telling me about her spring vacation
(Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh)
She's not leaving much to the imagination
(Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh)
She's giving me way too much information
(Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh)

Maureen
You don't know what you do to me
I know you won't be true to me
The least that you can do for me
Is keep it to yourself
I'm so sorry, I don't mean to shout
It's just that I can do without
The details of your days and nights and your thoughts and dreams
Maureen, Maureen, Maureen, Maureen, Maureen

D-do you know what I mean?
D-do you know what I mean?
D-do you know what I mean?

She calls me up at ten past midnight
(Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh)
'Cause she and some guy just had some big fight
(Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh)
And I say, "Well, maybe he's just not all that bright"
(Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh)
She tells me it's not his brain that she likes
(Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh)

M-M-M-M-M-Maureen
You don't know what you do to me
I know you won't be true to me
The least that you can do for me
Is keep it to yourself
I'm so sorry, I don't mean to shout
But really, I can do without
The details of your days and nights and your thoughts and dreams
Maureen, Maureen, Maureen, Maureen

I know you think I'm just a friend
But can we please just put an end
To all the graphic imagery that you insist on feeding me?
I can't accept I'm not the one
Who's getting to have all the fun
And maybe that's what friends are for
But I just can't take it anymore

M-M-M-M-M-Maureen
You don't know what you do to me
I know you won't be true to me
The least that you can do for me
Is keep it to yourself
I'm so sorry, I don't mean to shout
But really, I can do without
The details of your days and nights and your thoughts and dreams
Can you keep it light?
Can you keep it clean?
Maureen, Maureen, Maureen, Maureen, Maureen
