Ooh Wup
Ooh Wup

Stand beside the mirror
Looking at her brand new face
She don't hear the phone call
Head is in another place
She thinks she likes to party
And you know she will
Night is just a mirror
And she sees you standing still

Oh she's gonna break your heart
And you know it's true
Cause she's telling you
Right from the very start
And you know it's true
Cause she's telling you
Gonna get that jive
(Ooh Wup)Get that jive
Gonna get that jive
(Ooh Wup)Get that jive
Gonna get that jive
(Ooh Wup)Get 

Standing by the jukebox
Thinking bout the boys again
Think you gotta pay boy
Cause she's out on the streets again

Oh she's gonna break your heart
And you know it's true
Cause she's telling you
Right from the very start
And you know it's true
Cause she's telling you
Gonna get that jive
(Ooh Wup)Get that jive
Gonna get that jive
(Ooh Wup)Get that jive
Gonna get that jive
(Ooh Wup)Get that jive 
Gonna get that jive
(Ooh Wup)Get that jive 

Oh she's gonna break your heart
And you know it's true
Cause she's telling you
Right from the very start
And you know it's true
Cause she's telling you
Gonna get that jive
(Ooh Wup)Get that jive
Gonna get that jive
(Ooh Wup)Get that jive

(Ooh Wup)Get that jive
(Ooh Wup)Get that jive
