Baby do you know who I think you are?
You are a dream, you are a star
So let it out, bringing home a scene
And show the world exactly what you mean

Baby strut
Let me see you walk, strut
Let your body talk, strut
Show me how you work, strut

When you lay it down, how you hurt me so
No need to stop, baby go, go, go
You are a freak of nature by the way you move
Just be yourself, you got nothing to prove

Baby strut
Let me see you walk, strut
Let your body talk, strut
Show me how you work
This is a chance for you to go berserk baby

Strut, strut, strut, strut

When you feel the need, the need to express
Whether it be pain or happiness
Take it to the street, cause it is your stage
Just be yourself, and bust out of your cage

Baby strut
Let me see you walk, strut
Let your body talk, strut
Let me see you work, strut, strut

Let me see you walk, strut
Let your body talk, strut
Let me see you work
This is your chance for you to go berserk
Baby strut

Let me see you walk, strut
Let your body talk, strut
Let me see you work
This is your chance for you to go berserk
Baby strut

Let me see you walk, strut
Let your body talk, strut
Let me see you work
This is your chance for you to go berserk
Baby strut
