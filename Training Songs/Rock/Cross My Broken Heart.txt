It`s a good day for a sad song 
'Cause the rain is fallin` and someone is saying "Good-bye" 
Close the door when you leave 
'Cause there`s a cold wind blowin' and it`s bringin' tears to my eyes 

After you go, I guess I'll never know where you've run 
Will you try to disguise how you're dyin inside? 
Well, then you'll be the only one 

Oh, I will get over you someday 
Though, I never loved you anyway 
And when you're gone my whole world won`t fall apart 
I swear, cross my broken heart 

Word gets 'round in this small talk town 
But I`ll stand my ground and I won`t even ask where you`ve gone to 
When they play a song 'bout a love gone wrong 
And you see me cryin', well, that don`t mean I miss you 

When I said I was crazy for you I was out of my mind 
When the smokes clears I`ll see it was not meant to be 
Yeah, I will be just fine 

Oh, I will get over you someday 
Though, I never loved you anyway 
And when you're gone my whole world won`t fall apart 
I swear, cross my broken heart 
 
By the second Tuesday of never I promise 
That I will be just fine 
Oh, yes, I will 

Oh, I will get over you someday 
Though, I never loved you anyway 
And when you`re gone my whole world won't fall apart 
I swear, cross my broken heart
