Wish That I Could Help You Let It Go
We Try So Hard To Hold On
Will Someday Set Us Free
To Somethin' We Believe
But We Always End Up Right Where We've Begun

All The Voices Screaming In Your Head
They Tell You What To Feel
Never Leaving You Alone
And It's Hard To Tell What's Right
And What They Think Is Real

From What Is Wrong, Oh
But In The Language Of The Heart
There's A Message Far Apart
From This World Of Our Illusions
And In The Silence You Will Find
And It's Where Your Journey Starts
That The Answers Come With Time

In The Language Of The Heart
Words Of Wisdom Falling To The Ground
None So Deaf As Those Who Hate
Can You See What You've Become
So Hurried And So Numb
Better Wake Up Now

It's Gettin' Kinda Late, Oh
There's A Message Far Apart
But In The Language Of The Heart
From This World Of Our Illusions
That The Answers Come With Time
And In The Silence You Will Find
As They Whisper In The Dark
Oh, In The Language Of The Heart
Ooh Oh

Ooh Ooh

Oooh Ooh
But In The Language Of The Heart
There's A Message Far Apart
From This World Of Our Illusions
And In The Silence You Will Find
And It's Where Your Journey Starts
That The Answers Come With Time

(Everythin's Gonna Come With Time)
And In The Language Of The Heart
From This World Of Our Illusions
There's A Message Far Apart
And In The Silence You Will Find
The Answers Come With Time
Oh, In The Language Of The Heart
As They Whisper In The Dark

Ooh Oh

That The Answers Come With Time
