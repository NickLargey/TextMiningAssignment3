The birth of a realization,
The rise of a high expectation,
Emerging successful, defiant,
Together the parts make a Giant.
See the world in the palm of his hand,
Striding steps that will cover the land.

He is coming,
Hear him coming,
Are you ready 
For his being?
See the Giant
Feel the Giant
Touch the Giant 
Hear the Giant.
The birth of a realization,
The rise of a high expectation,
Emerging successful, defiant,
Together the parts make a Giant.
