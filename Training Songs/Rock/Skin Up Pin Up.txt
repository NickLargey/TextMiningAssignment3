Sniffle this, sniff on this
My skin up pin up, oh yeah 
Monday to Friday
Nobody's seen ya, amphetamine-ah 
Oh, if I see you, would you stop and say hello? 
Oh, if I kiss you, would you run straight up my nose? 
Oh, Skeletina, say hello, ooh
We'll take you all on again 
We'll take you all on again 
We'll take you all on again 
We'll take you all on 
My all-consuming, self-inducing... 
Snivel this, put on this 
My skin up pin up, oh yeah 
Pick up a lady, tin foil in waiting
Stops me from aching 
Oh, if I see you, would you stop and say hello? 
Oh, if I kiss you, would you run straight up my nose? 
Oh, Skeletina, say hello-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo 
We'll take you all on again 
We'll take you all on again
We'll take you all on again 
We'll take you all on 
My all-consuming, self-inducing... 
He's my only passion, oh yeah 
He's my only passion, oh yeah 
We'll take you all on again 
We'll take you all on again 
We'll take you all on again 
We'll take you all on, yeah
