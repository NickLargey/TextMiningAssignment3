You named me 
Who am I 
That I should company with 
Something so divine 
Mercy waits 
Overjoyed 
Prospects of finding freeing 
Freeing me 

[Chorus]
Love is the thing this time I'm sure 
And I couldn't need you more now 
The way that you saw things were so pure 
Overjoyed 

You name me 
Entertain 
Thoughts of peace 
Can overcome anything 
Mirror spin 
Wicked tales 
Here lies reflections of 
Deceptions of 

[Chorus]

Missing the me from you, 
You gave to me 
(Gave to me) 
Don't like the one 
I have created today 
Crossing nameless 
From the one I've earned 
To be the one, the one you gave to me 

You name me, 
Name me 
Finding freeing me 

[Chorus: x2] 

Overjoyed 
Overjoyed
