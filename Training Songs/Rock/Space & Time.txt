I hope my body gets better
Do I mean my body or my mind?
Hate the word "forever"
Hate the word "change", I just need time
Give me time

Space and time
Ah, take me out to the future 
Just so I can look back into the past

I hope my body gets better
Do I mean my body or my mind?
Hate the word "forever"
Hate the word "change", I just need time
Give me time

Space and time
Oh, God, I was strange now, weren't I?
I hope that when I look back I will laugh

I feel I'm losing control of my body
Control of my moods and my decisions
And my money
I don't wanna come undone
And, I'm set to self-destruct

I hope my body gets better
Do I mean my body or my mind?
Hate the word forever
Hate the word change, I just need time
Give me time

Space and time
