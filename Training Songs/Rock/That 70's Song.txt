Hangin' out
Down the street
The same old thing
We did last week

Not a thing to do
But talk to you
Not a thing to do
Out in the street, oh yeah

Mom and dad
They live upstairs
The music's loud
So we don't care

I wish we had
A number so bad
Oh yea

Under street lights
Out past midnight   
We're all alright
We're all alright
Yea! Ow

I still recall
And drive on down
Pick you up
And we'll drive around

Not a thing to do
But talk to you
Not a thing to do
Oh yea!

Under street lights
Out past midnight    
We're all alright
We're all alright
Yea!
(Oh yea, oh yea)

(Hello Wisconsin!)
