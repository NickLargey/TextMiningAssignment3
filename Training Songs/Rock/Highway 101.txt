Take a drive baby up the coast, yeah Highway 101
I'll pass Ventura Santa Barbara too, Just as fast as my motor runs
Gotta pocket full of memories, some are happy and some are sad
Gotta girl standing by my side, through the good times and the bad

[Chorus]
Listen to the boulevard, listen to the falling rain
I believe in love now, with all of its joys and pains

Sick boy, sick girl, looking nice dressed up on a Saturday night
Take a walk downtown for awhile and chase the pale moonlight
I can still hear the mission bells and the train rollin' through your town
Gonna leave this world behind, we're Southern California bound

Listen to the boulevard, listen to the falling rain
I believe in love now, with all of its joys and pains
Follow the palm trees under the California sun
I believe in love now, I believe in love again

Listen to the boulevard, listen to the falling rain
I believe in love now, with all of its joys and pains
Follow the palm trees under the California sun
I believe in love now, I believe in love again
