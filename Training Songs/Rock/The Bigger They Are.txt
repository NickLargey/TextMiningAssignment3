Sunday morning and it's 10 am, the last day of the weekend again
Mow the lawn and read the papers, the afternoon game will be on the set
Sunday breakfast and an hour at church, I think I'll have a beer with the boys at lunch
Colourful shirts and colourful trousers, just the shot for a spot on the set
They don't worry about tomorrow, today's what counts and they're here today

Well I don't give a damn anyway, new gadgets and fashions of distraction
You know it was different in my day, quiet evenings at home with the family
The bigger they are the bigger they get.

Read the story now lots of adventure, follow the plot and it will take you away
Flashy fights and royal blue murder, anything to take your mind of today
I think I understand just what Sam said, when he said he's gonna live inside his head
Well, interesting facts and fascinating figures, the science of tomorrow is the pulp of today
And I don't find it all so amazing, loud and noisy and totally useless

Well I don't give a damn anyway, new gadgets and fashions of distraction
You know it was different in my day, quiet evenings at home with the family
The bigger they are the bigger they get.

Well I don't give a damn anyway, new gadgets and fashions of distraction
You know it was different in my day, quiet evenings at home with the family
The bigger they are the bigger they get.
