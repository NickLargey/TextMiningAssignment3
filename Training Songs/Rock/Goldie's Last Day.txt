Puppy love puppy love
Yes, she gave all she had
Not like a brother or sister
More like a Mom or a Dad

We never asked her, never gave her a choice
We just barked out commands
Sit, Stay, Don't beg
Stop licking my hands
Those days are gone now
I wish Goldie could come out and play

[Chorus]
Goldie's last day, Goldie's last day
If a picture paints a thousand words
There's nothing left to say
Wish you could have been there for Goldie's last day

She was eleven to you and me
What's that in dog years?
Seventy-seven that's more than eleven
She outlived her peers
The talk around town is that Goldie passed away

[Chorus]

We are confident that this incident was not an accident
(As per our investigation)
We are confident that this incident was not an accident
We are confident that this incident was not an accident
(She never missed a vaccination)
This incident was not an accident

[Chorus]
