I never wanted to settle down
Just a kid on a highway to nowhere
Wishin' for my girl to be real
She would satisfy my soul

10 000 lovers in one
10 000 lovers in one

Seems like i've known her a thousand
Years
We'we been together all through our
Lives she knows the way love should be
A fire burnin endlessly

10 000 lovers in one
10 000 lovers in one
She's like
10 000 lovers in one

Solo

10 000 lovers in one
10 000 lovers in one

10 000 lovers
10 000 lovers
10 000 lovers in one
