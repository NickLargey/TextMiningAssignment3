What's Inside A Girl? 

Whoa...there's some things baby I just can't swallow.
Mama told me that girls are hollow.
Uh-uh...What's inside a girl?
Somethin's tellin' me there's a whole nuther world.
Ya gotta pointy bra...ten inch waist.
Long black stalkings all over the place.
Boots...buckles...belts outside.
Whatcha got in there yer tryin' a-hide?
Hmmm?
What's inside a girl?
Ain't no hotter question in a so-called civilized world.
Can't see it by satellite baby that's cheatin'.
The President's callin' an emergency meetin'.
The King of Saim sent a telegram sayin' "Wop bop a loop a lop a lop boom bam!" Wooee...What's inside a girl?
Somethin's tellin' me there's a whole nuther world.
Whatcha got...whatcha got...Whatcha got in the pot?
Whatcha got...whatcha got...Whatcha got in the pot?
In the bottom of your bottomless bodypit.
You got somethin' and I gotta get it.
Come onnn...What's inside a girl?
Like da itty bitty baby takes apart his toys.
I'm gonna find what's rilin' up the boys.
Sugar and spice is just a bluff.
You can tell me baby...what is that stuff?! Come on...What's inside a girl?
That wavy gravy got my head in a whirl.
