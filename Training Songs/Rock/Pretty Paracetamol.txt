Pischer-z Pretty Paracetamol Lyrics 
Pretty paracetamol you soothe my aching brow,
I need you when my heard is spinning round,
I look into the looking glass but none of them is me,
It takes at least an hour to put me down,
First impressions often lie,
They often fool the naked eye.
I hold you gently on my tongue and then you drift away,
It's hard to read the writing on the label,
I force my eyes out sideways but I can't resist the strain,
And it don't help me, no it don't help me,
First impressions often lie,
They often fool the naked eye.
I think I recognize a friendly face I've seen before,
I'm floating far too quickly to be sure,
(don't you despair)
Take this inner web of twisted memories and lies,
(There's no one there)
I'm fighting for a reason to go on.
Pretty paracetamol you soothe my aching brow,
I need you when my heard is spinning round,
I multiply myself by two in the mirror on the wall,
And it don't help me, no it don't help me,
First impressions often lie,
They often fool the naked eye.
I think I've lost control, I think I've lost control,
I think I've lost control, I think I've lost control...
