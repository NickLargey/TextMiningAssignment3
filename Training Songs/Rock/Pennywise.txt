clear your mind hide your fear 
don't look around 
don't turn around 
pennywise is here 
evil lurks in his eyes 
the clown they call pennywise 
he's a monster 
he's not human 
he's more than just a figment of your imagination 
you can't run can't hide 
there's no way to escape pennywise 
he'll creep inside your soul at night 
and torment nice and slow 
don't turn around or look around 
pennywise will know 
he'll make you wish that you were dead 
and make it hard to cope 
he'll make you wish that you were dead 
and hanging by a rope
