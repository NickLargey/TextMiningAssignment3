I went down to the doctor
It was just the other day
My head was hangin' down
'Cause I'd been up for days dancin', dancin'

Well, he wrote me a prescription
You will find at any store
He said that "You're an idiot
Whose back out on the floor dancin', dancin"

Don't you feel like dancin'?
Don't you feel like shakin'?
Don't you feel like movin'
Till your back is breakin'?

Don't you feel like rockin'?
Don't you feel like rollin'?
Don't you feel like dancin'
Dancin' all night long?

I went 'round to see my sister
'Cause my head was hangin' low
She asked me what was shakin'
I said, "Sister, don't you know
I've been dancin', dancin'"

She said "Willie, what's your problem
Can you tell me what's the score?"
I said, "I'd feel alright
Once I get out there on the floor dancin', dancin'"

Don't you feel like dancin'?
Don't you feel like shakin'?
Don't you feel like movin'
Till your back is breakin'?

Don't you feel like rockin'?
Don't you feel like rollin'?
Don't you feel like dancin'
Dancin' all night long?

Don't you feel like dancin'?
Don't you feel like shakin'?
Don't you feel like movin'
Till your back is breakin'?

And don't you feel like rockin'?
Don't you feel like rollin'?
And don't you feel like dancin'
Dancin' all night long?

Don't you feel like dancin'?
Don't you feel like shakin'?
Don't you feel like movin'
Till your back is breakin'?

Don't you feel like dancin'?
Don't you feel like shakin'?
Don't you feel like movin'
Till your back is breakin'?
