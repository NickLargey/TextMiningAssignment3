Fortunate woman, you know I wanted to fly, make it by myself alone.
Now I'm lookin' for a man with a silver dollar shoeshine,
I gotta get a way back home.

Listen to me, woman, now can't you hear me callin', I've got a lot of love to do.
Don't you know I'm gonna cry some, I know I'm gonna die some,
I gotta get back to you.

[Chorus]
Gotta get back, gotta get back, gotta get, gotta get back to you.
Gotta get back, gotta get back, gotta get, gotta get back to you.

Fortunate woman, the monkey man's dead and the junky didn't get too far.
But I'm singin' my song, 'cause I got my head, and my bed, and my red guitar.
I'm a-rollin' down the highway, now don't you get in my way,
Mister, I'm a comin' through.
Well, I know I'm gonna cry some, you know I'm gonna die some,
I gotta get back to you.

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
