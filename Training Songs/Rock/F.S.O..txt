He beats you black and blue
He loves you black and blue
He leaves you black and blue
He's just a criminal

You think you're getting through
You think he still loves you
You think it's all worth it
He's just a criminal

You need help but you can't get nothing
He needs help but he's just too stubborn
So when they come with the bag for your body
So sad, too bad, everybody's sorry

You keep your mouth closed fade and die
Take control of your life and survive
I tell you know you've got to get out
You've got to get out because you're better off without

You deserve better than that
