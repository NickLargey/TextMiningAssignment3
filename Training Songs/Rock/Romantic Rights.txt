Your romantic rights are all that you got
Push 'em down son it's more than just lip.
C'mon girls I know you know what you want
C'mon, c'mon now and give 'em all (shhhhh)
You're beating walls now you just won't quit
You play with shapes but they just won't fit.
I know you love me you don't know what you like
You're watching TV I stay up all night.

I don't need you, I want you 
I don't need you, I want you 

South carolina kid is heating things up
His wounds are bleeding and we're filling the cup.
This game will save us if we don't die young
C'mon, c'mon girl and have some fun.
Come here baby I love your company
We could do it and start a family.
She was living alone unhappily

We could do it, it's right romantically.
We could do it, it's right romantically.
We could do it, it's right romantically.

I don't need you, I want you
I don't need you, I want you

I don't need you, I want you 
I don't need you, I want you 
I don't need you, I want you 
I don't need you, I want you
