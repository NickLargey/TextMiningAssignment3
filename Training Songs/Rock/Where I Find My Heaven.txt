Hey Monday mornin' is only for the brave
And the blood flows through my heart and leaves like sand as I shave

And the wind outside, and the taxi's ready
And the lonesome hum that comes from my desk lamp is

Where I find my heaven
Is where I find my heaven
Is where I find my heaven
Heaven

But Sunday mornin' is only for the blessed
And the grace keeps flowing just as long as we can stay undressed

And a whispered word in my spirit lies
And the sacred moments of sillyness are

Where I find my heaven
Where I find my heaven
Where I find my heaven
Heaven

It's where I find my heaven
It's where I find my heaven
Where I find my heaven
It's where I find my heaven
Where I find my heaven
Where I find my heaven
Heaven
