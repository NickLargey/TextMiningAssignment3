Well the devil's nipping at your heels and this time it's for real
A lonely hunger starts to gnaw as you wish away the pain
Of another desperate dead end day forever filled with sadness
To forget about the pain you take your bottle, drink your grave

[Chorus] 
Singing Hail, Hail, the Gangs All Here.
Leave your worries at the door boy, they're not going anywhere
Hail, hail the gang's all here
When the going gets tough, I know my friends will still be there
Well you're walking down the road and the wind is in your face
You're down and out and the unemployment line's a mile long
The money in your pocket may not get you through the day
But cheer up son I know a place where mugs like us belong

[Chorus]

Pick your heart up off the ground though I'm sure it weights a ton
You're no better or no worse than any mothers son
Though you're up against all odds and you're backed against the wall
You recall the cheer, "The Gang's All Here" and shout!

[Chorus]
