Mystic harmony, won't you weave a magic spell
To bring her back to me? Strike a cord within her heart
Bewitch her with your mystic harmony
Just for me

Hey, mystic harmony, fill her mind with magic music
Play our song for me, keep that feeling, never lose it
Touch her with your mystic harmony
Just for me

Hey, I'm holding your hand, it's just like I planned
I want you to know
I love you
Hey, you're holding me tight, a mystical night
And now you must know
That I love you

Hey, mystic harmony, now you've brought us close together
Play your symphony, keep her by my side forever
Hold us with your mystic harmony
Constantly

Hey, I'm holding your hand, it's just like I planned
I want you to know
I love you
Hey, you're holding me tight, a mystical night
And now you must know
I love you

Hey, I'm holding your hand, it's just like I planned
I want you to know
I love you
Hey, you're holding me tight, a mystical night
And now you must know
I love you

Hey, I'm holding your hand, it's just like I planned
I want you to know
I love you
