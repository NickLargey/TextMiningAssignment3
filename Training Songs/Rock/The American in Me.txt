I need me a destination 
I ain't the kinda cat's gon' just jump in his car an' drive 
 
I'm usin' my transportation
So then when am I going to arrive? 

[Chorus:]
And I guess it's just 
The American in me
And I guess it's just 
The way I'm apt to be
And I guess it's just 

They're stoppin' me out on the freeway
'n they ask of me what I do and where I'm bound 
I used to get a lot more leeway
Hey, well, now I get a lot more down 

Repeat[Chorus:]
The off ramp backed up miles today
And the carbon fumes
Were drifting towards the sky
The sky began to cry
And the thunder booms

An' I'm back once again on the car lot
An' I ain't even paid for that thing I drove up in yet 
Well, I might make a trade an' I might not
But I know I'll remain in debt 

Repeat [Chorus:]
Harmonica solo...
Repeat [Chorus:]
