Starting now the wait is over 
As long as you jump the ride 
'cause I won't highway-walk forever 
As long as you jump the ride 

As long as you follow me 
This is what I do, like I do 
I've been on the ride before 
It never stops at all 
It never stops at all 

You'll start your engines like a virgin 
As long as you jump the ride 
We'll cut the whip and lose the anchor 
As long as you jump the ride 

As long as you follow me 
This is what I do, like I do 
I've been on the ride before 
It never stops at all 
It never stops at all 

As long as you follow me 
This is what I do, like I do 
I've been on the ride before 
It never stops at all 
It never stops at all
