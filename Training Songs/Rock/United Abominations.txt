Within striking distance from Ground Zero sits a smoldering international cauldron
The United "Abominations" as it were
Forged to prevent wars and froze in the face of disaster
And stood silent while terrorization took hostage of the world

In a mire of hypocrisy, the UN ignored sex crimes by its blue helmets
And enables terrorism, so, in the end, it's failed
And the UN is where our so-called friends get to stab us in the back
And we pay twenty-two percent of their tab to host our enemies here at home

Ambassadors from countries otherwise known as a catastrophe
Enjoy diplomatic immunity living in Manhattan 
While their children are turned into prostitutes
It's a complete and utter disgrace, a blot on the face of humanity
And they get away with it

Poverty in their kitchens
Held hostage by oil-for-food
Yet their own plates are full of the fat of their lands
There's no blood on their hands, right Ko-Jo?
They promised to tell the truth
Without leaving a fingerprint
They will lose the U.N. one way or another
The victim, I fear, will be us, sisters and brothers

The U.N. is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now; the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done
It's payback time at the United Abominations

A grave and gathering danger
The decision to attack
Based on secret intelligence; it'll take years
I fear to undo the failings in Iraq
You may bury the bodies
But you can't bury the crimes 
Only fools stand up and really lay down their arms
No, not me - not when death lasts forever

The U.N. is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now; the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done
It's payback time...

The U.N. is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now; the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
The U.N. is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now; the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done
It's payback time at the United Abominations
