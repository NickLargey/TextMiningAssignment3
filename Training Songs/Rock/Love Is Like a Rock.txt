Love is Like a Rock
You can't depend on your teacher
You can't depend on your preacher
You can't depend on politicians
You can't depend on superstitions

[Chorus]
Love can rock you
Never stop you
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah,
Love is like a rock

You can't rely on Mother Nature
You can't rely on your paychecks
You can't depend on your doctor
You can't depend on your lawyer

[Chorus: x2]
