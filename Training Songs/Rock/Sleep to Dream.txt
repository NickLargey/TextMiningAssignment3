You have it all 
The ceiling cracks 
And you fly 
But I fall again 
Please say goodbye 
Take your love out of me 
And don't ask me why 
I'm not your friend 
Trying to stand 
But you bend me again 
What's up with that 
Takes more then this for me to take off my hat 

And I said it first
Between you and me 
I sleep to dream 
I sleep to dream 

And I said it first
Between you and me 
I sleep to dream 
I sleep to dream 

So you kissed me now 
This face doesn't seem so brave after all 
Please let me go 
I need to hear myself think 
I only hear the water flow 
I'm not your friend 
Trying to stand 
But you bend me again 
What's up with that 
Takes more then this for me 
To take off my hat 

And I said it first 
Between you and me 
I sleep to dream 
I sleep to dream 

And I said it first
Between you and me 
I sleep to dream 
I sleep to dream 

I said it first
Between you and me 
I sleep to dream 
I sleep to dream 

I'm not your friend 
Trying to stand 
But you bend me again 
What's up with that 
Takes more then this 
For me to take off my hat 
Takes more then this 
For me to take off my hat 
Takes more then this 
For me to take off my hat 

[Repeat x3]
And I said it first 
Between you and me 
I sleep to dream 
I sleep to dream 

And I said it first
Between you and me
