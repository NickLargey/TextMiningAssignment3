Moving   on   a    pale   moonlight
Staring  at  the   tail lights of the
Truck that  rips   the road apart
In front of me

I watch your right hand shifting gear
Wondering what I'm doing here
'Cause both our minds
Are occupied by memories

Like a forest in my eye
Are the pillars of the sky
As I picture you
And call it your perogative

Time and time again it seems
We're always somewhere in between
And that's the truth
It's in the way we live

Ray, ray, rain
If you feel the same
Give me a sign
We're running out of time

Spiders, snakes, and lizard heads
Tell the tale that we'll all be dead
And don't you know
In my fantasies

Fading on the tender neath
What we are is what we breathe
Insultingly
With your jealous hate

Ray, ray, rain
If you feel the same
Give me a sign
Give me a sign

Ray, ray, rain
So you feel the same
It's written in that
I can't wait another day

And no it's not okay
Explain yourself and say
Now no one ever said that life was fair
At six times in a row
The winner starts to go
Walking up and down the builder's square
Right down from the start
And right down from the heart
Finding words that no one thought were there

Ray, ray, rain
If you feel the same
Give me a sign
Give me a sign

Ray, ray, rain
So you feel the same
It's written in that
I can't wait another day

Moving on a pale moonlight
Staring at the tail lights of the
Truck that rips the road apart
In front of me

Ray, ray, rain, if  you feel the same
Give me a sign, we're running out of time
