My timing is off
She isn't ready for my love
It's all that I got
But it's a pretty big thing
That she should recognize
The truth between us cannot hide

She knows that it's real
But the situation doesn't fit
I know what I feel

And I know that this is really
Everything it's all about
And I don't have a single doubt

My timing is off
But sometimes that's how it all works
Believe it or not
We don't have a choice
In matters of the heart

Just gotta be brave enough
To love and let yourself be loved
My timing is off
And I'm not worried 'bout a thing

She knows that it's real
She couldn't throw it all away
For fear of happiness
This isn't like that other mess
