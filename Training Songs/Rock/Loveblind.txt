Have I told you 'bout the case
Of the man who had no face? (Sure I have)
His wife suspected something
That's why she brought me in
We arranged to meet one night
At a bar called Aphrodite's (On Second Street)
When I looked into her eyes
I quickly realised (Danger)
The price was right, the deal was struck
I don't think that she gave it a thought
 It was clear to see that the lady was love blind
 It was clear to see, it was clear that she was love blind
Out into the foggy night
Into the city's blurry light (I drove alone)
I wondered then what kind of place
Would make a man lose face
I pieced together clue by clue
Just what a faceless man would do (It wasn't hard)
Who would he love, where would he go?
Places faceless men would know (On Second Street)
I was close, I was near
But that woman just wouldn't hear
 It was clear to see that the lady was love blind
 It was clear to see, it was clear that she was love blind
 Love blind...
Next morning came, as mornings do
I had a shave that was close, too (A close shave)
In the mirror, in my space
There was a man without a face
I rang my client and I banged on her door
I told her it was me that we was lookin' for
 It was clear to see that the lady was love blind
 It was clear to see, it was clear that she was love blind
