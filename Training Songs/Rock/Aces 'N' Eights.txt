Lady luck, lady luck
You must have played your cards just right
I wouldn't be in the fix I'm in tonight
Queen of hearts, you stop my start
You drove me down, turned me around
Drove the stake to its mark.
Gothcha!

The ace of spades, the ace of spades
You play your hand until you fade
And the weather play loaded
Say you bring it back where you stay
Queen of hearts, you stop my start
You turned me around
Bring me down
Drove the stake to its mark.
Oh, ow!

One-eyed jack
Don't look back
Oh, I'll never sleep tomorrow
I caught the time
And asked them why my business hollow
Queen of hearts, you stop my start
You drove me down, turned me around
Drove the stake to its mark
Ha!

Lady luck, lady luck
You must have played your hand just right
I wouldn't be in the fix I'm in tonight
(I don't believe that)
Be in the fix I'm in tonight (my only)
I played my cards just right
I wouldn't be in the fix I'm in tonight.
