Ow
Oh yeah, get up
Ow (yeah)
Ow ow
Well, they say it's kinda frightnin'
How this younger generation swings
You know it's more than just some new sensation
Well, the kid is into losin' sleep
And he don't come home for half the week
You know it's more than just an aggravation

And the cradle will rock
Yes the cradle, cradle will rock
And I say rock on uh rock on

And when some local kid gets down
They try an' drum him outta town
They say, ya coulda least faked it boy, fake it, boy (oh stranger, boy)
At an early age he hits the street
Winds up tired with who he meets
An' he's unemployed (unemployed) ow

And the cradle will rock ow
And the cradle, the cradle will rock
An' I say rock on oh, say, rock on

Have you seen junior's grades? (oh)
