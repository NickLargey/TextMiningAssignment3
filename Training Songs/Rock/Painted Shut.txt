You are screaming at me
Don't get me started
Saying you're gonna leave
That's just retarded
Leaving me all alone
To throw the party
To celebrate your fate
You are departed

It seems as though
Your mouth is closed
It's painted shut
With guilt

No more screaming at me
Don't get me started
No more saying you'll leave
That's just retarded
No more leaving alone
To throw the party
I'll just celebrate fate
You are departed

It seems as though
Your mouth is closed
It's painted shut
With guilt

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

It seems as though
Your mouth is closed
It's painted shut
With guilt

It seems as though
Your mouth is closed
It's painted shut
With guilt
