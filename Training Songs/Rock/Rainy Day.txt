Another rainy day
Sunlight in your eyes
I sleep the day away
Without you by my side
I wanna save the world
I wanna save myself
But I'm covered over gray
Another rainy day

Raise my hand and wave goodbye
I tell myself I'll be alright
Another hour I'll be sky high
Doin my best to hold on tight
I close my eyes and come back down
Lose myself inside your smile
And stay there for awhile

Another rainy day
And all I have is time
I waste the day away
And watch the world go by
You wanna save the world
You wanna save yourself
But ya covered over gray
Another rainy day
