The very first time I saw your face
I knew you were the classic one
We danced and laughed and talked all night
But you had to leave out of town

But as I walked you home that night
The whispers then soon changed
And like a knife right through my heart
Sweet misery again

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name
Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

If I believe what I've been told
I'd only be around for a while
You love 'em and leave 'em for less than a song
But they still can't forget that smile

And once I'm safely home alone
I wish you could be here
I want so bad to be the one
To say exactly how I feel

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name
Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name
Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

I haven't got a thing to give
Except for what you see
Remember this, if all should fail
You'll always have a friend in me

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name
Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name
Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same
