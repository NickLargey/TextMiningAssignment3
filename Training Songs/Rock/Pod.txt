Cause it's the Pick!
Of Destiny child,
You know we will be rockin' cause it's fucking insane!

It's just the Pick!
Of Destiny child,
More precious than a diamond on a platinum chain!

In Venice Beach, there was a man named Kage
When he was buskin he was all the rage.
He met Jables and he taught him well,
All the techniques that were developed in hell.
Cock pushups and the power slide,
Gig simulation now there's nowhere to hide.
They formed a band they named Tenacious D,
And then they got the Pick of Destiny.

Cause it's the Pick!
Of Destiny child,
You know we will be rockin' cause it's fucking insane!

It's just the Pick!
Of Destiny child,
Our tasty grooves are better than a chicken chow mein!

Cause he who is sleazy,
Is easy to pleasy.
And she who is juicy,
Must be loosy-goosey.
And he who is groovy,
Will be in my movie,
So come on!

The wizard and the demon had a battle royale,
The demon almost killed him with an evil kapow,
But then he broke his tooth and thus the demon said "OW"

Cause it's the Pick!
Of Destiny child,
You know we will be rockin' cause it's fucking insane!

It's just the Pick!
Of Destiny child,
You know our movie's better than Citizen Kane!

Cause he who's a geezer,
Must live in my freezer.
And she who is starkey,
Is full of mularkey.
And he who is groovy,
Must be in my movie,
So come on!

Oh! Cause if you're a diva,
Then go to Geneva.
And if you're a crony,
Then suck on my bony.
And if you are groovy,
Then get in my movie!

It's called the Pick of Destiny!
The Pick of Destiny
