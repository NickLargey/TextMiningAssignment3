I came to tell you
How it all began
Nothing seems to work out right
I'm broken down again
So hold me now
Say it's not forever
(Forever)
'Cause maybe someday
In time

Well things will go my way, ohh
Things will go my way

I've pushed to get through
The crowds of twisted souls
Just to find I'm right back here
Doing what I'm told
So take my hand
Don't let me surrender
(Surrender)
'Cause maybe someday
Ya, in time

Things will go my way, ohh
Things will go my way, ohh
Things will go my way

For all the lies I've tasted
Looking for the truth
For all the dreams I'm chasing
What am I to do?
Everything's against me
The answer's are all wrong
Hoping that I'll find out
It was worth it all along

So hold me now
(So hold me now)
And Say it's not forever
(Say it's not forever)
'Cause I know someday
In time

Things will go my way, ohh
Things will go my way, ohh
Things will go my way

For all the lies I've tasted
(My way)
Lookin' for the truth
(My way)
For all the dreams I'm chasing
(My way)
What am I to do?
(My way)
Everything's against me
(My way)
The answers are all wrong
(My way)
I'm hoping that I'll find out
Things will go my way
Ah
Things will go my way
