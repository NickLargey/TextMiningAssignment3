Lookin' at you for all my answers
Bright blue eyes that go dark and empty
Now that you're gone there's a reason to get strong
And light has shown the truth
And we're all left here with a single fear
And it's all because of you

Take me
Take me to heaven
Watch me go bye-bye
To the sky
Take me
Take me to heaven
Watch me go bye-bye
To the sky
Yeah

Words in a book with burnt up pages
The meaning of which is lost to the ages

Take me
Take me to heaven
Watch me go bye-bye
To the sky
Take me
Take me to heaven
Watch me go bye-bye
To the sky
Yeah

Turn the pages that fade through the ages
A love of truth, not faith and faces
A love of truth, not faith and faces

Watch me go bye-bye
To the sky
Yeah
