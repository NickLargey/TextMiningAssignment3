I had a plan and it made God laugh
It didn't work, should've checked the math
I hit the wall 'cause I live too fast
I didn't know it could hurt that bad
I took the hope but there was none
I should've known that was so dumb

Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh

I was a dick when I was seventeen
I thought the world brought me everything
But who am I knew I'd never be
Is all the shit that happens in between

Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh

There's no going back
When life's a loaded gun, you 
Pull the trigger, trigger
There's no going back
The past is in the past
Thank God it doesn't last forever
There's no going back
F*ck that going back
There's no going back
F*ck that going back

Yesterday was another life
Turning left didn't turn out right
Stuck in hell when I was twenty five
You can't regret what you don't decide
I should have stayed, should have let go
Should've, could've means you'll never know

Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh

There's no going back
When life's a loaded gun, you 
Pull the trigger, trigger
There's no going back
The past is in the past
Thank God it doesn't last forever
There's no going back
F*ck that going back
There's no going back
F*ck that going back

The future I'm living now
Is not what I'd thought it'd be
The person I was before
Is nothing like me
The future I'm living now
Is the way that I want it to be
The minute I walk through the door
I slam it behind me

There's no going back
When life's a loaded gun, you 
Pull the trigger, trigger
There's no going back
The past is in the past
Thank God it doesn't last forever

There's no going back
F*ck that going back
There's no going back
F*ck that going back
