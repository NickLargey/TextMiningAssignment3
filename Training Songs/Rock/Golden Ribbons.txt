Listen to the people crying
Hoping for the day they'll be free
I don't have to tell you we're (they're) dieing
Just wake up, take a look, what do You see?
I see young men my own age in coffins
And mothers in tears for their sons
And sweethearts and wives
Alone with their memories
And golden ribbon's those fortunes of war
Thousands and thousands
Shall gather together
To seek and find the Way we all need
And the son will bring (backhanded glory) us together
Hallelujah
and rid ourselves of the pain we all see
We see young men our own age in coffins
And Mothers in tears for their sons
And Sweetheart's and wives
Alone with their memories
And golden ribbon's those fortunes of war
What does it to avail a man
To gain fortune
And lose his soul?
