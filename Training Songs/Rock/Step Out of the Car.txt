Step out of the car
Inner-city action
It's already won
It's already won

Charges bring a swarm
To rumors of corruption
It's already war
It's already war

And I'm looking for you
So surrender to me
In this storm
It's hard to see
There's a thin
line between
Love and hate
Love and hate

Step out of the car
Acts of desperation
Leave you in a mess
Leave you in a mess

Americana's glow
Is gone without a place to go
It's already war
It's already war

And I'm looking for you
So surrender to me
In this storm
It's hard to see
There's a thin
line between
Love and hate
Love and hate

Voices winning me instead
Undercover in my head
Voices winning me instead
Triggers pointed at my head

Step out of the car
Step out of the car
Step out of the car
Step out of the car
