It was cheap at half the price
Took a shovel where a spoon would suffice
Now I can't see you
Now I can't see you

Regimental in my way
Detrimental at the end of the day
But you won't be told
No, you won't be told

I will be, I will be
I won't be frightened
I will be, I will be
I'll be enlightened

Word of pain you so to say
There's a splinter in your
Splendor today
I could believe you
I would believe you

There's a world inside your world
There's a glass house where the insults are held
But you won't be told
No, you won't be told

I will be, I will be
I won't be frightened
I will be, I will be
I'll be enlightened

Took a chainsaw to my mind
Did arrange I'd left a sad world behind
But all will be fine
Yes, all will be fine

I will be, I will be
I won't be frightened
I will be, I will be
I won't be enlightened

I will be, I will be
(you're shy _______)
I won't be frightened
(you try but still the words won't come)
I will be, I will be
(you're shy _______)
I won't be enlightened

I will be, I will be
(you're shy _______)
I won't be frightened
(you try but still the words won't come)
I will be, I will be
(your chance had turned)
I won't be enlightened

I will be, I will be
I won't be frightened
I will be, I will be
I won't be enlightened
