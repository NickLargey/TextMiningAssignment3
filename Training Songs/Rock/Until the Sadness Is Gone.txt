1st of May sister- put that record on
And dance through the rooms 
Of the house of your dreams
There's not much 'round here that's half

As pretty as it seems
But it gets bigger
And it gets better
So put that record on and dance until

The sadness is gone
And they say sister
They say all is fine
Truth or lie, sister, they say all is fine

Fine
Fine
Well here's the laughter
And here's the sore throat

And here's another one of the only kind
That will ever grow here
And the air is full of...
Mark my words and sleep

The air holds nothing
So ten years of falling down is nothing, now?
Ten years of feeling sick is nothing?
Well I spy an eye for an eye and

A tooth for a tooth in you
And I spy clear skies all over
And I spy a life repeating itself in you
So he might say "- I remember a feverish night 

When she would cling to the walls 
And talk like a child
And that car travel under the beautiful sky
That car travel into the longest of nights

And the air was full of
Poisoned words
And the record's broken
And as I walk through every room of my life,

Thinking I can never take the edge of anything
And shape it to a perfect ball
And let it roll down the hall
To knock all this shit out of my way,

The sun brakes through,
The sun brakes through
And I see you
I see you like always
Like every day

And still I dance through the rooms
Of the house of my dreams
Nothing 'round here is 
Half as pretty as it seems

And it won't get bigger
It won't get better
But put that record on and dance with me
Until the Sadness Is Gone
