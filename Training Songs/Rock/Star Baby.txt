Well I never been much for admitting things
That's why it's all so hard to say
That I'm head over heels in love with your kind of insanity
And if it please your highness on a sunny day sometime
Can I take your picture in the park with silk and satin oh?

Star baby
Flashy little shiny little two timin' mama singin'
Star baby
Shiny little flashy little lovin' machine

I've never been much good at keepin' a secret
Now it's easy for me to say
That I'm head over heels shook up about the way that you fool with me
And if it please you highness on a sunny day sometime
Can you take me riding babe I'll tell you what I'm thinkin' 'bout you

Star baby
Flashy little shiny little two timin' mama singin'
Star baby
Flashy little shiny little lovin' machine

Well I saw you last night on a Hollywood show
And now it's easy for me to say
That I'm head over heels shook up about the way that you sang to me
And if it please your highness on a sunny day sometime
Can you take me drivin' maybe kissin' in you Cadillac

Star baby
Flashy little shiny little two timin' mama singin'
Star baby
Flashy little shiny little lovin' machine
Star Baby
Star Baby
Flashy little shiny little lovin' machine
Star Baby
