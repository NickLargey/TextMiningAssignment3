You don’t feel the same
When the fears go
You ride my time, I'll never go with you tonight
Until the party ends, until the part when we retire
Over the hill, over the hill we go

And I’ll buy you the night, and I’ll buy you the time
And we can do anything you want
Will you go there, my never, my never

You ride my time, I'll never go with you tonight
Until the party ends, until the part when we retire

You tell me slow
What have you seen
What did you see 
And three girl saw her
Looking so thin
Black and bruised skin

I'll never go with you tonight
Until the party ends, until the part when we retire
Over the hill, over the hill we go

You look so frail, you know 
But still you 
Tears fall 
You look so frail, you know
But still you 

Until the party ends, until the part when we retire
Until the party ends, until the part when we retire
