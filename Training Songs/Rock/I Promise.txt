Rest your head on my shoulder
When the soldiers come for us
I'll lay my hand on your belly, I promise

Kiss me once to forgive me
Curl your toes around my thumb
I'll hide the money behind the wall, I promise

You are the dream that I forgot
I will hold you in the night

You are the dream that I forgot
The dream that I forgot to have
I will hold you in the night

You are the dream that I forgot
The dream the dream
The dream I forgot to have
I will hold you in the night, I promise

Rest your head on my shoulder
When the soldiers come for us
I'll lay my hand on your belly, I promise

I promise
