My [Incomprehensible], my life is dull
And dried up like the sound of voice makes
When the heart grows cold and it?s going that way

I think I?ll move out of state somewhere far from
Seattle City lights, they burn my eyes
California sounds nice but California?s a lie
Maybe I'm out of luck or maybe I'm just blind, oh this time

Rain on my hopes, rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous, the pursuit of this dream
We thought we?d be there long ago

My life is like a rolling river, so muddy and absurd
And although I might be mistaken I know that I?ll be heard
And I find the second I try to pull away
I'm thrown back in line, oh, this time

So, rain on my hopes, rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous, the pursuit of this dream
We thought we?d be there long ago

Rain on my hopes, rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous, the pursuit of this dream
We thought we?d be there long ago

And we're all looking for
The same thing, the same thing
Seattle is calling me
Back home, back home, so

Rain on my hopes, rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous the pursuit of this dream
We thought we?d be there long ago

Rain on my hopes, rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous the pursuit of this dream
We thought we?d be there long ago
Oh oh oh oh
