This is our city of the dead
Another life owes its dreary head
We all, we try, we live, to lie
Doubting days, trying to get by
Waiting for the calling
Anticipation in the air
We only dream of difference
City's sleeping, unaware
Break the silence, (wake the dead)
Running through these streets alone
I can't get sleep, let's break this hole
'Cause I swear, and this will render useless
I promised you, we got this far
Not gonna stop me, gonna stop me now
I'm not hiding in shadows
Wake up
Saying that this passage is clear

You said, you said, you said
This time was gonna be different
Wake up the dead

You said, you said, you said
This time was gonna be different
Wake up the dead

Drop me the line, something stirs inside
This isn't over yet
Shake off the dirt
Swallow regret
Stop living under the weight
Living under the weight of regret
Your regrets
Don't lose hope
Your regrets
Don't lose hope
Don't let it happen to you
Don't lose hope
Which side are you gonna choose?
'Cause I'm only, I believe in seeing you rise!

We said, we said, we said
This time was gonna be different
Wake up the dead

We said, we said, we said
This time was gonna be different
Wake up the dead

We said, we said, we said
This time was gonna be different
Wake up the dead

We said, we said, we said
This time was gonna be different
Wake up the dead
