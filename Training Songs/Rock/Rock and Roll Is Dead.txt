I used to do the pony 
I used to do the twist 
But now my horse's died 
And believe me it won't be missed 
'cause 

Rock and Roll Is Dead 
And we don't care 
Rock and Roll Is Dead 
And we don't care 

I used to boogie at the get down 
But now it seems just a bore 
I'm going to a wake 
Ain't gonna twist and shake no more
