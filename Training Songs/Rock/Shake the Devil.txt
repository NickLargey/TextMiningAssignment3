You were born with a bad disposition,
And a heart as cold as ice.
Your tongue is sharp as a razor,
It's cut me more than twice.
Shake the devil. shake the devil.
I believe you could shake the devil,
You could shake him all night.
Standing face to face with the devil,
Send him runnin' off in the night.
