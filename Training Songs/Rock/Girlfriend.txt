Your sisters so cool she goes to university
Your brothers got it sussed he takes biology
Your dads not a criminal he's part of the economy
Your mums not invisible she's knows about philosophy

And it's so sad
The way they have to be like that to me
And it's so sad
The way you had to leave the family

You like to have a row it's part of your vocabulary
You talk about love like you're gonna win the lottery
You've got it all planned like daylight robbery
Your friends just say he's such a cheeky monkey

And it's so sad
The way they have to be like that to me
And it's so sad
The way you had to leave the family

How long have you been my girlfriend, girlfriend
How long have you been my girlfriend, girlfriend

You talk about the stars like a hippy on celery
I'll do the washing up and you can play monopoly
It's such an opportunity for you to start photography
I ain't going there it's out of my geography

And it's so sad
The way they have to be like that to me
And it's so sad
The way you had to leave the family

How long have you been my girlfriend, girlfriend
How long have you been my girlfriend, girlfriend
How long have you been my girlfriend, girlfriend
How long have you been my girlfriend, girlfriend

You go on about that bloke like you wanna marry him
He's always getting drunk and I have to carry him
But what's a name she has to take the blame
I only want a laugh but here we go again

And it's so sad
The way they have to be like that to me
And it's so sad
The way you had to leave the family

How long have you been my girlfriend, girlfriend
How long have you been my girlfriend, girlfriend
How long have you been my girlfriend, girlfriend
How long have you been my girlfriend, girlfriend
