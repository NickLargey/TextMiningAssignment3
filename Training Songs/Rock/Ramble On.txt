The leaves are falling all around
Time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged
For such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go
Autumn moon, light my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I got one thing I got to do

Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now, sing my song
I'm goin' 'round and 'round I got to find my girl, on my way
I've been this way ten years to the day, ramble on
I'm gonna find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time to for spreadin' roots
Time has come to be gone
And to our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

Ramble on
Now's the time, the time is now, to sing my song
I'm goin' 'round the world, I got to find my girl, on my way
I've been this way ten years to the day, I gotta ramble on
I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Mine's a tale, can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
Years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
In the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one
Crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, yeah
And there's nothing I can do now
Unless I keep on

Ramblin' (I'm gonna)
And now's the time, the time is now, sing my song
I'm goin' 'round and 'round I got to find my girl, on my way
I've been this way ten years to the day, ramble on
I'm goin' round the world, see my girl
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I will
Searchin' for my baby
Doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, babe, oh
Keep on ramblin', baby
Hmm, a-keep on ramblin', baby
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Keep on ramblin', baby
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby
