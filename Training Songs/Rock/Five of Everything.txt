No matter what I try there’s no room in my mind
No way to go round that, that’s just the way it is must I remind
I don’t pick up the phone but you still try to call
There’s nothing left to say you’ve already gotta know we’ve said it all

The story never ends,
In search of something
But once we arrive it all starts again
Reaching for higher ground,
The river’s rising and it keeps on flowing forever
No matter what we have found

Sometimes it seems insane
To just keep pressing on
As if it will put out the flame
But still the thirst remains
Drink another drink
And somehow I still feel the same

Step off, head out, take flight, and just run
Got five of everything but I just need one
My brain telling me what I want, I need
Got five of everything but I still proceed

Help me fill up this hole
It’s gaping and out of control
It feels like I’m losing touch and it’s taking its toll
When this wall isn’t moving
State of things aren't improving
And no satisfaction in the distraction of the day

Sometimes it seems insane
To just keep pressing on
As if it will put out the flame
But still the thirst remains
Drink another drink
And somehow I still feel the same

Step off, head out, take flight, and just run
Got five of everything but I just need one
My brain telling me what I want, I need
Got five of everything but I still proceed

Living in this culture can be a drag
It’s just a commercial what we have
A one track mind we grab, grab, grab
We’re past being crazy, call us mad
Gone is the golden egg and the goose
And the bullshit of all hell breaking loose
We gotta hit the boost, sip on the thick juice
Disregard the bad cards, wake the truth

Step off, head out, take flight, and just run
Got five of everything but I just need one
My brain telling me what I want, I need
Got five of everything but I still proceed

The story never ends,
In search of something
But once we arrive it all starts again
Reaching for higher ground,
The river’s rising, it keeps on flowing forever
