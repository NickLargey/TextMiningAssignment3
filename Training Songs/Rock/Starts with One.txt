Starts with one I can't feel
It's all in your mind anyway
I can't heal
Make me feel this way, oh

Now there's two I can't see
I've never felt this way
I can't feel
Anything anyway

Let's show them the only way
Let's show them our hearts

Only three I can't seem
To get enough anyway
I can't speak
Nothing to say anyway

Let's show them the only way
Let's show them our hearts

Let's show them the only way
Let's sew up their hearts

Distorted light moves in
Or am I mistaken'

It feels so
It feels so
It feels so cold... x2

There goes today
It slowly fades...slowly fades away
Here comes today
Never go...never go away
