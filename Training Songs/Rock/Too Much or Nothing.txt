Are the lights so bright
That you can`t see
How a little taste of everything
Could leave you quite this empty?
Tell yourself it`s not your fault
Take the pills with a pinch of salt
Makes no difference, makes no bones
It`s hard to think with your mouth full of stones 

It`s too much or nothing
Too much or nothing 

Beside yourself, beside the fire
Stare deep into the flames
As if you`ll find some sort of answer
Tell yourself you`ll be alright
Pinch yourself with all your might
Makes no difference, makes no bones
It`s hard to think with your mouth full of stones 

It`s too much or nothing
There`s no in be... in between
Too much or nothing
When you`re making do with make believe
Too much or nothing
Living way beyond your dreams
Too much or nothing
And now everything`s extremely
Too much or nothing
 
Too much or nothing
Can come in like
Too much or nothing 

Too too too too too too too too too too too too 
Down & out
Too much or nothing 

Too much or nothing
There`s no in be... in between
Too much or nothing
When you`re making do with make believe
Too much or nothing
Living way beyond your dreams
Too much or nothing
And now everything`s extremely 

Beside yourself, beside the fire
Stare deep into the flames
As if you`ll find some sort of answer
Tell yourself it`s all your fault
Swallow your pride with a pinch of salt
Makes no difference, makes no bones
It`s hard to think, it`s just hard
To think it`s just... 

Too much or nothing
There`s no in be... in between
Too much or nothing
When you`re making do with make believe
Too much or nothing
Living way beyond your dreams
Too much or nothing
And now everything`s extremely
Too much or nothing
Too much or nothing
Too much or nothing
Can come in like
Too much or nothing 

Too much too much too much
Much too much or
Nothing nothing nothing
Too much too much too much
Much too much of
Nothing nothing nothing
