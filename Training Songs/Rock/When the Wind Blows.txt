The blistering mouth, a judgemental eye, the thoughts of an idiot stick
Well
Your humour is crass and simple of mind, this coward is never a miss
Well
It used to be chat, not all of it with, the temper it never does fit
Well
This sullen is fun, we knew you had won, the price of this heaven is shit
Well
But when the wind blows, your phase will stick like ugly
How pure is my mind, now i'm sure this is my mind
The teeth in your ties, the fold in your eyes, melancholy, fashionable, sick
Well
A bleed on the side, we know it's unkind, deserved was never like this
Well
The beef in your mind, the birth of the blind, the stink of inedible piss
Well
This sullen is fun, we knew you had won, the price of this heaven is shit
Well
