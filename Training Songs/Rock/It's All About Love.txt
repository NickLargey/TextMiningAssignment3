Every mornin' I wake up, the first thing I remember
Is all the things I said the night before
Then I look in the mirror, stop myself pretendin'
All I have is worth a whole lot more

It doesn't matter what you do
As long as I can be with you
I know we're gonna see this through
It's all about love

Every time that I'm with you, I capture every moment
Just in case this world should fall apart
And I don't wanna lose you, you can hear me callin'
I can't change what happened in the past

It doesn't matter what you do
As long as I can be with you
I know we're gonna see this through
It's all about love

Look around, look around
At all these familiar faces
Don't ya know, don't ya know, don't ya know
That it still means the whole world to me?

It's all about love
It's all about love

So don't forget all the good times
The nights that we're together
Keep those memories locked inside your heart

It doesn't matter what you do
As long as I can be with you
I know we're gonna see this through
It's all about love

It doesn't matter what you say
I'm never gonna walk away
I'll love ya 'til my dyin' day
It's all about love

It's all about love, it's all about love
It's all about love, it's all about love
It's all about love, it's all about love
It's all about love

It's all about love, it's all about love
It's all about love, it's all about love
It's all about love, it's all about love
It's all about love
