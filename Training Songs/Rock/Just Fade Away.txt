She asks for more and I give less
Why can't she see it's obvious
I mean no but she takes yes
I make it clear but she don't guess

She comes round it gets me down
But she don't catch a hint I drop
She turns up it turns me off
And she don't know when to stop

What am I supposed to do?
How to gently break the news?
How to get the message through?
Perhaps I should just fade away

She asked me out and I gave in
Then she gave out and I felt mean
I really want no more of us
So I stay home, she comes across

She comes round I turn her down
But she bounces back again
She comes on I turn her off
But she don't get what's really plain

What am I supposed to do?
Got to get the message through
Got to make her see the truth
I wish she would just fade away

Do you want to know do I love you?
The answer's no
Is that straight enough for you?

She asked for it I told her flat
That I don't want no more of that
I've really had you up to here
And I don't even like you near
If you come round I won't be in

I can't stand to see your face
If we meet up then count me out
Why don't you just fade away?

Fade away
When love's not love
When love's not love
When love's not love
Fade Away
