Melancholy mood
Forever haunts me
Steals upon me in the night
Forever taunts me
Oh, what a lonely soul am I
Stranded high and dry
By a melancholy mood
Gone is every joy
And inspiration
Tears are all I have to show
No consolation
All I see is grief and gloom
Till the crack of doom
Oh, melancholy mood

Deep in the night
I search for a trace
Of a lingering kiss
A warm embrace
But love is a whimsy and flimsy as lace
And my arms embrace an empty space

Melancholy mood
Why must you blind me?
Pity me and break the chains
The chains that bind me
Won't you release me, set me free?
Bring her back to me
Oh, melancholy mood
