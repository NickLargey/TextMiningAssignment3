I'm a little mashed up
I'm the world's strongest man
Call me when the fire starts
But don't call me if it gets too hot
I wanna be myself
Don't leave me by myself
I'm always at odds
What a bore

I'll play the game for you
Only if I give a f*ck
Call me when the lightning strikes
But don't call me if your hair turns white
I'm on a good racing line
But I'll crash this car
I'm always at odds
No more

I'm a little bit fun
I'm the world's strongest man
Don't call me when the madness starts
I'll be home watching crap TV
'Cause when I wanna destroy
Another tear might fall
I'm always at odds
No more

I'm a little mashed up
I'm the world's strongest man
Call me when the fire starts
But don't call me if it gets too hot
I wanna be myself
Don't leave me by myself
I'm always at odds
No more!
