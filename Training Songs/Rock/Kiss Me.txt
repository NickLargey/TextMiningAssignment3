Silent star
Screams afar
I gazew at you my light
Exploding chill

This aching will
When the moon is right
You shine
Hold it up

Don't let it down
Don't stop me now
Kiss me
Please just kiss me

'Cause your eyes look adorable
With you I'm home again
Emerging fear
That you're not here

I can see
You're changing ways
The wind is strong
The moon is gone

And your shadow disappears
Hold it up
Don't let it down
So don't stop me now

Kiss me
Please just kiss me
'Cause your eyes look adorable
With you I'm home again

Don't stop me now
Kiss me
Please just kiss me
'Cause your eyes look adorable

With you I'm home again (I'm home again)
With you I'm home again
Don't stop me now
