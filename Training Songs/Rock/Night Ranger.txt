In the cool city, in the heat of the night
Looking for adventure on the face of the light
A Colorado school boy put his days on the line
Nights out of paperback, 'Catcher In The Rye'

Night ranger
Where you gonna run to now?

Ranger

He met her at a rock show, skin tight jeans
Heavy metal leather hanging from her seams
He took her to a late night, she put her heart on the line
Left her standing in the doorway singing, "Thanks for the good time"

Night ranger
Where you gonna run to now?

I can hear you calling, calling
I can hear you calling, night ranger
I can see you falling, falling
I can see you falling, night ranger
Where you gonna run to now?
Night ranger

In the hot city on a cool summer night
Four letter words make it alright
A Colorado school boy put it all on the line
Under the street lights having a good time

I can hear you calling, calling
I can hear you calling, night ranger
I can see you falling, falling
I can see you falling, night ranger
Where you gonna run to now?
