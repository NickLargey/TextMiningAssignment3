You say you don't want me
You say you don't care
You say that your heart
Ain't got no room for me there
You say you don't need me
But I know that it's just a lie
'Cause when you call me in the night
Tellin' me your life is better off without me
How come you're sleepin' all alone
Tellin' me you don't ever think about me...

Hey, you're givin' yourself away
It's there in every move you make
You can't hide your heartache away
Hey, it's somethin' you don't have to say
It's written in the tears on your face
I see through the part that you play
Your givin' yourself away...
Your givin' yourself away...
It doesn't matter what you say
Your givin' yourself away...
Your givin' yourself away...

So you got all your freedom
And you got all your time
So you got the illusion that your doin' fine
So you smile in the mirror
Through the sadness your smile can't disguise
Why don't you come right out and say
Baby you can't take another day without me
You know I'm runnin' through your blood
You need me like a drug and you can't live without me...

Hey, you're givin' yourself away
It's there in every move you make
You can't hide your heartache away
Hey, it's somethin' you don't have to say
It's written in the tears on your face
I see through the part that you play
Your givin' yourself away...
Your givin' yourself away...
It doesn't matter what you say
Your givin' yourself away...
Your givin' yourself away...

And when you call me in the night
Tellin' me your life is better off without me
I know that you're lyin' there alone
Baby cause I know you can't live without me
