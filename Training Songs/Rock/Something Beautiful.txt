Light weight too straight no reaction
I don't care if I'm not in fashion
I will follow you I will follow you
It's hearts up heads down puddle of red wine
You get back up and you face the climb
I will follow you

Something in me almost breaks

But I wait
I'm sinking in my skin
And I wait
My heart is wearing thin
'Cause I'm looking for
Something beautiful

You cut me up and you make me bleed
A sad stained heart hanging on my sleeve
I'll still follow you I will follow you
But you say ?look up look up look all around you
Can't you see the love that surrounds the very soul of you??

Something in me almost breaks

But I wait
I'm sinking in my skin
And I wait
My heart is wearing thin
'Cause I'm looking for
Something beautiful
And I pray
For it to come right in
There'll come a day
My heart is wearing thin
That I fall upon
Something beautiful
Something meaningful

You stick your soul out risk it all
Your fearless beauty breaks your fall

Something in me
Knows there's something more
And it's so close I wanna run

But I wait
I'm sinking in my skin
Yeah I wait
My heart is wearing thin
'Cause I'm looking for
Something beautiful
And I pray
For it to come right in
There'll come a day
My heart is wearing thin
When I fall upon
Something beautiful
Something beautiful
Something meaningful
