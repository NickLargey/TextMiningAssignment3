So many came before you
The prisoners of fate

A history of bloodshed
A legacy of hate.
But where will you be standing 
When the battles have been won?
Inside your lonely fortress 
The battles just begun.

After the war
who will you be fighting for? 
After the war is over.
After the fire is burning 
To its dying embers
after the war.

A letter from the draft board 
Put paid to all your dreams
You're just another number 
In military schemes.
They marched you in a uniform
You wore against your will
With lies of hope and glory 
They taught you how to kill.

After the war
Who will you be fighting for? 
After the war is over
You thought you'd be a hero 
After all that survived
If hell was meant for heroes 
Then surely you've arrived.

After the war
After the war
After the war
Who will you be fighting for?
After the war
Who will you be fighting for?
After the fire is burning 
To its dying embers
After the war.
