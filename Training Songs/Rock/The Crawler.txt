I am the crawler
Who wants your daughter
Feel we oughta
And you can’t stop her

Let’s go, let’s go tonight
And bask in the moonlight

And your daughter
And your brother
And your mother
Just your daughter

Let’s go, let’s go tonight
And bask in the moonlight

Oh, oh

On the corner
And your daughter

(?) lovers

They last forever
