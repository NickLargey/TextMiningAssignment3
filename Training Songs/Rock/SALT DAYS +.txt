In your mind
You build pyramids round yourself
And into time, you'll wonder what you have left
No one can see the design of your mind
Tell you can leave constructor

[Chorus]
Laugh out laugh, but don't laugh alone
Stand up proud, your feelings are fun
Close one height to see what you've done
I won't cry as you're breaking this song

When you talk it's the opposite of yourself
Take it aim, with arms that will make to fail
The covers of... too far the... 
No one can read it's been thin from the start

[Chorus:x2]
Laugh out laugh, but don't laugh alone
Stand up proud, your feelings are fun
Close one height to see what you've done
I won't cry as you're breaking this song
