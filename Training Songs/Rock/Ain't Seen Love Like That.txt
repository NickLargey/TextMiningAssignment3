I've been miles from nowhere, crossed and doubled back
Time is a healer and I've done my time, 'cos I ain't seen love like that

I've seen the light of freedom, dim and fade to black
So many faces, but no one compares, no I ain't seen love like that

And I've got people tellin' me to let her go, don't let it turn you around
Tomorrow's coming and you'll never know, the one that you lost may be found

I believe in justice, I wonder where she's at
It feels like a lifetime and it just ain't fair
No I ain't seen love like that

And I've got people tellin' me to let her go, that girl is bringing you down
Tomorrow's coming and you'll never know, the love that you lost may be found

You know that people tell me to let her go, don't let it turn you around
Tomorrow's coming and you'll never know, the love that you lost may be found

No I ain't seen love like that - so many faces
Ain't seen love like that - and no one compares
I ain't seen love like that
Ain't seen love like that - ain't seen love
Ain't seen love like that - no, no I ain't
