So much to be and so much to see
There's very little here for me
It's really hard to get through

[Chorus]
So won't do it anymore
Can't feel it anymore
Won't do it anymore
Can't feel it anymore

There's so much I'd like to say
You're not bothered either way
It's really hard to talk to you

[Chorus]
