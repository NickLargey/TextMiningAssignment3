Girlfriend now
I have a have a girlfriend now
No way, no how I get a girlfriend now

I remember it vividly, love. 
I've been walking erect since the moment we met
And I caught your eyes to my surprise (your white thighs)
Hebraic neuroses ceased to be 
And angel's conversing with me
The new attractive to me is divine
And even if your friends don't understand
No matter what, I'll always be your man
And even if you go, you know you?ll leave me feeling grand
Yeah yeah

I'll need new contraceptives, green eyes
I thanked God when you left him, green eyes
Let's spend the night entwined out on the boardwalk in sickly summertime
Like the yin and the yang of the afikomen
You're the omen that all has changed that was deranged
And even if you stomp me 'til I'm sore
No matter what, I'd bleed to be your whore
And even if the cancer grows until we explode, I'm yours

Girlfriend now
I have a girlfriend now
No way, no how
I get a girlfriend, now?
Well, from here on forth, I'm yours

And even if your whisper eats my ear
Your voice shall be the only song I long to hear
And even if you fear the end, our sacrament of salmon and Irish beer
Will still be here

Girlfriend now
I have a girlfriend now
No way, no how
I get a girlfriend, now?

Boy, I need your love, so give it to me
Boy, I need your touch, so lay it on me
Boy, I need your love, I need your touch, I'm yours?

Girlfriend now
I have a girlfriend now
No way, no how
I get a girlfriend, now?

Girlfriend now
I have a girlfriend now
No way, no how
She's my girlfriend now
