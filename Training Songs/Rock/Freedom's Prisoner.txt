I want to be the jiver you'd want to meet
I want to be yer danger man in the street
I want to be the biggest thing in site
I want to be yer dancer in the night
Want to be macho, want to be cool
Want to be treated like a jewel
To get hold of you babe I know that I can
Gotta get to you n be the man
When I see you coming weaving across the floor always 
Want to feel n beg for more
Whenever yer move them legs I always feel a pain
Want to get with you again n again n again
When you've got yer finger on the pulse
Then all I see, is a wonderful place
I always want to be
I hear from all the girls you're quite a bitch
That sounds so wrong, sacrilege
Put on a little make-up n jive tonite
I'd even do the hustle to catch yer site
You're like the elemental child
My crazy dancer, sexy wild
When you pout yer lips n wriggle yer hands
I want to be bad, bad, bad like the boys in the bands
I'm always there to watch yer come
Slithering across the floor
I get so hot, stare in awe
I seen you dance in new york, london and la
Swear I'm gonna do it with you one day
It's gotta be the wonderful, magic movements that you do
I'm Freedom's Prisoner watching you
