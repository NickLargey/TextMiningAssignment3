Baby shaved her head and gone
Now she's got black stockings on
I think she's warmin' up to the ice age 

Baby spreads her little wings
Now the boys say awful things
I think she's warmin' up to the ice age 

She's got a heart and it's on fire
But how would they know
This cool blue flame will only expire
Out here in the snow 

She could melt the modern world
But she's just a modern girl
I think she's warmin' up to the ice age 
 
Frozen like a punch bowl swan
Frozen like a mastodon
I think she's warmin' up to the ice age 

Maybe she'll come back to me
In ten million years
And maybe I could make her see
It's only a world of tears 

Her survival kit contains
Lots of things to keep her brain
The proper distance from her heart
'Cause that's where all the trouble starts
Baby hasn't figured yet
That one cold shoulder is all you get
One cold shoulder don't stop no show
mCause baby we're all Eskimos
I think she's warmin' up to the ice age
I think she's warmin' up to the ice age
