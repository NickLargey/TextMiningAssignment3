They say that sometimes
You've got to pick up bombs ad fight
For what you believe is right

Some say
That's just not the way
You will only make things worse

So I close my eyes and turn my head away
And I hope it'll be all right
Fall into a restless sleep
While so many innocent die
That's why I sing

Hail to all of us
Hail to all of us down here

Maybe someday soon
When we've thought things over
We'll know what to do
But probably
There's a much bigger chance you see
That it will all be gone

So I close my eyes and turn my head away
And I hope it'll be all right
Fall into a restless sleep
While so many innocent die
That's why I sing

Hail to all of us
Hail to all of us down here

New York City, London, Jericho
Jerusalem, Sydney, anywhere you want to go
Cape Town, to the moon and back again

Hail to all of us
Hail to all of us down here
