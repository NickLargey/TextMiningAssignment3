The walking and constantly
An endless stream of endless dreams
That wheel and roll just past my shoulder
The waiting and constantly
An endless shift of sifting through the facts
The fey you never know for sure

I was sure until they asked me
Now I don't know
All I know is something touched me
Shadows lift my fingers
Don't let the cold
Every now and then things become clear

There is nothing that will bring you back
There is nothing that will change this fact
There is nothing that I will take back
I know, I know, this is a fact
I'm pretty sure, I know
I don't know, I don't know, I

I tell everyone a different story
That way nothing's ever boring
Even when they turn and say, ?You lied?
Petals drifting past my shoulder
Or maybe snow, I'm cold, I'm not sure
Someone yelled at me, I don't know why

If you want someone to love you
Just let me know
People pushing past me
If you want someone to love you
Then don't just go
Every now and then things become clear

That there is nothing that will bring you back
And there is nothing that will change this fact
There is nothing that I will take back
Your shoes, you left your hat
It's on the bed or else the chair
I don't know, I don't know, I

Oh, my darling, oh, my darling

So if you want someone to love you
Just let me know
People shouting at me
If you want someone to love you
Then don't just go
Every now and then things become clear

That there is nothing that will bring you back
And there is nothing that will change this fact
There's nothing that I will take back
Your shoes, you left your hat
It's on the bed or else the chair
I don't know, I don't know

The walking and constantly
An endless stream of endless dreams
That wheel and roll just past my shoulder
That wheel and roll just past my shoulder
That wheel and roll just past my shoulder
That wheel and roll just past
That wheel and roll just past my shoulder
