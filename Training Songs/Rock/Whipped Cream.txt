I want it with whipped cream on it
Baby gimme gimme gimme your love
'Cause I'm hungry you can't keep it from me
Lord knows you got more than enough.
Baby I, I'm fiendin' I know you got your reasons
For keeping it to yourself
But you got plenty honey I don't think it's funny
Gotta give it give it give it or else
I might just lose my mind.

[Chorus]
I think I'm entitled to your body gotta
Little problem with personal space and I've been
Poundin' the Jager my breath and behavior
Have been driving the patrons away.

I want it with whipped cream on it

Baby gimme gimme gimme your love
'Cause I need it girl oh you gots to feed it
You can't beat the heat that beats in my blood.

Yeah you got sweet lovin' still hot from the oven
All the muffins that a man could desire
But I'm not gonna give up all the money
'Til ya admit you wanna sit by the fire
I think I just lost my mind.

[Chorus]

I want it with whipped cream on it
Baby gimme gimme gimme your love
I want it with whipped cream on it
Baby gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme your love.
(I really want it.)

[Chorus]

Poundin' the Jager my breath and behavior
Have been driving the patrons away
