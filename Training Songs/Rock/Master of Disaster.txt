Bleeding heart of mine
Fearful mind beside
Can't deny the sign
Return to the time

Did it really die?
This must be a lie, bestial lust
Bestial lust spills my blood
Your bodies in the mind

Master of disaster
Master, master
Master of disaster
Master, master of disaster

It's going piece by piece
Like I tell the truth
The anger has begun
Our lives are as one

Beyond natural life
Inside through internal strife
Bloody animal inside
Standing by my side

Master of disaster
Master, master
Master of disaster
Master, master of disaster
Of disaster

Disaster, disaster, disaster, disaster
Disaster, disaster, disaster, disaster
Disaster, disaster, disaster, disaster
Disaster, disaster, disaster, disaster

I am your angel, your angel in black
Could I hold you all life long?
I want to die with you with your angel in black

Lay down your soul for the last time
Lay your mouth down for the last cry

The world is going mad
The world will feel my pain
Going soon insane
Will be no return

Power cannot overthrow
We are ready to grow
You can't thrill us, bestial lust
You can't kill us

Master of disaster
Master, master
Master of disaster
Master, master of disaster
Of disaster, of disaster

Master
