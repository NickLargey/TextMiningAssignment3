Once he loved her 
Once he could 
See her as a flower 
The days would rise 
And set in her eyes 
A sweetness he'd devour 
Slowly it took him over 
Seeds from the dark side 
Planted when just a boy 
Grew wild inside him now 

The skin between your heart and mine
Like sun to moon and earth to sky
And brains are washed in glossy lies 
'Til beautiful means perfect in our minds 

Hated himself 
All his life 
Couldn't own his blessings 
He pushed aside 
Every ray of light 
That photographed him shining 
Slowly he wanted more 
Than she could ever give 
With her he fantasized 
About a movie star 

The skin between your heart and mine
Like sun to moon and earth to sky
And brains are washed in glossy lies 
'Til beautiful means perfect in our minds 

I like the way you move in the sun inside your room
I like the way you move in the sun inside your room
When the sun, it kisses your skin
And makes me crazy while you're in
I can't see you big at all
Suck your life, oh yeah

Slowly he went too far; flame to the fire
His breath curling all the pages of a magazine 

The skin between your heart and mine
Like sun to moon and earth to sky
And brains are washed in glossy lies 
'Til beautiful means perfect
The skin between your heart and mine
Like sun to moon and earth to sky
And brains are washed in glossy lies 
'Til beautiful means perfect in our minds
