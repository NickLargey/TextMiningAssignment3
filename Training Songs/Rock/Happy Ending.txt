This is the way you left me,
I'm not pretending,
No hope, no love, no glory,
No happy ending

This is the way that we love,
Like its forever,
Then live the rest of our life,
Both not together

Wake up in the morning, 
Stumble on my life,
Can't get no love without sacrifice,
If anything should happen,
I guess I wish you well,
Mm, a little bit of heaven,
But a little bit of hell

This is the hardest story,
That I have ever told,
No hope, or love, or glory,
Happy endings gone forever more
I feel as if I'm wasting,
And I waste every day

This is the way you left me,
I'm not pretending,
No hope, no love, no glory,
No happy ending

This is the way that we love,
Like its forever,
Then live the rest of our life,
Both not together

Too black in the morning,
Someone's on my mind,
Can't get no rest,
Keep walking around,
If I pretend that nothing ever went wrong,

I can get to my sleep I can dream now and just carry on?

This is the hardest story,
That I have ever told,
No hope, or love, or glory,
Happy endings gone forever more,
I feel as if I'm wasting,
And I waste every day,

Oh I feel as if I'm wasting,
And I waste every day

This is the way you left me,
I'm not pretending,
No hope, no love, no glory,
No happy ending

This is the way that we love,
Like its forever,
Then live the rest of our life,
Both not together

A little bit of love

Little bit of love (repeated)

This is the way you left me,
I'm not pretending,
No hope, no love, no glory,
No happy ending

This is the way that we love,
Like its forever,
Then live the rest of our life,
Both not together
This is the way you left me,
I'm not pretending,
No hope, no love, no glory,
No happy ending

This is the way that we love,
Like its forever,
Then live the rest of our life,
Both not together

This is the way you left me,
I'm not pretending,
No hope, no love, no glory,
No happy ending

This is the way that we love,
Like its forever,
Then live the rest of our life,
Both not together
