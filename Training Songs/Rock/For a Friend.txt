I never cried the way I cried over you
As I put down the telephone and the world it carried on
Somewhere else, someone else is crying too
Another man has lost a friend, I bet he feels the way I do
Although I'm left without, I know your love within
As I watch the sun go down, watching the world fade away
All the memories of you come rushing back to me
As I watch the sun go down, watching the world fade away
All I want to do id kiss you goodbye

Summer comes and I remember how we'd march
We'd march for love and peace, together arm in arm
Tears have turned, turned to anger and contempt
I'll never let you down, a battle I have found
And all the dreams we had, I will carry on
As I watch the sun go down, watching the world fade away
All the memories of you come rushing back to me
As I watch the sun go down, watching the world fade away
All I want to do id kiss you once goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

And all the dreams we had, I will carry on
As I watch the sun go down, watching the world fade away
All the memories of you come rushing back to me
As I watch the sun go down, watching the world fade away
All I want to do id kiss you once goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
