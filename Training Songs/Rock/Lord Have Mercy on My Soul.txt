I've walked through the Halls of Karma
I shook hands with both the Devil and God
They turned my eyes to the inside to see
Where my energies have gone
Yes I've run with both all through my life
I've respected and reflected them both
Yes the sympathy of God as he looked at my life
The excitement of the Devil as we talked.

So Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy on my soul.

The Devil said, "Scratch my back and I'll scratch your back for sure"
So you have done all these sins for him
My heart could not be pure
I found out what means more to me
Than anything on this earth
To be ready for the judgment day
Ready to face the truth.

So Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy n my soul.

I hope I've done th right things
For both your sake and mine
I preach in what I live for
My only fear is fear of time
I wanted to look logical
To both my "Maker" and his host
But this trip of life must be complete
Or my cards will be lost.

So Lord Have Mercy On My Soul
