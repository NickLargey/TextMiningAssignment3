If this is worth my time then ill be here for awhile
If this is worth your while then you're making me smile
If I say oh I am I still is all you want
Then I'm not sure how much in common we've got
If you think you've had enough, if you think you've had enough

Somebody's gonna miss us when nobodies here for this song
Somebodies gonna miss out when nobodies had in the club?

Cause this is no attempt to abandon anyone
It is the influence of the music we love
Well If you cant relate and refuse to sing along
Then maybe I can interest you in some other song
A little something like
All that you want is another baby yeah

Somebody's gonna miss us when nobodies here for this song
Somebodies gonna miss out when nobodies had in the club?
Well oh my
If its gonna take time its gonna mean that all of my all of my mistakes are gonna be solved
And were gonna be great

Somebody's gonna miss us when nobodies here for this song
Somebodies gonna miss out when nobodies had in the club?
Somebody's gonna miss us when nobodies here 
Here for this song and I hope they will
Somebodies gonna miss out when nobodies here
