This morning I woke up beside the river.
The grass and trees were green.
Flowers begin growing.
The birds will sweetly sing.
Stronger and much deeper now than ever,
But lying by your side I never feel the stride
I know it's real this time
Cause my heart is yours
My heart is my
Cause my heart is yours
My heart is
The sun falls behind the greatest mountain.
And every moment passing by is a new color in the sky.
Well darling close your eyes.
And now we are flying, we are flying over the mountain.
To follow the sun and back to the river where the evening has won.
Cause my heart is yours
My heart is
My heart is yours
Well my
Ohh now when you look at me it hits me just like a summer breeze.
My heart
Hold me close and underneath the moonlight melody.
Well darling dance with me
Well darling dance with me
Well darling dance with me (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Darling like the morning light
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
My heart is yours Darling like the morning light. (alright)
Everything will be alright. (ooh baby)
Everything will be alright.
Darling like the morning light.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright. (2x) In the morning(4x)
