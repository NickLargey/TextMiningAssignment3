I've been thinking about
What you said last night
And for all your fine words
You still don't have it right

'Cause that's the way that it is
And you won't ever change
You can scream at me
But the powers that be
Won't ever hear your voice
'Cause they're lost
In their own importance
No, they'll never hear your voice

'Cause that's the way that it is
And you won't ever change it

I've heard all your stories
Of how the few can be strong
And how you'll fight to the end
Just to prove me wrong

'Cause that's the way that you are
And you won't ever change it
But don't come cryin' to me
If your fanciful schemes
Don't turn out like you planned
'Cause you're chasin'
After something
That keeps slippin'
Through your hand

That's the way that it is
And you won't change it
