Waitin' for come rain to fall
Waitin' for some mail to come
Waitin' for the dawn again
Old man on the farm

Milk the cow slop the pigs
Sweeping out the chicken house
Drinking whiskey in the barn

Goodnight ladies
Sorry if I stayed too long
So long it's been good to know you
I love the way I sing that song
