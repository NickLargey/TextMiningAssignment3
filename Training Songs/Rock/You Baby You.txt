Ah, ah
Well, you, you, you
You captured me
My baby, can't you see
That's the way I want it to be
I, I feel so free
Everyone now looks at me
Watch my baby down the street
My heart skips a beat
Well, now I know
I really love you so
Everyone in this world should know
That I love you, you love me
That's the way it should always be

Oh, yes, ah ah
Well, I, I feel so free
Everyone now looks at me
Walks my baby down the street
My heart skips a beat
Well, now I know
I really love you so
Everyone in this world should know
That I love you, you love me
That's the way it should always be

Oh, yes
I, I feel so free
Everyone now looks at me
Walks my baby down the street
My heart skips a beat
Well, now I know
I really love you so
Everyone in this world should know
That I love you, you love me
That's the way it should always be
Oh, yes, ah ah
