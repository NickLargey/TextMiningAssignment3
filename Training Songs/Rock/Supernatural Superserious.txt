Everybody here
Comes from somewhere
If they would just as soon forget
A disguise
Disguised as they know you made you feel it
At the summer camp they volunteered
No one saw your face, no one saw your fear
You got apparition just appeared
Took you up and away from this place and shared
Humiliation
Of your teenage nation
Nobody cares no one remembers or cares
If your fantasies are
Dressed up in travesties
Enjoy yourself with no regrets

So if you call out safe then I'll stop right away
When premise explodes and the room starts to shake
The details shift
And the stories the same
You don't have to explain
You don't have to explain
Humiliation
Of your teenage nation
No one cares
If your fantasies are
Dressed up in travesties
Enjoy yourself with no regrets

Everybody here comes from somewhere
If they would just as soon forget, disguise
So if you call out safe then I'll stop right away
When the premise explodes and the room starts to shake
The details shift
With the stories the same
You don't have to explain
You don't have to explain
Humiliation
Of your teenage nation
This celebration
Of your teenage nation
Nobody cares no one remembers and nobody cares
Nobody cares no one remembers and nobody cares
