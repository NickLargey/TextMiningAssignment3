Hallelujah the King has come 
Beautiful Savior God's own Son 
Hallelujah the Christ is here 
To rejoice for our salvation's near

Emmanuel, a humble King 
We give you our hearts as an offering 
You laid down your crown 
It became as dust 
Emmanuel, God with us

Hallelujah the angels sing 
To certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay 
Hallelujah the world will see 
The fullness of His majesty

Emmanuel, a humble King 
We give you our hearts as an offering 
You laid down your crown 
It became as dust 
Emmanuel, God with us

Oh come all ye faithful our God is here 
Joyful triumphant salvation's near 
Oh come and behold our King 
Come and behold Him

Emmanuel, a humble King 
We give you our hearts as an offering 
You laid down your crown 
It became as dust 
Emmanuel, Emmanuel 
God with us
