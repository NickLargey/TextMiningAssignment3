You had it on my day, you had on
You had it on my day
Each morning we marry,
It's just as almost gorgeous of days
I know you'll never run away
You met a young man who was a wild child
Who harmonize' his keys in his droning mind
Saxophone sings from inside his head 'cause

I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away

I'm living all the time thanks 'cause your mine
You turn my dying days away
Each day we carry on like believers and lovers
Though there are others who would rather run away

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey now
If you wanna' hear me sing press play
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
Pay, ay, ay, ay close attention

I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away

I'm holding you all night through to the dawn
You turn my dying days away
My steady style on how to love
Been taking dope to cope, have to come down, sometimes

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
Hey, hey, hey close to touching
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man

I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away

I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away

You had it on my day, you had on
You had it on my day
Each morning we marry,
It's just as almost gorgeous of days
I know you'll never run away
