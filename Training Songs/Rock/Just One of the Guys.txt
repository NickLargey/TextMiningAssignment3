All our friends, they're getting old
But the girls are still staying young
If I get caught being rude in a conversation
With a child bride on her summer vacation

No matter how hard I try, to be just one of the guys
There's a little something inside that won't let me (oh, oh, oh)
No matter how hard I try, to have an open mind
There's a little voice inside that prevents me (oh, oh, oh)

How I live, it got me here
Locked in this bathroom, full of tears
I have begged for you, and I have borrowed
But I've been the only sister to my own sorrow

No matter how hard I try, to be just one of the guys
There's a little something inside that won't let me (oh, oh, oh)
No matter how hard I try, to have an open mind
There's a little clock inside that keeps ticking

There's only one difference between you and me
When I look at myself all I can see
I'm just another lady without a baby

No matter how hard I try, to be just one of the guys
There's a little something inside that won't let me (oh, oh, oh)
No matter how hard I try, to have an open mind
There's a little cop inside that prevents me

I'm not gonna break for you
I'm not gonna pray for you
I'm not gonna pay for you
That's not what ladies do

(Da da da da da)

Oh, oh, oh
