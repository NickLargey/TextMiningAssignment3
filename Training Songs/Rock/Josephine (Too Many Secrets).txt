Oh Jo-osephine, well you won't fi-ind your dream
At the local movie show, the only place you go-o
And I've seen your face at night, out in the glow of the projection light
'Cause up o-on the scree-een are all the people you might have been

I know-ow-ow, I can see
That they'll never give you all the things you're gonna get from me
And I know-ow-ow, yes I know-ow
That you're just another lo-onely gir-irl with no place to go-o

But Josephi-ine (Josephine), don't look in my eyes, you've got too many secrets
Oh, Josephi-i-ine (Josephine), they ain't crocodile cries or Hollywood features
But Josephine, I believe (Josephine), you can try 'em out on me
Just try 'em on me

I believe, I belie-ieve
Oh Jo-osephine, well you won't fi-ind your place
Up on a movie screen, with a different name and a different face
And I know-ow, what they say 
That you never wanted life, all you want is a three act play
And I know-ow-ow, 'cause I trie-ied 
Just to make you talk about thi-ings you wanted to hi-i-ide

But Josephi-i-ine (Josephine), don't look in my eye-eyes
'Cause you've got too many secrets
Oh Josephi-i-ine (Josephine), they ain't crocodile cries or Hollywood features
But, Josephine I believe (Josephine), you can try 'em out on me
'Cause you see, I don't want to tell ya I know all the answers
But Ill pay my money, take my chances
Baby I don't want to see ya all alone
At the end of the show when the light goes on

'Cause I ain't no star-are, I don't know that sce-ene
I know what I a-a-am, and I believe in Josephi-ine
Josephine, I believe, I belie-ieve
Josephine, just try 'em out on me
Josephine, I believe, I belie-ieve
Josephine, try to sing your song to me
Josephine,
