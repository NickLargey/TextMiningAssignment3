Won't you be my sunshine baby 
In a world that's sometimes crazy

I see through my window, I see through the trees
I'm watching the world as it falls on it knees
I hope for tomorrow, I hope for today 
I'm lost for the words with so much to say
No one can tell me answer me why 
I'm watching the world as it's crashing me by
Can you see the reasons the ones that are true 
Tell me there's me and there's me and there's you 

Won't you be my sunshine baby 
You know your words always save me
Won't you be my sunshine baby 
In a world that's sometimes crazy

I see through my window the stars as they shine
I know in my heart that's there's still enough time
To make a difference to make a change
To make a world where we're glad that we came
All that was righteous and all that was wrong 
All that was written can be undone 
Tell me the reasons and say that their true 
Tell me there's hope and say that it's you

Won't you be my sunshine baby 
You know your words always save me
Won't you be my sunshine baby 
In a world that's sometimes crazy

And I'm rooted like a willow tree
I'm reaching out to the sea 
As you hold on to me
And I'm gonna stop the hands of time 
So the sun can always shine 
And the world will finally see

Won't you be my sunshine baby 
In a world that's sometimes crazy
Won't you be my sunshine baby 
You know your words always save me

Won't you be my sunshine baby 
In a world that's sometimes crazy
Sometimes crazy
