(Soni  sing the Fairweather Johnson song...) 
I like the Stealers in '75 
I only like the Broncos when they come alive 
I liked the Redskins in '83 
There when the Dolphins are playin' well  yeah  
Well  they're the team for me. 
Cause I'm Fairweather Johnson (Johnson) 
Yeah  yes I'm Fairweather Johnson 
(Johnson I like the Braves in '95)
