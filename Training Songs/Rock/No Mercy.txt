(No mercy, no mercy)

The riptide greets the water's edge, he says it's good to meet again
The sun is out, it protects us, it lets the fish in my belly swim
Five thousand years ago, we danced with the comets from outer space
It was our nature them, indigenous, and now I feel out of place

(No mercy, no mercy) 
For the goods that grace us all, we destroy what's in our path
(No mercy, no mercy)
Understanding of the purpose of the nature of the world

And then man came, we welcomed him with plants and food to eat
Tranquil rivers and tall pines for shade now all but obsolete
Brother dear would beautify the woods amongst us all
And now he runs and hides from the hunter
To keep his head from the hunter's wall

(No mercy, no mercy)
For the goods that grace us all, we destroy what's in our path
Aaaahh (No mercy), aaaahh (No mercy)
Understanding of the purpose of the nature of the world

The gravitational pull
Can never be wrong
But to live all as one
Has taken too long
Mother Earth
And deservedly so
Has given birth to us all
And there's nothing to glow

But greed and corruption, violence, pollution
Hate, a disease, a new constitution
We need to gather 'round a global huddle
Give praise to the ones that we lost in the struggle
And spread the love, yo, spread the love
Spread the love, spread the love, spread the love

(No mercy, no mercy)
For the goods that grace us all, we destroy what's at our path
Aaaahh (No mercy), oooooh (No mercy)
Understanding of the purpose of the nature of the world

And now the skies are covered up
From a blue to a shade of gray
A man in red many moons ago
Had a vision it would come someday
Five thousand years ago, the earth we now deny
Was the greatest canvas ever painted
Under the eastern sky

(No mercy, no mercy)
For the goods that grace us all, we destroy what's at our path
Aaaahh (No mercy), true (No mercy)
Understanding of the purpose of the nature of the world
(No mercy ,no mercy)
For the creatures and the fish, and the people of the sun
Aaaahh (No mercy), aaaahh (No mercy)
For the concrete and the chemicals, kills the nature in us all

Kills the nature in us all
Kills the nature in us all
