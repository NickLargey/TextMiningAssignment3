I'm tryin' to write these lines
About how pleasant it seems outside
I know that it's a sin to wish for everything
I'll sit down and tell the truth
About the problems I see in you
To a boy in love, the chance can seem like everything

I've seen all the things that I've been trying to do
Broken then torn in two
The tears in my eyes say, I don't want to be free
Put all your faith in me

In the morning it makes me cry
To watch the light as it shines outside
Sometimes it makes me feel, I have everything
Like a fool in search for the truth
Sigh and think what's the use
I know that if I try, I get everything

Share the time through the pain and abuse
Oh, why was I born to lose?
The look in your eye gave the brothers some keep
To put all your faith in me

Fly me to the moon and let me see the stars
I'll take a piece of paradise and take a trip to Mars
So tell me what I'm goin' through
And show me where you are
I've heard my favorite melodies
In the back seat of your car

Fly me to the moon and let me see the stars
I'll take a piece of paradise and take a trip to Mars
So tell me what I'm goin' through
And show me where you are
I've heard my favorite melodies
In the back seat of your car

And I'm dreading the final right
And fighting it all the time
People think they know and say sing anything
If an idiot can make you smile
Well then we'll always see eye to eye
As they say, in life a shock will leave you paralyzed

Such a feeling, such a feeling
Such a feeling, such a feeling
Such a feeling
