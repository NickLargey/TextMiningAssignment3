Do or die, can't you feel it in your heart?
Shooting blood under your skin
It's all around you
Do or die, don't you feel it in your soul?
Blaming me for all the trouble
Or was it all you?
You have taken them all
Sixteen marks on your skin
Where did I go wrong?
You want suicide, I can see it in your eyes
No more pills for you to swallow
And no tomorrow

This hate is bleeding in front of me
Confused and bleeding in front of me
Your life, bleeding in front of me
We all fuckin' bleed, so just let it go

I was hollow inside from the start until the end
So where do I begin?
Another vacant heart, dreams of beautiful lies
Filled with emptiness and sorrow
But no tomorrow

This hate is bleeding in front of me
Confused and bleeding in front of me
Your life, bleeding in front of me
We all fuckin' bleed, so just let it go

Do or die, can't you feel it in your heart
Shooting blood under your skin
It's all around you
Live a lie so that no one else will know
Go ahead and let the blood flow
But it was all for show
Just let it go
Let it go
We're all fuckin' freaks, so just let it go
