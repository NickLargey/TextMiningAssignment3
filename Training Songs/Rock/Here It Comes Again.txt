Let's talk about a criminal procedure 
Throw out the idea of illegal seizure
Put a rope around somebody's neck 
Let's hold some bastard up for example
Take his blood and a urine sample 
Feed him garbage and make him pick up the check

[Chorus]
Well, here it comes here it comes, here it, 
Here, here, here it comes again (twice)

While you were sleeping the neighbors crept in 
Saw you were naked and called it a sin

The next thing you know... it's the next thing you know
Men they poked their heads in your kitchen door 
Smelt something burning and they were sure
It must be the flag you were burning that's what they swore

[Chorus repeat]
They tell you the preacher was hypocritical
What they don't tell you is that he's typical
What he stands for is totally mythical
And as they lead him away he'll pray for you brother
With a bible in one hand and playboy in the other
Imagine what he does to his mother

[Chorus repeat]
They tell you they want to give the right to life
To millions of jerks who will live by the knife
Who'll beat up their children and beat up their wives
Now don't write poetry it's an offense 
Unless it falls to the right of the fence

You'll wind up a victim of zero tolerance 
Let's hold some bastard up for example
Take his blood and a urine sample 
Remind him that man belongs down a man hole (three times) and then 
Ah yeah, get on down.
