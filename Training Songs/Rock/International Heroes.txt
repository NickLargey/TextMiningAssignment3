(kim fowley/kerry scott)

Bobby and sue still go to school
Falling asleep and it ain't too cool
Tom and jane stuck in the rain
At every concert when the bus leaves early
We're just wasting time
Wondering what we'll find when it's all over

I think I'll cut my hair off and start brand new again
Why bother being different? we're all the same
Hey friend it's gotta end
I don't care what you wear, it's what you are that makes you a star

International heroes, you got the teenage blues
Change has gotta come soon or else we're gonna lose

The noise I hear year after year ain't done nothin' but become unclear
Hey everybody, what have we got? old clothes and records starting to rot
Don't throw them away
Open yourselves to the sounds of the future

International heroes, you got the teenage blues
Change has gotta come soon or else we're gonna lose
International heroes, you got the teenage blues
Change has gotta come soon or else we're gonna lose... lose... lose... lose

International heroes, you got the teenage blues
Change has gotta come soon or else we're gonna lose
International heroes, you got the teenage blues
Change has gotta come soon or else we're gonna lose
