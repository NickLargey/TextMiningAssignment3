Touching a thousand dreams,
feeling your memories
I guess I've never been more on my own
And the thought of you makes me cry
'cause you made me feel like sunshine 
There's a danger, you ain't forever
Watching the memory die

One more look at the 
One more look at the night
One more look at the only women I've ever loved
And it's you
Give me one more reason to keep believing
this dream of you holding me tight 

'cause you were everything 
But you go taking living your own way 
Taking the dream that was mine 

Maybe we should have known
we let it slip away
Now I just sit in the dark all alone
And the thought of you makes me cry
'cause you made me feel like sunshine
I'm a stranger
You don't even know me
Taking the sun from my eyes

One more look at the
One more look at the night
One more look at the only women I've ever loved
And it's you 
Give me one more reason to keep believing
this dream of you holding me tight 

We had everything and I need you
Need to be near you, baby, we can't let it die

One more look at the 
One more look at the night
One more look at the only women I've ever loved
And it's you
Give me one more reason to keep believing
this dream of you holding me tight 
One more look at the
One more look at the night
