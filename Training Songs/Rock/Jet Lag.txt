What time is it where you are?
I miss you more than anything
Back at home you feel so far
Waitin' for the phone to ring
It's gettin' lonely livin' upside down
I don't even wanna be in this town
Tryin' to figure out the time zones makin' me crazy

You say good morning
When it's midnight
Going out of my head
Alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset
It's drivin' me mad
I miss you so bad
And my heart heart heart is so jet lagged

What time is it where you are?
Five more days and I'll be home
I keep your picture in my car
I hate the thought of you alone
I been keeping busy all the time
Just to try to keep you off my hand
Tryin' to figure out the time zones makin' me crazy

You say good morning
When it's midnight
Going out of my head
Alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset
It's drivin' me mad
I miss you so bad
And my heart heart heart is so jet lagged

I've been keepin' busy all time
Just to try to keep you off my mind
Tryin' to figure out the time zones makin' me crazy
I miss you so bad
I wanna share your horizon
And see the same sun rising
Turn the hour hand back to when you were holding me

You say good morning
When it's midnight
Going out of my head
Alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset
It's drivin' me mad
I miss you so bad
And my heart heart heart is so jet lagged
