He will paint the light and shade colors and the trees
He will climb the steepest hill believing what he sees
He will lay down on the ground beneath the old oak tree 
He will sleep forever if you try to set him free 
Sail on the wings of a cloud where to well nobody knows
And cry, cry if you want them to see, die every day to be free
Be proud, to wear the colours that you call your own

Be loud, speak out when you want the world to know
Be strong, hold the flame for everyone to see
Be weak, if you want to love
He will paint the endless sea a mystery to me
He will reach out for the sun not dreaming what he sees
He will fall down on his knees angel touching ground 
Takes him to the other side sweet love is coming down
