Hours of small talk, blackboards and chalk
Till the dust it settles down.
Miles upon miles of red tape to walk upon
To walk home, I'll be back soon.
But not a second too soon.
I'll be back soon.
There's not a second to lose.
Oh no, No.
Hey.
I've been stuck here for days
Well it's all business
Regarding money problems, wealth and fame
It's been said before please don't get the wrong idea
I ain't complaining
I'll be back soon
But not a second too soon.
I'll be back soon.
There's not a second to lose.
Oh no, No.
Hey.
Not a second too soon.
And not a second to lose.
But not a second to lose.
But not a second too soon.
Oh no, No.
Hey.
(Oh yeah)
(Not a second too soon, not a second to lose).
(No, no, oh no, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oww. Not a second too soon, oh yeah oh yeah).
(Not a second to lose)
(Not a, not a, not a second to lose).
(Not a second to lose).
