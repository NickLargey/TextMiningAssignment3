If you're here 'cause you love me
And not just because things didn't work out with him
If you've had sweet dreams of me where we left off
Come on in, come on in
If you've come back forever and if you're sincere
If you'll be satisfied with one man
If you've got it together and you're bringing it here
Come on in, come on in
I've been missing the fire in your ocean green eyes
And the love words you whispered back then
And if you can still say them without telling lies
Come on in, come on in
It's the worst kind of hell when we're living apart
I don't think I can take it again
If you swear you won't break it, I'll open my heart
Come on in, come on in
Come on in, come on in
