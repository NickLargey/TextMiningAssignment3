Oh you who hail from Ontario 
Know the tale of the Donnelly's Oh 
Died at the hands of a mob that night 
Every child and man by the oil torch light 
Jim Donnelly was no angel sure 

But they burned his barn, broke down the door 
Well the children cried while they killed old Jim 
Then they killed his wife, then they turned on them 
No judge, no jury, no hangman, no justice in Ontario 
A hundred years or more have turned 

And you always hear how much we've learned 
Well a man lay dead in a Port Hope bar 
And the blood ran red on a hardwood floor 
And the big men ran through the nearest door 
Only one man knew what had happened for sure 

Well one and all wore the outlaws' brand 
And the big bikes roared through the Great Northland 
When you live on the edge of the law 
You know, justice in Ontario 

Blue smoke still hung in the air 
No one spoke when the cops got there 
Well the local constable made the call 
Send us Corporal Terry Hall 

They all sang a different tune 
When Corporal Hall walked in the room 
With his picture book and a list of names 
One by one the witnesses came 
And they told him what he wanted to know 
Justice in Ontario 

The provincial cops searched far and wide 
And the outlaws ran but they could not hide 
And they brought em in every single one 
Save the man who actually fired the gun 
It was down in London, they were tried 
And the guilty man stood free outside 

When he took the stand to pay his debt 
The judge was blind and the jury deaf 
In Kingston Town they're locked up still 
When the sun goes down and the air is chill 
You could swear you heard Jim Donnelly's ghost cry
