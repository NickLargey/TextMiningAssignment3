Without a window to see through,
I did my time, in here without you,
Slept on the floor down in the LEC,
Meet me back home and do the mocking.

It seems like misery loves misery,
My favourite songs they keep me company,
So many memories come down to this,
I maybe be lost but I'm not hopeless.

I heard that sound a mile away
I heard that sound a mile away
All those things i wish that i could say
I heard that sound a mile away
A mile away

Came in like static off the tv,
This kinda thing over goes easy,
I meant to tell you but you were gone,
I tried to get it right, i got it all wrong

I heard that sound a mile away
I heard that sound a mile away
All those things i wish that i could say
I heard that sound a mile away
A mile away

Sat outside the show,
With nowhere else, nowhere else to go
Don't say "can't see"
It sure does sound, get to me

(Whoa oaaa) Na Na Na Na Na (Whoa oaaa)
Don't save yourself....get to me
(Whoa oa) Na Na Na Na Na
Get to you....get to me

I heard that sound a mile away
I heard that sound a mile away
All those things i wish that i could say
I heard that sound a mile away
A mile away
A mile away
