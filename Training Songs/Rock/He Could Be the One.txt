Yesterday I met a guy,
The kind I dream about at night
He said come on lets take a ride,
And I said okay...yeah
Every movie major's really hip,
He's hip uh huh
He could be the one to come and steal my heart away
(chorus)
He could be the one...I like his style
He could be the one...his love I've tried
He could be the one to make it all worth while...yeah
He could be the one,he could be the one
He could be the one,he could be the one

I got to say he's super fine
I can't get him off my mind
I know he's not a waste of time,
He's got it all...yeah
Every movie major's really hip,
He's hip uh huh
Got my name and number and I'm waiting on his call...hey...ohhh
(chorus)
He could be the one...I like his style
He could be the one...his love I've tried
He could be the one to make it all worth while...yeah
He could be the one,he could be the one
He could be the one,he could be the one

In this modern day and age
There's just another blasting stage
Everybody's out to score,
But love to me is so much more! let's go!

Hey ohhh!he could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one to make it all worth while...yeah!
He could be the one (8X)

I like his style
He could be the one (2X)

His love I've tried
He could be the one (2X)

I like his style
He could be the one (2X)

His love I've tried
