We walk in circles, destined to collide
Which way is up, I never could decide
But when I'm down you're like a parasite
You take my breath and you fall out of sight

Maybe I'll run and hide
Tomorrow change my mind
Until then it's suicide

Every night and every single day
Controls my dreams, I don't know what to say
You turn to the left, I turn to the right
You won't come in the sun, it's far too bright

Maybe you'll run and hide
Tomorrow change your mind
Until then it's suicide

Standing in the dark
This could be our last mistake
Standing in the dark
This could be your last mistake

Systems red, we switch to overload
"Defcon Five" we're ready to explode
You think we're humble we take no prisoners
You drop that bomb there'll be no prisoners

Maybe we'll run and hide
Tomorrow change our minds
Until then it's suicide

Standing in the dark
This could be your last mistake
Standing in the dark
This could be your last mistake
But it's not the first one

Standing in the dark, dark, dark, dark
Standing in the dark, dark, dark, dark

Maybe I'll run and hide
Tomorrow change my mind
Until then it's suicide

Standing in the dark
This could be your last mistake
Standing in the dark
This could be our last mistake

Standing in the dark
Standing in the dark
Standing in the dark
Standing in the dark
Standing
Standing
In the dark, dark, dark, dark
