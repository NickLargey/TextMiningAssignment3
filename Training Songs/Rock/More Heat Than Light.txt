The imperial disaster's in a furious decline 
They've been burning down the ghettos burning down the ghettos 
Crossing all 
Of the lines 
And everyone gets so excited as it all start to rise 
All the time all the time radiating 
More heat than light 
More it than light 

They've been spitting on the mirage in the back of the van 
If he can do it if he can do it if he can do it 
I think anybody can 
They've been polishing the dolphin you've never seen a beast so bright 
All the time all the time radiating 
More heat than light 
More heat than light 

All you funny little men 
With that fever in your eyes 
You say put them with the others
You should never analyse 
He fucked the watermelon women like a thief in the night 
All the time all the time radiating 
More heat than light 
More heat than light
