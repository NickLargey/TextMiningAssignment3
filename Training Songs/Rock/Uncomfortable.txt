Driving away, I wish I'd stayed
Another night, hasn't changed
And now I see, it's you not me
Who needs the time, you can't find anymore

I never wanted love, but now it's come undone
I'm waiting on the time, you see I care
But now it's fading fast, thought it was gonna last
I'm not uncomfortable but I, feel so uncomfortable

The pieces fit perspective hits
You realize everything is the same
You say the same lines, all done on my time
As it goes on, I will be gone

I never wanted love, but now it's come undone
I'm waiting on the time, you see I care
But now it's fading fast, thought it was gonna last
I'm not uncomfortable but I, feel so uncomfortable

When the memories bend
I'll see you at the end
And if they never fade
I won't be far away

I never wanted love, but now it's come undone
I'm waiting on the time, you see I care
But now it's fading fast, thought it was gonna last
I'm not uncomfortable but I, feel so uncomfortable
