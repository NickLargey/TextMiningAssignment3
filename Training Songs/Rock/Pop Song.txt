WeIl let me tell how it came
You won't believe it
I was alone, I recall
It was such a bad day

I was so down that I prayed
To some god to help me
To find again my way
What wouldn't be easy

I was afraid not to keep
Just a little hope in me
I couldn't stand what I'd Iived
However l had

All my love to give, all my life to live
All my love to give, that's what I needed
All my life to live
I wanna be in overdrive

Well she appeared in the sky
Just like an angel
That's coming down from the stars
Ifs unbelievable

I cannot say how l feel
Now that I met her
My pain is healed, she can see.
All I have is

All my love to give
All my life to live
All my love to give, that's what I needed
All my life to live, I wanna be in overdrive

Now I can feel so high, I can't believe it
Since you stole my heart, I can't believe it
Now I can feel so high, I can't believe it
Since you stole my heart
Think I'm in overdrive
