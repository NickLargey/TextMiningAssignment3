Well, ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze
Baby, won't you tell me your name? Yeah
Well, ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze
Baby, won't you tell me your name? Yeah
I got a funny little feeling
And it's going right to my brain

Ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze
There's a mountain on the top of my head, there is
Ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze
There's a mountain on the top of my head, right
I keep on wondering
Sometimes I wish I was dead, it's true

Ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze
This pain is breaking me down, down and down
Ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze
This pain is breaking me down
I'm like an old scrapped vehicle
Can't turn my wheels around, oh that's right

Well, ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze, come on
Oh, like a bee
Oh, you strung me, baby
Oh it's true, oh right through the heart

Ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze
Baby, won't you tell me your name?
Oh, ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze
Baby, won't you tell me your name?
You know this funny little feeling's
Getting on top of my brain

Well, ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze
I'm gonna write a letter to you, oh yeah
Ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze
I'm gonna write a letter to you
Well, declaring my love
And telling you I love you

Ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze
Hoping everything goes right
Well, ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze-ze
Hoping everything goes right
Well, I fancy you around me everyday
And every night and every night, oh yeah

Well, here comes that bee again
Oh yeah, stinging me right through
It's on top of my head
Ze-ze-ze-ze
