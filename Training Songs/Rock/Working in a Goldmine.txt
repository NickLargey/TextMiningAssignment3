Our love's the sound
Of broken skies
Too blind to see
What lies inside
We love what shines
Before our eyes
Why can't we learn
What hides?

Waiting on the last train
Flicking through the highlights
Livin' in a suitcase
Positively uptight
Kissing in the full moon
Drowning in the sunshine
Walking on a tightrope
And everything is gonna be just fine
'cause I believe in your heart of gold
Automatically sunshine
Yeah glitter, glitter everywhere
Like working in a goldmine
And we believe that there's a heart beats on
In the dark of the close down
Yeah glitter, glitter everywhere
Like working in a goldmine

And time not tied
Is time to feed
We lose our pride
We spill our seed
The worst of us
Escape so slow
The best of us
Just goes

They'll make you work for everything
Never let it roll
Never let it swing
Take control and let your heart sing
