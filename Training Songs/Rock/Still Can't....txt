Still can't recognize the way I feel, I feel, I feel
Know what you said to me was real
And you still can't find the strength to apologize, gize, gize, lies
You just go on laughin' and tellin' everyone lies

'Cause you wanted it all
You wanted it all, you wanted it all
No, and there's nothin' at all
There's nothin' at all, there's nothin' at all, no

Maybe if you could see beyond your nose, your nose, your nose
Who knows
Let you know what had happened surely showed
But you can [Incomprehensible] that your attitude, I do, I do
And you went on laughin' and shoutin' it all too soon

'Cause you wanted it all
You wanted it all, you wanted it all
No, and there's nothin' at all
There's nothin' at all, there's nothin' at all, no

Still can't recognize the way I feel, I feel, I feel
Have to know if what you said to me was real
And you still can't find the strength to apologize, gize, gize, gize lies
You just go on laughin' and tellin' everyone lies

'Cause you wanted it all
You wanted it all, you wanted it all
No, and there's nothin' at all
There's nothin' at all, there's nothin' at all, oh

Wanted it all, wanted it all
You wanted it all
Wanted it all, wanted it all
You wanted it all
