Everybody says they want a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
My account doesn't go that high
It doesn't mean you have to say goodbye to me

I can't promise you a million bucks
But I can promise I'll be good to you
Everybody wants a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you

Day one, we'd go fishing
Dollar movies on day two
Days three and four, we'd spend in bed
Just like we used to do

A million days with you would go by much too fast
But I've got a million ways
To make our friendship to last
I've got a million ways

Everybody says they want a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
My account doesn't go that high
But it doesn't mean you have to say goodbye to me

Day five, we would ride our bikes
Camping on day six
Days seven and eight, I'd show you
How much I love you

A million days with you would go by much too fast
But I've got a million ways to make our friendship to last
I've got a million ways
Everybody says they want a million bucks

But I'd rather have a million days with you
My account doesn't go that high
It doesn't mean you have to say goodbye to me
I can't promise you a million bucks

But I can promise I'll be good to you
Everybody wants a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
A million days with you, a billion days with you
