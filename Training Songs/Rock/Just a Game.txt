Wizards of a modern age cast spells of electric power
But the corporate strings that make them dance
Lead up to an ivory tower
There sit the fates in solitude, far from the public eye
No one ever sees them smile and nothing makes them cry

Welcome to the kingdom, the land of bought and sold
A world of real-life fantasy where truths are seldom told
Try hard to remember all that glitters is not gold
You can pay the piper, but you cannot buy his soul

[Chorus]
It's just a game, you're in it all the way
It's just a game, don't let yourself slip away
It's such a shame, I heard somebody say
It's just a game, and all I can do is play

What you do choose, now, what do you believe, now
Who are you gonna trust?
All you dreams and fancy schemes
Just crumble into dust

Calm and cool and computerized to calculate and collect
We wait and watch and wonder
Just which puppet they'll select

Like the moth, too near the flame,
Who learned his truth too late
We're all too deep into the game
That is the master of our fate

The poets and the pipers have got their motives
And you've got yours, no doubt
And so the game continues
That's what it's all about

[Chorus]
