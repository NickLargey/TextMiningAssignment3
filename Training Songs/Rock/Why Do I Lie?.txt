i would love to be better
i would love to be free
i would love to be perfect
when you look at me
but instead i'm still crying
yes instead i'm still lying
sad to say i'm still trying
not to be me
when i see all the weakness
that i turned into sickness
i still think i can slide
just fine on the ice
it's not easy to be honest
sometimes i'm just astonished
how hard it can be to be true
 
why do i lie?
is it just to get by
if i give up my lines
will i die?
if fortunes are favored
then i am in labor
and i'm trying so hard
to leave lying behind

i don't want to be hazy
i don't think that i'm crazy
but i've had some moments
where i am not sure
and if you can forgive me
for just being human
then i will try harder
to keep my words pure

i could be on the border
it could be a disorder
honestly i think
that i can come clean
and all of my stories might even be boring
if i can tell you
what they all mean

why do i lie?
is it just to get by
if i give up my lines
will i die?
if fortunes are favored
then i am in labor
and i'm trying so hard
to leave lying behind
