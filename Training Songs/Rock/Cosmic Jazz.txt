I know your name, you told me,
It's a cloak and dagger tune.
Make love to you every full moon, baby,
When the day is through.
Use your magic carefully,
The danger creeps up slow.
Intuition can serve you well,
Or fool you when it's time to go.

Come stealin' like a thief,
Now I'm shakin' like a leaf.
Screamin' out, ¡°t's comin' soon!'
Yeah, yeah, the crescent moon.

Cosmic jazz is all around,
Keeps my feet on the ground.
Overload, shake down,
Gotta go, oh, gotta go.

About this premonition,
It contains a spell.
Stays just like a vision,
Showin he's not doin' well.

Spot carved from a finger,
The witches paint it black.
A wizard tied up by her love,
But now he wants his wallet back.

Been stealin' like a thief,
Now I'm shakin' like a leaf.
Screami' out, it's comin' soon!'
Yeah, yeah, the crescent moon.

Cosmic jazz is all around,
Keeps my face on the ground.
Overload, shake down,
Gotta go, oh, gotta go.

Repeat twice.
