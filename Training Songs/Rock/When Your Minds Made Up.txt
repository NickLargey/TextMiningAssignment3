So, if you want something
And you call, call
Then'll come running
To fight, and I'll be at your door
When there's something worth running for

When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to change it
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to stop it

You see, you're just like everyone
When the shit falls all you want to do is run, away
And hide all by yourself
When you're far from me, there's nothing else

When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to change it
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point even talking
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to fight it

So, if you ever want something
And you call, call
Then I'll come running.
