Scarred open wounds
The needle, it dances and glows through the skin
Under lights that burn so bright
'Round the roads we see at night

The light has faded through the windows
The light has faded through the windows

Destroy to destroy landscapes
People you know, people you don't
Wards of empty patients
Just to sleep away the days

The light has faded through the windows
The light has faded through the windows

Last call on the waterfront
As the kids all stare into thin air
Last call on the waterfront
As the kids all stare into thin air

You wait for your breath to come
Your breath to come
Your breath to come
Your breath to come

The fantasy of reality
Goes rushing through your head
Just a symphony of a restless dream
Down to your fingertips

Last call on the waterfront
As the kids all stare into thin air
Last call on the waterfront
As the kids all stare into thin air

You wait for your breath to come
