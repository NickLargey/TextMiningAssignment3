With every little smile do you know me better
You know I'm never what I seem
'Cause I don't worry about the future
My days, they pass just like a dream
Are you scared of what you're seeing?
Does it make me seem so cruel?
And now I'll ask you if I hurt you?
That's just something that I do

[Chorus]
If you don't listen to me
You'll stay the same
And you're just gonna fade away
Fade away
If you don't listen to me
You'll stay the same
And you're just gonna fade away
Fade away

Listen, hear the secret in my voice
Are you so gone that you can't hear?
Scared I forgot you for no reason?
Maybe that's what you can't bear
Give me more than words and gestures
Give me something I can keep
That's how you get to love forever
That's why you've gotta try and see

[Chorus]

If you don't listen to me
You'll stay the same
If you don't listen to me
You'll stay the same
If you don't listen to me
You'll stay the same
And you'll fade away
