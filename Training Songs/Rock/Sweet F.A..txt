I was rollin? down the window of my car
And I was thinkin? where the game had got me so far

Doesn't matter where you're goin? or where you're comin? from
Or is your life just like a grain of sand?
F*ck all else

Well, I was rollin? down the highway of my dreams
And I was wonderin? 'bout Hollywood sunsets and the silver screen

Doesn't matter where you're goin? or where you're comin? from
Or is your life just like a grain of sand?
F*ck all else

Doesn't matter where we're goin? or where we're comin? from
Or is your life just like a grain of sand?
F*ck all else

Rollin? down the highway in a dream
I was rollin? down the highway in a dream
Just rollin? down the highway in a dream

Just rollin?, just rollin'
Just rollin?, just rollin'
