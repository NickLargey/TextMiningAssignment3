Introducing happiness.
Happy, yes!

Look who's found you.
Look who stole you from your nest...
And in theiving, we stole you from an icy death.
November's cold and lonely here,
But not at home and I'm so happy
I could make you happy.

Introducing happiness.

What do I owe you,
Or do you owe me more?
A better deal than this
There's never been before.
I must appear a mess to
Have to write a song about you.
You make me...

Introducing all this love into our house.
While your brother lives with mother
And your sister loves it in Upstate New York (on a farm).

When I see you
Throw the kitchen window wide,
I take a second to thank you.
I feel so good inside.
Although I go away sometimes,
I take your picture in my mind
So when I'm yards and yards away
I am reminded not to stray.
Unless I've climbed the tallest tree.
Only that will keep me.

Introducing happiness.
Introducing happiness.
Introducing...you.
