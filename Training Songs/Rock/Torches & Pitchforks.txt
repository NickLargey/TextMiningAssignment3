They come middle of the night so you better run
Torches and pitchforks and you know what this is
They cry, baby don't you know that you care and divide?
I pray on my knees just to go another day
Another day

Say what you need to say, you gotta get it right
Take some time like you used to
Say what you need to say, you gotta get it right
Just take some time

Oh no, middle finger up so you'd better go
I'll stay, burning night into the day
The day

Say what you need to say, you gotta get it right
Take some time like you used to
Say what you need to say, you gotta get it right
Just take some time

Don't you wanna say it like you used to?
Don't you wanna say it like you used to?
Don't you wanna say it like you used to?
Don't you wanna

Say, say what you need to say, you gotta get it right
You gotta take some time

Don't you wanna say it like you used to?
Don't you wanna say it like you used to?
Don't you wanna say it like you used to?
Don't you wanna say?

They come, middle finger up but we never run
Torches and pitchforks but you know it's okay
Okay
