I'll lock myself away
And not face one more day
On the streets of this town
And all I've got to lose
Is a feelin' called the blues
And a little old frown
I signed your dotted line
And did my best at tryin'
Givin' all I could give
And all I've gotten back
Is this feelin' that I lack
What I'm needing to live

And you say you don't see it
When a grown man starts to cry
You turn your face away and you walk on by

I found myself a girl
Who brightened up my world
From December to May
And then ran off with Jim
But I'll defer to him
And his purple beret
'Cause he knows how to wheel and deal
And not to feel when he's knockin' you down
And I know he'll succeed
'Cause thatâ€™s just what you need
On the streets of this town

And you say you don't see it
When a grown man starts to cry
You turn your face away and you walk on by

I'll lock myself away
And not face one more day
On the streets of this town
And all I've got to lose
Is a feelin' called the blues
That's been going around
I fit your crazy norm and wore your uniform
Where you told me to go
And got back in return
This here feelin' that I've learned
What the Indians know

And you say you don't see it
When a grown man starts to cry
You turn your face away and you walk on by
By, by
