Yeah yeah ya
Came from the skies
Burst through the gates
With no mercy or disguise

With their hearts set out in flames
I know; I've seen the master plan
Well I'm just a man
(I am just a man)

I'm not giving in
All the people understand
'Cause they all fell down and prayed
I know;

I've seen the master plan
Kill the President
They killed the President
They killed the President

Came from the skies
(Came from the skies)
In all shades of green
We can always justify

We can measure up your dreams
I know; 
I've seen the master plan
Kill the President

They Killed the President
Yeah yeah ya
Yeah yeah ya
Yeah yeah ya

They killed the President
they've killed the President
I'm just a man
