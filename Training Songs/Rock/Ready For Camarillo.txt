I'm 'bout ready for Camarillo
My head is goin' fast
I'm like some ship out on the ragin' sea
That's losin' its mainmast
Can't find my direction
My thoughts are so confused
My problem's that there is no easy way
To heal the soul that's been abused
Sought to find the diff'rence
Between ghosts and reality
But who can tell me what's my name?
I mean, what is really me?
In my dreams it seems so simple
Such an easy way to be
I'm gonna lose myself in someone else
Just to find that way to me
Find that way to me
Yeah, in my dreams it seems so simple
Such an easy way to be
I'm gonna lose myself in someone else
Just to find that way to me
Find that way to me
Lord, just about ready
Yeah, just about ready
Can you hear me now?
I'm ready 
I'm about ready
Huh, I'm yours
