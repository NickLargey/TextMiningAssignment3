Well you look fantastic in your cast-off casket
At least the thing still runs
This nine to five bullshit don't let you forget
Whose suicide you're on.
I'm the one you trust in
and the world owes you nothing
You really, really want it that bad
You gotta come get it
It's your life, go live it
'Round the corner, give it some gas
If you want it that bad
Be a world class fad
Remember leave a trail of crumbs
If you want it that bad
You're a world class fad
Remember where you started from
Don't be sad
You're a world class fad
You wax poetic about things pathetic
As long as you look so cute
Believe these hills are starting to roll 
Believe these stars are starting to shoot
If you want it that bad
Be a world class fad
Remember leave a trail of crumbs
If you want it that bad
You're a world class fad
Remember where you started from
Don't be sad
You're a world class fad
And the pressures gonna build yeah
Higher and higher
Something's gotta move here
Ain't knocking on wood
You're foxin' the cove? Oh yeah
Don't be sad you're a world class fad
Well you look fantastic in your cast-off casket
At least the thing still flies
I believe this road is starting to wind
And where we're going, starting to hide
If you want it that bad
You're a world class fad
Remember leave a trail of crumbs
You want it that bad
Be a world class fad
Remember where you started from
If you want it that bad
A world class fad
If you want it that bad
You're a world class fad
Don't be sad
You're a world class fad
Don't be sad
You're a world class fad
Don't be sad
That you're a world class fad
