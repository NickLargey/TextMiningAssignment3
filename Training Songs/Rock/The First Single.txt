I can't stand to think about a heart so big it hurts like hell. Oh my God I gave my best but for three more years to end like this. Well do you want to fall apart? I can't stop if you can't start. Do you want to fall apart? I could if you can try to fix what I've undone. Cause I hate what I've become.
(Chorus) You know me, oh you think you do, you just don't seem to see. I've been waiting all this time to be something that I can't define. So let's cause a scene. Clap our hands and stomp our feet. Or something, yeah something. I've just gotta get myself over me.
I could stand to do without all the people I have left behind. What's the point in going around when its straight line baby. A straight line down. So let's make a list of who we need and it's not much if any thing. Lets make a list of who we need and well throw it away cause we don't need anyone, no we don't need anyone.
And I hate what I've become. You know the night life is just not for me, cause all you really need are a few good friends. I don't want to go out and be on my own, you know they started something I can't stand. You leave for the city, well count me out. Cause all this time is wasted on everything I've done.
