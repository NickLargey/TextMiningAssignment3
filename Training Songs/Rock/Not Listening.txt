You can say whatever you like I'm not listening anymore
It makes no odds whatever you say I'm not listening anyway
You can scream until you are blue in the face
I'm not listening anymore
So don't bother - save your breath - I'm not listening anymore

Just shut up!
Stamp your feet, cry like a child I'm not listening anymore
Scream the whole house down I'm not listening anyway
I've had enough - my ears are blocked
Your views are measured in decibels
In one ear - out the other...

Why don't you shut up!
You can say whatever you like I'm not listening anymore
It makes no odds whatever you say I'm not listening anyway
Stamp your feet, cry like a child I'm not listening anymore
So don't bother - don't waste your breath

I'm not listening... I'm not listening anymore
