Free that girl
The one that glows she knows
She rules the world
Free that girl
The one that glows she knows
She rules the world

She said
Call me sister rose
I'm at war with all these posers
And these frauds
I want 'em out
Let freedom reign
Let hope stand firm on fields of doubt
Then she led me by the hand
And took me to the promised land

Free that girl
The one that glows she knows
She rules the world

She said I'm just like a rose
I'm beautiful and I can hurt you
With my thorns
Don't squeeze too tight
Cause I can blow up in ya face like dynamite
