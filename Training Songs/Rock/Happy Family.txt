VERSE 1
It would be nice if we could all just sit together
It would be great if we could have a cup of everything
What would you do with everything?

It would be lovely to see all your faces smiling
It would be wonderful if all the ---- I sing about was happening, was happening, was happening

CHORUS
Then it turns out to be with one happy familyyyyyy
But all these families break,
Everybody's on the take,
All that matters today's the kind of money that you maaaaake, the money that you maaaaake.
Yeah all these families break, and everybody's on the take,
All that matters today's the kind of money that you maaaaake, the money that you maaaaake.

VERSE 2
It would be nice if we could all just live together
That's a hand-in-hand situation
It would be great if we could feel a bit of sympathy
Yeah sympathy for you and me
It would be lovely if we'd all stood up together,
It's gotta be like that commercial on tv
It would be wonderful if all this ---- I sing about was happening, was happening, happening yeah.

CHORUS

Oohahooooo

It would be nice if we could all just sit together
It would be great if we could have a little fun
It would be nice if we could be a happy family today.
