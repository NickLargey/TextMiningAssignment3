Ooh, rain be pourin' down
Every day my mind is cloudy
Got enough tears to fill the sea
They say that I'm a drag
Tell me, I be lookin' sad and nobody wants to party with me
And it's because of you, the shitty things you do
The low ways that you treat me, endlessly
I was gonna leave you 'til you kissed it (Kissed it)
I wanted to leave you, then you kissed it (Kissed it)
I was gonna leave you, then you dipped it (Dipped it)
Baby you fixed it (Fixed it) when you kissed it (Kissed it)
I don't wanna fight baby
Kiss it (Kiss it) 'cause I miss it (Miss it)
Make it alright (Alright)
Boy you light a fire in me

Ooh, you treat me like a dog
Tell me all I do is wrong
Treat me like I wear a training bra
You push my love away, then you come to save the day
Then the next thing I be seein' ya with other girls in the club
It don't feel like lovin' me
I was gonna leave you 'til you kissed it (Kissed it)
I wanted to leave you, then you kissed it (Kissed it)
I was gonna leave you, then you dipped it (Dipped it)
Baby you fixed it (Fixed it) when you kissed it (Kissed it)
I don't wanna fight baby
Kiss it (Kiss it) 'cause I miss it (Miss it)
Make it alright (Alright)
Boy you light a fire in me

One more time, love thing

They bring you down, they build you up
