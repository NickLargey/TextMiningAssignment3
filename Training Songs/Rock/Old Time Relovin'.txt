People like you and I always hurt one another,
Until there's nothing left to hurt no more.
You and I will always hear different drummers,
You just go your way, I'll go mine.
 
You and I always take from each other,
Until there's nothing left to give no more.
You and I are just like lightning and thunder,
We never let the sun just shine.
 
I need some old time relovin',
You know I need it so bad.
Gimme some old time relovin',
Just like my old daddy always had.

Just like my old sister said she had.
 
What did she have?
