If I walk down this hallway, tonight,
It's too quiet,
So I Pad through the dark
And call you on the phone
Push your old numbers
And let your house ring
Til I wake you ghost.
Let him walk down your hallway
It's not this quiet
Slide down your receiver
Sprint across the wire
Follow my number
Slide into my hand.

It's the blaze across my nightgown
It's the phone's ring.

I think last night
You were driving circles around me.

I can't drink this coffee
Til I put you in my closet
Let him shoot me down
Let him call me off
I take it from his whisper
You're not that tough.
