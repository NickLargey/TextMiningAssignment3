One Night, One Kiss
Only One Feeling Exist
One Breath, One Touch
But I've Never Felt This Much

And I, I want to Share My Whole Life With You 
I want to Keep On Dreaming Dreams And With You
Make Them All Come True
As I Lay Inside Your Arms And 
Rest My Head Upon Your Shoulder
Believe Me There's Nothing That
I Can't Do Whenever We're Together

One Time, One Place
With The Warmest Sweet Embrace
One Joy, One Pain
Only True Love Can Sustain

And I, I want to Share My Whole Life With You 
I want to Keep On Dreaming Dreams And With You
Make Them All Come True
As I Lay Inside Your Arms And 
Rest My Head Upon Your Shoulder
Believe Me There's Nothing That
I Can't Do Whenever We're Together

I Can Never Be The Same Girl That I Used To Be
I'm Stronger Now 'Cause 
You've Made Me Face The Fear In Me
And You Don't Have To Prove Yourself At All
And Making Wrong Things Right
The Fact That You Love Me
Makes Everything All Right

And I, I want to Share My Whole Life With You 
I want to Keep On Dreaming Dreams And With You
Make Them All Come True
As I Lay Inside Your Arms And 
Rest My Head Upon Your Shoulder
Believe Me There's Nothing That
I Can't Do Whenever We're Together

And I, I want to Share, Share My Whole Life With You 
I want to Keep On Dreaming, Dreams Do Come True
As I Lay Inside Your Arms And 
Rest My Head Upon Your Shoulder
Believe Me There's Nothing That
I Can't Do Whenever We're Together

Honey Keep On Dreaming
Nothing That I Can't Do
Nothing That I Can't Do
Only When I'm With You
