I've paid my money and I'm taking my chances 
I've done my share of city dances 
If I fall I'll just play on through 

I deal with love the best as I'm able 
I keep my cards on top of the table 
I don't spend much of my time blue 

[Chorus:]
And now here's you 
And now here's you. 
Here is you 

There's never been anything that any girl could say 
There's never been one got to me anyway 
And I sure thought I knew my heart too 
I got eyes but I didn't see you coming 
You could have been just any woman 
And if you are why am I so blue 

It must be you 

[Chorus] 

When you're not looking is when you're found 
Love comes looking to spin you around, 
Round and round 

I've been in love too much too deep 
If you don't need loving 
What's it gonna be 
It's gotta be, yeah yeah 

[Chorus]
