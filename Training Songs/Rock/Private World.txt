Oh, break-down

To a private world
To a private world

Well, I just lost a love, I'm bound, she drowned or something else
'Cause I get cool and lonely, feelin' sorry for myself

I need a private world
A private world

Oh, you call that drivin' then you see us dream
I call it laughing, tryin' hard not to scream

Private world
Oh, a private world

Oh, the joint start shakin', it's ready to crumble
The boys are dukin', lookin' for a rumble

Need a private world
I need a private world

One that is movin'
At least I'm movin', better shut that door
Private world, private girl, private world
Better keep it confidential

Private world
Whoa oh-oh, private world

Oh, you know I want some money, she replies
When uptown comes downtown, better take her for a ride

Into the private world
I think it's a private world

Oh, baby call, call my name
I'm tryin to explain', that I'm not the same

In a private world
Oh, a private world

'Cause I just lost a love, I'm bound, she drowned or something else
'Cause I get cool and lonely, feelin sorry for myself

I need a private world
Oh, a private world

One that is movin'
At least I'm movin', shut that door
Private world, private girl, private world
You better keep it confidential

You got to keep it confidential
You got to keep it confidential
When I says hush
Child, dont you cry
I'm beggin' you hush
And dry those tears from your eyes
You gotta hush
Dontcha know you gotta hush

Oh, alright
