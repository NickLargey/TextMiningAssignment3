He is alive and kicking and screaming
He calls it gymnastics, calls it velocity
And you spend twenty years climbing and never change your mind or change direction
And you call it the path of least resistance
You have everything you ever need

So you sing if you can't beat them join them
All the way up to your floor
Memorize and repeat it
And sing it like you mean it

They are talking to me and I'm nowhere to be found
There's somewhere else I had to be
Call it necessity, mutiny, entropy
They think I'm down
They tell me I should brighten up
But that's just 'cause they don't know an explosion when they see one

And they sing if you can't beat them join them
All the way up to your floor
Memorize and repeat it
And sing it like you mean it
All the way home to your front door
Yeah you better believe it
Sing it like you mean it
