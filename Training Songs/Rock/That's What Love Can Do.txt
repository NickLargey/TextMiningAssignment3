Change a cool, cool man into a nervous wreck, baby,
That's what love can do.
With a heart of gold chained around your neck,
Doesn't mean love's not for you.
Though it don't come easy, take it honey, this may be your chance.
The night goes on forever, when you're lookin' for romance.

Make an old man young, make a young man old,
Baby that's how love can be.
Change a hard rock heart into a jelly roll,
While your warm blood starts to freeze.
When you start to love, you feel a change of personality.
You used to be so mad, but now how crazy can you be?
And now you're stumbling like a jailbird on the run,
Love arrests you and you don't know what you've done.

I ba-ba-babble like a tongue-tied man, honey, that's what love can do.
I talk sweet talk no one can understand, baby, that's what love can do.
I shake and shiver, baby, cry you a river, honey, that's what love can do.

Well, you wake feeling good, but you sleep so bad,
And you keep cryin' all the time.
To your friends' concern, you tell 'em I'm not mad,
But you think that you've lost your mind.
Though it don't come easy, take it honey, this may be your chance.
The night goes on forever, when you're lookin' for romance.

I ba-ba-babble like a tongue-tied man, honey, that's what love can do.
I talk sweet talk no one can understand, baby, that's what love can do.
I shake and shiver, baby, cry you a river, honey, that's what love can do.

And now you're mumblin'and you don't know what you're saying,
You feel so worried 'til she looks your way again.

I ba-ba-babble like a...
