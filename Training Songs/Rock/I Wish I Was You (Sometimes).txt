Stop messing around it's the countdown to ignition 
Bring the hammer down and be done with the twenty questions 
We got nothing done you just gotta love that don't you 
We're still having fun so at least it's a start 

And nothing comes close to this tell me it's true 
If I had just one wish, I wish I was you 

I try to call connect but I'm still getting disconnected 
I've come to expect so much less than I expected 

And nothing comes close to this tell me it's true 
If I had just one wish, I wish I was you 
Sometimes I wish I was you 

Stop messing around 'cause we must be missing something
