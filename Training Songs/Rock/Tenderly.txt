The air is cooling and the sun's going down
The day's been grueling in this dusty old town
My body's aching for what you do to me

Tenderly tenderly
Tenderly tenderly

The words are easy when the language is love
You know exactly what I'm thinking of
My heart is hungry for what you do to me

Tenderly tenderly
Tenderly tenderly

I've had lovers go up in flames
Been with others who've had no names
God I've waited patiently
For someone who really touches me

I feel your fingers and their touch is like fire
Sensations linger then they turn to desire
My body's aching for what you do to me

Tenderly tenderly
Tenderly tenderly
