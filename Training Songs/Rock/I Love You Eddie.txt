(Hey hey hey, hey hey hey)
I love you, Eddie, but so does Betty
'Cause you're such a handsome guy
Who's gonna kiss you, who's gonna miss you
Who's gonna laugh and who's gonna cry

(I love you Eddie, but so does Betty)
I love you, Eddie, but so does Betty
Tell me, which one will it be
Make no mistake now, one heart will break now
Do you love her, or do you love me
(I love you Eddie, but so does Betty)

Last night you took her to a movie show
Tonight you took me to a dance
Each day I'm hopin' that you'll let me know
That I've got the very best chance

I love you, Eddie, but so does Betty
Tell me, which one will it be
Make no mistake now, one heart will break now
Do you love her, or do you love me
(I love you Eddie, but so does Betty)

Woah
(Hey hey hey, hey hey hey)
Woah
(I love you Eddie, but so does Betty)
