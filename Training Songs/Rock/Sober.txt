Well I'm
So scared I might fall down
I'm feeling sober now
But I still can't feel the ground

Tried
I tried to make demands
But it's not that hard to sense
That things are different now

Now that I don't feel so lonesome
Anymore
Feel so lonesome
Now that I am not afraid

At all
If you put your arms around me
I won't fall
Now that I am not afraid

At all
But time
It takes time to make amends
Though it's so hard to make sense

'Cause I'm feeling sober now
But I'm
Too small to take defence
Though it's not that hard to sense

That things are different now
Now that I don't feel so lonesome
Anymore
Feel so lonesome

Now that I am not afraid
At all
If you put your arms around me
I won't fall

Now that I am not afraid
At all
At all
Na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na
I'm not afraid
At all
