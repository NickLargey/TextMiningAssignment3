here's one more raw emotion to contend with
one last bullet to defend the fort with
i was drowning in complacency's cheap perfume
yeah licking my wounds

yeah one more specimen one with real potential
if the suit fits well you're looking quite presidential
i picked your face out of some police photos
yeah steps of the wicked overthrown

come have your way with me
come have your way with me
there's nothing left
there's nothing left to see

salome's over-weight she broke jacob's ladder
where the corpse is honey you know the vultures gather
yes i've always been taught that love was worth keeping
yeah truth worth believing
