Yeah, I'm sick of this
England's shit
It's slashing down
We are drowned

Star is here
Drinking beer
Star is scrawled
On my wall

C.I.D.
They follow me
I kidnap Star
In my car

A T.V.R.
We'll drive to Prague
And stop at Mars
And we'll be

Taking Star to L.A.
We'll drive to Vegas for the day
We want to sit in the sun
And take it easy

Take it easy
Yeah, Mam's got cake
Belly ache
Feeling sick

Through Kuwait
Stole a tank
Drove to France
Star's amazed

In a trance
M53
Hit a tree
Crashed my car

I killed Star
Stowaway
On a ship
Dodge the pigs

What a trip
Taking Star to L.A.
We'll drive to Vegas for the day
We want to sit in the sun

And take it easy
Take it easy
