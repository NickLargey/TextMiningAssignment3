I've packed a cooler and a change of clothes
Let's jump and see how far it goes
You got my heart and your daddy's boat
We got all night to make it float
We could sit on the shore
We could just be friends
Or we could jump in

Whole world could change in a minute
Just one kiss could stop this spinning
We could think it through
But I don't want to, if you don't want to
We could keep things just the same
Leave here the way we came, with nothing to lose
But I don't want to, if you don't want to

I got your ring around my neck
And a couple of nights I don't regret
You got a dream of a degree
And a shirt that smells like me
Yeah, we both got dreams we could chase alone
Or we could make our own

Whole world could change in a minute
Just one kiss could stop this spinning
We could think it through
But I don't want to, if you don't want to
We could keep things just the same
Leave here the way we came, with nothing to lose
But I don't want to, if you don't want to

Never waste another day
Wonderin' what you threw away
Holdin' me, holdin' you
I don't want to if you don't want to

We could keep things just the same
Leave here the way we came, with nothing to lose
But I don't want to
But you don't want to

But I want you
