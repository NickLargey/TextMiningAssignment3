Remove the tie and you will find
That the details are now complete
And hope is a word that we both hope for
The changing seasons we both need
And You're so beautiful when you shine for me
And You're so beautiful when you shine, oh 
There's not much left, it's been so long

And this reflection has not been kind
So we place our hands in these foreign skies 
It's so easy to forget
You're so beautiful when you shine for me
You're so beautiful when you shine for me
You're so beautiful when you shine for me
You're so beautiful when you shine, oh
