Young and rich 
Everything I desire 
Light bulbs with shades 
In every room 
And work is play--believe me 
Nothing must come too hard 
It comes in the mail 
Most everyday 

I could respect a man who had it all 
And he'd toss the ball away 
I know I'm not that kind 
I wouldn't mind to 
Have a chance thrown my way 

Famous friends 
Big parties for me 
Every night like tonight 
Am I a fool to want it all 

I could respect a man who had it all 
And he'd toss the ball away 
Because you know I'm not that kind 
I wouldn't mind to 
Have a chance thrown my way 

Young and rich 
With everything I desire 
Everything I need 
In every room 

With everything I desire 
Filling every room 
Everything I need--and maybe 
Some more things I don't need, you know 
Filling every room 
Everything I need 
Filling every room
