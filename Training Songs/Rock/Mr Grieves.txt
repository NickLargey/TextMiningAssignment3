Hope everything is alright hope everything is alright
What's that floating in the water
Oh Neptune's only daughter
I believe

In Mr. grieves
Pray for a man in the middle
One that talks like Doolittle
I believe 

In Mr. grieves
Do you have another opinion
Do you have another opinion
La la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la

Got bombed got frozen 
Got finally off to a finally dozing
I believe
In Mr. Grieves

Do you have another opinion
Opinion
Do you have another opinion
Do you have another opinion

You can cry you can mope
But can you swing from a good rope
Oh I believe
In Mr. Grieves

Hope everything is alright 
Hope everything is alright
