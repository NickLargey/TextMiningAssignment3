The cards are on the table.
The tingle's in my hands.
I know you'm going to win.
Play my every hand.
Black Jack Table, Roulette Wheel.
Each sin my every vice.
When I meet the dealer,
Tonight it feels just right.
It's in the cards
The future's in the cards.
My heart is feeling strong
My nerves they feel like steel.
Lights go flash, in my eyes.
Ready to spin the wheel.
I hold my breath, I think a song.
I know nothing will go wrong.
I feel my life go round again.
It's in the cards
The future's in the cards.
The wheel is spinning round.
Four aces in my hand.
The tingle's getting stronger now.
This win will be so grand.
The cards are on the table.
This bluff I call to see.
Nothing beats the hand I hold.
This win was meant to be.
