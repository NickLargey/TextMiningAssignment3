I met a man who bought up land
Wherever his feet would tread
He asked me to El Paso
Said I could stay on his spread
He has horses and cows and tractors and plows
And all kinds of money to burn
But how can I get to Texas
When my wheels won't turn

There was a lady from Spain
Who had a fine frame
Then she moved to Hollywood
She said come and stay for a week and a day
I said I did not think I could
She said the sunshine's fine
I could spend some time
There are lessons I could learn
But how can I get to L.A.
When my wheels won't turn
How can I get to L.A.
When my wheels won't turn

I'm standin' still
'Cause my wheels won't turn
I'm not in love
And my fuel won't burn for you

At a college of knowledge I tried to learn
All the tricks to beat the system
I'd hide nooks and memorize my books
'Till I knew I'd never never miss them
Eventually I got my degree
But the real thing I did learn
You just can't hit your home run
If your wheels won't turn

There was a man in white
Who did things right
Now he watches from above
He said here's the way that I want you to pray
And the way to live and love
So I saw the light and did things right
But the candle would not burn
Tell me, how can I get to heaven
If my wheels won't turn
How can I get to heaven
If my wheels won't turn
