This one goes out to the lonely
This one goes out to the broken ones
This one goes out to the angels
Fallin' from the sky

This one goes out to your brother
This one goes out to your mother
This one goes out to your sister
And this one's for you

And all the lovers and believers
And the ones who've been betrayed
To all the fighters, all the dreamers
And the ones who've not been saved

Don't lose your faith
I know you're right
Don't be scared of being lonely
I'm here with you

This one goes out to the lonely
This one goes out to the broken hearts
This one goes out to the people
Left behind, waiting to be found

I've seen your shadow in the dark
I've seen this struggle in your life
Feels like nothing comes out right

For all the lovers and believers
And the ones who've been betrayed
To all the fighters, all the dreamers
And the ones who've not been saved

For all the lovers, and believers
And the ones who've not been heard

I know you're right
You've got that something in your eyes
I know that you will be alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't be scared of being lonely
I'm here with you

For all the lovers and believers
For all the fighters and the dreamers
And the ones who've not been saved

For all the lovers and believers
And the ones who've been betrayed
To all the fighters, all the dreamers
And the ones who've not been saved

For all the lovers and believers
And the ones who've been betrayed
For all the fighters, all the dreamers
And the ones who've not been saved

Don't lose your faith
I know you're right
Don't be scared of being lonely

For all the lovers and believers
And the ones who've been betrayed
