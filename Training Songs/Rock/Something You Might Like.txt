Everybody wants to know
How you feel
So maybe you could sing
Singing's not a sin

Everybody wants to know
What you're doing here
Maybe you could dance
Come on shake your pants

Everybody wants to know
Where you coming from
Did you fly here in a ship
Ride a black hole for a click

Everybody wants to know
If you're sweet
Please don't shoot us with a gun
Or that laser by your feet

Here something that you might like

Everybody wants to know
If you're happy of ere
Would you like to buy a home
Live in London or in Rome

Everybody wants to know
If you're our friend
In the end

Was it something I said
Was it something I said
That you could never forget
That you could never forgive
