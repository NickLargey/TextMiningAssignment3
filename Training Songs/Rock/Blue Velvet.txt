I wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

I wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were my eyes
Warmer than may my tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours the love I held tightly
Feelings the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when he left
Gone was the glow of blue velvet

But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet
Through my tears

Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet
Through my tears
