(Robert Palmer)

We got to keep in touch
We fit just like a glove girl
Between the two of us 
There always will be love there

I don't mind if I don't hear a word from you in years
If you blow my candle out I will fall to tears

Knowing your still lovin' makes me want it to be real

Darlin' you've just got to let me know the way you feel

We got to keep in touch
We fit just like a glove girl
Between the two of us 
There always will be love there

I know when I'm kissin' you you're easin' from behind
Too much solitude can make a body lose his mind
When I get that burnin' need to share what we have found
I have faith that you will let me know you're still around

We got to keep in touch
We fit just like a glove girl
Between the two of us 
There always will be love there

Keep in touch girl
Keep in touch girl
Keep in touch girl
Keep in touch girl
Keep in touch girl
Keep in touch girl
