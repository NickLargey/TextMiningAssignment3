It can do just what you want
Summer tan, these little symptoms you got
Water cool these bones down, you're so hot
Waves can break these feelings like they're not

So, sweetly lover won't you let me know?
Like a circle round and round we go
Now we see what we're gonna regret
How did the water get so cold?

So, we soldier on, with burning feet we run
And here our bodies lay with our own road so far away
Water cool these bones down, it's so hot
Waves can break these feelings like they're not

So, sweetly lover won't you let me know?
Like a circle round and round we go
Now we see what we're gonna regret
How did the water get so cold?

Sweetly lover won't you let me know
Now we see what we're gonna forget
Never know what we're gonna regret

Like a circle round and round we go
Now we see what we're gonna regret
How did the water get so cold?
