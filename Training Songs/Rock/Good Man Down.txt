Well a good man’s getting hard to find these days but there still a few around.
A whole world looks up to a good man, It’s hard to keep him down.
So if you’re going out looking for a good, good time,
But the boys all turn into clowns,
Focus your attention, don’t forget to mention,
No don’t forget to mention that the boys just love it when you dish it out.
Easy with the ones you’ve found.
And your wind up toys keep you busy for awhile until a good man comes around.

Well you can yell and scream, treat them mean, beat them up with words,
Throw them in the face you say.
Do this, do that what it is, where it’s at, anything to get you your way.
And you change your mood, cop an attitude, take them to the cleaners.
Just because you’re steaming, just because you’re hot,
Just because all the boys stop talking when you raise your voice.
Your temper ends up on the ground, you don’t mean nothing to a good man.
It’s hard to keep a good man down, down, down, down.
Well it’s hard to keep a good man down.

Go to war, slam doors, have a fit, throw shit, use every little trick you’ve found.
It don’t mean nothing to a good man,
Just because all the boys start shaking when the dishes fly,
Tremble as they crawl on the ground.
Well it’s hard to keep a good,
Hard to keep a good man down.
Yes it’s hard to keep a good man down.
