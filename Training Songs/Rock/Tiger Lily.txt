Sweet obscenity
Bring her back to me
Lost in her perfume
Think I'm gonna sue
Sweet obscenity
Didn't I know it
Didn't I call her name
Stale cigarettes
Crumble in your fingers
Caught with a drink in my hand

Edging to the door
Sweet obscenity
Didn't I know it
Didn't I call her name
Tiger lily girl
Standin' cross-eyed in the corner
Tiger lily girl
Standin toungue tied in the corner

Somethin' in her eye
Tells that I should try
Somethin' she might say
Tells right away
Somethin' in her eye
Didn't I know it
Didn't I call her name
Tiger lily girl
Standin' cross-eyed in the corner
Tiger lily girl
Standin toungue tied in the corner
