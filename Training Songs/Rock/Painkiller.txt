Started with a pain in my heart
That compromised my sanity
I was really fallin' apart
When this angel came and rescued me

She has a gift of healin' power
As it works on me for hours and hours
She’s a painkiller, she works on me
Painkiller, oh yeah, set me free

She lives all by herself now
In a bad neighborhood
But when she comes out tonight
She be lookin' mighty good

And right now I need her so much
She done ease my pain with just one touch
She’s a painkiller, she works on me
Painkiller, oh, set me free

She not the cure for all my ills
But when I hurt I know she will
She’s a painkiller, she works on me
Hey, painkiller, yeah, set me free

There’s a real fine line between addiction and love
But I know when the night time comes
I got no choice, I got to succumb to my
Painkiller, she works on me
Painkiller, ooh, set me free

Painkiller, set me free, hey, hey
Painkiller, yeah, yeah, yeah, work on
Work on me, work on me, work on me
Work on me, work on me, work on me
Work on me, work on me, ah yeah, work on me
