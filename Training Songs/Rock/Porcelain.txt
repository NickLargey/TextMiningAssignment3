I'm like porcelain
I'd break if you say anything
And when I'm taking a good look in the mirror
Thinking this is not happening

He needs aspirin
She can't stop thinking about him
She said she needs to lay down for just a minute
His face is all over this dirty town

Someone like you, it's a shame, we can work it through 
Watching you break in
Someone like you, it's a shame, we can work it through 
Just like porcelain

Oh pretty Kim
Please don't breed an ugly kin
Baby baby, you're naming all the colors
Makes no difference, it won't change a thing

Someone like you, it's a shame, we can work it through 
Watching you break in
Someone like you, it's a shame, we can work it through 
Just like porcelain

Somebody said it really doesn't matter what we do
Watching you break in
Someone like you, it's a shame, we can work it through 
Just like porcelain

Someone like you, it's a shame, we can work it through 
Watching you break in
Someone like you, it's a shame, we can work it through 
Just like porcelain

Somebody said it really doesn't matter what we do
Ain't nobody new
Someone like you, it's a shame, we can work it through 
Ain't no one like you

Nobody should tell you it doesn't matter what is true
Watching you break in
Nobody should tell you it doesn't matter what is true
Just like porcelain
