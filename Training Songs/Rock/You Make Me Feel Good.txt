You don't need any reason, do you baby
Surely you should know that by now
But if you need a reason, I'll give one to you
You make me feel good, you make me feel good

I don't need any reason when I hold you
I never do ask myself why
But if you need a reason, I'll give one to you
You make me feel good, you make me feel good

[Chorus:]
So good, so good, don't have to justify
Why I feel so good, so good, so good
Never thought could be so good to me

But if you need a reason, I'll give one to you
You make me feel good, you make me feel good

[Chorus]

You don't need any reason, do you baby
Surely you should know that by now
But if you need a reason, I'll give one to you
You make me feel good, you make me feel good
