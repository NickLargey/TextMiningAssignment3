when i hear the stories that you tell
it's make believe i know it
if i could only live inside your world
it's different there i know it 
it's so hard to keep from falling down 
you can always trust yourself
you're seeing things not all there
you're seeing things
every time i look into your eyes
a picture is completed
it's impossible to focus on the truth
it draws me in i can't leave
it's so hard to find the strength to fight
look beyond the ordinary things
the vision is not over
help me find the wonder in it all
you are my one reminder
now i know you've got a better way
