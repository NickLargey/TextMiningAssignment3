I took a walk
Down by the prison wall
I didn't know
I couldn't see
The side of the wall
I needed to be

I Looked at the sky
I looked at the clouds still rolling by
Worshipped the sun
Giving it's life to everyone
Yeah I watched the clouds roll by
'cause we are all equal underneath the sun

That's the way
That's the way of the world
The way of the world
That's the way
That's the way of the world
The way of the world

I took a ride
Over the ocean wide
I didn't know
I couldn't see
Who I could trust
Or who trusted me

I travelled the earth
Trying to find the good and the kind
I had to choose
If I should win, or if I should lose
Yeah I had to choose, the way
'cause we are all, equal underneath the sun

That's the way
That's the way of the world
The way of the world
That's the way
That's the way of the world
The way of the world

That's the way
That's the way of the world
The way of the world
That's the way
That's the way of the world
The way of the world
That's the way of the world
