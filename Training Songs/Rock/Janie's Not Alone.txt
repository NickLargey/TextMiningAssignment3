Hard times, shadow of a street light , dark eyes, stealing to survive
God knows, with a pocket full of hope she goesâ?¦

Young life, closing all around her, she'll be twelve, somewhere â??round June
No chance, for a child growing up too soon

And she never felt love from someone, never had love before
Just another cry of desperation, that no one stands up for

Janie's not alone
She's not the only one, who lives a life in misery
Janie's not alone
All she can do is run, that seems to be her destiny

No mother, no father, she calls for angels, but the angels cry
No chance, I guess that she was born to lose, yeah

And she never felt love from someone, never had love before
Can we ever stop the tears from falling, so she won't cry no more

Janie's not alone
She's not the only one, who lives a life in misery
Janie's on her own
All she can do is run, that seems to be her destiny

And she never felt love from someone, oh never had love before
Just another cry of desperation, that no one stands up for

Janie's not alone
She's not the only one, who lives a life in misery
Janie's not alone
All she can do is run, that seems to be her destiny

Janie's not alone
But she keeps holding' on, it's not how it was meant to be
Janie's on her own
All she can do is run, that seems to be her destiny
Janie's not alone
Janie's not alone
