Let it go
I been told a million times let it go
But I won't cause my mama said to hold on to hope

You can be right, you can be wrong
You can be anything you want
You can be you
You can be you

When it's tough and the whole world brings dreams to a stop
Don't give up
Just remember you're loved no matter what

You can be right, you can be wrong
You can be anything you want
You can be you
You can be you
You can be you
But you'll always be mine

Nowadays when I find myself in times of pain
It's okay
I still hear the words my mama would sing

You could be right, you could be wrong
You could be anything you want
You can be right, you can be wrong
You can be anything you want
You can be you
You can be you
You can be you
But you'll always be mine

You can be right, you can be wrong
You can be anything you want
You could be right, you could be wrong
You could be anything you want
You can be you
You can be you
You can be you
But you'll always be mine
