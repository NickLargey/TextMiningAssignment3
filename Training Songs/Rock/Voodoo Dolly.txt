She's your little voodoo dolly
And she's gonna make you lazy
Like the little drum in your ear
Transfixes you to your fear

And now she's transfixed in your fear
And you know she's gonna stay there
Because her nails are deep in your hair
And she made you so unaware

Are you listening to your fear?
The beat is coming nearer
Like the little drum in your ear
Transfixes you to your fear

She's such an ugly little dolly
And she's making you look very silly
And when you listen in to her ear
You get paralysed with her fear

Oh down, down, down in your fear
Down, down in your fear

Now this little voodoo dolly
Has made you very lazy
And you're anemic from her sucking
And when your dead she'll find another

Better break that little dolly
And sling her in the corner
Now she's a sorry little dolly
Such a sorry little dolly

Are you listening to your fear
The beat is coming nearer
Like that little drum in your ear
Transfixes you to your fear

Listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
