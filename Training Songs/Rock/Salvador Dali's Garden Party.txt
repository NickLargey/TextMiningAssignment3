Got an invitation to a garden party
And it said that everyone would be there
Famous painters, Pop Art poets and Hollywood filmstars
More celebrities than you have ever seen
In a week of TV

So I wore my brand new paisley shirt
I bought last week in Kensington Market
And I wore my brand new Chelsea boots
I rode there on my scooter but there wasn't anywhere to park it

And it was some kind of happening
Some kind of happening
Some kind of happening
Some kind of happening
Salvador Dali's garden party
Salvador Dali's garden party

Everybody was there
Everybody was there
Everybody was there
Everybody was there

Got an invitation to a garden party
And it said that everyone would be there
Famous painters, the Pop Art poets, Hollywood filmstars
More celebrities than you have ever seen

It was some kind of happening
Some kind of happening
Some kind of happening
Some kind of happening

Jack Nicholson was there
Mia Farrow was there
Woody Allen was there
Dennis Hopper was there
Peter Fonda was there
Debbie Harry was there
