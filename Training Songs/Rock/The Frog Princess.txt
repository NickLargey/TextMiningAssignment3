I met a girl, she was a frog princess
I guess I ought to make it clear
That I saw nothing through her see-through dress
Until she whispered in my ear
You don't really love me and I don't really mind
'cause I don't love anybody, that stuff is just a waste of time
Your place or mine?
I met a girl, she was a complete mess
I should've left her well alone, but oh no, not me
I had to see if underneath that dress
Her heart was really made of stone
You don't really love me and I don't really mind
'cause I don't love anybody, that stuff is just a waste of time
Your place or mine?
I met a girl, she was a frog princess
And yes I do regret it now
But how was I to know that just one kiss
Could turn my frog into a cow?
And now I'm rid of her I must confess
To thinking 'bout what might have been
And I can visualize my frog princess
Beneath a shining guillotine
You don't really love me and baby that is alright
'cause I don't love anybody,
I come and go through peoples love-lives
Your place or mine?
