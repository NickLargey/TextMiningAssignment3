We are all together alone, and these are just wishes and I
Am just dreaming. If I ever grow up I will take care of the old and
All the babies that have no one. You might think I give myself
Too much credit but I am just dreaming. 'Cause not much is sacred,
There's not really much to do here any more. I don't feel like you said,
I walk the earth my darling but I never feel at home and we all
Say I will change tomorrow. I will change it all tomorrow. I will
Assure all of the husbands who are guilty and the wives who feel
Useless. I will nurse all of the black and blue babies with their
Unhappy parents who had unhappy parents. I will assure all of the
Boys who feel awkward and the girls who feel clumsy. I will walk
Alongside the old man who feels so alone as everyone rushes by him.
You might think I give myself too much credit but I am juts dreaming.
I don't feel like you said, I walk the earth my darling but I never
Feel at home, and we all say I will change tomorrow.
