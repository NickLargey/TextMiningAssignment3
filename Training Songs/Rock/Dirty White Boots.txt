Come up to my room
Get out of the weather
Drop the window shade
And take off your sweater
You are all I need
To make me feel better
Let your hair hang down
And give me that leather, come on

Put a record on
And your dirty white boots, come on
You know you turn me on
In your dirty white boots, come on
We're gonna get it on
In your dirty white boots, come on, come on

You know these games we play
They give me such pleasure
The girls in magazines
Cannot even measure
There's nothing you won't do
I don't have the pressure
Take your knickers down
And give me that treasure, come on

Put a record on
And your dirty white boots, come on
You know you turn me on
In your dirty white boots, come on
We're gonna get it on
In your dirty white boots, come on, come on

Girl I need you rockin' next to me
You're the one that brings me ecstasy
Girl I need your lovin' every day
You're the only one who could make me stay (? Play them guitar)

Come on, put a record on
And your dirty white boots, come on
You know you turn me on
In your dirty white boots, come on
We're gonna get it on
In your dirty white boots, come on, come on, yeah

Come on!
Put the red light on
And your dirty white boots, come on
You know you turn me on
In your dirty white boots, come on
We're gonna get it on
In your dirty white boots, come on, come on

Yeah!
