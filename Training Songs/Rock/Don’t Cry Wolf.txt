You don't have to listen
To what your parents say
They don't understand us
Their laws we don't obey
You can wear what you want
There ain't no uniform
Go where you want to go
Don't stay locked at home

Don't be a fool
Don't cry wolf
Don't be a fool
Don't cry wolf

You can't stand around now
Looking like fools
But there's a lot you could do
There ain't no rules
No point in getting bored
That won't help if you fall
So come and have some fun yeah
And help us smash it up

Don't be a fool
Don't cry wolf
Don't be a fool
Don't cry wolf

It's no good for you kids
Being told what to do
There's a lot of change for you
If you find something new

You don't have to listen
To what your parents say
They don't understand us
They're laws we don't obey
You can wear what you want
There ain't no uniform
Go where you want to go
Don't stay locked at home

Don't be a fool
Don't cry wolf
Don't be a fool
Don't cry wolf

Don't be a fool
Don't cry wolf
Don't be a fool
Don't cry wolf
