Walking with your eyes closed down a dead end street
You think you're never coming back
That's when your heart begins to bleed, yeah
Wandering in circles and you don't know where to go

Let me take the rain
Let me take the pain
And wash it away

I'd do anything, give anything for you
When your love's blinded my eyes can see, yeah
I'd do anything, give everything it's true
Feel what I'm feeling, make you a believer
I'll be your faith healer

Came without a warning, tore your world apart
Lost dreams and bad memories
Have dept me in the dark, yeah, yeah
You can keep running, running from the shadows of the past

Let me clear the rain
Let me take the pain
And wash it away

I'd do anything, give anything for you
When your love's blinded my eyes can see, yeah
I'd do anything, give everything it's true
Feel what I'm feeling, make you a believer
I'll be your faith healer
