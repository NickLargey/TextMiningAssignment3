All those long and lonely summer nights
That I have spent alone
Just thinking of you don't make dreams come true
When you're so far away

All those lovely moonlit summer nights
I guess they're all in vain
I know that I could don't know if I should
I want you in my arms again

Here I just sitting lonely
Just counting the days I've to stay
But how do I know I still love you
When you're so far away

All those long and lonely summer nights
I guess they're all in vain
Just thinking of you don't make dreams come true
I want you in my arms again

Here I just sitting lonely
Just counting the days I've to stay
But how do I know I still love you
When you're so far away

All those long and lonely summer nights
I guess they're all in vain
Just thinking of you don't make dreams come true
When you're so far away

We'll be together somehow, someday
Oooh
