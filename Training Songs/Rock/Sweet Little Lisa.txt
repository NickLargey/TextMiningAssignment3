Well the works whistle blew at a half past five o'clock
I saw the red light at the corner, man I never tried to stop
I got pulled over by a man in blue, he said what you thinking you're
Tryin'a do?
I told him 'bout my baby and he let me go, thanks a lot
I got invited to a party at a high class hollywood pool
There were women all around me, man I began to drool
I weighed the evidence in hand, I said girls you got to understand
Since I met my baby I've been living by the golden rule

Ain't nobody gonna make me shout
Ain't nobody gonna put me out
Ain't nobody gonna make me do like my sweet little lisa does
Ain't nobody gonna make me sing
Make me do the wrong damn thing
Sticking my head in a cold cold stream, like my sweet little lisa does

I was pulling out of dallas, got pulled over by a debutante
She was playing with her keys, she thought I was acting kinda nonchalant
She said she'd take me up to her room, and keep me 
I've got a sweet sugar mama give me everything I want

Ain't nobody gonna make me shout
Ain't nobody gonna put me out
Ain't nobody gonna make me do like my sweet little lisa does
Ain't nobody gonna make me sing
Make me do the wrong damn thing
Sticking my head in a cold cold stream, like my sweet little lisa does
