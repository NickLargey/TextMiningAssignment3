Some Girls
Love to run around,
love to handle every thing they see

But my girl
has more fun around
and you know she'd rather be with me

Me oh my
Lucky guy is what I am
Tell you why you'll understand
she don''t fly although she can

Some boys 
love to run around
They don't think about the things they do

This boy wants to settle down
and you know he'd rather be with you

Me oh my; 
Lucky guy is what I am
Tell you why you'll understand
she don't fly although she can
