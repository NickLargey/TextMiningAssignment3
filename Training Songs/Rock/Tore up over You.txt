EVER SINCE YOU`VE BEEN GONE
I`VE CRIED THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG.
SINCE THE DAY YOU SAID GOODBYE
IT HURT ME SO,
NO LIE, 
NO LIE.
TORE UP OVER YOU
AND I JUST CAN`T FIND MY WAY.

[Chorus]:
TORE UP,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
TORE UP.
OO-OO-OO
TORE UP,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
TORE UP.
TORE UP OVER YOU
AND I JUST CAN`T FIND MY WAY.

[verse 2]:
YOU NEVER LOVED ME
THOUGH YOU TOLD ME SO;
IF YOU DID,
HOW COULD YOU GO?
IT WAS YOU, 
NOT ME,
THAT LEFT AND WENT AWAY WITH SOMEONE ELSE.
TORE UP OVER YOU 
AND I JUST CAN`T FIND MY WAY.

[Chorus]:
TORE UP,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
TORE UP.
OO-OO-OO
TORE UP,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
TORE UP.
TORE UP OVER YOU
AND I JUST CAN`T FIND MY WAY.

[verse 3]:
TELL ME WHAT DID I DO
THAT MADE YOU GO AWAY.
TELL ME WHAT CAN I DO
TO MAKE YOU COME BACK AND STAY.
TORE UP OVER YOU
AND I JUST CAN`T FIND MY WAY.
