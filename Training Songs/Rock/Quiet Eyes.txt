Tony, my head is on a pillow
Clock strikes, it's the count of four
Four hours of tossin' and turnin'
In a big brass bed

I've tried all the tricks in the book now
But I just can't sleep no more
Tony, what's happenin' to me
I'm tired and I'm cold
Somehow I'm imagining things
Movin' in the shadow
And my face is a painting crying
In the heat of the sun

Let the world outside pay its dues
I'll never know why, no matter how high
It's a sign that's been sealed and delivered
Tony, it's lookin' into your
Quiet eyes, silent tears
Silent as the night you deserted me
Quiet eyes, silent tears
Silence, and the night lasted seven years

Meanwhile I'm counting all the hours
And I've counted all the days
On the pages of a calendar
And I threw it all away
Tony, I'm tryin' to make some sense, babe
I'm always tryin' to get through to you
Maybe you're the last one to notice
How much I've been lovin' you

Let the world outside pay its dues
I'll never know why, no matter how high
It's a sign that's been sealed and delivered
Tony, it's lookin' into your
Quiet eyes, silent tears
Silent as the night you deserted me
Quiet eyes, silent tears
Silent as the night you deserted me
Quiet eyes, silent tears
Silence, and the night lasted seven years
