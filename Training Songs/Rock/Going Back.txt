I`m just a fool - no disguise 
I still get hurt - same old pride 
But growing older - I`ve realized 
There`s not a place - in my life - tonight 

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna leave this town no more 
I'm sorry for the times that I did before 
I'm going back to where my heart came from 
I ain`t gonna leave this town again 
I'm sorry for the things I did but then 
I didn`t realize where I belonged 

Shakin` the blues - every night 
Been all alone - no surprise 
Don`t you forget me - I`m so blind 
I`m coming back - one more time - tonight 

[Chorus] 
If these streets were empty 
With nothing to see 
You could take me from this town 
Oh but you won`t take this town out of me 

Too many years - can`t forget 
So many dreams - ain`t done yet 
An` all of these memories - still the same 
I`m going home - and I`ll remain - unchanged

[Chorus]
