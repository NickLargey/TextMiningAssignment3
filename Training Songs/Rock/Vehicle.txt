Hey, well I'm the friendly stranger in the black sedan
Oh won't you hop inside my car
I got pictures, got candy, I am a lovable man
I'd like to take you to the nearest star

I'm your vehicle baby
I'll take you anywhere you want to go
I'm your vehicle woman
By now I'm sure you know
That I want ya (want you)
I need ya (need you)
I got to, have to have you child
Great God in heaven, you know I love you

Well if you want to be a movie star
I got the ticket to Hollywood
Well if you want to stay just like you are
You know I think you really should

I'm your vehicle baby
I'll take you anywhere you want to go
I'm your vehicle woman
By now I'm sure you know
That I want ya (want you)
I need ya (need you)
I got to, have to have you child
Great God in heaven, you know I love you
Oh you know I do
