You fools try to live with yourselves
Through other peoples dreams
It's a pity you don't listen to yourselves
Just to your next of kin
Judging people putting down their beliefs
Is that a necessary
You're gonna get it back belive me
You're just a peasant under your regim

It's all
You want
You know you got it
And you know you gotta thow it away

You know I try to live with myself
And not through my dreams
I try to listen to what's in my head
But it's not what it seems
Just like you but in a different way
I'm gonna get it back
You know I try but in a different way
Another power you lack
