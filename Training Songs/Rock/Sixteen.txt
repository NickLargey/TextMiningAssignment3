Sweet sixteen in leather boots
Body and soul, I go crazy
Baby, baby, I'm a hungry
Sweet sixteen

Funky bar all full of faces
Pretty faces, beautiful faces
Body and soul
Body and soul
I give to you
I am an easy mark with my broken heart
Sweet sixteen

Show you my explosion, sweet sixteen
Go out to the funky bar I get hurt, crying inside
'Cause everybody's so fine
And they don't need me

Tell me what can I do, sweet sixteen?
I give my body and soul sweet sixteen

I must be hungry
'Cause I go crazy
Over your leather boots
Now baby
I know

That's not normal
But I love you
I love you
I love you
Sweet sixteen
Everywhere I go, I love it
