Who fills the sky
Who answers when I cry
I feel alone, I feel abused
I feel there's nothing I can do
It's getting late
There's no one home
No messages on the telephone
I feel so good today
It's hard to stay away
A hunter and his prey
Today will be the day
Is this real, is it you
Are you what I see
Is it him, am I good
Or just vanishing cream
Is there truth, how many lies
Am I a fool to believe
Who's in my bed
I feel misled
It's just vanishing cream
