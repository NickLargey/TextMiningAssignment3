Time and time again
I'm over seduction
Closer now, closer now, stop 
With my hand on a fire
Of a desire
When all I want to do is relay

She's love
She's love (woah)
She's love
She's love (la da di)

Sit, don't stay
It's only the weekend
It's only that I care
Come on lover, love me like that 
Why are you so indie? 
Where are you going?
When all I want to do is relax

She's love
She's love (woah)
She's love
She's love (woah)
She's love
She's love (woah)
She's, She love (la da di)

She's love
She's love (woah)
She's love
She's love (woah)
She's love
She's love (woah)
She's, she love (la da di)
