Take a bow 'cause you played your heart out
And take your time with working the rest out
And try and stay out of your head
I have seen you invent the damnedest things there

Oh, so what?
Maybe she could not really ever see you through herself
What does that change about you or her?
Try and stay out of your head
I have seen you invent the damnedest things there

Maybe down the road I'll see you in a blur
From the speed of light you've had with her
Maybe down the road I'll see you in a blur
See you in a blur

Don't lean back, my friend
There's not much there that will push you on
Use your stride, slow
And break it up over time

And try and stay out of your head
I have seen you invent the damnedest things there
Try and stay out of your head
I have seen you invent the damnedest things there

Take a bow
