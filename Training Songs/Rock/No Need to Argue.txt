There's no need to argue anymore
I gave all I could
But it left me so sore
And the thing that makes me mad
Is the one thing that I had
I knew, I knew, I'd lose you
You'll always be special to me
And I remember all the
Things we once shared
Watching TV movies on
The living room armchair
But they say it will work out fine
Was it all a waste of time
'Cause I knew, I knew, I'd lose you
You'll always be special to me
Will I forget in time
You said I was on your mind
There's no need to argue
No need to argue anymore
There's no need to argue anymore
Special
