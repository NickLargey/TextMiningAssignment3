It's alright now, the day ain't over
It's alright babe 'cause we're still standin'
We're sure looking shaggy and raggy and funny
But every smile, boy, is a revelation

That we're living out of faith, living out of hope in darkness
And if love is all when need when living in a world of madness
Then you got me and I got you and we got all we need
'Cause hey-yeah, we got love, hey-yeah, we got love

Now they can't break us 'cause they didn't make us
No, they can't save us 'cause they don't love us
When the lights go out now yeah and the show is over
We'll still be singing some crazy love songs

Well we're living out of faith, yeah, living out of hope in darkness
And if love is all when need when living in a world of madness
Then you got me and I got you and we got all we need
'Cause hey-yeah, we got love, hey-yeah, we got love

We'll be singing on the street dancing like a shell of amber
'Cause love is all I need when living in a world of madness
And you got me and I got you and we got all we need
'Cause hey-yeah, we got love, 'cause hey-yeah, we got love
'Cause hey-yeah, we got love, I said, hey-yeah, we got love

You hear what I say? Yeah
