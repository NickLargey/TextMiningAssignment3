Now they say a man, ain't supposed to cry
Then why do I have tears in my eyes?
If I were half as strong, as the steely sun
Then I could mend what I have undone
No this house is not a home-no this house is not a home

No this house is not a home, without you
And what I mean to say, is that I need you now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you somehow
So if it's in your heart, to bring it home to me
Then we can get it back the way it should be

[Chorus]
And with god, as my witness
This I swear to you
With all my heart, I do promise
I will love and honor you

So if it's in your heart, to bring it home to me
Then we can get it back the way it should be

[Chorus: x 2]

... Without you... without you... without you... without you
