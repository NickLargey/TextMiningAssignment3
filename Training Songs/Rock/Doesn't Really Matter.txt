Are you sitting comfortably?
Then we'll begin

He's a fascist

It's been a hard day in the city
Affects you in the most peculiar way
A dull day don't seem pretty
We've said all that there is to say
And if you were to ask me questions
You don't really want to know
Your concern is just for show
Just for show

Your name's a number, just press a button
Your memories lost but they've not forgotten
They try to break our, our lust for passion
They try to tell us that it's not in fashion

And if you were to ask me questions
What are we fighting-for?
We're just breaking down the door

It doesn't really matter
I've been through this all before
It doesn't really matter

They fight in England and Northern Ireland
The police they try to hold us still
They can bleed us and they can feed us
But you know they'll never control our will

And if you were to ask that question
What are we fighting for?
We're just breaking down the door

It doesn't really matter
I've been through this all before
It doesn't really matter to me

It doesn't really matter
I've been through this all before
It doesn't really matter to me
It doesn't really matter
Oh

It doesn't really matter
It doesn't really matter
It doesn't really matter
No no
It doesn't really matter
At all
It doesn't really matter
At all
It doesn't really matter
It doesn't matter to me
It doesn't really matter
No no no
It doesn't really matter
Oh oh oh oh
It doesn't really matter
No no no
It doesn't really matter
No no no no no no
It doesn't really matter
No
It doesn't really matter
Matter, matter, matter
Matter, matter, matter
Matter, matter, matter
Matter, matter, matter
Matter, matter
