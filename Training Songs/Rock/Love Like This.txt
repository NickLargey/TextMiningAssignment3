I've got a way with counting cars
And you've got a way of breaking hearts.
I've got the keys to a real fast car.

And you're a real fast girl,
I want a love like this
Won't you show me a love like that.
(woah oh oh)

They say that loves a bitch
Read my lips
I've waited all my life for a bitch like this
For a kiss like this

Take off your jeans
And your cowboy boots
I like it best
In my cheap suit
I cut the breaks to your racing heart

'Cause you're a real fast girl

I want a love like this
Won't you show me
A love like that
(woah oh oh)

They say that loves a bitch
Read my lips
I've waited all my life for a bitch like this
For a kiss like this

Clean up the hotel suite
You've made a mess of me
You've got me on my knees
I'm spinning out
I'm tangled in your sheets
You've got the best of me

Were never coming down
But were coming

I want a love like this
Wont you show me
A love like that
(woah oh oh)

They say that loves a bitch
Read my lips
I've waited all my life for a love like this
A love like this
Wont you show me a love like that
(woah oh oh)

They say that loves a bitch
Read my lips
I've waited all my life for a bitch like
Waited all my life for a love like
Waited all my life for a kiss like this

For a kiss like this
For a kiss like this
For a kiss like this
For a kiss like this
