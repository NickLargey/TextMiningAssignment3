My girls best friend she told me
She said "All your love's in vain"
Said "That girls gonna leave you"
So I sing this love refrain

That girl she's gonna walk out that door
So you better treat her right
So I'm treating her right

I ran back home to tell her
That I still ached for her touch
A man don't wanna believe none
That he hurt this woman oh so much

The note sat there by the front door
It said 'I left tonight'
But I treated her right
I treated her right, I treated her right
I treated her right, I treated her right, yeah

Broke down on the doorstep
Tear come to my eye
Should've believed that woman
She could tell no lie, she could tell no lie

Knock on the door next evening
A shadow, a familiar outline
Yes she come up and smile at me
And I know I'm gonna feel fine

My futures looking bright and rosy
My girls best friend puts her hand in mine
Now I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright

Now I'm feeling, now I'm feeling
I'm feeling alright
