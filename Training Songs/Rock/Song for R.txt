My dad said that every guy should get to meet a girl like you
I guess it's true
Now I met you
Let me get on with my life
Someone told me
That I never had a problem until I met you
I guess it's true
Now I got one
Let me get on with my life
You know I try to run away
But you call me twice a day
To say how funny you are
Let me get on with my life
My mom said
She wanted you out of the house
Just 'cause nobody likes you
I know it's not clever
but she don't watch Saturday Night Live
Like you do
You know I try to run away
But you call me twice a day
To say how funny you are
Let me get on with my life (x4)
