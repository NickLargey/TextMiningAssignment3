I've been workin' all week long out in the saddle
I lay my bed roll down at night out on the range
Cussin' dust and heat and fly's and cattle
All this romance can drive a poor cowboy insane
And that lonesome coyote's a howlin' on the prairie
And that big Wyoming moon is shinnin' down
Well it's Saturday night and you know its customary
For a wild and wooly cowboy to ride to town

Well I just got paid and my pockets are full of money
I can't stand no more I can't wait another day
I got to ride to town I gotta see my little green eyed honey
We're going to dance and romance and love the night away
And that lonesome coyote's...
I'm gettin' sick and tired of just sleepin' on the ground
Come on Buck let's go to town
