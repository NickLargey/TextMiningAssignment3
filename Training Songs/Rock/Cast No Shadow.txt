Here's a thought for every man who tries to understand 
What is in his hands (what's in his hands) 
He walks along the open road of love and life 
To find it if he can (to find it if he can) 
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say 
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay 
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say 
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow 
(Haaaaaaaa-ah) 
As they took his soul they stole his pride (priiiii-hide) <-- 3 times 
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow 
(Haaaaaaaa-ah) 
(Haaaaaaaa-ah) 
(Haaaaaaaa-ah)
