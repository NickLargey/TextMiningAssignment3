I don't judge my memory anymore
Can't tell if things are better than they were before
But this heart of mine is ready to believe
Long lost lover comes bare come

The life of a friend
Can't stand being alone
Until the morning comes
And you have to leave

Than I see you on the street
Holding on to someone else
Who even looks like me
Seems like

I'm only fooling myself
I'm playing games with my heart and soul
I know that fooling myself
It can be dangerous, dangerous

If I lose control
I'm only fooling myself
I'm playing games with my heart and soul
Everybody knows fooling yourself

Can be dangerous, dangerous
When you lose control
When you've only got yourself to blame
Well, when you asked if I could take you in

It was harder than it should have been
'Cause you will always search good company
And last night you wanted me to stay
But this morning you just slipped away

No goodbye
Maybe you were just a dream
Well I'm easy when it comes to be unkind
And share on me a little bit of love from a side

Than the truth begins to hurt
It gets too hard to hide
I'm only fooling myself
I'm playing games with my heart and soul

I know that fooling myself
Can be dangerous, dangerous
If I lose control
I'm only fooling myself

I'm playing games with my heart and soul
If I use side of hell
To make you reappear
Still I can't be sure

What is and is it real
I'm only fooling myself
I'm playing games with my heart and soul
I know that fooling myself

Can be dangerous, dangerous
I'm only fooling myself
I'm playing games with my heart and soul
Everybody knows fooling yourself

Can be dangerous ? dangerous
