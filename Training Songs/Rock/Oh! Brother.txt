[Mecass, the mass, decline, domain, relan, drazan, my heart's blocked, rout]
Oh! little brother
We are in a mess
Don't look at me that way
Don't put me to the test
When I first saw you
People said:
"He scrutinised a little monster"
And disappeared through red door
Now everyone is disinformation
Disinformation
Disinformation
He says:
"Won't you give me one more chance?"
"I'm not a communist"

Disinformation
Disinformation
Disinformation

Oh! little brother
We are in a mess
Don't look at me that way
Your d-jacket's a mess
There's always
Someone beside you
And there's always
Someone in your arms
Oh! little brother
If only I had known
Then I might not
Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
