I'm going back to my town
won't be there for long
I'm going back to my town
where I can't lose and I can't go wrong

going back to the city
where everything turns around
going back to the city
where my feet spin fast off the ground

going back to the city
where everything turns around
going back to the city
where my feet spin fast off the ground

going back to my town
I need it oh so bad
I'm going back to my town
I'll leave your face and I'll be sad

my town
my town
my town
my town
