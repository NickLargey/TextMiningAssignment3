Do you remember that sunny day
Somewhere in London
In the middle of nowhere
Didn't have nothing to do that day
Didn't wanna do nothing anyway

You got a way of walking
You got a way of talking
And there's something about you
And now I know I never ever
Wanna be without you

I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
Of your precious love
Of your precious love

The first time I saw you
Standing in the street
You were so cool you could've
Put out Vietnam
All the girls asks "what's he like?"
I says, he's kind of shy
But that's the kind of girl I am,
He's my kind of guy

I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
Of your precious love
Of your precious love
Of your precious love

I'll build my world around you
I'll bless the day that I found you
I'll stay beside you, I'll never leave
Or tell you all those lies that you'd never believe
Uh huh huh

I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
Of your precious love
Of your precious love

You got a way of walking
You got a way of talking
And there's something about you
That's the kind of girl I am,
He's my kind of guy
And now I know I never ever
Wanna be without you

I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
I wanna be haunted by the ghost
And now I know I never ever
Wanna be without you

(Haunted by the ghost)
