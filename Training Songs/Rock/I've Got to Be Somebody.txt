I never had any reason
For ambition or drive
In fact, I never had anybody
That cared if I'm alive

But then one day she came my way
And I heard a voice within me say
Don't let her get away
Whatever you do

But I never thought
That this could be
That she would ever
Look at me seriously

[Chorus]
And that's why
I've got to be somebody
I'm down on my knees
Begging please please please please
I've got to win her love for me

I grew up on the sidewalks
Got along the best I could
Mama worked all day long
And Papa was no good

I've never asked for much before
But here I am at Heaven's door
So help me please
Don't let her pass me by

'Cause I'd rather die than see
Her love turn into sympathy for me

[Chorus]

Got to be somebody
Got to be somebody
So tired of being a nobody

I've got to be somebody
I'm down on my knees
Begging please please please please
I've got to win her love for me
