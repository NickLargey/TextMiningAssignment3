Early in the mornin' I'm layin' on my bed
Stickin' to the rhythm of the music in my head
Rockin' in the mirror, rollin' out the door
Hop into the car and put the pedal to the floor

Callin' out your number, I'll take you for a ride
Find something to keep me satisfied

Runnin' for the money, layin' out the green
It's a tax accountant's nightmare, it's a rock n' roll dream
The income may be different but the outcome's still the same
You'll never be a winner boy until you play the game

Hounded to distraction, racin' to and fro
Losin' my direction keepin' up my status quo
Now I tried, tried, tried, tried
It just don't seem to keep me satisfied

A hundred thousand miles in a 747
Take it all in style if you wanna get to heaven
Chasin' all the action every single night
Never understand it but you try to do it right
Ragged 'round the edges, none the worse for wear
Cuttin' all the corners but they never get me there

Now I try, try, try, try
It just don't seem to keep me satisfied
