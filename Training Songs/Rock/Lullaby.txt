You've Been looking for god
You've been down on your knees
Will the Angels believe you now?
Wanting more than the bliss of a beautiful kiss
From the lips of the one who fell 
Well its hard to tell...
Its like an opium dream 
Through your psyche it streams
It relieves and believes the pain that you fought in vain
Oh no....please don't
Wave goodbye, wave goodbye
Because your sleeping tonight 
Sleeping tonight
Safe in the arms of Morpheus
You've escaped through these means these delirious dreams 
Helped to shelter an sooth your soul
The regrettable roles 
The salvation they sold
Satisfied your desire to burn 
And now you've learned?
Oh no....please don't 
Wave goodbye, wave goodbye
Because your sleeping tonight 
Sleeping tonight
Safe in the arms of Morpheus
And were waving goodbye 
You're sleeping tonight
Safe in the arms of Morpheus
