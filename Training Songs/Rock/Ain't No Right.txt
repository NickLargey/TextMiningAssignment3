I am skin and bones, I am pointy nose
But it motherfuckin' makes me try
Makes me try, and that ain't wrong
I'll tell you why. . .There ain't no right!
Ain't no wrong now, ain't no right
Ain't no wrong now, ain't no right
Only pleasure and pain
Motherfuckin' bad wind came, blew down my home
Now the green grass grows
Bad wind came, blew down my home
Goddamn goodness knows!
Where the green grass grows there can't be wrong
And goodness knows, there ain't no right!
Ain't no wrong now, ain't no right
Ain't no wrong now, ain't no right
Only pleasure and pain
Bumped my head, I'm a battering ram
Doddamn took the pain
Cut myself, said "So what?"
Mother fuckin' took the pain
Said "So what?," I can't be wrong
I thought so but there ain't no right!
Ain't no wrong now, ain't no right
Only pleasure and pain
