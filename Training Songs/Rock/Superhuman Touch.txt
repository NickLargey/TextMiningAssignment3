I'm on fire
Nothing's gonna hold me back
Unless the sky has a pocketful of tricks to try

Oh
You pick a color and I sing it for you
I know you feel the same way
Say 
Say
Say you feel the same way

Your fingertips are like a superhuman touch
Can't get enough of this electric love 
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand

Sparks flying out in every direction
There's more of this to come
I think it must be heaven
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand

I'm on fire
Golden echoes upon my face
Tell those dreamers they can dream up all they like in this place

Oh
You pick a color and I sing it for you
I know you feel the same way
Say
Say
Say you feel the same way

Your fingertips are like a superhuman touch
Can't get enough of this electric love 
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand

Sparks flying out in every direction
There's more of this to come
I think it must be heaven
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand

Just one day like this will keep me going on
Tender kisses will keep me going on
Oh
Oh
Oh

Your fingertips are like a superhuman touch
Can't get enough of this electric love 
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand

Sparks flying out in every direction
There's more of this to come
I think it must be heaven
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand

Seems like hell has broken loose
It couldn't be more beautiful
I just want to burn the sun with you

Must be God to inspire the greatest minds in all of power
I just want to burn the sun with you
With just a wave of your hand
