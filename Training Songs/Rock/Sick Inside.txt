I'm just a girl who
Kissed a boy who
Is in love
With someone else
I didn't mean to
Feel the way I do
It just happened by itself

And now I'm sick inside
Yeah it makes me wanna cry
I'm so sorry about last night
Yeah it happened so fast
I wanted it to last
In the moment it felt so right
But now I'm sick inside

He stopped by my house
We were hangin' out
He was wonderin' where you are
We went walking 
We were just talking
Then he kissed me by his car

And now I'm sick inside
Yeah it makes me wanna cry
I'm so sorry about last night
It happened so fast
I wanted it to last
In the moment it felt so right
But now I'm sick inside

Now I'm stuck with this feeling in the pit of my soul
I guess I should've had a little self-control
I knew that it was wrong I admit it
I wish there was a way that I could make it all right
I really wanna tell you that I put up a fight
But that would be the lie (that would be the lie)

And now I'm sick inside
Yeah it makes me wanna cry
I'm so sorry about last night
Yeah it happened so fast
I wanted it to last
In the moment it felt so right
But now I'm sick inside

Now I'm sick inside
Yeah it makes me wanna cry
In the moment it felt so right

I'm just a girl who
Kissed a boy who
Is in love with you
