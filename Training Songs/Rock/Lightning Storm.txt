This lonely existence may use the way
For the hard of hearts must beat be brave
While this quite lightning storm
Wreaks the harvest gold we try to sow
So it begins
The way the light still dances beneath
The skin there the messenger from hell since were bound to win
As the days do come but the years do go
So take care of your freedom you'll never know

I sit on the wing for a blackbird song
To tell me were and when this all went wrong
There's no resolution without remorse
Ignorance bliste ye fin let state of course
Puncture the skin and see his blood run cold on desert sand
Come hear the meant for mothers with childless hands
As the days do come but the years do go
So take care of your freedom you'll never know
Take good care of your freedom you'll never know

Take what you give until theres nothing left but everlive
And night this is on shadows and after kill
As the days do come and the years do go
So take care of your freedom you'll never know
Yeah take good care of your freedom you'll never know
The days do come but the years do go
So take care of you freedom you'll never know
