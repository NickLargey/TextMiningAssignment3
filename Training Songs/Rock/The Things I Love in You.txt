Sittin' on the corner drinkin' my beer
Told all the others Happy New Year
Told everybody some things
I knew
I knew
Doesn't really matter anymore
Never really mattered anyway
Only I do wonder how you'd feel
If it were you
In my shoes

Could you change, I wonder
If you knew
All the things I love in you

If I had a dollar for every time
I hung out on the corner doin' time
While you showed another through all
All the things i love

Could you change I wonder
If you new
All the things I love in you
