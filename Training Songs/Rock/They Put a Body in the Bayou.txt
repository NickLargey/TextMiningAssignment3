They never came to town
He really gets me down
Take off that plastic crown
Coke nose and a pretty sound

Alright make it quick
Good songs make you rich
That feelin' it'll pass
Good boys come in last
Bad girl by my side
Poppin' pills on the fly
Cold grave when I die

I came by to see you
I just had to know
Who put the body in the bayou
Who left the tracks on the road

Told me act your age
That's why she's underage
Said her papa hates the Federales and
When he drinks too much he smacks her face

Alright make it quick
Good songs make you rich
That feelin' it'll pass
Good boys come in last
Bad girl by my side
Poppin' pills on the fly
Cold grave when I die

I came by to see you
I just had to know
Who put the body in the bayou
Who left the tracks on the road

I came by to see you
I just had to know
Who put the body in the bayou
Who left the tracks on the road
