[Chorus:]
Everything will be alright (everything will be just fine)
Everything will be just fine (everything will be alright)
Everything will be alright (everything will be just fine)
Everything will be just fine (everything will be alright)

Windows and your doors are closed
Seeing the world in black and white
Still singing the same old song
Don't know where you went wrong
Life is just the way it's always been

Three days, and forty miles away
Are the roads that life goes
Can't buy the way I've found
I want you here around
In the end, after all the cops are down

[Chorus]

It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
And this is why
I don't trust myself with you
And this is why
I'm paying tomorrow

No, no those tears won't come
Well I'm so cold, cold
Tears won't come, no
Alright
No, no those tears won't come, no
I'm so cold, cold my tears won't come
My tears won't come
I'm so cold, my tears won't come
I'm so cold, my tears won't come
