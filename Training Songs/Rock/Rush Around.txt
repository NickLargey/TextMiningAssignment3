Must have heard the same song twenty times.
Mama sang and put the make up on her eyes.
We were getting ready to go.
School and the work whistle blow.
Everybody had to rush, rush, rush around.
Rush, rush, rush around.
I remember thinking this just can't be right.
Got to be a better way to live you life.
Slow like a soft Southern breeze.
Nobody take time to breathe.
Everybody had to rush, rush, rush around.
Rush, rush, rush around.
Ooo what you do, I dreamt of you yesterday.
Ooo what you do, you come to me then fade away.
Sometimes a memory is hard to bear.
Don't know how a thing so old could still be there.
When I fell the rain in my soul.
I give it up and I go.
Everybody had to rush, rush, rush around.
Rush, rush, rush around
