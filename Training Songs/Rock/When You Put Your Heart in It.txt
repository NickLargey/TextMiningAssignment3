We knew it was one in a million
It was such a long shot
Somehow we've got here together
And who knows what will happen
Anything can happen
If we keep getting better
And we keep on believing.

When you put your heart in it
It can take you anywhere
Who's to say that we can't make it
It's the same dream that we share
When you put your heart in it
It can take you anywhere.

This road was so long and winding
It was such a hard road
But we can't stop once we had started
We were always getting closer
Suddenly it happens
A chance in a lifetime
Now we're gonna take it
We can make it.

When you put your heart in it?
