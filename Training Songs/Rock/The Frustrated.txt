X-rated hit the heaven 
Three chords play the music 
Four beats back to basic 
Five sense around the world 

Looking for the real enemies 
Looking for the real enemies oh ah

X-rated give me a reason why? 
You attack the symbols why? 
You've lost history 
Nobody can save a twisted soul 
You sent a letter to the wrong address 
You sent a letter to the wrong address 
You sent a letter to the wrong address 
You sent a letter to the wrong address 
Frustrated, frustrated, I will go 
I will fight, I will do, rock n' roll
Frustrated, frustrated, I will go 
I will fight, I will do, rock n' roll yeah (yeah)

Ballad はいつか深い眠りを誘う
飛ぶ夢はもう見ない
光を奪われた双頭の月の下で

You sent a letter to the wrong address
You sent a letter to the wrong address
You sent a letter to the wrong address
You sent a letter to the wrong address
Looking for the real enemies 
Looking for the real enemies 
Looking for the real enemies 
Looking for the real enemies 

Frustrated, frustrated 
I will go, I will fight, I will do, rock n' roll
Frustrated, frustrated 
I will go, I will fight, I will do, rock n' roll
Frustrated, frustrated 
I will go, I will fight, I will do, rock n' roll
Frustrated, frustrated 
I will go, I will fight, I will do, rock n' roll, yeah hoo
