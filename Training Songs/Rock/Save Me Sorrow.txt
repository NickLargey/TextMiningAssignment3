We've been wading in a sea of destruction 
Sinking further in disease and temptation 
Save me sorrow be gone (Be gone) 
Up ahead there's a sun that's a-rising 
In a world that I pray to remind me 
Save me sorrow be gone by dawn last aspiration 
Fear defies my expectations 

(Whoah oh oh, Whoah oh oh) 
All night long, all night long, over and over tonight 
(Whoah oh oh, Whoah oh oh) 
All night long, all night long, over and over tonight 

In a search for the reason of my tears 
And the ghost of our youth was near 
Save me sorrow be gone (Be gone) 
Now I see what I fear it's in front of me 
The other times all I needed was to save me 
Save me sorrow be gone, be gone 

(Whoah oh oh, Whoah oh oh) 
All night long, all night long, over and over tonight 
(Whoah oh oh, Whoah oh oh) 
All night long, all night long, over and over tonight 

Make me believe(?), just one time 
Make me believe, it's in your heart, it's in your eyes 
I wanna go, yeah 
Oh yeah 
Let go 

(Whoah oh oh, Whoah oh oh) 
All night long, all night long, over and over tonight 
(Whoah oh oh, Whoah oh oh) 
All night long, all night long, over and over tonight 
(Whoah oh oh, Whoah oh oh) 
Tonight, tonight, over and over tonight 
(Whoah oh oh, Whoah oh oh) 
Tonight, tonight, over and over tonight
