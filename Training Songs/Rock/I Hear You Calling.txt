I've seen you now about the fourth time baby 
But you know that I've got nothing to say 
Its so charming to look on your face but your eyes 
Inviting something I just can't do now I've been around

On my day feels like ages since I've been out your way 
I've been caught up with handful of new sensation 
I hear you calling calling for me out in the night but it's all bad and I know that
