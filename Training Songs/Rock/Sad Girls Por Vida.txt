Waiting, wondering,
While trying to own up, if I find the words,
Apologies are useless without
An address to send them to
Waiting, wondering,
How long you could be missing from my life
Without a clue
I've racked my brain about a hundred times a day
I'm confused by everything, I've used my means,
I'm still uncertain
Now it boils down to one big question
Are we separated by five states, two countries,
Or the next town over?
Sad girls for life [x4]
(I just want to say)
I've racked my brain about a hundred times a day
I'm confused by everything,
I've used my means,
I'm still uncertain
Waiting, wondering
I guess I'll keep my fingers
Crossed till I can get an answer
Sad girls for life [x4]
(I just want to say)
(What's the last thing I said to you?
Can't count on anyone but you)
Wait, wait, wait,
I'll wait here for you [x4]
