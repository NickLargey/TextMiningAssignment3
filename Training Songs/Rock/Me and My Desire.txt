This is me and my desire
Taking all that I require
Such a pretty sight to see
And there's nothing left for me
Well you know it's very funny
And I don't have much money
Change my color it's a dare
Change my face and my hair

Don't want to be a moving part
Back door ladies rearranger
Don't want to feel the cold nights bite
In and out of my life

Fascinated for a while
It's the color of your smile
And there's plain there's nothing free
It's not good enough for me

It's a break up such a made up
What do you desire
No more fake up need a shake up
What do you desire

This is me and my desire
Taking all that I require
Well you know it's very funny
Such a pretty sight to see

This is me and my desire
Taking all that I require
Well you know it's very funny
And I don't have much money
Me and my ? me and my
Me and my desire
Me and my desire
