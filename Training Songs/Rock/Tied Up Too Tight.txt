Oh where I come from
I just don't conform
get me out of here
leave the boredom behind
want to see those bright lights
Get this thing in gear, yeah

So we'll ride in my car 
Follow the star
Drive on into town
with the stereo lit
[something]
I think of them when they're down [perhaps?]

You put your boots on
you put your boots on

and all the boys and girls sing
straight out of west london
just like a loaded gun
its kinda shitty/this kinda city they don't like us
we'll hit the strip tonight
your eyes are burning so bright
can't you feel the blood rush baby
tied up too tight

tell me can you feel it
through the city breathing
feel its beating heart
no superstition
just cold ambition
its time to make a mark
