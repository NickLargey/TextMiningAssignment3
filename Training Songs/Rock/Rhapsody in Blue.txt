She got a tattoo of a bracelet on her wrist 
The love of strangers on her Christmas list 
She ain't sentimental, she don't like to reminisce 
She's a champion of action 

You ain't never heard her voice, but that's all right 
'Cause you ain't never seen her face before tonight 
But now you see her swaying to the left and to the right 
And it rocks your whole foundation 

See her spinning 'round 
Blond hair falling down 
You can hear the sound

Of your heart breaking 
From the love she's taking from you 
The song it's making 
Is like a rhapsody in blue 

Well you ain't never seen no aura in your life 
But you know her's is the color of the sky 
When she looks at you it kills you, 
When she turns away you die 
It's a tragic situation 

So you drink one down for courage, two for soul 
You drink a third for good luck, then you stroll 
Out onto the dance floor, 
But your feet are too damn cold 
And you need more insulation 

See her spinning round

Oh, she don't love you 
Oh, she don't see you in the crowd 
Oh, if she did she would not want you anyhow 

Expectation lingers in the air 
The problem is that no one else is there 
Just the memory of your angel, 
All these ghosts in empty chairs 
Making comments 'bout the weather 

The taxi cab is waiting at the door 
You can hear the driver blowing on his horn 
So you close your eyes one last time, 
And you conjure up her form 
And you shake it down together 

See her spinning round
