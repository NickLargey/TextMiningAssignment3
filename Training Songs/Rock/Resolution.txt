I'm giving up
This whole lie, this whole me
Call it out like a family
Instead I bide my time, get a ride
Until the rubber leaves the road

You said don't lie so I made the truth
Seemed like a lie to even you
Control your fear, it's clear
That you do not know where you're going to

So, don't you worry
You'll be my resolution
Characters of no illusion
You'll be my resolution

One month down and it's in sight
Oh I'm guaranteed to lose my mind
It's dangerous to speak and sigh
You might know what I'm trying to hide

So, from the cradle to quarter age
Oh I bought the book but didn't flip the page
Oh readiness is near, we steer
As far away from the coming of days

So don't you worry
You'll be my resolution
Characters of no illusion
You'll be my resolution

Characters of no illusion
You'll be my resolution

Turn around, put it down and see
That this is really the place to be.
I'm not you, nor you me
But we're both moving steady.
