I'm useless and I know it
Auditory hallucination
You said I don't care what I'm thinking about
But I'm thinking of you right now

Night time is my time
Dreaming I'm leaving
Falling in space
Will I slow down
Or go faster and faster
Into the maybe
Slow down
Right now

I wouldn't feel anything
When we burst into dust forever
And no angels will help us out
'Cause they?ve all gone away

Night time is my time
I'm dreaming I'm leaving
Falling in space
Will I slow down
Or go faster and faster
Into the maybe
Slow down
Right now

Faster and faster
Go faster and faster
Go faster and faster
Go faster and faster
Faster and faster
Faster and faster
Faster and faster
Faster and faster
Faster and faster
