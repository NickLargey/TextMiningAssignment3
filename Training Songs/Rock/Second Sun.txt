I caught the tail of something I forgot to give
It's the strangest of emotions
I couldn't tell if it's the enemy in me
Now well, I could take a thousand years
No one stands and no one hears
Something tells me I could be alright
All the changes I could crawl
It's not enough to save it all
Temporary happiness, I like it

Would you say I'm never gonna tell you
Don't you know I'm straight to the point again
And I'm waiting for the second sun
To show me where I'm going wrong

Could you see if anybody is looking my way
I don't know if I believe you
I hope to god it's coming back on me someday
It's always happening to someone who
Could take it all and see it through
Now I'm left with nothing that I would need
And everything will turn around
And just as I am here I've found
Standing in the wake of you, I like it

Would you say I'm never gonna tell you
Don't you know I'm straight to the point again
And I'm waiting for the second sun
To show me where I'm going wrong
Going wrong

Now you'll hide in the alley way
Safe from the longest day
We'll take on all you say
Temporary happiness
I never thought I'd be
The friend you had in me

Would you say I'm never gonna tell you
Don't you know I'm straight to the point again
And I'm waiting for the second sun
To show me where I'm going wrong

Would you say I'm never gonna tell you
Don't you know I'm straight to the point again
And I'm waiting for the second sun
To show me where I'm going wrong
To show me where I'm going wrong
