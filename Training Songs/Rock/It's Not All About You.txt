You start in the middle and you're doing fine 
But there's just too little to keep them satisfied 
So you try a little harder and you try and try 
Long way off so you go for a ride 
I said everybody wants to have it made 
They don't wanna do nothing but they still get paid 
So you ride a little further and it starts to change 
You think that everything is gonna be the same 

[Chorus]
I said it's not all about you 
You're so cynical and vain 
And I know you'd rather die than take the blame 
It's not all about you 
You're so cynical and vain 
Yeah I swear you can't get out of your own way 

Now you made your way up and you light the few 
But it gets a little foreign and there's nothing to do 
So you look to the middle but it's nothing new 
Everybody wants to be the same as you 
I said everything's gonna be the same 
And it doesn't matter if they ever knew your name 
So you better take the money and forget the fame 
Looking back in the middle and get out of the game 

[Chorus x2]

So it's down to the bottom and there's nothing to say 
I think everybody knew that it would be this way 
It's the same old story and it's such a shame 
So make yourself at home cause we're here to stay 
I said everybody wants to have it made 
And they don't wanna do nothing but they still get paid 
So you ride a little further and it starts to change 
You keep thinking that everything is gonna be the same 

[Chorus]
