One, two, three, oh, she's so
Messed up, she don't even ball
Well, she's so messed up
She has no fun at all
She's a sad case of hit-and-run
I think that I would rather f*ck her mum

Oh yeah, her face is such a mess
The best thing she can do is die
Oh well, I'd save her the trouble
But I bet you'd still call it a crime

Oh would you, now?
So messed up, well, she's so messed up
Oh yeah, she's so messed up, so messed up

So messed up
So messed up
So messed up
So messed up
So messed up, lying in the gutter
So messed up
Flat on her face
So messed up
Yeah, so messed up
So messed up

Oh, she's so messed up she don't feel the pain
Oh, she's so messed up she's always been the same
Oh, well, she's so messed up she don't feel the pain
I think, know what I think, she ain't even got a brain
