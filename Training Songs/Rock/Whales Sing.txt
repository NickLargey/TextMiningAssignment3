You were bad but do you feel it?
And in the hindsight you don't see it
And it's a shame you were forsaken
With the traps set, so well hidden
And I know all whales can sing

With the shouting, you hold me up again
If you're the highway, I'm the pavement
Through back door from the existing
And all the wind blows never ending
I know all whales can sing

Cut all this out, we shall not be turning
Lightly into the wind and never again
Hear the song end of the oh, ocean

The trip is long but you will prosper
You're not alone, boy you have a father
And there's a lesson that they have given
And underwater I can listen
And I know all whales can sing

There is enough for when you come down
Into the water you will hide out
For the changing of what is sacred
Oh, to the father, hope that he will read it
And I know all whales can sing

Cut all this out, we shall not be turning
Lightly into the wind and never again
Hear the song end of the, oh, ocean

I know all whales can sing
And I know all whales can sing
