The door bell rings hard
Ready to go
She's a mess from her head to toe
And it's alright
Yeah it's alright
Falling into lost
Quarter to ten
My friend's going nuts
And it happens again
But it's alright
This is my kind
I'm running down the street
My heels in the air
This city is rough
We're not in Bel Air
And it's alright
This is my kind

Oh what a night
I guess you're ready for the show
(We will be free again)
Oh what a night
I guess you got to let me go
(We will be innocence)

We are surrounded by the hanging trees
I see the lights coming to me
Like diamonds
I feel silence
Your heart stops
(Perjured of me)
I need no money
Man I want your disease
And it's alright
You are my kind
We're running down the fields
Rebels in air
You wanna free world everywhere
And it's alright
Cause we are blind

Oh what a night
I guess you're ready for the show
(We will be free again)
Oh what a night
I guess you got to let me go
(We will be innocence)

I feel you ignorance
I save my innocence
In this world
I feel you ignorance
I save my innocence

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh what a night
Oh what a night

Oh what a night
I guess you're ready for the show
(We will be free again)
Oh what a night
I guess you got to let me go
(We will be innocence)
Oh what a night
I guess you got to let me go
