See it on television every day
Hear it on the radio
It ain't humid but it sure is hot
Down in Mexico
Boss man tryin' to tell me
Beginnin' of the end
Sayin' it'll bend me
Too late my friend
Riff raff
It's good for a laugh
Riff raff
Laugh yourself in half
Now I'm the kind of guy that keeps his big mouth shut
It don't bother me
Somebody kickin' me when I'm up
Leaves me in misery
I never shot nobody
Don't even carry a gun
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong
I'm just havin' fun
Riff raff
It's good for a laugh
Riff raff
Laugh yourself in half
