If l was a bird and you was a fish 
What would we do, l guess we'd wish 
For re-incarnation, re-incarnation 
Wouldn't it be a sensation 
To come back too, like reincarnation 
If l was a tree and you was a flower 
What would we do, l guess we'd wait for the power 
Of re-incarnation, re-incarnation, 
Wouldn't it be a sensation 
To come back too, like reincarnation 
L love you, and don't you know l always will 
You're a girl, l'm a boy, 
But suppose you were a rose 
And l was a whip-poor-will 
If l was a bird and you was a fish 
What would we do, l guess we'd wish 
For re-incarnation, re-incarnation 
Wouldn't it be a sensation 
To come back too, like reincarnation 
If l was a tree and you was a flower 
What would we do, l guess we'd wait for the power 
Of re-incarnation, re-incarnation, 
Wouldn't it be a sensation

You're a girl, l'm a boy,
