I tried to call your number,
But there's just no answer.
Maybe there's no one there at all.
I wait to hear from you,
But it's just no use.
So I'll try again tomorrow.
Over again, as time passes by.

Chorus:
Telephone Exchange, you've got the same old line.
Telephone Exchange, just say hello or goodbye.
Don't keep me waiting by the phone.

It seems like all last evening,
The phone just kept on ringing.
I guess I'll try just a little bit longer.
And so I'll pay with time,
For this lonely crime,
Of wanting to hear you say hello.
Over again, as time passes by.

Repeat Chorus

Solo

Chorus:
Telephone Exchange, you've got the same old line.
Telephone Exchange, just say hello or goodbye
(Repeat Twice)
