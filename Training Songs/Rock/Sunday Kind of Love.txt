I want a Sunday kind of love 
A love to start on Saturday night 
And I want to know its more than love at first sight 
And I want a Sunday kind of love 
Oh yea yea

I want a love thats on the square 
Cant seem to find somebody 
Somebody to care 
Im on a lonely road thats leading no where 
I want a Sunday kind of love

I do my Sunday dreaming
And all my Sunday scheming 
Every minute, every hour, every day

Im hoping to discover 
A certain kind of lover 
Who will show me the way 

my arms need someone 
Someone to enfold 
To keep me warm when Mondays are cold 
i want a love all my life to have and to hold 
Oh I want a Sunday kind of love 
Oh yea yea yea
