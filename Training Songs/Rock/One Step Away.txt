I can't believe it's happening
One more step away from being
What I never thought I'd be
So tell me
It's funny how the pieces came unglued
It's funny you think you have a clue
As to the nature of this game.
We play.

I'm beneath you
You're beneath me
Scrape it all away
Until I'm hollow.

I can't believe it came to be
One more step away from losing
Everything inside of me
You're so intriguing
It's funny how it all just broke in two
It's funny how you think I live for you
And I don't even know your name
Tell me 

I'm beneath you
You're beneath me
Scrape it all away
Until I'm hollow.

Now I'm beneath you
You're beneath me
Scrape it all away
Until I'm hollow.

Scrape away until I'm hollow
Scrape away until I'm hollow
Scrape away until I'm hollow

Tell me I'm beneath you
You're beneath me
Scrape it all away 
Until I'm hollow.

Now I'm beneath you
You're beneath me
Scrape it all away
Until I'm hollow.

Now I'm beneath you
You're beneath me
Scrape it all away
Until I'm hollow.
