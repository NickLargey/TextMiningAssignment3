I take a look around, I don't like what I see 
A bunch of people who don't know shit about Unity 
I see right through your skin, you say you see through mine 
Then please explain to me why we fight all the time 
I can't take it anymore, this is bothering me 
Got people killing each other 
Why does this have to be? 
I wish I knew, I really wish I knew 
How people can see there's no real difference between me and you 
  
It's a bomb with a short fuse 
And I know it seems like no use 
The tension's building a reaction 
This is a call to actionÂ­ 

S.O.S. we need help [Repeat x4] 

Man's inhumanity towards another man 
It's man's insanity and ignorance again 
And now the time had come to stop what's going on 
The hatred's building up, exploding like a bomb 

It's a bomb with a short fuse 
And I know it seems like no use 
The tension's building a reaction 
This is a call to actionÂ­ 

S.O.S. we need help [Repeat x4] 

The bomb is gotta stop Â­the bomb is gonna pop! [Repeat x4] 

It's a bomb, it's a bomb! 

It's a bomb with a short fuse 
And I know it seems like no use 
The tension's building a reaction 
This is a call to actionÂ­ 

S.O.S. we need help [Repeat x4] 

Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop!
