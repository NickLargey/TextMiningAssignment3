Save my heart
For all of time
If you're going to open up
Well, come and pay the price

And take this love
Take it to the streets
Burn down everything
Till you see it all complete

My body, it moves
Like a shooting star
My body, it moves
Like a shooting star

Underneath the stars
They were fading into life
Love was full of slaughter
We moved out of the night

My body, it moves
Like a shooting star
My body, it moves
Like a shooting star

My body, it moves
Like a shooting star
My body, it moves
Like a shooting star
Star, star, star
