Well the first time that I met you, you were only seventeen
But I had to put you down, 'cause I didn't know where you'd been
You had a long black dress, 
Your hair in a mess, 
You didn't seem to have no class
But the look on your face 
Was no disgrace
I knew I'd had to move real fast

Honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild
Oh Honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild
Just about to lose my mind

Well the second time that I met you, you were just turned twenty-one
And all your talk about love, love, was gone, long gone

Oh Honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild
Honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild
Just about to lose my mind

Oh Honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild
Honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild

Honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild
Honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild

Honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild
Honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild

Honey, honey, honey, honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild
