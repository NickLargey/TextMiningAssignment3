I've got a thing for you baby always have 
Never knew how far my heart would take me 
She's my friend but she treats you bad 
Can't let that happen to such a decent man 
If you let me in, let me stay a while 
I'll do more than make you smile 
Come to me child 

I'm gonna soothe you 
Hey baby 
I know just what to do 
My baby 

Don't worry, I won't do you any harm 
My touch is gentle, my body is warm 
Lift your head, feel my cool hand on your face 
Let me kiss your tears away 
If you let me in, honey let me stay 
Lay your head on my breast 
I'll do the rest 

I'm gonna soothe you 
Hey baby 
I know just what to do 
My baby 

Can you feel it 
Comin' down like a trance 
Forget your head remember how to dance 
Can you feel it 
Comin down like healin' 
So deep, it just couldn't be a sin, now baby 
Walk on in, baby come on in 
Make yourself at home in my arms 

I'm gonna soothe you 
Hey baby 
I know just what to do 
My baby
