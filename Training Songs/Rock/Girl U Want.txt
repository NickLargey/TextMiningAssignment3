You're in a corner everywhere you turn,
You know you're headed for the planet of burn,
But the words get stuck on tip of your tongue,
She's the real thing but knew it all along,
She's just the girl, she's just girl
The girl you want

She sings from somewhere you can't see
She sits in the top of a greenhouse tree
She sends out an aroma of undefined love
It drifts on down in a mist from above
She's just the girl, She's just the girl
The girl you want

Look at you (with) your mouth watering
Look at you (with) your mind spinning
Why don't you just admit it's all over
She's just the girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want

You're in a corner everywhere you turn,
You know you're headed for the planet of burn,
But the words get stuck on tip of your tongue,
She's the real thing but knew it all along,
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want

She's just the girl, she's just the girl
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
