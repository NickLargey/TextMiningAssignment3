Say you got two friends
So tight with them
See them all running
They all want revenge

See them on the street
See them all around
Upset the system
Gonna burn it down

Take a swing, fight back
Chances that you take
Knock down, drag out
Stories all the same

Street fight tonight
What you gonna do?
Someone's always running up
Behind you

See them on the run
With bullets in their hand
See them all fighting
They all want revenge

You want a riot
You want a fight
New York City
Is ours tonight

Take a swing, fight back
Chances that you take
Knock down, drag out
Stories all the same

Street fight tonight
What you gonna do?
Someone's always running up
Behind you

You better get ready
No time to mess around
You better get ready
'Cause there's no backing down

You better get ready
No time to mess around
You better get ready
'Cause there's no backing down

They all want revenge
They all want revenge
They all want revenge
