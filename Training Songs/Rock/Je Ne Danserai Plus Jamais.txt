My soul was swayin' to the beat of your heart
And your lips were sayin' that we won't dance apart
Now someone else is holding you the way I did then
So I'll never, no I'll never, never dance again

Oh I've danced with others just to show I don't care
But my arms discovered that the thrill wasn't there 
Unless my arms are holding you the way I did then
So I'll never, no I'll never, never dance again

I'll stay off the dance floor till memories grow dim
'Cause my heart would break to see you take every step with him

I'll survive seein' ya sighin' on that shoulder of his
Oh how I've been cryin' knowin' how sweet that is
So while that guy is holding you the way I did then
I will never, no no I'll never never dance again oh I'll never

No, darlin' no I will never no no I'll never never dance again
No, darlin' no I will never no no I'll never never dance again
Say baby no I will never
Whoa I'll never never dance again
Hey baby no I will never no I'll never never dance again
No baby no I will never
