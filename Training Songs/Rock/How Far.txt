My life is a circle
No beginning and no end
It's always repeating a trail I defend

A misunderstanding
That can't be erased like a file
I've got all I wanted
But still I'm not satisfied

How far will I go to
And search my respect and my pride
How long will I lie to myself
About the privilege of my life
That turns around 'till I die
And take the dark with me

Why am I sad when I have more than I ever had?

My life is too stable I get no air
My jail is my skin I'm false like a fable
That is being praised for it's sin

Once I am trying to follow the light
Then the bitch grips my feet
Pulls me down underneath

How far will I go to
And search my respect and my pride
How long will I lie to myself
About the privilege of my life
That turns around 'till I die
And take the dark with me
