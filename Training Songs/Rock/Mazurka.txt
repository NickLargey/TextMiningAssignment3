I was standing on the corner of the avenue
I was watching all the girls go by
And there she was in a five and ten cent store
Somehow I got to make her mine
Yeah somehow I got to make her mine

I was way uptown, I was lost in the crowd
I was in blood bank, I was standing in line
And there she was, she was checking my count
Somehow I got to make her mine
Yeah somehow I got to make her mine

She got style, she got taste, she's got long, long legs
She got savoir faire
She don't need no hook, she's got more than good looks
She got savoir faire

Maybe in some cafe, along the Champs-Elysee
Maybe Rome, maybe Avenue C
I know I've seen your face some place before
Baby, I love the way you paint your lips
Yes, I love the way you move your hips

She got style, she got taste, she's got long, long legs
She got savoir faire
She don't need no hook, she's got more than good looks
She got savoir faire
