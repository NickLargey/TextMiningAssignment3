Well you followed me all around New York City 
Tryin' to make people think I wanted you with me 
I can only hope that they didn't believe you 
I can' t figure out why I got to deal with you 

What are you doin' in my life? 
What are you doin' in my life? 
What are you doin' in my life? 
I didn't ask for you 

I don't know how you got my telephone number 
Probably some jerk try in' to put me under 
Some friend of a friend of a friend of mine 
Baby who you tryin' to fool when you tell those lies? 

What are you doin' in my life? 
What are you doin' in my life? 
What are you doin' in my life? 
I didn't ask fo are you 

Well this is all a little too much to believe 
You're puttin' my name all around in the street 
Honey where did you think this was gonna lead? 
Baby will you tell me what you want from me? 

Well you're the last woman in the world that thrills me 
Now you got my girlfriend tryin' to kill me 
Honey my friends think that I've gone crazy 
Can't you figure out that you ain't my baby 

What are you doin' in my life? 
What are you doin' in my life? 
What are you doin' in my life? 
I didn't ask for you
