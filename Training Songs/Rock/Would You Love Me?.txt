Sittin' in a movie
And I'm starin' at the screen
They're draggin' Jesus from the town
It don't look good to me

Well, if I had a bucket
I'll bet He had a spoon
I'd go down to that river bed
I'd bring that river home to you

Would you love me?
Would you really love me?
Would you love me?
Would you really love me?

Lovers rode the wheels
Right off the gravy train
They could've shot that mother down
But they didn't, just the same

Oh, and the women threw their panties
And the women threw their bras
Elvis hung his head and said
"They'll forget me when I'm gone, when I'm gone"

Would you love me?
Would you really love me?
Oh, would you love me?
Would you really love me?

I was afraid you wouldn't answer
Did I wake you up?
Listen, I still got this box of band aids here
I'm not bleedin' to patch things up

Oh, there's still some at the bottom
Yeah, I got the box right here
Man, if I could hold that moment to my chest
I swear I'd disappear

Oh, would you love me?
Would you really love me?
Would you love me?
Would you really love me?
Alright
