When I see you smile
It makes me smile too
I can't believe how far away you really are
Did you ever think of anyone else
Did you ever think of yourself
One wish I had I used on you

I'll be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you
(2x)

When I look in your eyes
I see much more than you
I can't believe how fucking strange you really are
I can't think of anyone else
I can barely think for myself
All that I know is that I love you

I'll be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you
(2x)

I don't want to face the world without you
(6x)

I'll be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you
(2x)
