With a feather in your cap
Another jewel in your crown
Another notch in your belt
You’re the captain at the helm
The statuette on your shelf
Says you’re better than me
Better than me

With all the coal in the core
All the water and the oil
You can buy any girl in the world
With the soil that you borrow
And the moral you deny
You can buy the eyes of the world

With all the coal in the core
All the water and the oil
You can buy any girl in the world
With the soil that you borrow
And the moral you deny
You can buy the eyes of the world

Better than me (you’re better than me)
Better than me (you’re better than me)
Better than me (you’re better than me)

Like oil in the ocean
I couldn’t keep to myself
Your father was a merchant
And i’m a salesman myself
See what we have in common
Is so easy to find
We’re wound around each other
Like wires and vines
Wires and vines

Build a shrine to fast goodbyes
And we played sweet adeline
Who should you apologize to?
What is there to say?

And we played sweet adeline
There’s nothing more to apologize for
What is there to say?
