He, likes to keep his brain
On the more mundane
'Cause some things, they just are, you know

Things
Are falling into place
He's thinking of the chase
And picturing her face
Upon
The body of
A silicon based porn-star

I don't know why
But I just
Love everything about you
I'm gonna try
Not to think;
If I think, I could doubt you

Star-crossed lovers take their lives
Every Friday night
He's swearing by the moon again

She, tells invented dreams
Finds It hard to breathe
Writes his name in steam
Upon
The shower screen
With her left hand

I don't know why
But I just
Love everything about you
I'm gonna try
Not to think;
If I think, I could doubt you

Little me
Little unromantic me
Honestly, sincerely
But unromantically
Little me

I don't know why
But I just
Love everything about you
I'm gonna try
Not to think if
I think I could doubt you
