I will walk the road as long as the road goes
I will try to dodge the rock the valley throws
Revealer, caught a fever
We all have a sinking stone

And when the road presents a twisting case of fate
A meaner eye you need to contemplate
The season comes with a reason
We all have a setting sun

Distance, mark of distance
Your burden is your brilliance
There's a vessel, a hidden vessel in the stone

Difference, not indifference
Your passion marks you different
And you wrestle, and how you wrestle to come to know

The whispering light
The truth is awful quiet
Like it's whispering at night
Can tell you how to
Break the fever
With light
The truth is awful quiet
Like whispering in light
Can tell you how to

And light is less and light is more in some
For don't confuse the weather for the sun
Revealer, magic healer
And when will your vision come

And lightning rods will guide your journey home
And revelations from a fist of bones
And when the rock weighs heavy in your soul
Just tell her that you have earned the right to know

Revealer, how to break the fever
You carried in, like these demons your kin
And you'll render it secret then

Distance, mark of distance
Your burden is your brilliance
There's a vessel, a hidden vessel in the stone

Difference, not indifference
Your passion sparks resilience
And you wrestle, and how you wrestle to come to know

The whispering light
The truth is awful quiet
Like it's whispering at night
Can tell you how to
Break the fever
With light
The truth is awful quiet
Whispering at light
Can tell you how to
Break the fever
With light
The truth is awful quiet
Whispering at light
Can tell you how to...
