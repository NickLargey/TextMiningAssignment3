Into the valley of the dolls
Into the valley of the dolls
Into the valley of the dolls
Went the gang of four

Song number one and the rhythm up amping
Drummer beats down 4/4 rock ranking
A bass so deep thud thud spines shaking
And all around mad eyes are rolling

Made up and stunning
As the feet get moving
As the pressure rising
White faces staring

As into the valley of the dolls
Go the gang of four
Song after song rockettes up rocking
One hundred watts scream man

My ears are bleedin'
Hot bodies charged blonde locks a' givin'
And all around - young girls are fainting
Their hearts a pumpin'

As the spikes are dancing
Shank girl shanking
I saw love vibrating
As into the valley of the dolls

Go the gallant four
Into the valley of the dolls
Into the valley of the dolls
As into the valley of the dolls

4 skulls are splitting
5 fingers are clicking
6 strings are burning
7th hour approaching
8 legs are stomping
9 lives are groovin'
10 thousand coasting

X generating
As into the valley of the dolls
Into the valley of the dolls
Into the valley
Into the valley of the dolls
