Sir Jungle, sir Jungle, sir Jungle, sir Jungle

Jungle boy don't fear, jungle boy come near

 Chorus:

Sir Jungle, sir Jungle, go join your gang, yeah, see your lover going crazy
Jungle boy I view, jungle boy come through

In the jungle, I love to rumble, he's the fat guy, he's the bad guy
When the city turns to rubble
Chorus repeats 6x

See your lover going crazy, so let your body do the talking
He's the fat now, he's the bad now, he understands
In the jungle, I love to rumble with my boyfriend
When the city turns to rubble - ooh the trouble
See your lover going crazy, ... jungle boy
... I love jungle boy

chorus repeats 4x

In the jungle, I love the rumble, he's the fat now, he's the bad now
When the city turns to rubble, he's the fat now, he's the bad now

When the city turns to rubble
... I love jungle boy
See your lover going crazy, ... I love jungle boy
