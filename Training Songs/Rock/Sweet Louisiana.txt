Well I thought I'd go out to Tulsa
And ride in a rodeo
Red beans and rice sure would be nice
Back where the Mississippi River flows

And it's a long way back to Vicksburg
Mississippi River is muddy and wide
But it don't seem like much
When sweet Louisiana's waitin' on the other side

Well there's a lot of room up in Canada
Where a man catch his breath
But the men are bold and the women are cold
And you damn near freeze to death

And it's a long way back to Vicksburg
Mississippi River is muddy and wide
But it don't seem like much
When sweet Louisiana's waitin' on the other side

There's pretty girls in Kansas City
And a man can have a ball
But the women in Ouachita Parish
Drive a young man up the wall

And it's a long way back to Vicksburg
Mississippi River is muddy and wide
But it don't seem like much
When sweet Louisiana's waitin' on the other side

Well I thought I'd go out to Tulsa
And ride in a rodeo
Red beans and rice sure would be nice
Back where the Mississippi River flows

And it's a long way back to Vicksburg
Mississippi River is muddy and wide
But it don't seem like much
When sweet Louisiana's waitin' on the other side

'Cause it don't seem like much
When sweet Louisiana's waitin' on the other side
