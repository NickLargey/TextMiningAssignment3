Every inch of you looks like a lady
So don't get caught here in the city at night
And if you want to take a chance and go down crazy
I sell protection for a price

Well, call it love or call it murder
This is the crime of the century
No, don't point that thing on me

[Chorus]
All in all my aim is better
Shots as clean as a mean goal-getter
A bad man on the run
I'm gonna be your dark stranger
Contact man 'tween you and danger
I'll protect you baby with my elephant gun

Every minute counts and you play both sides of the law
Mm, these dangerous days
Mean nine lives doin' anything at all
A lot of folks been blown away

Well, call it love or call it murder
This is the crime of the century
No, don't point that thing on me

[Chorus]

Bang!

Well, call it love or call it murder
This is the crime of the century
No, don't point that thing on me

Don't try to use that thing on me
