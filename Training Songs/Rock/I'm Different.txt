I'm different and I don't care who knows it
Somethin' about me
It's not the same  yeah
I'm different and that's how it goes
Ain't gonna play no goddamn game

Got a different way of walkin'
I got a different kind of smile
I got a different way of talkin'
Drives the women kind of wild
Kind of wild

He's different
And I don't care who knows it
Somethin' about him
It's not the same
He's different
And that's how it goes
And he's not gonna play your gosh darn game

I ain't sayin' I'm better than you are
But maybe I am
I only know that when I look in the mirror
I like the man
We like the man

I'm different and I don't care who knows it
Somethin' about me
Not the same
I'm different and that's how it goes
Ain't gonna play your goddamn game

When I walk down the street in the mornin'
Blue birds are singin' in the tall oak tree
They sing a little song for the people
And they sing a little song for me

He's different and he don't care who knows it
Somethin' about him
Not the same
He's different and that's how it goes
And he's not gonna play your gosh darn game

I'm different and I don't care who knows it
Somethin' about me
Is not the same
I'm different and that's how it goes
Ain't gonna play no boss man's game
