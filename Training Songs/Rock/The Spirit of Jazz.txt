The cool is dead, baby
Go on and sleep
Rest your weary head and love a better me
And in the morning
We'll start over again
That's how they do it up on the screen
So me and my baby
We would dance all night
But I don't know the steps
In my baby's time
To do it like they do it
For the girls uptown
I hear they light them up like the blues
So I'm waiting, so I'm waiting
And she's waiting, and she's waiting
For us to remember

Was I good to you, the wife of my youth
No other soul could love you
Like my rotten bones do
So I will wait on the edges in between
These New York streets
Where you and I would meet

For twenty nine years
We loved that line
And I would take it easy
If I had your mind
But I'm a cannonball to a house on fire
And you're slow like Motown soul
So what man wouldn't love her
With that long black hair
If I cut you up
Maybe I came to bear
To bandage your wounds
With the salt on my tongue
And I'm the only one not here
So I'm waiting, so I'm waiting
And she's waiting, and she's waiting
For us to remember

So was I good to you, the wife of my youth
No other soul could love you
Like my rotten bones do
So I will wait on the edges in between
These New York streets
Where you and I would meet

And only I can heal your wounds
Only I can heal your wounds
When you can't go on
When you can't go on
When you can't go on
When you know, hold on

So was I good to you, the wife of my youth
No other soul could love you
Like my
So was I good to you, the wife of my youth
No other soul could love you
Like my rotten bones do
So I will wait on the edges in between
And I will wait on the edges in between
And I will wait on the edges in between
These New York streets
On all these New York streets
Where you and I would meet
