She was always on the run
She said she didn't need someone
But you know
Somehow you know
And I was only half awake
Waiting for the clouds to break
But you know
Somehow you know

Suddenly we had to be together
Suddenly the world could fade away
The radio was playing Johnny Come Lately
She said hello and I was helpless and everyone knew
The radio was playing Johnny Come Lately
How did they know
How do they know

Rolling under open skies
I wonder why I close my eyes
Little girl, shut out the world
And every little sign tonight
Every little kick inside
Couldn't tell her anyway
What would she say

Somebody said there's no forever
Everybody knew she'd walk away
And I remember the day
The radio was playing Johnny Come Lately
She said hello and I was helpless and everyone knew
The radio was playing Johnny Come Lately
How did they know
How do they know

Running away from the weighted dice
Running from the good advice
And pretending
I knew the ending
Oh I tried, you can hide
From the heart beating inside
