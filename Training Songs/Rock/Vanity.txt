And I wonder where do you get your inpiration?
Where do you get your motivation?
And what motivates me to hold your hand?

And I don't want you to see all these things I hide
When you were holding my hand I didn't think I'd die

And I wonder why do you make that midnight drive-by?
When you left me out to hang dry?
Well this rope is tightening

You couldn't tell me that this was the best you could do
And now you're left me to hang here all alone
And she waits for me
In her sunday dress laced with pink and white
You shouldn' why have shut me out. 
When you're the one that changed your mind
You could've changed your mind
While I was sitting there all alone

If you should die before you ask me  How am I?
If you should die before you ask me  For my life
If you should die before you ask me  If I'd die, 
If I'd die with you

She's innocent but she's got a gun
She'll hand it over then shell run
I'll pull the trigger, yeah, I'll pull the trigger
I'll shoot her up, yeah, I'll shoot her up. 
Bang
I want your plastic perfection
I want to see your vanity
I want you sexy psychotic
So I can see you lunacy

And I wonder where do you get your motivation?
And what motivated me to hold your hand?
Sweetness
This isn't working
I thought the breath that you'd bring would give me life

And she's a mellow dramatic
She thought that I was romantic, but then the gun went off
And now I've left you there to bleed here all alone
And I look so beautiful
In her Sunday dress laced with pink and white
