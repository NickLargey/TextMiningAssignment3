There's a spider crawling on the bathroom mirror
Right on top of my right eye
And I can't stop staring back
How did I get this way?
Take a big look at a living lie

Rags to rags and rust to rust
How do you stand when you've been crushed?
So rags to riches was a bust

Sometimes I dream about it what it's like back home
The railroad tracks and the pussy willow
But I had to leave it and I go back
Whenever my tired head hits the pillow

Rags to rags and rust to rust
How do you stand when you've been crushed?
So rags to riches was a bust

Busted once again
But I'll show them one day
That I can buy and sell the world

One day I'll come through with my American dream
But it won't mean a fucking thing

Rags to rags and rust to rust
How do you stand when you've been crushed?
So rags to rags and rust to rust (don't let me go)
Rags to rags and rust to rust (don't let me go)
Rags to rags and rust to rust (don't let me go)
