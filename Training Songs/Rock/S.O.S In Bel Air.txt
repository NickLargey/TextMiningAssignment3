Well I really got to go now
Phony eyes and you're not just anyone
Even though we're not supposed to
I would rather be close to anything
Is it a false alarm then I'll go on

You can't cross the line
But you can't stop trying 
You can't cross the line
But you can't stop trying
You can't cross the line
But you can't stop trying
You can't cross the line
But you can't stop trying

Alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone

Crystal bamboo
White azure canoe
Crystal bamboo
Do you need an idol or need someone to talk to?

Put my name on your list
S.O.S. in Bel Air

When tired, you're no fun
When idols are boredom to everyone
When every piece of every costume
Are stolen missing I recall the pretty things
Is it the last of me or lesson one?

You can't cross the line
But you can't stop trying 
You can't cross the line
But you can't stop trying
You can't cross the line
But you can't stop trying
You can't cross the line
But you can't stop trying

Alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone

Crystal bamboo
White azure canoe
Crystal bamboo
Do you need an idol or need someone to talk to?

Put my name on your list
