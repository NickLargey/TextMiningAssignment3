Nobody wants her she`s nobody`s child 
Nobody seems to care 
Isn`t it funny now that she needs someone 
There`s nobody there 
 
Mum and Dad have it all arranged 
She`s leaving on the morning train 
For Aunt Nora`s house (so sad) 
Somewhere in the Country 
 
The morning paper social page 
Declined to take a stand 
On Aunt Nora`s house 
Somewhere in the Country 
 
She was a quiet girl 
I really didn`t know her that well 
She was a friendly girl 
I heard that but I`m not one to tell 
Such a shame, who`s to blame? 
It`s so sad 
 
Doesn`t Daddy care at all? 
Can he hear baby cry? 
At Aunt Nora`s house 
Somewhere in the Country 
 
She was an only child 
But it was always hits they gave 
She was a lonely child 
But love was all the poor girl craved 
Such a shame, who`s to blame? 
 
It`s so sad (sad) 
Somewhere in the Country 
It`s so sad (sad) 
Somewhere in the Country 
 
(So sad) Nobody`s child 
Somewhere in the country
