My next-door neighbor
An unassuming man
White picket fences
Respected citizen
In the darkness of hidden passion
In the place that's kept out of view
Raping his teenage daughter softly whispering "I love you"

Look inside: you may find your own de Sade
Thinks you hide, here behind the clean facade

Two-faced creatures - prisoners of the twilight zone
Changing features - contradiction to the bone
Never see eye to eye
Double talk, too many lies
Hypocrites all the way
Doing as we do not see

A loving father
In camouflage concealed
Slaughtering babies
Because their enemies
Butchering in the name of justice
Genocide in the name of peace
"Civilizations" built on blood and bones, when will it cease?

Look inside: do you now your borderline?
Does your self drive a shiver up your spine?

Two-faced creatures - prisoners of the twilight zone
Changing features - contradiction to the bone
Never see eye to eye
Double talk, too many lies
Hypocrites all the way
Doing as we do not see

Our politicians
Leader in wisdom donned
Preach to the masses
And every time they're conned
Slve to greed and servants to power
But the words are honest and pure
The kings of two-facedness reign undisputted and secure

Look inside: would you do it just the same?
What's to hide, everbody plays the game

Two-faced creatures - prisoners of the twilight zone
Changing features - contradiction to the bone
Never see eye to eye
Double talk, too many lies
Hypocrites all the way
Doing as we do not see
