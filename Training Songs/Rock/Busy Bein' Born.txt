The days keep dragging on
Those rats keep pushing on, whoa
The slowest race around
We all just race around, whoa

And when the hope's gone the weight falls on me
Yeah, when I'm gone, the weight falls on me

No sense in signing up
You're names already in
Go ahead, yea, f*ck it up,
The next guy pays for it

'Cause what I get ain't half of what I give
and half don't suit me anyway

'Cause what I get ain't half of what I give
and half don't suit me anyway

Maybe I sacrifice to feel like I'm alive
Penniless, it’s all the same
At least I'll die with a name

I ain't dead yet!

Give it back!
Or I’ll take it!

Give it back!
Or I’ll take it!

Or I’ll take it!

Maybe I sacrifice to feel like I'm alive
Penniless, it’s all the same
At least I'll die with a name

Maybe I sacrifice to feel like I'm alive
Penniless, it’s all the same
At least I'll die with a name

Give it back!
Or I’ll take it!

Give it back!
Or I’ll take it!

And when the hope's gone
The weight falls on me
Yeah, when I'm gone
The weight falls on me

And when the hope's gone
The weight falls on me
Yeah, when I'm gone
The weight falls on me
