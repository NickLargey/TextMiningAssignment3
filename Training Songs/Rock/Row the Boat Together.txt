Standing by a riverside 
A river so deep and so wide 
Current's too strong for only one man 
I know because I tried 

I got eight oars - 
four on either side 
Is there anybody with me 
Eight hands four willing hearts 
Won't someone answer my plea 

Well I got in the boat 
I stayed afloat 
Some way across I was tiring 
Well I need someone to help me 
to get to the other side 

Along came son of Alabama south 
He said "I heard you calling 
If you don't mind the colour of my skin 
I'll help you not to fall in" 

Then suddenly Joe from out of Tokyo 
"If my eyes don't make you nervous 
I used to handle a junk back home" 
Said 'Can I be of service' 

Well we got in the boat 
we stayed afloat 
Halfway across we were tiring 
We got to row this boat together 
to get to the other side 

Two more oars 
only one seat left 
One more person to lean on 
A brotherhood boat to a land called home 
with our share of freedom 

Got in the boat 
stayed afloat 
There's no need to be tiring 
We rowed this boat together 
Happiness meets the other side 
We rowed this boat together 
Happiness meets the other side 
We rowed this boat together 
Happiness meets the other side
