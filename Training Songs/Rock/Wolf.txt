The wolf by the ears
The tiger by the tail
The sinking realization that this time you’re gonna failure is a friend
Who talks behind your back
Puts the bit between your teeth
Let’s the cat out of the bag
And these things may mean more
To me than to you
Just because you don’t believe it
Doesn’t mean it isn’t true
True

Roll with the punches
Smell the roses
Roll with the punches
Smell the roses
Roll with the punches
Smell the roses

Comparisons a thief
a despot and a liar
It will take away your joy in the happiest of
Time will never tell
Space is gonna win
The prayer is to the saint what the bed is to the sin

And these things may mean more
To me than to you
Just because you don’t believe it
Doesn’t mean it isn’t true
True

Roll with the punches
Smell the roses
Roll with the punches
Smell the roses
Roll with the punches
Smell the roses
