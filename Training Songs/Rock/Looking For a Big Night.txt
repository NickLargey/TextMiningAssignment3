Please don't keep us waiting
Hurry light up the night
Big plans in the making
And we've got to do it up right

He'll pick me up at seven
I've been ready for an hour or more
We both smile 'cause we both know
What's in store

Lookin' for a big night
Out on the town
Looking for a big night
As long as Friday rolls around

Lookin' for a big night
Out on the town
Lookin' for a big night
When every Friday rolls around

Every Monday morning
I start out feelin' real low
'Cause I've got for long nights
And five long days to go

Then I begin anticipating
Till there's no one else around
I think about you until my resistance
Don't wanna be found

Lookin' for a big night
Out on the town
Looking for a big night
As long as Friday rolls around

Lookin' for a big night
Out on the town
Lookin' for a big night
When every Friday rolls around

Contemplating the madness
Keeps me in this state of mind
It's not the good it's the badness
That puts me over the line

Everybody should feel it
Everybody should know what it's like
To lose control and lose your soul
To Friday night

Lookin' for a big night
Out on the town
Looking for a big night
As long as Friday rolls around

Lookin' for a big night
Out on the town
Lookin' for a big night
When every Friday rolls around
