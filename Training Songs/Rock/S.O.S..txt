Stagecoach lady, hourglass body
Makin' thinks glow in the night
Well, she would if she could
And she'd be good if she would
Only tell her lover she be out tonight

'Cause I'm a bad
A lonely school boy
And I'm a rat
And it's too bad can't get me none of that
Salt lake city, salt-lickin' bitties
Bogies turn, stinkin' of gin
Well my daddy was hard
His face was pretty scarred
From kickin' ass to playin' poker to win

'Cause I'm a bad
A lonely school boy
And I'm a rat
And it's too bad
Can't get me none of that
It's too bad
It's too bad can't get me none of that

New sold lady my mama Cady
Chivalry was born at her feet
Well she should have thought twice when pa showed his dice
Imagine put my daddy to sleep
'Cause I'm a bad
A lonely school boy
And I'm a rat
And it's too bad can't get me none of that
It's too bad
Lord, it's too bad
I said it's too bad
Lord it's too bad, yeah
I said it's too bad
It's too bad
You know it's too bad
Ah, it's too bad
