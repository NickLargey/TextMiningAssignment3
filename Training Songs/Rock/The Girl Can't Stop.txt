The girl can´t stop
Oh that magical power, directing her dreams
But her only dream was to be up on the screen
Yes and though she had my love, it didn´t seem real

It was the power of a million lovers she need to fool
She got to make it in Hollywood
Makin' it to the top
She knows that it might destroy her, but the girl can´t stop

She got to make it in Hollywood
Makin' it to the top
She knows that I really love her, but the girl can´t stop
She can´t stop

She didn´t need money
I had some of that
But she needed to know it was her those eyes were lookin?at
Now she´s selling her secrets, and shoppin?her past

She was a beautiful baby
But she´s gettin' old fast
She got to make it in Hollywood

Yeah, reachin' out for the top
To feel the eyes of a million lovers
The girl can´t stop
She got to make it in Hollywood
Feelin' her way to the top
Well, she knows that I really love her, but the girl can´t stop
