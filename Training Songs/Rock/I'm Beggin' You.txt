I'm beggin' you, let's start anew
All my fears were wrong
I was too headstrong
Now I'm missing you
It's been too long, and still you're gone
If you ever cared
About the life we shared
Please let me know

I think about you lately
More than you will ever know
And if you could just forgive me
You know I'd love you so

We had a love, to be proud of
What was once a thrill
Then became a chill
And so very cold

So I'm beggin you, let's start anew
Give it one more chance
It's the final dance
Before you go away
I've got something more to say

I think about you lately...

You know I never meant no harm
Can't you see it's just a false alarm
How can I make you change your mind
'Cause I wanna make it right this time
You know I'll love you all the way
That's why I'm beggin' you to stay
You've got to listen to my plea
I'm down here on my bended knees
Baby won't you please come home
Can't stand to be so all alone
