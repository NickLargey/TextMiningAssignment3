dream through warning sign
numb your senses
blisslessly asleep
reason will will you a maze
mortal friend with simple heart
can't buy the blood to follow
without way out
pain not the measure of mercy
pain not the measure of mercy
breathe in a body could smile and catch
breathe in a body could smile and catch
the word
behind words
the word
behind words
whisper wake up call
should sleeper strike back
accept attack and go
mail your message to your soul
seeming lost sometimes stir
in nick of time to need your
sense of balance
pain not the measure of mercy
pain not the measure of mercy
breathe in a body could smile and catch
breathe in a body could smile and catch
the word
behind words
the word
behind words
pain not the measure of mercy...
