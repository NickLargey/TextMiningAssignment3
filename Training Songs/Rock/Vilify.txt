As you vilify, every single move that I make
And try to bind me in your insanity
You'll come to know
That you never had control from the onset
Go find another lap dog, fucker
Your need to clarify Every single word that I say
Has left me wrestling with our disparity Leave me alone
Take another wretched soul on the hell-ride
Go find a more susceptible sucker

I can't believe this is happening
I don't want to start over again
A stone I keep falling over again, and again, and again

When you vilify
You begin to nullify, everything that we've ever done
You're fucking with my head
As you vilify all I've ever given
I don't want to fall apart anymore
I want to end it right now
When you vilify, I start to ponder every battle ever fought
Every thought, imploding in my head
If you vilify, it's a bitter pill that I will force you to devour
Enough, why don't we end it right now?

I've had my fill, and I think I've had enough
When you open your mouth, every word incenses me
Don't want to know, why you every waking moment
Revolves around, criticizing every part of me
Another bill, the number cannot be defined
For the blood and the soul, that had to flow incessantly
F*ck you all And let every minute be a reminder of
How you let it all come crashing down

I can't believe this is happening
I don't want to start over again
A stone I keep falling over again, and again, and again

When you vilify
You begin to nullify, everything that we've ever done
You're fucking with my head As you vilify all I've ever given
I don't want to fall apart anymore I want to end it right now
When you vilify, I start to ponder every battle ever fought
Every thought, imploding in my head
If you vilify, it's a bitter pill that I will force you to devour
Enough, why don't we end it right now?

And when you're broken, and bitter inside
And reality sucks, because you know I'm right
All over nothing, unforgiving inside
Well doesn't it suck, just to know I'm right

When you vilify
You begin to nullify, everything that we've ever done
You're fucking with my head As you vilify all I've ever given
I don't want to fall apart anymore I want to end it right now
When you vilify, I start to ponder every battle ever fought
Every thought, imploding in my head
If you vilify, it's a bitter pill that I will force you to devour
Enough, why don't we end it right now?

When you vilify
You begin to nullify, everything that we've ever done
You're fucking with my head As you vilify all I've ever given
I don't want to fall apart anymore I want to end it right now
When you vilify, I start to ponder every battle ever fought
Every thought, imploding in my head
If you vilify, it's a bitter pill that I will force you to devour
Enough, why don't we end it right now?
