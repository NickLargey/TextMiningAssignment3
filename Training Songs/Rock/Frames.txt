My heart is getting heavier
Heavier than I ever thought it could
And for a while I believed that I was Superman but I misunderstood
And you could chase me down 'cause you know how 
I wanna feel like what we had was good
But now my heart is getting heavier
Heavier than I ever thought it should

With this empty space I can't replace
The overwhelming merry on your face
And in this hollowed empty picture frames
I wish I never even knew
These walls with empty picture frames
If new then all they hate to do
Halls with empty picture frames, I wish I never even knew your name

Recognize I'm terrified, I wonder if I'll ever be this way
But hold it here and wait my dear
In case you ever need a place to stay
Well I know that this is just a song
But maybe it will lead you here someday
We both know I fucked it up and I'll f*ck it 
You don't believe in love to love another way

Oh easier than said and done, my heart is growing heavy anyway
Well it's better to be loved than lost, at least that's what the older people say

Well I'll be alone, I told you so
And time and time again I let it go
But if you never had a broken heart then there's no way in hell you'll ever know

My heart is getting heavier
Heavier than I ever thought it could
My heart is getting heavier
Heavier than I ever thought it should

Now my heart is getting heavier
Now heavier than I ever thought it could
Well my heart is growing heavier
Heavier than I ever thought it should
Ever thought it should

Now my heart is getting heavier
Heavier than I ever thought it could
And for a while I believed that I was Superman but I misunderstood
And well you chased me down 'cause you know how 
I wanna feel like what we had was good
But now my heart is getting heavier
Heavier than I ever thought it should
Ever thought it should

Well I'll be alone, I told you so
And time and time again I let it go
But if you never had a broken heart then there's no way in hell you'll ever know
