You've been waiting so long to find it in yourself that you have nothing
You've been trying to find yourself through the years
From the start to the finish line
And I can say I have been honest with you
But you're not gonna listen, You don't ever listen

Make your own, make your own history
Leave behind your legacy
Make your own, make your own
Make your own history
Leave behind, leave behind your legacy

Blindly following footsteps before you know it
Traveled closer to your own death
Through the years you've misplaced identities
A hybrid of lies and apologies

Think for yourself
Prove to everyone that your life means something
Do you want to be alive?

Make your own, make your own history
Leave behind your legacy
Make your own, make your own
Make your own history
Leave behind, leave behind your legacy

Stop trying to be something that you're not
Start thinking with your heart and focus on what you got
Make your mark on the world
Because the only lives that count are the ones that make an impact

To live a life is to be profound
Pick yourself up get your feet off the ground
No use for everything to be handed to you
The higher the better it doesn't matter what you do

Make your own history
Make your own history
Make your own history
Make your own history
Make your own history
Make your own
