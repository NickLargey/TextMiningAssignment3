Fill me up, fill me up,
I'm a long way from home,
And I don't have a lot to say.

Fill me up, fill me up,
Cause you're all that I've got,
And I traveled a long, long way.

Cheer me up, cheer me up,
Cause I'm all alone,
And I'm takin' it day by day.

Cheer me up, cheer me up,
Cause you're all that I've got,
And I traveled a long, long way.

I'm a bellhop now, on a busy day,
And I'm starting at sunrise.
And the color of dawn,
From this plane that I'm on,
Is the day breaking in your eyes.

I'm a still-life now, on a tabletop.
I'm a case-study in French Blue.
And it's clear to me now
That the whole of my life,
I've been making my way to you.

And I know where you live,
And I know who you are.
So don't get too close.
And don't go too far...

Well I might be alright,
If I just see the light,
I don't care if the phone don't ring.
And I'll know when it's right,
Like a voice in the night,
And the right shade of Tangerine.

Fill me up, fill me up,
I'm a long way from home,
And I don't have a lot to say.

Cheer me up, cheer me up,
Cause you're all that I've got,
And I traveled a long, long way.

And I know where you live,
And I know who you are.
So don't get too close.
And don't go too far...

Don't get too close!
And promise me that you'll never go too far...
Don't go too far! Oh!

Fill me up! Fill me up!
I'm a long way from home,
And I don't have a lot to say.

Fill me up! fill me up!
'cause you're all that I've got!
And I traveled a long, long way.

Cheer me up! Cheer me up!
Cause I'm all alone,
And I'm takin' it day by day!

Fill me up! Fill me up!
'cause you're all that I've got!
And I traveled a long, long way.

Well, I travel led a long, long way.
Yeah, I traveled a long, long way.
