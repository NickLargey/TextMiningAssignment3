In a word or two, it's you I want to do
No not your body, your mind you fool
Come here baby, yeah

We're all alone in a villa on the Rivera
That's in France on the south side
In case you cared
Out of all your friends I want to be the closest
That's why I tell you things
So you'll be the mostest
When it comes to life, to be this man's wife
You got to be well educated on the subject of fights
I mean prevention of
In other words, its R.E.A.L meaning of this thing called love
Are you up on this?
If so, then you can get up off hug and a kiss

Come here baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker

Come here baby, yeah

We need to talk about things
Tell me what ya do, tell me what ya eat
I might cook for you
See it really don't matter cause it's all about me and you
Ain't no one else around
I'm even with the blindfold, gagged and bound
I don't mind, see this ain't about sex
It's all about love being in charge of this life and the next,
Why all the cosmic talk?
I just want you smarter than all the people who take that walk

Come here baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker

Come here baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker

Horns stand please

I like it, I like it

You seem perplexed I haven't taken you yet
Can't you see I'm harder than a man could get
I got wet dreams comin' out of my ears
I get hard if the wind blows your cologne near me
But I can take it, 'cause I want the whole nine
This ain't about the body, it's about the mind

Come here baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker

Come here baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker

Guard your folks and get your daughter
The sexy motherfucker's so fine I could drink her bathwater
A long, leggy 5'8", packing an ass as tight as a grape
I want to spit some game but I said to myself mmm
Just conversate (Yeah!), 'cause I'm usually quite the calm one (Come on!)
You never found me out prowling boy, I'm just havin' fun
But I'm happy to change my state of mind for this behind
I bet that if you threw that ass into the air it would turn into sunshine

Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass
Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass
