All my friends are takin' over
To make a mess of me
All my friends are broke and ugly
And make a mess of me

Then I saw a river fall from Heaven
Rain mistakes on me
Then I saw your mother shoot your father
Killed herself the same

All my friends have made a cyclone
To make a mess of me
All my friends have broken silence
To make a mess of me
All my friends are takin' over
To make a mess of me
All my friends are broke and ugly
And make a mess of me

Then I saw a river fall from Heaven
Rain mistakes on me
Then I saw your mother shoot your father
Killed herself the same

Blow it all away
Get the gun out
Load the bullets
Shot that fucker in his head
