She told me Sunday
Baby its over
We cant go on this way
I really love you
But I must live too
She said take care okay?

Please don't look my way
When you see me on the street
We will still be strangers
When we meet

I never really
Thought that you'd give up
Your home and Family
I've got my own life
You've still got your wife
She whispered tenderly

Please don't look my way
When you see me on the street
We will still be strangers when we meet

All throughout this troubled time
Times I wish that you were mine
Spend my nights and days thinking of you
Sometimes lie awake at night
Think of you and its all right
Spend my days and nights
Dreaming of you

She told me Sunday,
Baby its over
We cant go on this way
I really love you
But I must live too
She said take care okay?
