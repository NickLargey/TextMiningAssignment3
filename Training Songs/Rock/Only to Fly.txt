You must live
What you really love
You must be
Only what you're dreaming of
Like a bird
Rising through the sky
You are only
Only to fly

When you hear the sound you love
Do you turn and walk away
Is it something you are frightened of
Are you scared what it may say

You must run you cannot hide
It's only what you really feel
It calls to you from deep inside
You've got to know this dream is real
Only to fly
Only to fly
Only to fly

You must live what you really love
You must be only what you're dreaming of
Like a bird rising through the sky
You are only
Only to fly
Only to fly
