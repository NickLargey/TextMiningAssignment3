I got a fatal heart, I'm tried to living 
Got a tortured soul, I can't give it away 
Gonna find a line, to get me through to reason 
Gonna bury it all just to give it a name 

I hate the taste but I carry I'm believing 
I hate the taste but I'd do it again 
I hate the taste but I carry I'm believing 
Yeah I hate the taste but I'd do it all again 

I'd say I told you so but I'd know you never listen 
You're the only one I ever can't assure 
There's a fine line between fool and heartache 
It's the fatal sign that makes heartache fools 

I hate the taste but I carry I'm believing 
Yeah I hate the taste but I'd do it again 
I hate the taste but I carry I'm believing 
Yeah I hate the taste but I'd do it all again 

I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there? 
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there? 

I got a traitors heart, I'm tired of living 
With a tattered soul I got no one to blame 
Gonna fall apart if I leave it to decision 
She's the only one that can take it away
 
I hate the taste that I carry I'm believing 
Yeah I hate the taste but I'd do it again 
I hate the taste but I carry I'm believing 
Yeah I hate the taste but I'd do it all again 

I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there? 
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there? 

I carry all the mess want to dance with direction 
I'm as sick as it gets, I need you there 
I carry all the mess want to dance with direction 
I'm as sick as it gets, I need you there 
I'm a mess

I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there? 
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there?
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there?
