See the sun
Shine above your head
See the love
That you once had
Don't ever let go
Oh no
See the dreams
That you hold inside
See the hope
See the colours fly
Don't ever let go
Oh no
Don't ever let go â?? oh no
And if you wish upon it
With open eyes
The world will sing to you
Yeah if you really want it
Then hold on tight
You've got everything to loose
See the world
Through a child's eyes
Never give up
Or let it slip by
Don't ever let go
Oh no â?? don't ever let go
When fortunes open wide
And if you wish upon it
You'll be surprised
How the world will sing to you
If you really want it
Then hold on tight
You've got everything to loose
Don't ever let go
You need to keep the dream alive
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
Hold on tight
