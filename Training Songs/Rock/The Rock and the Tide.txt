See a mountain, see an ocean, see the years that bring
Rock and tide close together
Settle down I say to myself, things that come with time
Will always be better

Everyone gets what they want too fast, these days
No one knows the way to make things last

Still I say, hey baby, I'm through waiting
'Cause I need you now I'll show you how
You can take my hand and save me, c'mon save me

Everyone gets what they want too fast, these days
No one knows the way to make things last

Now the moon is in the right place after years of
Spinning 'round the sun, so I'm done with
All the times I strained to find 
A rhyme left me blind, and busted

Everyone gets what they want too fast, these days
No one knows the way to make things last

Still I say, hey baby, I'm through waiting
'Cause I need you now I'll show you how
You can take my hand and save me, c'mon save me
C'mon save me

Baby, I'm through waiting
'Cause I need you now I'll show you how
You can take my hand and save me, 
Hey, baby, I'm through waiting
'Cause I need you now I'll show you how
You can take my hand and save me, c'mon save me
C'mon save me, c'mon save me, c'mon save me
