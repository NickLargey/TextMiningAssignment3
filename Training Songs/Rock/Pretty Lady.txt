She's a pretty lady
She sings a pretty song
She ain't got no money
She barely just gettin' along

Same old story on the street
You really got to hand it to the girl
She's a star and she knows it
She's out to prove it to the world

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Listen to her music
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And every man is out to make her a star
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

She's a pretty lady
She sings a pretty song
She may be lonely now
But she won't be lonely too long

She's a beautiful lover
But let me warn you from the start
She may give you her love
But she'll never give you her heart

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Listen to her music
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And every man is out to make her a star
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Listen to her music
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And every man is out to make her a star
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

She's a pretty lady
Sing a pretty song
