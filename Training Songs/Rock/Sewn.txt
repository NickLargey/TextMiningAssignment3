Give me the song and I'll sing it like I mean it 
Give me the words and I'll say them like I mean it 

Cos you got my heart in a headlock 
You stopped the blood and made my head soft 
And god knows 
You got me sewn 

Nah nah nah 

Danny boy, don't be afraid, to shake that ass, and misbehave 
Danny boy, I now you got time, but what are you waiting for, 
Anyway the dust may just blow away, if you wait for a windy day 

But you may find the chance has past you by; 

I cant do the walk 
I cant do the talk 
I cant be your friend 
Unless I pretend 

So give me the song and I'll sing it like I mean it 
So give me the words and I'll say them like I mean it 

Cos you got my heart in a headlock 
You stopped the blood and made my head soft 
And god knows 
You've got me sewn 

Nah nah nah 

Danny boy, don't be a fool 
Take upon to break the rule 
Danny boy your lookin' so low 
You lookin' like the dead grown old 
Anyway the blues just may wash away, if you wait for a rainy day 
But you may find, the chance had past you by 

I cant do the walk 
I cant do the talk 
I cant be your friend 
Unless I pretend 

So give me the song and I'll sing it like I mean it 
Give me the words and I'll say them like I mean it 

Cos you got my heart in a headlock 
You stopped the blood and made my head soft 
You've got my heart in a headlock 
You stopped the blood and made my head soft 
Made my head soft 
Made my head soft 
Made my head soft 
Made my head soft 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah
