Well billy was hip with the time to tip
He said man you got to see her dance
The way she move to that funky groove
Put something restless in your pants

I ran down to miss kitty kat
You know the place I mean
For my [unknown] chiquita, all the from New Orleans
She make you scream

The way she shake that thing
Put my heart on a string
The way she shake that thing

I laid eyes on a sweet chiquita
Boys I'll never be the same
She had that look can't be mistook
Nah the way she shook that frame

Made me holler mercy
Mercy don't do me no good
Girl give me such a hard time
Give me a case of wood
Oh those clothes she wore

The way she shake that thing
Put my heart on a string
The way she shake that thing

Kitty kat finally folded
When chiquita ran out on her own
Been a couple of years gone down
She took off for parts unknown
But every now & then, me & my one eyed friend
We remember yesterday
Take our advice, you want somethin' nice
She never comes your way, guarantee you'll say

The way she shake that thing
Put my heart on a string
The way she shake that thing
