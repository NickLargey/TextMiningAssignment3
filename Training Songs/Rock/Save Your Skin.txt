If all the people that you ever knew
Pooled all their money and gave it to you
Do you think you could raise enough to save your skin?
Save your skin
Save
Save
If all the people that you ever knew
Pooled all their money and gave it to you
Do you think you could raise enough to save your skin?
I don't know
I don't mind how high you climb
No I don't mind that climb is mine
Save your skin
