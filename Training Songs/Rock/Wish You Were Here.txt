You're the sweetest thing that there's ever been
You can make history just by walking in
You're an animal lover this cat thinks you're a kitten
I want to rabbit about you to anyone who'll listen

You're OK
You're alright
Don't have to be blind to know that you're out of sight
Having said that my dear
How I wish that you were here

You can talk the birds right down from the tree
You can make a grown man cry just by saying please
You're an Olympic runner, stop them in their tracks
When you leave the field behind they keep on coming right back

You're OK
You're alright
Don't have to be blind to know that you're out of sight
Having said that my dear
How I wish that you were here

Well you're the tops
You're the best
You could even say you're the rest
Must admit
I must say
You darling are so OK
You're alright

Don't have to be blind to know that you're out of sight
Having said that my dear
Oh having said that my dear
Having said that my dear
Oh having said that my dear
