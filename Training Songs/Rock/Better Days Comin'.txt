There's a sign of a better day comin'
It's your time, baby stop bumming
Just feel the love in stormy weather

And if you wanna know how
You gotta line 'em up now
Every damn day (right now)

If you want it come and get it
Woah, yeah

Just like Saturday
Everything's ok

Turn around
All around the world
Better days comin'
You're the sound
Just gotta listen now
Better days comin'

There's a light at the end of your tunnel
Like day from night
Whoa, yeah

Just a step away
Everything's ok

Turn around
All around the world
Better days comin'
You're the sound
Just gotta listen now
Whoa yeah, whoa yeah
Better days comin'

Just like Saturday
Everything's ok

Turn around
All around the world
Better days comin'
You're the sound
Just gotta listen now
Whoa yeah, whoa yeah

Turn around
All around the world
Better days comin'
You're the sound
Just gotta listen now
Better days comin'
