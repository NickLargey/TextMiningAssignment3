All of your faults lay them at my feet 
I wanna walk with you darlin’
All of my fears keep them from me 
I wanna hide with you darlin’ sweet 

Tonight our little apartment is a house in the Heights 
And it's lit up so bright by your smile 
You're my music and you're my sound 
And I don't wanna get used to not having you around
I don't wanna get used to not having you around

Movin’ our bones to our favorite songs
I wanna dance with you darlin’
Lovin’ me now like you loved me back then
I just wanna be with you darlin’ sweet 

Tonight our little apartment is a house in the Heights 
And it's lit up so bright by your smile 
You're my music and you're my sound 
And I don't wanna get used to not having you around
I don't wanna get used to not having you around

And you're crying, but not because you miss me
But because I'm missing everything
And you're crying, but not because you miss me
But because I'm missing everything

Tonight our little apartment is a house in the Heights 
And it's lit up so bright by your smile 
You're my music and you're my sound 
And I don't wanna get used to not having you around
I don't wanna get used to not having you around
