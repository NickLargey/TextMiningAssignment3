You're wasting your time coming 'round here
What got you to thinking there was something new going on?
You're wasting your time coming 'round here
What got you to thinking I had a different song?

Been lying awake all night trying to figure out
It's that old song - keeps running around in my head

You're wasting your time coming 'round here

But what's good for me is not necessarily for the best
So play it for me

Sometimes it works, sometimes it don't, you know
Some days it hurts, some days it feels real good
Sometimes it hurts, sometimes it don't, you know
Some days it works so good I can see my way home

Been climbing these old walls warning and screaming what a cheat you are
Ah, how much you mean ?
'Cause nothing else comes near me, you got this trick going on
May have the sharpest chisel, the keenest eye
It's just that old song, I've only got the one

So play it for me

Sometimes it works, sometimes it don't, you know
Some days it hurts, some days it feels real good
Sometimes it hurts, sometimes it don't, you know
Some days it works so good I can see my way home

I may unscrew the top just to hear that sound
I may pour a little just to see the light shining through
A little sip, but no more
Hey, you belong to me now, don't you wander too far

So play it for me
And I'll play it for you
So play it for me
And I'll play it for you

Sometimes it works, sometimes it don't, you know
Some days it hurts, some days it feels real good
Sometimes it hurts, sometimes it don't, you know
Some days it works so good...

I'm wasting my time coming 'round here
What once burned so brightly is all but smoke in the air

You're wasting your time coming 'round here
What got you to thinking I had a different song?
