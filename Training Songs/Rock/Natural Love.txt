Natural love (natural love)
It's natural love (natural love)
Honey, you and I
Lying in the midnight sun

I say it's natural love (natural love)
It's natural love (natural love)
So hold me close
Our love has just begun

Oh, darling, it was good for me
I know it was good for you
We'll make the best
A little better tonight

A whispered word, a tender kiss
I tremble when we touch like this
Well, it's so good, so strong, so right

Natural love (natural love)
It's natural love (natural love)
Baby, you and I
Lying in the midnight sun

You know it's natural love (natural love)
It's natural love (natural love)
So hold me close
Our love has just begun

Come on and let your feelings go
Say the words we both know
Don't hold back any love feeling tonight

Surrender's what I wanna do
When I get the mood for you
Well, it's so good
Well, it's so good, so strong, so right
