Girl I stand accused
People say I love you
Yeah, I stand accused
Oh but what can I do
You belong to some other guy
Hope I never have to testify
If loving you is a big crime
I've been guilty a long time

Girl I stand accused
With no more than a chance
Yeah I stand accused
And I got no defense
All I need is a touch from your hand
Find myself on the witness stand
I'd be unable to lie girl
I got a love that won't die girl
Tell the world that I was guilty
I wouldn't stand a chance
Tell the world that I was a victim
A victim of circumstance

Girl knock myself out see if I could explain
Girl I love you so much that I'm almost insane
You disturbed my balance of mind
Couldn't help what I did at the time
I stand accused and I'm guilty
Baby I always will be
I need a witness baby
