Back me up cover me
Bless my soul set me free

I will smile so don't you cry
We both know the reasons why

I'm wide awake and I'm flying
Don't bring me down bring me down

Is all about life 
Its all about breathing
Doing what's right
To be the one you're meant to be
Its all about trust
And what you belive in
Baby this time 
Its all about me

Hands untied minds made up
My feet are walking I can't stop

I was blind I was stuck
But now I'm loose wish me luck baby
I'm wide awake and I'm flying
Don't bring me down bring me down

Is all about life 
Its all about breathing
Doing what's right
To be the one you're meant to be
Its all about trust
And what you belive in
Baby this time 
Its all about me

How can I explain to you
This thing I'm going through
I can only keep my faith
And do what I belive is true
I will stay on track
I'm never looking back again
