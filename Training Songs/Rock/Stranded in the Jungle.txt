I crashed in the jungle while tryin' to keep a date
With my little girl who was back in the states
I was stranded in the jungle afraid and alone
Tryin' to figure a way to get a message back home
But how was I to know there was a record jump my plane
Had been picked up and spotted my girl in lovers lane
And meanwhile, back in the states

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle flat as he can be
So come on pretty baby just you and me
Meanwhile back in the jungle

The boys in the jungle had me on the run
When something heavy hit me like an atomic bomb
When I woke up and my head started to clear
I had a strange feeling I was with cooking gear
I smelled something cookin' and I looked to see
That's when; I found out they was a cookin' me
Great Cuckoo let me outta her
Meanwhile back in the states

[Chorus]

I jumped outta the pot and finally got away
Frantic and worried about what my baby would say
So I jumped in the ocean and started to swim
But my chance of survival was gettin' mighty slim
So I thumbed down a whale who was headin' my way
And I reached the states in bout a half a day
And when I got to lovers lane I was almost dead
When my soul was gone, here's what I said

Baby, baby, your man is no good
Baby, baby, he should've understood
You can trust me as long as can be
So come back pretty baby where you used to be
Cause I love you, cause I love you
Cause I love you, cause I love you
Cause I love you,
