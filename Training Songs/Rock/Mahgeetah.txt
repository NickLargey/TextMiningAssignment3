Sittin' here with me and mine
All wrapped up in a bottle of wine
Little we can do... 
We gonna see it through somehow
So...now are you ready to go, my lady?

I been waitin' on the boat here 
I been waitin so long
Can he see me? 
Does he feel me?
Does he know me at all?
Does it shiver?
Always deliver?
Does it know me at all?

Bang! Bang! Goes the night
All wrapped up in the firelight
Don't rock bottom, just listen
Just slow down
Do...now are you ready to go, my lady?
I been waitin' on the boat here, 
I been waitin' so long...
