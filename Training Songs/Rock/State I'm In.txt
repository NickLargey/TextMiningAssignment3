Can we carry on
Or must we still pretend
That we're really friends
Those feelings have gone
But we're not the same
And we're both to blame
There's nothing left to tell you
Nothing left to give you

[Chorus]
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
You walk out when I walk in
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
Can't you see the state I'm in

Now the time has come
To leave the past behind
And I've made up my mind
Look at what we've done
Who needs to be ashamed
Of the crying game
I've built my world around you
I'm better off without you

[Chorus]

There's nothing left to tell you
Nothing left to give you

[Chorus]
