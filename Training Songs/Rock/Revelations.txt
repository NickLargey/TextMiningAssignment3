There’s nothing to be scared of, there’s no reason to be afraid 
So, why do you keep running away? 

From the angel to the devil that follows, there’s no promise in tomorrow 
If I should die before I wake, I’d pray for all, a goodness sake 

I’ve been given a chance to start again, I’ve been given the chance to tie lose ends
Pleading and praying these dreams stop fading 
I’ve been given a chance to start again, I’ve been given the chance to tie lose ends
I swear to God that this could be my last goodbye, I hope it makes you cry 
(Do you feel anything? I’ve held back not a thing)

‘Cause I can’t help, but scratch at these stitches, and you can’t help but burn these bridges
We’ll watch them go down in ashes, second guessing second chances 
The Irony of living in memories 
There’s no way out of this scarless, no love should be so heartless 
Oh you know that this could be my last goodbye 

I’ve been given a chance to start again, I’ve been given the chance to tie lose ends
Pleading and praying these dreams Stop fading 
I’ve been given a chance to start again, I’ve been given the chance to tie lose ends
I swear to God that this could be my last goodbye, I hope it makes you cry 
(Do you feel anything? I’ve held back not a thing)

Searching for the answers or looking for a sign, you’re never gonna find it, if all you do is runrun away
I’ve been given a chance to start again Pleading and praying these dreams stop fading Stop Fading
I am new again 

My heart is in the places I have been, experiences, and my fair share of sin 
Though time drifts on, (The memories live on/The memory lives on) 
I’ve been given a chance to start again, I’ve been given the chance to tie lose ends 
Pleading and praying these dreams stop fading 
I’ve been given a chance to start again, I’ve been given the chance to tie lose ends
I swear to God that this could be my last goodbye; I hope it makes you cry
