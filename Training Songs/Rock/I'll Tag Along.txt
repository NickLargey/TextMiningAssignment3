Don’t mind me, friend of a friend
Bent the key to my lost weekend
Don’t mind me, along for the ride
Diz, the gas man says, it’s all right

Tag along
I get a taste of things
Flap my little wings
I’ll tag along

You could be my kind of crowd
A little bit edgy, a little bit loud
I test the water, I feel the heat
Before I jump in with both feet

I’ll tag along
I keep out of your hair
You’ll hardly know I’m there
I’ll tag along

Love those swirly whirly lights
Love that girl with the rips down her tights
Might have to hurl when the Molotov bites
I’ll tag along

I didn’t do it, it wasn’t me
I was at the back, invisible, see?
I’m a 100 per cent and that’s a fact
You can ask Diz, I’ll be right back

I’ll tag along
And get a taste of things
And flap my little wings
I’ll tag along

Light fantastic, pop a few
My brain’s elastic, appetite too
Cash or plastic? I’d kill for the loo
I’ll tag along

I’ll tag along
I’ll tag along
