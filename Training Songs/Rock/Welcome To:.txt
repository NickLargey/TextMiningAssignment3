Welcome to:
No amount of stoned makes you feel ok
Welcome to:
This year's alone - brought to you by Christmas day

Welcome to:
The darkness into which prayin' people pray
It's quiet here except for this song
Now that everybody's gone

But hey
Least you don't have to play along today
Welcome to:
Something like elation when you first open your eyes

Just 'cause it means
That you musta finally got to sleep last night
Welcome to:
The precipice between groundlessness and flight

It's quiet here except for this song
Now that everybody's gone
But hey
Least you don't have to play along today

Besides which
Welcome to:
Taking the good stuff down off of the shelf
And welcome to:

The art of conversation with yourself
Welcome to:
Humming an unbroken tune
All day long

Yes it's quiet here
But hey
Least you don't have to play along today
