You gotta walk that walk 
You gotta talk that talk 
You gotta be that girl 
In the toughened world 
Come , now cut me so fast 
[Chorus]
Pirate Love 
What you're looking for 
Pirate Love 
What I'm wanted for 
I never needed it so bad 
[2nd Verse]
The crowd's runnin' cold 
Ain't it ? 
The mommies are praying 
Little girls sayin' no 
The big girls always want more 
[Chorus]
Pirate Love 
What you're looking for 
Pirate Love 
What I'm wanted for 
I never needed it so bad 
Hey , oh ! 
[3rd Verse]
Well , I'm locked in all these battles 
Everybody seems so cruel 
I can't tell them who's who 
With a bag of voodoo 
[Chorus]
Pirate Love 
What you're looking for 
Pirate Love 
What I'm wanted for 
I never needed it so fast 
Fast 
Fast 
Yeah 
Pirate Love [x8]
[Chorus]
Pirate Love 
What you're looking for 
Pirate Love 
What I'm wanted for 
I never needed it so bad !
