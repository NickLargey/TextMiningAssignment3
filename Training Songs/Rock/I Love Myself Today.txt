You left me like a broken doll
In pieces as I took the fall
For you, you dumb chump!
You left me free-falling like space junk
Burning up in the atmosphere of life

Well I sound like a philosopher
But I'm a fool who's off her rocker
Cause I let you in my heart that one last time

I've had enough, made up my mind
I'm gonna get up and out and

[Chorus]
I love myself today
Not like yesterday
I'm cool, I'm calm
I'm gonna be okay! Uh huh
I love myself today
Not like yesterday
Take another look at me now
Cause it's your last look
Your last look forever

Well look at you you're all puffed up
In that big red truck- but you're outta luck (this time)
Well, that's tough
Cause I'm on fire- too hot to touch
With a chatroom full of lovers on the line
Gonna step right up. Spit shine my soul
I'm gonna be proud and loud and outta control!

[Chorus]

I'm lookin' in the mirror and I like what I see,
I've lost the fear & the horror that's been eating at me
Cause being with you is like a hangman's noose
I was living my life in dead man's shoes

I've had enough. Made up my mind
I'm gonna get up and out and

I love myself today
Not like yesterday
I'm cool, I'm calm
I'm gonna be okay! Uh huh
I love myself today
Not like yesterday
Take another look at me now

[Chorus]

I love myself today [Repeat: x7]
