[Chorus]
Baby, you're my heart's desire
Your love sets my soul on fire
You're my type, you're my kind
You're always on my mind
You're my heart's desire

When the sun comes up in the morning
You're the first thing, baby, on my mind
When the sun goes down in the evening
You're the last thing, baby, on my mind

Baby, you're my heart's desire
Your love sets my soul on fire

There ought to be a law against the way
You turn me on, baby, night and day
I hear your voice but you're not there
I see your face, baby, everywhere

Baby, you're my heart's desire
Your love sets my soul on fire, yeah

[Chorus]

Don't know why I love you so
But I know I'll never let you go
Don't know why I need your love so bad
But you're the only love I've ever had

Baby, you're my heart's desire
Your love sets my soul on fire
You're my type, you're my kind
You're always on my mind

Baby, you're my heart's desire
Your love sets my soul on fire
You're my type
