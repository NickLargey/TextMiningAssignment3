Babylon's burning
You're burning the street
You're burning your houses
With anxiety

With anxiety
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning with anxiety
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning

Babylon's burning
You're burning the street
You're burning the ghetto
With anxiety

With anxiety
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning with anxiety
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning

Babylon's burning, baby can't you see?
Babylon is burning with anxiety

You'll burn at your work
You'll burn at your play
It's positively smoldering
With ignorance and hate

And with anxiety
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning with anxiety
Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning

Babylon's burning, baby
Can't you see?
Babylon is burning with anxiety

Babylon's burning, babylon's burning
Babylon is burning
Babylon's burning, babylon's burning
Babylon's burning
