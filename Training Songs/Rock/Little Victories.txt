All these little victories, yeah
All these little victories, yeah

Look at the angel high up above the ground
She must've burned her wings now afraid to come down
Far below things are looking bad
Lines have got crossed and the world's gone mad today
I'm stuck in Texas and I'm trying to reach L.A.

All these little victories, yeah
All these little victories, yeah

Well, it seems to me the older we get
The more we see, the more we forget
The way history goes round and round
It's kinda funny but right now I don't feel like laughing out loud

All these little victories, yeah
All these little victories, yeah

We thought we come so far
But we're yet to win the war, yet to win the war

But I wish that angel, high in the air would cry to God all mightiest
[Incomprehensible] got to Pasadena
Would watch that go down cynically well, okay, okay, okay, okay
You see I'm stuck in Texas and I'm trying to reach L.A.

All these little victories, yeah
All these little victories, yeah
All these little victories, yeah
Oh, all these little victories, yeah

All these little victories, yeah
(But we are yet to win the war)
All these little victories, yeah
(But we are yet to win the war)

(All these little victories, yeah)
But we are yet to win the war
(All these little victories, yeah)
But we are yet to win the war

(All these little victories, yeah)
But we are yet to win the war
(All these little victories, yeah)
