Sittin' on the edge
Looking for songs in a bottle
Talking with strangers who don't know my pain
Blurry eyed and burned out

Choking on more than I can swallow
Crack in a little voice called out my name
She said ~ Whatever happened to you
It's been two years where have you been

And I guess all my fears were true
The words were all gone the time's been too long
But I deserve to know what happened to my friend
Staring in her face

I see a past that still haunts me
The road where we split up is paved with the things I didn't say
We had wonderful times, but terrible timing
Now just leave her alone, I'll just be in the way

She said whatever happened to you
You took the coward's way out again
And I guess all my fears were true
The words are all gone, the time's been too long

But it's not too late to say I'm sorry to a friend
I'm sorry to a friend
Sorry to a friend
Like a stone in a stream

Life smoothes all our edges
'Til we barely make a ripple any more
But those times in my life will live with me forever
But we're not the same people that we were before

And I'm sorry for the smiles we missed and the times that I blew it
I've got so much to tell you 
I don't know where to start
Maybe I'll find a way maybe you'll help me do it

'Cause friends like us should not be apart
And I'm sorry to a friend
Well now I'm sorry
