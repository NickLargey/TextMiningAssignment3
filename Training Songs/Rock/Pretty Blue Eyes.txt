Though, I was in love before
Then you moved in next door
Pretty blue eyes
Pretty blue eyes

All the guys in the neighborhood
Keep saying that you sure look good
With your blue eyes
Pretty blue eyes

Saw you from my window
My heart skipped a beat
Wanna sit on your doorstep
So now I can meet
Pretty blue eyes

Please come out today
So I can tell you, what I have to say
That I love you, love you
Pretty blue eyes
