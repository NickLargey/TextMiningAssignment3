Wake me from my sleep
A cautionary tale
A walk in infancy
A way to derail
I wanted only you
The walls are falling down

And somebody says
Ah give a little love,
Give a little love
But take your time

Somebody sighs
Yes, give a little love,
Give a little love
But take your time

[Chorus:]
A private life
C'mon no
I said livin'
Gets to be
Just like a rate race
Rat race
C'mon
I'm a -read between the lines
Fierce struggle
A natural one
A tough job
Gets to be
Just like a rate race
Rate race
C'mon I'm a locked up in myself

Check before rising
Check before we work
Childproof the scene
No screams can be heard
The roof is caving in
The space between our hearts
The walls are falling down

And somebody says
Ah give a little love,
Give a little love
Take your time

Somebody sighs
Yes, give a little love,
Give a little love
But take your time

[Chorus]
It's a rat, it's a rat, it's a rat race
It's a rat, it's a rat race
It's a rat, it's a rat, it's a rat race
It's a rat, it's a rat race

Aah life
Living in a rat race
C'mon

Hmm, life
Are you living in a rat race?
C'mon
Here inside yourself

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I'm locked up in myself
I'm locked up in myself
