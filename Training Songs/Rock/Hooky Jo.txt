Hooky high hooky Jo
I need you so
Hooky bye hooky go
Where I don't know
Looky high looky low
Where can you be
Hooky high hooky Jo
I need your company

And my sergeant said
The war is over son
It doesn't really matter
That the north has won.

So I packed my bags
And I gave back my gun
I turned and headed home
With the fighting done

Hooky high hooky Jo
I need you so
Hooky by hooky go
Where I don't know
Looky high looky low
Where can you be
Hooky high hooky Jo
I need your company

Hooky Jo and me
We planned to make a start
But the war came between us
And we fell apart

Now this old gray coat is getting mighty thin
But I'll keep on looking for her
Till we meet again

Hooky high hooky Jo
I need you so
Hooky by hooky go
Where I don't know
Looky high looky low
Where can you be
Hooky high hooky Jo
I need your company
