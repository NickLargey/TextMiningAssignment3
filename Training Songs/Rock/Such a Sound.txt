Well the writers have all spoken
And their day is growing long
Now the city has awoken
The underground is moving on

Such a sound
Such a sound

The road we walk along is broken
And it looks so good today
Two sides of this world we felt it
Shaken from our sleep again

Such a sound
Such a sound
