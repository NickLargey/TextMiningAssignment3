One, two
One, two, three

We were shaking in our beds that night
There were strangers in the streets that night
Preacher cried out hells been raised
The preacher cried out hells been raised

Another hot Oklahoma night
Another hot Oklahoma night
The kind of night where you just sit still
The kind of night where you just don't move

We were shaking in our beds that night
We were shaking in our boots that night
Tornado hit and the roof gave way
Tornado hit and all we could do was pray

How was I to know what I was to think
How was I to know what I was to feel
How am I to say what I can't describe
How an I to face what I cannot hide

We were looking in our hearts that day
There was movement in our hearts that day
They were talking but we could not hear
They were talking but we could not hear

Fever broke and the dead's raised up
Ground broke open and the dead were raised
The kind of night where you just sit spooked
In a hard life is, in a hard life in

We were looking in our hearts that day
We were hugging in our beds that night
Storm hit and the roof gave way
When a man say it ain't easy
And he swore duty, body and soul

How was I to know what I was to think
How was I to know what I was to feel
How am I to say what I can't describe
How am I to face what I cannot hide
One, two, three

Momma said you know she ain't strong

We were looking in our hearts that day
We were praying in our hearts that day
We were praying but we could not feel
We were praying but we could not feel

Another hot Oklahoma night
Another Oklahoma night
Fools part as the day breaks wide
Heaven's doors were opened wide
I quit, so I said give up
Said I can't stop the lights not gone
When a heart rips me open and all I could do was pray

How was I to know what I was to think
How was I to know what I was to feel
How am I to face what I cannot hide
How am I to face what I cannot hide
