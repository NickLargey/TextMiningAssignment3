One step
One step

As I witness the death of innocence
A predator feeding on its creation
Through the fallout of this hallucination
I (I) walked into darkness

Must not surrender my god to anyone (one)
Or this body will become carrion

One step closer
One step closer to my grave
One step closer
One step closer to the fate

As I witness my own degeneration
The future condemns me
