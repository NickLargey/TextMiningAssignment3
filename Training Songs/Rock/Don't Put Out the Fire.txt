Suffering in silence
Your patience is climbing the walls
You've tried to reach somebody
But there's no answer when you call
Burning with passion
How long have you been this close to the edge
You walk around in circles
And hold back a silent scream
You need to touch somebody
Somebody you saw in a dream
Burning with passion
How long have you been this close to the edge
[Chorus]
You are burning with the heat of your desire
And you may never feel this passion again
So, don't put out the fire
The way that you're behaving
You'd think you've no will of your own
But with a little imagination
You'll never be alone
Burning with passion
How long have you been this close to the edge
[Repeat Chorus]
We may never ever feel this passion
We may never ever feel this again
[Repeat Chorus]
We are burning with the heat of our desire
And we may never feel such passion again
So, don't put out the fire
Feel the fire
We may never feel this passion again
Feel the fire
