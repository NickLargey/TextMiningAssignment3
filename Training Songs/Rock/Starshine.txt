Oh you used to be silver
Love light, Lover's stare
Well you used to make me shiver
He said "Well this is the price that we would finally pay"
I said "I don't believe you I need you, I need you to stay"
She said "We've been together for so long"
And I said, oh I said
"Playing with fire was"

Oh you used to be silver
Love light, Lover's stare
Well you used to make me shiver

Oh, this is the price that we finally pay
I said "No, I don't believe you, I need you, I need you to stay"
She said "We've been together for so long"
Well I said "Playing with fire was, playing with fire was"

Starshine
Ooh, you used to be silver
Love light, Lover's stare
Well you used to make me shiver
He said "Well baby this is the price that we would finally pay"
And I said "I don't believe you I need you, I need you to stay"
And she said "We've been together for so long"
And I said, and I said "Playing with fire was wrong!"
Playing with fire was
Playing with fire was

Starshine
Oh you used to be silver
Run, run, runaway on down
You make me shiver
Runaway, runaway
Why don't you runaway baby?
I told you what to do with your life but you could not save me
Well, I told you what to do with your life but you could not save me
