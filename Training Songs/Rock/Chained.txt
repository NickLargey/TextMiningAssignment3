I wait outside in the middle of the night
I watch your window 'til the morning light
A poor boy dreams about a rich girl's touch
I know I should run away, but I need you so much
Tell me, how long, how long will it be, will it be
You want me to hold on, just hold on, and you'll see
That in the middle of the night, I'll be waiting
 Chorus:
Chained, chained - I've been chained to your rhythm
Locked up in the heat of desire, but it feels so right
Chained, chained - you're the reason for living
You got to help me, I'm on fire
You say you want a rich man, you say I'm not your kind
But when you get the need babe, you call me every time
I'm not gonna take it, it's a living hell
I don't know if it's day or night, I'm just caught in your spell
Tell me how long, baby how long will it be, will it be
You want me to hold on, just hold on, and you'll see
That in the middle of the night, I'll be waiting
chorus  (with "but it feels so strong")
(Instrumental break)
Maybe tomorrow, maybe you'll realize
When you play with emotion, you'd better think twice
You'll look around and wonder, but you can't explain
How it happened to you, when you're wrapped up in my chains
Tell me how long, how long will it be, will it be
I tell you to hold on, hold on, and you'll see
That in the middle of the night, yeah in the middle of the night
You'll be screaming
chorus  (without "I'm on fire")
I've been chained, chained, oh yeah
Chained to your rhythm, to your rhythm of love
I've been chained, chained, chained to your rhythm of love
(Chained, chained)  (repeats out)
