Is there something more? Surely there must be
You can't lose everything, so you're quite happy
To live with nothing more than a life-long shopping list
You tick it off on credit, well you'll pay for it

Week in and week out
Your lucky charms will always let you down
Maybe next week we'll see, maybe
You stand in line completely still
Feel really, truly unfulfilled, week in, week out

Where are you going to turn when all ambition fails?
Why try anymore if human nature's stale?
Invite the hand of God to touch the lucky few
There's no such thing as God nor easy money too

Week in and week out
Your lucky charms will always let you down
Maybe next week we'll see, maybe
You stand in line completely still
Feel really, truly unfulfilled, week in, week out

Week in and week out
Your lucky charms will always let you down
Maybe next week we'll see, maybe
You stand in line completely still
Feel really, truly unfulfilled, week in, week out
