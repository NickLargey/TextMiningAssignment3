Train roll on, on down the line,
Won't you please take me far, far away
Now I feel the wind blow, outside my door,
I'm leavin' my woman at home, oh yeah
Tuesday's gone with the wind,
Oh my baby's gone, gone with the wind
And I don't know, oh, where I'm goin'
I just want to be left alone
When this train ends, I'll try again
I'm leavin' my woman at home

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone, with the wind
Train roll on, Tuesday's gone

Train roll on many miles from my home, see I'm
I'm ridin' my blues, away yeah
But Tuesday you see, a she had to be free
Somehow I got to, to carry on

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone, with the wind

Train roll on
My baby's gone
I'm ridin' my blues, baby
Tryin' to ridin' my blues
Ride on train
Ride on train
Ridin' my blues, baby
Goodbye Tuesday, goodbye Tuesday
Oh, oh, oh, train
