You should know by now that 
The common thread is taut
I'd like to stay but you just won't listen
Disappointment I'd take though 

There's no point to it
I blew it
If you could think aloud, 
It won't mean anything will change

If you could think aloud, 
It won't mean anything will change
As tests go wrong and we deny it together
Or a second of thought might ache forever

I blew it I blew it I blew it
But did you ever go too far 
Up against your own persuasion
Consummate madness then despise

You should have learnt by now that 
The common thread is taut
You should have learnt by now that 
The common thread is taut

It's hard to reflect when 
Your world is sighing
You could never catch up 
And there's no use trying

I blew it I blew it I blew it
And if the gods were on your side 
I couldn't let you slide
(I blew it) 

(I blew it)
And if the gods were on your side 
I couldn't let you slide
(I blew it) 

(I blew it)
You blow it 
You blew it 
I blew it
