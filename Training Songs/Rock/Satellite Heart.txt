So pretty so smart
Such a waste of a young heart!
What a pity, what a sham
What's the matter with you, man?

Don't you see it's wrong, can't you get it right?
Out of mind and outta sight
Call on all your girls, don't forget the boys
Put a lid on all that noise!

[Chorus]
I'm a satellite heart, lost in the dark
I'm spun out so far you stop, I start
But I'll be true to you

I hear you're living out of state, 
Running in a whole new scene
You know I haven't slept in weeks, 
You're the only thing I see

[Chorus: x2]

No matter what you do yeah I'll be true to you
