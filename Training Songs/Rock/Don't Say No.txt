We live in confusion times
My world is a vice
Nobody gets out alive
But you can break through the ice

Don't say no

My wounds are the open kind
I bleed every day
I pray for a change of mind
You can take me away

Don't say no, don't say no
Don't say no and don't say no

Take on the system, playin' on the wrong side
Spend all my money tryin' to have a good time
Come 'round to see you from time to time
Week in the knees and I'm busted

Some people, they treat me kind
Some drive me away
Some people, they blow your mind
It's not easy today

Don't say no

I live on the borderline
You come from the void
I beg you to cross the line
You take good care of your boy

Don't say no, don't say no
Don't say no, don't say no

Got me a ticket sittin' on a gold mine
Send me the interest, take me where the sun shines
Come 'round to see me from time to time
Bring it to me when I'm busted

One minute, I'm out of time
I don't fit in your game
You kill me in overtime
I don't remember my name (don't say no)

One minute, you're on my mind
Next minute you're gone (don't say no)
You tell me to read the signs
They tell me we're on

Don't say no, don't say no
Don't say no, don't say no

Don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't, don't, don't
