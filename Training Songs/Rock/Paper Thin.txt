I was gonna get up off that bar stool 
Just as soon as I could figure it out 
Why I was overlooked at the car pool 
Stood up at the dance with no twist and shout 

When you're burnin' with your last desire 
And every memory haunts you 
You write it down in alcohol fire 
'Cause that's the only flame that wants you 

[Chorus:]
When you're paper thin 
Yeah, read all about it 
When you were out of luck, well, luck was doin' all right 
Now you're paper thin 
Yeah, they can see right through ya 
You just cut your little finger on the edge of the night 

Now, do I really have to be responsible 
For what I did between those tavern walls?
I was just mixing up some chemicals
You could've heard a pin drop, could have heard time crawl

And every once in a while 
You could hear your own heart pound 
Maybe some paper doll with a pasted on smile 
Would let you write her number down 

[Chorus]
