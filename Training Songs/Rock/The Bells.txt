Hunger drives me
It's got me by the reigns
I let it wreck me
Time and time again

I decided
To never ride again
I don't know
What happened

Dad, I broke my promise to you
If you're wondering where I've been
I thought I knew what I was doing
But I was wrong again
I understand, son

The fairer gender
They always turn my head
From sheer embarrassment
I'm nearly dead
