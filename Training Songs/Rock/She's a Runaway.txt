You know Mary was a woman fine
She was living with a hard guy
Yeah, Mary got beat up
One to many times

She's a Runaway
She's a Runaway
Mary stole some money
And she got herself a gun

Then she shot her man down
Now she's on the run-un
She's a Runaway
She's a Run, Runaway

Well she ain't lookin' back anymore
She said, "Catch me if you can anymore"
Ya know she didn't want to do it
But he just pushed her to far

Everybody got a breakin' point
And Baby there you are
She's a Runaway
Run, Run, Run, Runaway

She's a Runaway
She's a Run, Runaway
I said "She ain't lookin' back anymore"
She said, "Catch me if you can anymore"

Well, that's the story of Mary and the gun
Ya know, She's a lot tougher now
She's livin' on the run

She's a Runaway
She's a Run, Runaway
Run, Run, Run, Runaway
She's a Run, Runaway
