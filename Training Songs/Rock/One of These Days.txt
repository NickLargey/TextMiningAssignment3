One of these days I'm going to get it together
Gonna buy a watch gonna get it together
Stop wasting time

One of these days I'm gonna get out of bed
I'm gonna turn off the TV.
Gonna raise the dead
Raise the dead

One of these days when I fall in love,
it won't fall apart like it always does
One of these I'll forget about you
Take out the trash that's what I'll do

One of these days and it'll be real soon 
I'm gonna kick some ass
Gonna clean my room
Sometime soon

One of these days I'm gonna touch the sky
Like that awful song
"I believe I can fly"
"I believe I can fly"

One of these days you'll be so sorry
Sorry that you let it slip away
One of these days I just won't care
If you're sorry anyway

One of these days I'm going to get it together
Gonna be on time
I'm gonna get it together
Stop wasting time

One of these days I'll accept the fact
I'm not getting any younger
And I can't go back
Can't go back

One of these days I'm gonna stop saying one of these days [Repeats]
One of these days
