'Round and 'round and we won't let go
And where we stop no one knows
Uh huh, uh huh
Down and down in a spin we turn
Looking like we'll never learn
Uh huh, uh huh

Think about what everyone is saying
Ruby dear, oh don't you hear?
Late at night when the radio is playing
Ruby dear, so looky here

Oh this record's broken
It slips a beat
And all those watermelons
Have gone to seed

Nothing lives in this dirty little river
No one here will shed a tear
It dried up but it couldn't run forever
Ruby dear that's what we hear

I still like the ocean
Down by the sea
They left that door wide open
It tempted me

Hounding me from the bedroom to the kitchen
Ruby dear, I'm still not here
Now they throw the fox amongst the chickens
It's too deep, I'll drown in my sleep

Angels and prostitutes
They might look the same
And if to Hell we're going
I'll see you there

'Round and 'round and we won't let go
And where we stop no one knows
Uh huh, uh huh
Down the street where the bonfires glow
Looking like they lost control
Uh huh, uh huh

Settle down in that rocking chair
Breathing in that rotten air
Uh huh, uh huh
Johnny Jones fell fast asleep
Down a hole where the rocks are steep
Uh huh, uh huh
