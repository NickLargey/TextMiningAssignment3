At fair Mount's Bay, on that Christmas week
Was such a raging storm, no man could speak 
That lifeboat thundered through an angry sea 
Was called Solomon Browne and her company 

With courage, it was called
On our heroes brave and bold
With courage, it was cold
On board that night 

Now the stricken coaster called the Union Star 
Her maiden voyage, she never thought that far
With Captain Moreton and his four man crew 
A woman to save and her daughters two 

Now, never had a lifeboat fought in vain 
She could have made a dash for port but she tried again 
All sixteen perished in that mighty wave 
It tossed them overboard into a watery grave 

With courage, it was called 
On our heroes brave and bold 
With courage, it was cold 
On board that night 

Now back at Penlee Point, time stood still 
Twelve young children cried for their fathers killed 
A nation shed tears for years as the news went round 
The constant courage of our Solomon Browne. 

With courage, it was called 
On our heroes brave and bold 
With courage, it was cold 
On board that night 

With courage, it was called 
On our heroes brave and bold 
With courage, it was cold
