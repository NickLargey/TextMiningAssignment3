I'm going nowhere and I'm going to take my time
All the questions in the world
I can leave in my mind
I'm waiting on the sunshine, the sunshine

I'm waiting for answers
I'm waiting to figure it out
I took all my chances
I slipped through my town

[Chorus]
I'm going nowhere and I'm going to take my time
All the questions in the world
I can leave in my mind
I'm waiting on the sunshine, the sunshine,
The sunshine

Well it seems that my weakness
Is sometimes my only strength
And in my incompleteness you get your way

[Chorus]

I'll be around and I will find my way back down
Yeah I've seen the sound of the sun

I'm going nowhere and I'm going to take my time
All the questions in the world
I can leave in my mind
I'm waiting on the sunshine, the sunshine,
The sunshine, the sunshine
