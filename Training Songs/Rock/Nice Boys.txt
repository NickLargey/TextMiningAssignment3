She hit town a rose in bloom
Smell the sweet, sweet perfume
The color faded and the petals died
Down in the city no one cried

And in the streets the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
With roaches so big they got bones
They moved in and made themselves at home

I say nice boys,don't play rock 'n' roll
Nice boys, don't play rock 'n' roll
I'm not a nice boy!

Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
And now, she pays the price layin' down on her back

Want so bad just to please the boys
Ended up bein' just a toy
Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made

Nice boys, don't play rock'n'roll
Nice boys, don't play rock'n'roll
I'm not a nice boy, and I never was

Young and fresh when she hit town
Hot for kicks just to get around
And now she lays in a filthy room
She kills the pain with a flick and a spoon

And in the streets the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
With roaches so big they got bones
They moved in and made themselves at home

Nice boys, don't play rock'n'roll
Nice boys, don't play rock'n'roll
Nice boys, don't play rock'n'roll
Nice boys, don't play rock'n'roll
Nice boys, don't play rock'n'roll
Nice boys, don't play rock'n'roll
Nice boys, don't play rock'n'roll
Nice boys, they never play rock'n'roll
