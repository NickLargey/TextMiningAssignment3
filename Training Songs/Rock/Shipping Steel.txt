Hammer down the open road
Steel pigs my only load
Country songs are always playin'
He's a goin', she's a staying
Briquets keep the fires burning
Diesel keeps the wheels turning
Hikers on the edge of town
Start off young and end up learning

Shipping steel, shipping steel . . .
Nobody knows, the way it feels
Caught between Heaven and the Highway
Shipping steel, shipping steel . . .

Some men need a family
Need the club fraternity
God's salvation guaranteed
Mac's the only friend I need
