I had a tough time getting off the dime
Before I met you couldn't make up my mind
I was on and off again
I'd say we'd benefit if we were some kind of friends

Count me in
I've made a decision
Count me in
If you're in, I'm in

I know what you're thinking
And you know I'm with you
Count me in
If you do, I do

Many years together tells me something is right
Wake up every morning and the feeling is nice
We're not living the dream
We're living the lie
Hold to the source, well hold me tight, oh
Guarding the flame before it goes out
And it will go out, that is no doubt
The cycle of everything is what it's about
Ready now I'm about to

Count me in
I've made a decision
Count me in
If you're in, I'm in

I know what you're thinking
And you know I'm with you
Count me in
If you do, I do

Uh, you know they tried to get me just living in a box
But the second I try got ideas were blocked
Running in the concert 'cause everything comes to me
Gimme a pen an a pad and I'll trounce, ooh

Watch the moon across the sky
And my thinking is gone but I don't know why
Till the moon turns to blood you and me will go on
We could make war or we could make love
Till I figure out how you know what I'm thinking of
You are under my skin

Count me in
I've made a decision
Count me in
If you're in, I'm in

I know what you're thinking
You know I'm with you
Count me in
If you do, I do

I know what you're thinking
You know I'm with you
Count me in
If you do, I do
