There were trails of fallen trees
Deciduous and weeding marsh
The lowland birds and crickets roared
The final sound of fall
Along the banks of the river
We approached the footbridge
Entering the wilderness
Following my footstep

[Chorus]
The silence between us is the time
When I can't hear the thoughts
That's on your mind, yeah

Beyond the panic and worried that
Seems to consume most every thought
There lies a calm and steady hand
That someday you might see
Perhaps it isn't what you wanted
Or even what you're looking for
But once you see the symmetry
Once you see the you and me

[Chorus]

Winter lovers, we're so nervous
The words will disappear
What thoughts are on your mind, yeah

You park the car outside the Holiday Inn
We cross the highway single-file
And you were walking in a hurry
And there was me without water with a smile
Yeah!

[Chorus]

Winter lovers, we're so nervous
The words will disappear
What thoughts are on your mind, yeah
On your mind, yeah
On your mind, yeah
On your mind, yeah
