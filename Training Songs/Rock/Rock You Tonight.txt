Baby, won't you tell me
What can I do
You may fool the others
But something is wrong with you
You seem so troubled
And your smile has gone
Don't hold back now, baby
Tell me what's going on
If you lost the way
I'll help you find it
Open up any door
And I'll be the
Sit down baby
Next to me
Just close your eyes now
Lean back and set your mind free
The receiver is off the hook
The phone won't ring
I'll bring you whatever
Whatever you want me to bring
I guess I'm trying to tell you
I love you more than anything 

Let me rock you
Baby to night
Let me make sure you're feeling all right
Let me rock you baby tonight

So baby won't you tell me
Tell me what you need
All you've gotta do is say a word
I'll be on my feet
You seem so troubled
Your smile has gone
Don't hold back now baby
Tell me what's going on
All I want to do is make it right
Whatever is wrong

Let me rock you
Baby tonight
Let me make sure you're feeling all right
Let me rock you baby tonight

Now you can count on me forever
You can count on me forever
Forever

Let me rock you
Baby tonight
Let me make sure you're feeling all right
Let me rock you baby tonight
