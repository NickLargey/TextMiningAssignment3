There's holes up in the sky
The devil punched down to the monkeys
And now they've got drive through
And a video store where there used to be real live actors
Used to ride around here
Up on my high horse
With all the other good little butcher boys
A plagiarist of course
So roll over sweet thing
Like a nuclear reprisal inbound from outer space
There's a comparison here I'm trying to swing

God damn it's deafening!
Wish you shut up about everything
The future x-rated

There's holes up in the sky
No one's seen your son in days
And things just keep getting weirder and weirder
And now Christmas is for shopping
And the shopping god is everything

So roll over and lose it!
'Cause power's just another one of those things baby
It's pointless if you ain't gonna use it

God damn it's deafening
Wish you shut up about everything!
The future is x-rated

Used to ride around here on my high, high horse
God damn it's deafening
Wish you would shut up, shut up, shut up
The future is x-rated
The future is x-rated
The future is x-rated
The future is x-rated
