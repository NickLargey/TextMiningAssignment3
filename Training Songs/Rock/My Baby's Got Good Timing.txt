I was lost and all alone
An empty heart without a home
Just at the time when I needed a friend
She came along and she took me in

And every time I'm feeling down
When the world closes in somehow
Just in the moment when I need her the most
She comes to me and she holds me close

[Chorus]
My baby's got good timing
Don't know how but she reads my mind
And there's just one way to describe it
My baby's got good timing

In the night when the world is quiet
And she's lying here by my side
When it's her sweet love I need
That's the moment when she comes to me

[Chorus]

And when she loves me
She always loves me right on time
When she holds me she's, oh, so close
I can feel her heart beat with mine

[Chorus: x4]

My baby's got good timing
