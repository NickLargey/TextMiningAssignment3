White page, an empty field of snow
My room is twenty-five below
This cold man chasing ghosts
A road lies underneath a buried boat
Dogs search the under forest
We scour the empty streets
The fact remains until we find you
Our lives are incomplete

Do I hear laughters through a veil of snow and ice?
Where could you be on such a lonely winter's night?

I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop wanting you this way
I can't face dreaming without you
That's why I'm searching night and day
This heart's a lonely hunter
These hands are frozen fists
I can't stop thinking about you
I don't care if you exist

Do I hear laughter from behind this veil of midnight?
What are you hiding in the frozen heart of winter?
Somewhere a church bell tolls
I know you're close, your scent still warm
And then your trail turns cold, cold, cold

I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop wanting you this way
I can't face living without you
That's why I'm searching night and day
This heart's a lonely hunter
These hands are frozen fists
I can't stop thinking about you
I don't care if you exist

Do I hear laughter in the silence of the snow?
I know you're hiding in this frozen heart of winter
A midnight church bell tolls
I know you're close, your scent still warm
Then the trail turns cold, cold, cold

I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop wanting you this way
I can't face living without you
That's why I'm searching night and day
This heart's a lonely hunter
These hands are frozen fists
I can't stop thinking about you
I don't care if you exist 

I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop wanting you this way
I can't face living without you
I can't stop wanting you
