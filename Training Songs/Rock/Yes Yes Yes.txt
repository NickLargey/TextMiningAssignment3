Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough again
I called your bluff 'cos you think you're so tough because you can make enemies out of friends
I am getting sleepy
I'm in your command
Yes, yes, yes, I understand
Yes, yes, yes, I understand

(Uh-huh!)

Over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
The Xmas curse of sharing incurred we inferred the sword is mightier than the pen
You are in Atlanta
I am in a band
Yes, yes, yes, I'm in a band
Yes, yes, yes, I understand

A fact is a fact is a fact is a fact is a fact is a fact to misunderstand
And all the detractors who question the crafts have been asked to retract or face reprimand
You are always lying
I am on the lamb
Yes, yes, yes, I understand

Repetition of suspicion
Takes a lie and makes it true

Nearer and nearer and nearer and nearer and nearer and nearer to our demise
The fear we adhere to appears to be steering our ears to where we're only hearing lies
With us or against us
The line is in the sand
Yes, yes, yes, I understand

Repetition of suspicion
Takes a lie and makes it true
