Driving in your little green car
Driving too fast and driving way too far
What will you do in between
In between the lights when you're seen

On the road she´s really happy
On the road she feels alive

There she goes and there she goes
Hiding away from the rest of the world
There she goes and there she goes
Hiding away like a scared little girl
There she goes and there she goes again
There she goes and there she goes again
In her little green car

Waiting for the end of the road
Looking for the place that someone said to go
How can you come to the end
That´s when something pushes again

[Chorus]
There she goes, hiding again
Hiding from herself and the pain
She feels alive

Chorus
