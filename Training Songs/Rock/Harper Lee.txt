Like a crash I wait for the impact
And like a train I wait for the smoke
Like a storm I wait for the silence
And like a bluff I wait till you fold

Oooh there’s a gun in the attic let me go grab it
Oooh I’d blow holes in my soul just so you can look past it
Oooh ye there’s glass on the floor there’s a hole in the roof
Oooh ye the chandelier fell now the rains falling through

Like a dog I wait for my owner
And Harper Lee I’ll kill me a bird
And I sit back and I just watch it happen
And just like you I won’t say a word

Oooh there’s a gun in the attic, let me go grab it
Oooh I’d blow holes in my soul just so you can look past it
Oooh ye there’s glass on the floor, there’s a hole in the roof
Oooh ye the chandelier fell, now the rain’s falling through

Oooh I put mice in the kitchen to see if you’d kill them
Oooh oh no you let them live now there’s twelve thousand kids
Oooh oh ye you let them breed now I’ve got mouths to feed
Oooh oh ye you let them stay now they have taken my place
Oooh ye you left them alone now they’re eating our home
