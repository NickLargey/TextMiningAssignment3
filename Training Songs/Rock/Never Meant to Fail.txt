There's something I'm feeling, there's something that's wrong
These streets are revealing, in the early morn,
The war was last night, these wounds are not healed
If we keep believing, then we've gotta feel

As it goes
By the story that's already told
Comes a time when we all must let go
What happened to the story
Discontented cuts inside
It's not meant to, be this lonely
We were never meant to fail

Something that's crawling
In my skin
Emotions are falling
As it begins
I lost all my virtues
Long ago
I didn't want to hurt you
But now we know

As it goes
By the story that's already told
Comes a time when we all must let go
What happened to the story
Discontented cuts inside
It's not meant to, be this lonely
We were never meant to fail

Never meant to fail
Never meant to fail

As it goes
By the story that's already told
Comes a time when we all must let go
What happened to the story
Discontented cuts inside
It's not meant to, be this lonely
We were never meant to fail
We were never meant to fail
We were never meant to fail
We were never meant to fail
We were never meant to fail
