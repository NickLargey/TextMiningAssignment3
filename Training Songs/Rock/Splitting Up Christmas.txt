So what if I'm freezing, I'm awake and I'm happy 
The sun's steepling its shards on my floor 
I drag my feet to the shower and I hear someone singing 
I keep the lights off as the water gets warm 

Now I knot up tie and toss my books in a schoolbag 
They keep my priorties straight 
So I can sleepwalk through work like an outpatient program 
I don't buy but I'll get through anyway 

And at some point I'll call you and tell you I miss you 
And you are the point of my day 
And my face will get flushed and my throat will choke up 
When you tell me you feel the same 

So I have been thinking of splitting up Christmas
To see everyone I'd like to see 
And your first on that list
Your the lotto I hit

You're the star at the top of my tree 
And I have been feeling this good for a reason 
My friends and my family 
You are all the backbone 

You keep me balenced and settled 
And I"m in debt to you all endlessy 
So tonight I will call you and try to say 
"Thank you for being the sun on my face 

I know the world's almost over but you make it seem better
And I hope for you I do the same"
