Anytime a heart turns from darkness to light
Anytime temptation comes and someone stands to fight
Anytime somebody lives to serve and not be served

I know, I know, I know, I know
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move
In many mighty ways
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move
On the move today

Anytime in weakness someone falls upon their knees
Or dares to speak the truth that sets men free
Anytime the choice is made to stand upon the Word

I know, I know, I know, I know
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move
In many mighty ways
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move
On the move today

I see your generation standing on the truth
In each and everyday saying God is on the move
Anytime the Gospel stirs a searching souls 
And someone says “send me, here I go”

I know, I know, I know, I know
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move
In many mighty ways 
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move
On the move today

God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move
In many mighty ways 
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move
On the move today

I see your generation standing on the truth
In each and everyday saying God is on the move
