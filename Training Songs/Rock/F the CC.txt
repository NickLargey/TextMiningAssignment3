I used to listen to the radio
And I don't guess
They're listenin' to me no more
They talk too much but that's okay
I don't understand a single word they say
Piss and moan about the immigrants
But don√¢??t say nothin' about the president
A democracy don't work that way
I can say anything I wanna say

So f*ck the FCC
F*ck the FBI
F*ck the CIA
Livin' in the motherfuckin' USA

People tell me that I'm paranoid
And I admit I'm gettin'
Pretty nervous, boy
It just gets tougher everyday
To sit around and watch it
While it slips away
Been called a traitor and a patriot
Call me anything you want to but
Just don't forget your history
Dirty Lenny died so we could all be free
