Let's Go!

Oh, the night fell and most of us just turned and walked away
My girl can't walk safely home at night, there's gotta be a better way
There's a new day dawning but we've got a lot of work to do
I know we can see a better land because I believe in you

Well, you can ask the president, he don't know
You can ask the congressmen, they just want your vote
The world keeps on spinning, morality keeps running low
The solution is at hand, the world needs a hero

The world needs a hero, that's right, okay
The world needs a hero, and right away
I know we can do it, we're tried and true
Take that first step and awake the hero in you

Well, the ruins lay around us but we'll face the brand new day
Things look bad now but in time troubles fade
Hell, 'cause we'll just keep on fighting, that's the way it's gotta be
A few centuries of violence won't stand up to our eternity

I asked the government, I got no reply
Can't seek help from the boys in blue 'cause their hands are tied
The world keeps on spinning, morality keeps running low
The answers are at hand, the world needs a hero

The world needs a hero, that's right, okay
The world needs a hero, and right away
I know we can do it, we're tried and true
Take that first step and awake the hero in you

That's right!
