Some people may run
While others have fun
Trying to grab what they can
So I lie in the grass

I had too much too fast
But the best of all times waiting out
The days go by and waters run dry
But I've made up my mind

It's calling me, call me any time
It's coming up each and every line
Keep calling me, call me any time

Here is the song for those
Who never ever sit back and recover
Here is the one for those who never shiver
The cool cats I adore

Some people wear gloves
Carrying their portions of love
Until death comes from above
Now for dreams and for plans

You try as hard as you land
But I've made up my mind
