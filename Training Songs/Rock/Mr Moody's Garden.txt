Every day's a holiday in Mr. Moody's Garden
Where little girls say pardon and how do
You do my name is Nosey
And this is me sister really (really)
Good she is at saying "to you too"

Now just across the lawn is Pat
Sitting on his favorite hat
Waiting for the barber to arrive
And if he doesn't come today
Pat will shout (hip-hip-hooray)
Ain't it grand to be alive

When every day's a holiday in Mr. Moody's Garden
Where little girls say pardon and how do
You do my name is Nosey
And this is me sister really (really)
Good she is at saying "to you too"

Now lying on the garden fence
Is a man (at great expense)
History tells us will outgrow his youth
But only until such a time
He finds out why he's been lying
And then of course he'll tell the truth

Cause every day's a holiday in Mr. Moody's Garden
Where little girls say pardon and how do - ya do

Now down among the partridge trees
Lives a man who loves his knees
So much so he's framed them in a jar
And if by chance one should escape
And to put on must in it's place
With half a pound of shredded tar

Cause every day's a holiday in Mr.Moody's Garden
Where little girls say pardon
And Bill and Ben found stardom
While playing John Wesley Harden
Who looked just like Billy Cardon's
Answer to choo-choo
