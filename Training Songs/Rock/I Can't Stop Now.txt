Every time I'm away I think about you
I wish that you were near me
Gets so bad at times I talk to myself
I wish that you could hear me.

I get to thinking how it all started out, and I know, oh I know
It may not last forever
But in the meantime when the goin' is good, I know, oh I know
That we should be together.

You gave me everything and then some more
When I was cold you opened up the door
Don't want to stop I couldn't anyhow
You know I'm in too deep and I can't stop now.

When I come home I know I don't ever have much to say
I'm just glad to be there
You ask about the people I've met and the places I've been
You ask me what I see there.

I see you, I see you everywhere I go
I see you all around me
On a ship, on a train, on a plane, no matter where I am
I feel your love surround me.

You gave me everything and then some more
When I was cold you opened up the door
Don't want to stop I couldn't anyhow
You know I'm in too deep and I can't stop now.

You gave me everything and then some more
