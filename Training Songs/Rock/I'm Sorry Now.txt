Welcome to my world
Won't you please find a seat
There is no need to worry
I'm the only one to meet
I just wanted to express myself to you
Hey, undiluted and with nobody else to confuse

See, I was Marvin Gaye and Bond, James Bond
I was taking all day so I could turn you on
And I hated when you'd look away
When I was inside and slowly gettin' to it
It didn't help a lot when you would turn around
And I was on the top
And you would say
Baby, you can do it

I'm sorry now
And it's too late
I'm sorry now
Do you have to hate me?
I'm sorry now
So sorry, yeah
I wish you wished I wished you love
I wish you wished I wished you love

I hate spaghetti
And I also hate divorce
You probably already know that by then, of course
I like the earthquakes
I like it when the world shakes
I like the cracks it takes out of the walls
When two people
Lovers
Are acting like dolls in the arms of each other
That's my alarm

I'm sorry now
And it's too late
I'm sorry now
Do you have to hate me?
I'm sorry now
So sorry, yeah
I wish you wished I wished you love
I wish you wished I wished you love
I wish you wished I wished you love

Life is so unkind
You can fall behind
You know that I'm inclined
To ease your mind
Anytime

So welcome, baby
I wondered when your countenance would change
From sunshine and vanilla
To the raven tones of rage
And my back never looked so broad to you
As now, when turned upon the fool who spurned me
Boo hoo hoo

I'm sorry now
And it's too late
I'm sorry now
And you have to hate me
I'm sorry now
So sorry, yeah
I wish you wished I wished you love
I wish you wished I wished you love
I wish you wished I wished you love
I wish...
I wish...
I wish...
I wish...
I wish you wished I wished you love
I wish you wished I wished you love
I wish you wished I still wanted love with you
But I'm through it
Forget you
