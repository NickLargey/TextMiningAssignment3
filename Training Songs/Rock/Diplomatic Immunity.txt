I can speed in my car down the road.
I don't have to follow the highway code.
The laws which bind you don't bother me.
I've got diplomatic immunity.

I'm really free.
They can't touch me.
I've got sanctuary.
Diplomatic immunity.

I can walk down the street with a gun in my hand,
to protect myself from violent gangs.
Go into Harrods and steal some jewels,
store detectives look like fools.

I killed a girl once just for fun,
then waited for the police to come.
They couldn't do a thing,
I'm safe inside my wall of red tape.

Who is there to hear the call ?
And see the injustice of it all.
But who is there the hear the call ?
And see the injustice of it all.
