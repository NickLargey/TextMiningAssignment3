Panhandle, pedal faster
Playing cards, listen, master
Pointed gun, aim to please
No one talking, no one sees
Take a stand and collect
The images and imageless
Think in rhymes every time
Someone was a friend of mine

A visionary in a cage in Londonderry
A visionary, foggiest notion, visionary

A visionary, oh, oh, oh
Strip away the silver and the gold

Just torn-up stories in your cage
Never time to be a sage
You're so sublime
Growing old before your time

A visionary in a cage in Londonderry
A visionary, foggiest notion, visionary

A visionary, oh, oh, oh
Strip away the silver and the gold

A visionary, oh, oh, oh, Londonderry
A visionary, foggiest notion, visionary

A visionary, oh, oh, oh
A visionary, oh, oh, oh
A visionary, oh, oh, oh
A visionary, oh, oh, oh
A visionary, oh, oh, oh
A visionary, oh, oh, oh
