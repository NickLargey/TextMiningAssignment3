High above my head, there's a silver lining
In the sky, I tell you no lie.
I know that we can make it
I know that we're gonna make it
That's what I said
Cause we've got a silver lining above our heads.

High above the storm clouds
There's a new horizon, feast your eyes
Come on and feast your eyes
The beauty will astound you
The love there will surround you, open your eyes
The Lord put the silver lining into our skies

I want you to see things clearly
I hope you can feel the truth,
I know there's a hope for all mankind
Living under one roof.

I want you to see things clearly
I hope you can feel the truth,
I know there's a hope for all mankind
Living under one roof.

I look around in wonder
While the world is living under
A broken dream, or that's how it seems
But we weren't sent to change it
To change or rearrange it
Still we can dream,
And dreams were meant for living
If you know what I mean.
