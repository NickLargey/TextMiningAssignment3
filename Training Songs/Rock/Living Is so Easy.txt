Well, oh, my god, did she look cute
At the Dame Vera clay pigeon shoot
But it was over, oh, so fast
It was a blast

So here's to all the dirty girls
They're taking on all of the world
Accessorized up to the hilt
No one got killed

Northern girls
Are you going to the party?
Southern boys
Are you going to the party?

Everyone, the wessies and the ossies
Everyone is going to the party
And we know that you will understand, no, oh

Living is so easy
(Living is so easy)
Shopping is so easy
(Shopping is so easy)

Dying is so easy
(Dying is so easy)
All of it is easy
(All of it is easy)

I love your celebrity
Your VPL in the SUV
And then you're pissing vitamins
It is a sin

LVMH in the HLM
Luxury it will descend
I won't be looking at your eyes
In the end

Rive Gauche girls
Are you going to the party?
Banlieue boys
Are you going to the party?

Everyone, the cops and the commies
Everyone is going to the party
And we know that you will understand, no, oh

Living is so easy
(Living is so easy)
Shopping is so easy
(Shopping is so easy)

Dying is so easy
(Dying is so easy)
All of it is easy
(All of it is easy)

Northern girls
Are you going to the party?
Southern boys
Are you going to the party?

Everyone is going to the party
Everyone is going to the party
And we know that you will understand, no, oh

Living is so easy
Living is so easy
Living is so easy
Kissing is so easy
Dancing is so easy
Shopping is so easy
It's never been so
