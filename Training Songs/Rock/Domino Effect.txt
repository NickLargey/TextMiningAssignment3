I light a spark and you feed the flame
The whole world’s on fire
I say a word, then you say the same
Now we're all in the choir

And one thing’s for sure
Still ain’t a cure
To defeat the human chain

Truth is my friend
It will never end
And it’s been like this before

The story goes on
They fall one by one
Trying to stand
But the game’s just begun

From the first one in line
To the last in no time
And it seems there’s no way to reject
The domino effect
The domino effect

News travels fast, like words on the street
We’re tearing walls down
So easy to affect, we tend to believe
What might come around

And one thing’s for sure
Still ain’t a cure
And there’s nothing you can do

Truth is my friend
It will never end
And it’s been like this before

The story goes on
They fall one by one
Trying to stand
But the game’s just begun

From the first one in line
To the last in no time
And it seems there’s no way to reject
The domino effect
The domino effect
The domino effect

Truth is my friend
It will never end
And it’s been like this before

The story goes on
They fall one by one
Trying to stand
But the game’s just begun

From the first one in line
To the last in no time
And it seems there’s no way to reject
The domino effect

The domino effect
The domino effect
The domino effect

The domino effect
The domino effect
The domino effect
The domino effect
