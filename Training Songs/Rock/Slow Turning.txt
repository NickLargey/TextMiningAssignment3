When I was a boy, 
I thought it just came to ya' 
But I never could tell what's mine 
So it didn't matter anyway 

My only pride and joy 
Was this racket down here 
Bangin' on an old guitar 
And singin' what I had to say 

I always thought our house was haunted 
But nobody said boo to me 
I never did get what I wanted 
Now I get what I need 

It's been a slow turnin' 
From the inside out 
A slow turnin' 
But you come about 

Slow learnin' 
But you learn to sway 
A slow turnin' baby 
Not fade away 

Now I'm in my car 
I got the radio on 
I'm yellin' at the kids in the back seat 
'Cause they're bangin' like Charlie Watts 

You think you've come so far 
In this one horse town 
Then she's laughin' that crazy laugh 
'Cause you haven't left the parkin' lot 

Time is short and here's the damn thing about it 
You're gonna die, gonna die for sure 
And you can learn to life with love or without it 
But there ain't no cure 

There's just a slow turnin' 
From the inside out 
A slow turnin' 
But you come about
