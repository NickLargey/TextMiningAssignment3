Hello Honey, it's me
What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
What did the kids say when they knew it was their long lost daddy-o?
Remember how we listened to the radio
And I said "That's the place to be"
And how I got the job as an FM Jock the day you married me?
It was two kids and I was was into AM rock
But I just had to run around
It's been ages since I left you babe
Let me tell you 'bout what's gone down

[Chorus]
I am the morning DJ at W*O*L*D
Playing all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-morning voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five going on fifteen

The drinking I did on my last big gig, it made my voice go low
They said that they liked the young sound when they let me go
So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma to do me a late night talk show
Now I worked my way down home again, here to Boise, Idaho
That's how this business goes

[Chorus]

I been making extra money doing high school sock hops
I'm a big time guest MC
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen what they say to me
Got a spot on the top of my head, just begging for a new toupee
And a tire around my gut from sitting on my butt
But it's never gonna go away

Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just take off in my car
But you can travel on ten thousand miles and still stay where you are
I've been thinking that I should stop disk jockeying
And start that record store
Maybe I could settle down if you'd take me back once more

OK Honey, I see
I guess he's better than me
Sure, Girl, I understand
You don't have to worry; I'm such a happy man

W*O*L*D, W*O*L*D, W*O*L*D, W*O*L*D, W*O*L*D*

I am the morning DJ at K*A*H*J
Playing all the hits for you, playing 'em night and day
The bright good morning voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five, going on fifteen
I am the morning DJ at W*O*L*D, W*O*L*D, W*O*L*D, W*O*L*D
