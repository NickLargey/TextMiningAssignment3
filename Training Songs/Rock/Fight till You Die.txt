Look all around you there's a war that's going on
A struggle against the odds that's breaking out and must be won
They're getting ready with the weapons they have found
Take inspiration from the sound
See it in the faces of the people everyday
We need to take control and find some ammo right away
Our cause is righteous and we're gonna have our say
Get ready for the judgment day
Go ahead and try
Or kiss your ass goodbye
People of society are running for their lives
Get up now and go Or your never gonna know
Never gonna make it in your houses lying low
Give it one good try
Give it all and fight till you die
FIGHT TILL YOU DIE
A puppet government
They're dying in the streets
Families are breaking up cause underpaids can't make ends meet
The establishment has put their money underground
Cause they all know what's coming down
A lucky precious few with money in their banks
Can't imagine what it's like to find yourself in homeless ranks
They've got no conscience for the ones who won't survive
The time for payback has arrived
Go ahead and try
Or kiss your ass goodbye
People of society are running for their lives
Get up now and go Or your never gonna know
Never gonna make it in your houses lying low
Give it one good try
Give it all and fight till you die
FIGHT TILL YOU DIE
All alone in your own society
outside are the cries of lives in misery
an evil plot of a false democracy
subjugating souls just dying to be free
Look all around you there's a war that's going on
A struggle against the odds that's breaking out and must be won
They're getting ready with the weapons they have found
Take inspiration from the sound
Go ahead and try
Or kiss your ass goodbye
People of society are running for their lives
Get up now and go Or your never gonna know
Never gonna make it in your houses lying low
Give it one good try
Give it all and fight till you die
FIGHT TILL YOU DIE
FIGHT TILL YOU DIE
FIGHT TILL YOU DIE
