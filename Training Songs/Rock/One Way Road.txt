They come, they take
It's never enough because they can't relate
To the real world,
Thinking that the oyster is just for the pearl
They start those wars
They want to own the land sea and all the stars
And right those wrongs
They change their history with their poison forked tongues

All right, who's they?
A maybe it's the government of today
Or B for the big business man who thinks the whole world revolves around him
Or C for the corrupt official for A and B he be the man in the middle
Or D for discoverer for Cook and Columbus and the pirate plunderers

Doesn't mean I ain't gonna fight now
Just because I don't got a gun
The lyrical is heavier than lead and
This guitar is my canon
Just like my Martin and Mahatma
I'm gonna love I'm gonna over come
Maybe it's E for all of the above
But I don't want to be

Wrong way going down the one way road
Wrong way going down the one way road
Wrong way going down the one way road
Gonna turn it all around gonna back it on up
Wrong way going down the one way road
Wrong way going on a one way road
Wrong way going down the one way road
Gonna turn it all around gonna back it on up

These men, who they say we should follow
But we can't follow men if their hearts are hollow and
Mmm yes how can we respect puppet regimes that we do not elect?
Straight up straight up straight up like Pinocchio
And every time they lie man the fire just grows so
Now's time to be part of the solution
Raise your fist if you believe in revolution

Doesn't mean I ain't gonna fight now
Just because I don't got a gun
The lyrical is heavier than lead and
This guitar is my canon
Just like my Martin and Mahatma
I'm gonna love I'm gonna over come
Maybe it's E for all of the above
But I don't want to be

Livin' in a pantomime
Livin' in the fantasy
I don't wanna be don't wanna be 
I don't wanna be don't wanna be no
Livin' in a pantomime 
Livin' in the fantasy
I don't wanna be don't wanna be 
I don't wanna be don't wanna be no

Wrong way going down the one way road
Wrong way going down the one way road
Wrong way going down the one way road
Gonna turn it all around gonna back it on up
Wrong way going down the one way road
Wrong way going on a one way road
Wrong way going down the one way road
Gonna turn it all around gonna back it on up
