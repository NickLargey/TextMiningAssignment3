Please forgive me when I turn out the lights
Watch this haunted day turn into a wasted night
So cut me off throw me out
Cause I?m a reckless, I?m a reckless god damn son of a bitch

I?m reckless
So reckless
God save me from this madness
I?m reckless
So reckless
God save me from this madness

I?m walking on broken glass from the wreckage of my past
I?m locked up in a cage ?cause I?m a prisoner of my ways
So cut me off throw me out
?Cause I?m a reckless, I?m a reckless god damn son of a bitch

I?m reckless
So reckless
God save me from this madness
I?m reckless
So reckless
God save me, save me from this madness

Thank God I?ve got a woman with my name across her heart
Loving me ain?t easy loving me is hard
I?m sorry about the madness but that?s the way its gotta be
Cause it takes a crazy woman to love a reckless man like me

I?m reckless
So reckless
God save me from this madness
I?m reckless
So reckless
God save me, save me from this madness
