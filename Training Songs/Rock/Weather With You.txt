Walkin' around the room singin', 'Stormy Weather'
At 57 Mount Pleasant Street
Well, it's the same room but everything's different
You can fight the sleep but not the dream

Things ain't cookin' in my kitchen
Strange affliction wash over me
Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire
Couldn't conquer the blue sky

Well, there's a small boat made of China
It's goin' nowhere on the mantle piece
Well, do I lie like a lounge room lizard
Or do I sing like a bird released

Everywhere you go
You always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
You always take the weather

Everywhere you go
You always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
You always take the weather, take the weather with you

Everywhere you go
You always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
You always take the weather

Everywhere you go
You always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
You always take the weather, take the weather
Weather with you

Everywhere you go
You always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
You always take the weather

Everywhere you go
You always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
You always take the weather, take the weather
Weather with you
