One another, love each other, friendliness is kind
Specially when you're a friend of mine
Come together at the same time

Round and round and a get down
Round and round and a get down
Round and round and a get down

To each other, sister, brother
We're not getting up, going down

Round and round and a get down
Round and round and a get down
Round and round and a get down
