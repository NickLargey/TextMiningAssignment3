Numb, we're broken, here I stand alone
Wondering what were the last words I said to you
Hoping, praying that I'll find a way to turn back time
Can I turn back time?

What would I give to behold
The smile
The face of love
You've never left me
The rising sun
Will always speak your name

Numb, we're broken, here I stand alone
Wondering what were the last words I said to you

It won't be long, we'll meet again

What would I give (what would I give)
To behold
The smile
The face of love
You've never left me
(You've never left me)
The rising sun
Will always speak your name

It won't be long, we'll meet again
Your memory is never passing
It won't be long, we'll meet again
My love for you is everlasting

I mourn for those who never knew you
I mourn (I mourn) for those (for those) who never knew you
Who never knew you

It won't be long, we'll meet again
Your memory is never passing
It won't be long, we'll meet again
My love for you is everlasting

It won't be long, we'll meet again
It won't be long, we'll meet again
