I see you naked in the
Bath
Cigarette stains on your
Hands
Wilted flowers in a vase
And I ask how you are

I see your lipstick on
Your glass
And I think you're drunk
And start to laugh
And I find your note the
Letters ran
And it said I loved you

Don't ask why

Sixteen candles down the
Drain

I watch you passed out for 
A while
I touch your face you
Start to smile
And on your note is my
Reply
I wished I loved you

Don't ask why

Sixteen candles down the
Drain
