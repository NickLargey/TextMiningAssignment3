Slow down you'll never catch me
Look hard you'll never find me
Dreams fall apart but that's OK
Plans will unwind but that's alright
  
Give up your search is futile
Truth lies within the middle way
Dreams fall apart but that's OK
  
But I change whenever you're around
I break whenever you're around
  
It seems like such a fatal view
It seems like such a desperate view
to cling to but another you
to flee to such a desperate view of mine
  
Let go those bright tomorrows
What's there is filled with sorrow
Dreams fall apart but that's OK
  
But I change whenever you're around
I break whenever you're around
