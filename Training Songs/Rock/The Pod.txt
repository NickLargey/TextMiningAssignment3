morning scatters in and i am steady like a drug feeling out this
one
she wakes up smashed as hell and steadies her ass against the
rail
and bends before the pounding rain
she had the widest bright ideas all along about my love
and i need this f**king fix and i beg her
to pick from one of the billion ways to feel no pain
the morning after bends reflected and i can hardly stand the way
this
whole thing makes me seem
she climbs out from a dream with lungs hardly as she screams a
stereo scream
and bends before astounding rain
she's got a system made of metal and magnet bits inside a brain
she opens her box of tricks and begs me
to pick from one of the billion ways to feel no pain
she had the widest bright ideas
that all the world would sleep away until the nightmare ends
everyone is on wait, wait on the end, only uptight, love
