I'm done for once
And as soon as I get out of here
I plan on coming back for nothing
But then again there's you
And although this town does flaunt
All the stuff you need to feel at home
I plan on taking from it nothing, 
But then again there's you

Abby she's got to wait
Until she gets you on your own
So she can make you make mistakes
And you can offer to take her home

It's not like I don't miss it none
But the quicker I drink more in here
The quicker I lose track of you
But I know you wouldn't want that
And although this town does flaunt
Much thicker stories than I care to talk
Darling you you've ducked them in style
I'll always love you for that

Abby she's got to wait
Until she gets you on your own
So she can make you make mistakes
And you can offer to take her home
And now she's wearing that top you love
And she's topping it all off
By acting like somethings up
She always knew how to pull the strings
