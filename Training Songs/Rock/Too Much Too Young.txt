You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're married with a kid
When you could be having fun with me

(Oh no, no give me no more pickni)

You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're married with a son
When you should be having fun with me

We don't want, we don't want we don't want no more pickni

Ain't he cute?
No he ain't
He's just another burden on the welfare state

You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're married with a kid
When you could be having fun with me

No gimme, no gimme, no gimme no more pickni

Call me immature, call me a poser
I'd love to spread manure in your bed of roses
Don't want to be rich, don't want to be famous
But I'd really hate to have the same name as you

You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're married with a kid
When you could be having fun with me

(Gi we de birth control, we no want no pickni)

You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're chained to the cooker
Making currant buns for tea

(Oh no, no gimme no more pickni)

Ain't you heard of the starving millions
Ain't you heard of contraception
Do you really a program of sterilization
State control of the population boom
It's in your living room
Keep a generation gap
Try wearing a cap

You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're married with a kid
When you could be having fun with me

(Oh no, no gimme no more pickni)

You've done too much
Much too young
Now you stay in every night watching programs on TV

(We don't want, we don't want, we don't want no more pickni)

You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're married with a son
When you could be having fun with me

(No gimme, no gimme, no gimme, no more pickni)

You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're chained to the cooker
Making currant buns for tea

(Gi we de birth control, we no want no pickni)

Much too young
Now you're married to a man
When you could be having fun with me

Making beans on toast for tea

Making cheese on toast for tea

(No gimme, no gimme, no gimme, no more pickni)
