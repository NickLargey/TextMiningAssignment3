Have you seen your mother girl? 
Has she gone away? 
Gone away and found the pearl 
But the price she paid 

Gone, when you wake in the morning 
Gone, when you find that there's no one sleeping 
Gone, pretty Penny was her name 
She was loved and we all will miss her 

How far will you go I say, just to bait a mouse?
Shorter lived and longer gone
Can you figure out? 

Gone, when you wake in the morning 
Gone, when you find that there's no one sleeping 
Gone, pretty Penny was her name 
She was loved and we all will miss her 

Have you lost your sister girl? 
She's all but blown away 
Blown away and lost the pearl 
And the price she paid 

Gone, when you wake in the morning 
Gone, when you find that there's no one sleeping 
Gone, pretty Penny was her name 
She was loved and we all will miss her
