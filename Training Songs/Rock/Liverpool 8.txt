[Verse 1]
I was a sailor first, I sailed the sea
Then I got a job, in a factory
Played Butlin's Camp with my friend Rory
It was good for him, it was great for me

[Chorus]
Liverpool I left you, said 'goodbye' to Madryn Street
I always followed my heart, and I never missed a beat
Destiny was calling, I just couldn't stick around
Liverpool I left you, but I never let you down

[Verse 2]
Went to Hamburg, the red lights were on
With George & Paul, and my friend John
We rocked all night, we all looked tough
We didn't have much, but we had enough

[Chorus]
Liverpool I left you, said 'goodbye' to Madryn Street
I always followed my heart, and I never missed a beat
Destiny was calling, I just couldn't stick around
Liverpool I left you, but I never let you down

[Verse 3]
In the U.S.A. when we played Shea
We were Number One, and it was fun
When I look back, it sure was cool
For those Four Boys from Liverpool

[Chorus]
Liverpool I left you, said 'goodbye' to Admiral Grove
I always followed my heart, so I took it on the road
Destiny was calling, I just couldn't stick around
Liverpool I left you, but I never let you down

La la la la la la....Liverpool
