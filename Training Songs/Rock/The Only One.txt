Is it true, what they say
All about the way you are, when I'm far away
Let me know, say it ain't so, that's alright
Cos I believe, just what I see
And every little thing you do, looks fine to me
Let me know, say it ain't so, that's alright

Cos it'll take more than a whisper
To make me question you
But everybody's talking, and I need to know the truth

Tell me I'm the only one, til I know they're wrong
Look me in the eye and say, no one's going to take my place
Tell it out clear and strong, that I'm the only one, yeah.

Now I know, but I don't know why
In the face of jealousy, people cheat and lie
If that's true, then I don't blame you, that's alright
Cos a grand investigation, ain't what I'm gonna do
Cos it's only speculation, without a hint of proof

Just tell me I'm the only one, til I know they're wrong
Look me in the eye and say, no one's going to take my place
Tell it out clear and strong, that I'm the only one

I've got to be the only one, yeah yeah

Mmmmmm I gotta know

Tell me I'm the only one, til I know they're wrong
Look me in the eye and say, no one's going to take my place
Tell it out clear and strong, that I'm the only one

I wanna know (tell me I'm the only one)
Mmmmm I wanna be the only one (look me in the eye and say)

Say it out clear and strong, that I'm the only one
Woo, come on, ha ha

I'm going to be the only one
