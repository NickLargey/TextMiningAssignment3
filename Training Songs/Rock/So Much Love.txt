Hats need a beat
Like awake needs asleep
Like a pen needs a page
To re-write you need a mistake, oh, yeah

Hearts need a mind
Like a clock needs the time
Like white needs black
If you leave I hope you need to come back

Oh, I swear, I know, I believe it
Oh, I can't stop hearin' all the singin'
Oh, my soul has never had this feelin'
And it feels like gold

You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life comin' true

Strike all the bells
Hit 'em hard, make 'em all yell
Celebrate, infatuate
Lock us up, yeah, incarcerate, oh

Oh, I swear, I know, I believe it
Oh, I can't stop hearin' all the singin'
Oh, my soul has never had this feelin'
And it feels like

So, so, so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life comin' true

You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh, c'mon, yeah

You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life comin' true

You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life comin' true

You got so much love in you
