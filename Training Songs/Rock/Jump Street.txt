Dawn came sneaking like a skinny snake
The harder they go the harder I ache
Get so high
Down so low
Somebody tell me 'bout this debt I owe

West side bomber looked like a comer
Looked like I'll be back at school
Put two on the nose
And look how she goes
Little trained squeeze look like a fool
Rock on

And I'm gone
Stone gone
Said you can forget about me
And I'm gone
Stone gone

Working girls just tryin' to get ahead
Somebody's bound to end up dead
And honey
You better stop coming down on me
On me
Stop

Jump Street

Sally comes creeping at the break of dawn
Can't figure out whose side I'm on
Bomber comes back like a ringin' a bell
Knows a good thing and she knows it well

Well enough best left alone
Wish your mamma had kept you at home
Wish your mamma had kept the evidence
Worrying about the Feds has crucified me for dead
She wish I was dead
Well I wish I was dead

But I'm gone
Stone gone
As gone as I can be
And I'm gone
So gone

Don't look much like a Saturday night
Honey don't look for those flashing lights
But baby
You'd better stop coming down on me
Stop coming down on me
I don't need it
Stop coming down.. on me

OW !

Jump Street

And I'm gone
Stone gone
You can forget about me yeah
I'm gone
Stone gone
So long

Workin' girls just tryin' to get ahead
Somebody's bound to end up dead
And honey
You better stop coming down on me
Stop your coming down
Stop coming down on me yeah
Stop coming down on me

Look out funk

Jump Street
