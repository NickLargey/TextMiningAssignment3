My eyes keep me in trouble
I want every woman I see
My eyes keep me in trouble
I want every woman I see
Ah you pretty women kill me
You're gonna get poor me

Now I want women on my left
Women on my right
Women all day 
Women all night
I want to love pretty women
That is a natural fact
Natural fact
I want to love pretty women
Love 'em till their hair turns back

Now when you see me comin'
Raise your window high
Now when you see me comin'
Raise your window high
She's got a bad old man
And I'm too young to die

My eyes keep me in trouble
I want every woman I see
My eyes keep me in trouble
I want every woman I see
Ah you pretty women kill me
You're gonna get poor me
