As I look at the letters
That you wrote to me,
It's you that I'm thinking of,
As I read the lines
That to me were so sweet,
I remember our faded love.

I miss you, darling,
More and more, every day,
As heaven would miss the stars above,
With every heartbeat 
I still think of you,
And remember our faded love.

I think of the past 
And all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the doves
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love

I miss you, darling
More and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat
I still think of you
And remember our faded love
