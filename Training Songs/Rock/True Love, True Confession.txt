I try to call ya 
But I only get your service
You're the playmate of the year
So I guess that I deserve it 
Well you left me with some habits
That are awful hard to kick
If you see me on your TV screen
You better come on over quick 
Cause true love and true confessions 
Are the same thing
Don't go and sell our secrets for a gold ring
Our love was ended quickly for the deadlines
Now you talk about me in the headlines 
You're always seen in Paris 
At the Central Fashion Show
You got a million lovers 
And I can't forget your glow 
Well each week was like a playing card
And I'm living in a dream
You were nothin' like I thought you were
But I'm nothin' like I seem 
Cause true love and true confessions 
Are the same thing
Don't go and sell our secrets for a gold ring
Our love was ended quickly for the deadlines
Now you talk about me in the headlines 
You're so beautiful and clever
But you always have to scheme
Your reckless life will turn on you
Up along the silver screen
Oh yeah
This is true love 
Cause true love and true confessions 
Are the same thing
Don't go and sell our secrets for a gold ring
Our love was ended quickly for the deadlines
Now you talk about me in the headlines 
Cause true love and true confessions 
Are the same thing
Don't go and sell our secrets for a gold ring
Our love was ended quickly for the deadlines
Now you talk about me in the headlines
