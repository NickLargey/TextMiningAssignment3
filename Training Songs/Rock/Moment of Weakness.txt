I stand here in the pouring rain
You couldn't even be there to pick me up.
Yer taking me for granted, again
Yer running outta time, and yer out of luck!

Just a moment of weakness.
I should examine my head!
Just a moment of weakness.
I never meant a word I said!

I'm sick with the Bejing Flu
And you choose not to come home
A week later I caught you
Kissing a girl who was my clone!

Just a moment of weakness.
I should examine my head!
Just a moment of weakness.
I never meant a word I said!

(oh, why should I stay and pretend?
You make me laugh again
My darling, truth-is we are not even friends!
Oh, love comes and it goes.
Where you heart stops no one knows
How did I wind up in this mess, here with you!)

Just a moment of weakness.
I should examine my head!
Just a moment of weakness.
I never meant a word I said!
