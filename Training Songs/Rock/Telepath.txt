I`m leaving the smog below me now 
I`m leaving my troubles on the ground 
I`m watching those smokestacks just blaze away 
The sky will be blue never grey 

The future is filled with wasted time 
I can`t see the road -- I`m going blind 
I`m laughing at all of my future plans 
Shining like gold in my hands 

Isn`t it funny how you reach me 
You know exactly what I`m thinking 
You`re always helping me from sinking 
It`s your way 

Hello, this is London calling -- is my flight due 
Hello, is there someway I can reach you 
Isn`t it funny how you call me 
You call me up while I am sleeping 
You`re always helping me from sinking -- it`s your way 

Now this is the end of all my dreams 
The drumming has stopped behind my ears 
There`s no looking back now -- I`m too far away 
I`m shaking like mad in a daze. . . 

Then out of the night you join me here 
The people around me, they disappear 
And I hear your voice, and you speak to my eyes 
And everything comes alive
