She wore a low-cut black satin dress
Slit up the front and down the back
She wore black high-heeled shoes
With laces that went up her ankles

She wore black velvet gloves
With rhinestone bracelets around them
She had long blond hair, she had long blond hair
(Long blond hair, long blond hair)

And she sat on the jukebox with one leg propped up
And a crowd of boys gathered 'round her
And one tried to kiss her
But she turned her face

And I wish you could have seen her dance
The way she soared across the floor
I wish you could have seen her dance
She did a pirouette and then a Kung Fu step

I wish you could have seen her dance
The way she threw her hair through the air
And I wish you could have seen her dance

I asked her, "Do you come here often?"
She said, "I've never been here before"
I asked her, her name and she said
"They call me Kim Boston in England"

"And Kim English in Boston and also in Dallas"
I said, "How did you like Dallas"
She said, "It was just like Ireland
Except the wells don't look like wishing wells"

And I wish you could have seen her dance
The way she soared across the floor
I wish you could have seen her dance
She did the Flavo and the Tango and the Flamenco

I wish you could have seen her dance
The way she threw her hair through the air
And I wish you could have seen her dance

I asked, "Are you an actress"
She said, "No, but do you think I'm good enough"
She said, "You look like you belong on
Monty Python, Eric Idle"

She said, "Do you wanna know what I do for work"
I said, "Sure"
(She had long blond hair)
I said, "Alright"
(She had long blond hair)

She said, "I'm a maid and a dancer
I've danced for three rock bands
And one of the bands
Even wrote a song about me"

And I wish you could have seen her dance
I wish you could have seen her dance
I wish you could have seen her, wish you could have seen her
Wish you could have seen her dance
