This deja-vu feeling
I know quite well
This psychic confusion
This living hell
A cosmic connection
With someone somewhere
Is coming from your direction
I swear, I swear

And I've been running all this time
And I'm running out of places to go
And I am oh so sick and tired of every face that I know
Everything I do, everything I say
Everything in my head, every night, every day

I've been East, I've been West, I've been North, I've been South
I feel your arms, I hear your voice, I feel your hands, I kiss your mouth

[Chorus:]
And I am walking in London
And you are watching me walk
Talking Italian
And you are hearing me talk
Singing in Sydney
And you were sitting right there
Feeling you in me, everywhere, everywhere

An invisible touch
On the back of my neck
Fingerprints lingering
Warm breath
I'm either going insane
Or I'm a human wire
Receiving a signal
Desire, desire

And I've been running all this time
And I'm running out of places to go
And I am oh so sick and tired of every face that I know
Everything I do, everything I say
Everything in my head, every night, every day

I've been East, I've been West, I've been North, I've been South
I hear your voice, I see your face, I feel your hands, I kiss your mouth

[Chorus]

I've been East, I've been West, I've been North, I've been South
I've been East, I've been West, I've been North, I've been South
I've been East, I've been West, I've been North, I've been South
I feel your arms, I hear your voice, I feel your hands, I kiss your mouth

[Chorus]
