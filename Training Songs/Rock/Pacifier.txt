You feeling good today
'Cause I got told that you were
Smashed up on your own motorway
But it's O.K
The first upon the scene
A life support machine
But still collapse as if you were some accidental star

Do you know what the time is?
Is it messing with your mind kid?
Are you hurting all the time?
And you need a pacifier
Come on, lets take a look outside

Don't look so worried you know
There ain't no hurry
'Cause life's supposed to ebb and flow
Now you're all clear to go
And when you're out there
No, they can't catch you
Precious star, you are the best at what you are

Do you know what the time is?
What's messing with your mind kid?
Are you hurting all the time?
And you need a pacifier
Come on, lets take a look outside

Come on, lets take a look outside
