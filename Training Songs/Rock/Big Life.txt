Out of work, I'm out of school
Guess, things ain't looking so bright
I got holes in the knees of my Levi jeans
But the rest of me is dynamite

On the radio, the guy says come on
It's so hip, hip, hip to be square
When the world hits ya hard right here in the face
What do I know, I don't care

I get this feeling
That I'm about to win it all
(And I'll take it all)
I'm so excited
All this here writin' on the wall
(And I love it all)

I'll take my money
And I'll buy myself a car
I'll grab my girlfriend
And I'll drive her to the stars

Well, that might not be my heaven
But it's close enough to call it

Big life
It's what you make it, what you make it
Big life
It's what you make it
I could take a liking to
Big life

Late on one day as the sun went down
I was just about to do the same
I heard a knock on the door
Couple girls walked in

Said, ?Baby don't we know your name??
Well, we sweated all night
And we partied all day
And we did it all over again

When they left I discovered
They were workin' undercover
Hard livin'
Pays off again

I get this feeling
That I'm about to win it all
(And I'll take it all)
I'm so excited
All this here writin' on the wall
(And I love it all)

I'll take my money
And I'll buy myself a car
I'll get my girlfriend
And I'll drive her to the stars

Well, that might not be my heaven
But it's close enough to call it

Big life
It's what you make it, what you make it
Big life
It's what you make it
I could take a liking to
Big life

I'll take my money
And I'll buy myself a car
I'll get my girlfriend
And I'll drive her to the stars

Well, that might not be your heaven
But it's close enough to call it

Big life
It's what you make it, what you make it
Big life
It's what you make it
I could take a liking to
Big life

Big life

It's what you make it, what you make it
Big life
It's what you make it
I could take a liking to
Big life

It's what you make it, what you make it
Big life
It's what you make it
I could take a liking to
Big life
