If we were caught in the danger zone
Deep inside a world's unknown
Would we never turn away
If televisions all we were told
It showed us everything too old
But would we ever turn away

We grew up fast to realize
Your borrowed words can't compromise
Sometimes love won't sympathize
But colour never ever changes your hungry eyes

If we could turn back yesterday
Remember what we used to say
Would it be the same, to me

If no one told us right from wrong
Would they still have to wait so long
Sometimes love won't compromise
But colour never ever changes their

Hungry eyes, see forever
Hungry eyes, I fall inside you

I turned to face another side of me
Cause once we fall inside, it's forever
They told us we were wrong
But they'll never steal our song

Hungry eyes, see forever
