I get this feeling sometimes
Like theres nothing in the world that isn't mine
And I could have it all
Maybe I should have it all
I'll take you out of your life
Just the one sweet night
And you could take it all
Oh, maybe I could rip it off
It's easy to pick and choose
With you and me we can only lose
Just don't fight me off
And I won't write you off
Take me in and then you push me out
Fall all over yourself tonight
And just don't let it go, without a fight
Take me in and then you push me out
Fall all over yourself tonight
And just don't let it go, let it go
So here I am again
Singing songs about the summer
'Cause that's when you and me
When we came to be
I brought you home to my guitar
And told you how sweet you really are
'Cause you know what's on my mind
Is you getting all this time
It's easy to pick and choose
With you and me we can only lose
Just don't find me out
And I won't fight you off
Take me in and then you push me out
Fall all over yourself tonight
And just don't let it go, let it go
Oh no no, another girl, no no
Don't fight me off little girl
