Once I had a sweetheart and now I have none
Once I had a sweetheart and now I have none 
He's gone and left me He's gone and left me
Gone and left me in sorrow to mourn 
Last night in sweet slumber I dreamed I did see 
Last night in sweet slumber I dreamed I did see 
My own darling jewel sat smiling by me 
My own darling jewel sat smiling by me 
But when I awakened I found it not so 
But when I awakened I found it not so 
My eyes like some fountain with tears overflowed
Eyes like some fountain with tears overflowed
I'll venture through England, through France and through Spain
I'll venture through England, through France and through Spain 
My life I'll venture on watery main 
My life I'll venture on watery main
I'll set sail of silver and steer toward the sun 
I'll set sail of silver and steer toward the sun 
And my false love will weep, my false love will weep 
False love will weep for me after I'm gone 
After I'm gone, After I'm gone, After I'm gone...
