I've got this pleasant view
Late night working avenue
Never had the chance to love you
Never want to see you cry

Thank god it's quittin' time
F*ck me harder, kill the lights
Never had the chance to love you
Never want to see you cry
Never had the chance to love you
Hard cock, nasty mind
(Yeah, well c'mon, yeah)

[Chorus]

Take off your clothes and shut the door
Pornographic monster on the floor
That's what you like, I'll cum some more
Don't you know we f*ck for money
I'm a big-dick-motherfuckin' porno star

In my face, on top again
A dead lay lover never wins
Never had the chance to love you
Never want to see you cry

The best f*ck you'll ever have
A good job from a workin' man
Never had the chance to love you
Never want to see you cry
Never had the chance to love you
Hard cock, suicide

[Chorus]
