Somebody's after me, I can't pretend to be
Something I know I'm not
And when they come for me
I'll just let them be
'Cause all that I need today, is all I need

I just want to be thinking thoughts that I think
Dreaming my dreams and drifting within
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I know where I've been
Come on look within

Someone will always be more than I'll ever be
So then I'll be myself
And when they come for me
I'll just let them be
'Cause all that I need today, I need today

I just want to be thinking thoughts that I think
Dreaming my dreams and drifting within
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I know where I've been
Come on, live your dream

Oh you're big enough
You're tuff enough
And now I begin to see
Girl you've gotta
Lay your love on me
It's big enough
So far enough
And as far as my eye can see
Girl you gotta
Lay your love on me
Lay your love on
Lay your love on
Lay your love on me

Somebody's after me, I can't pretend to be
Something I know I'm not
And when they come for me 
I'll just let them be
'Cause all that I need today, I need today

An' I just want to be thinking thoughts that I think
Dreaming my dreams and drifting within
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I know where I've been
So come on, live your dream

Like a bird without wings
Like a bird who don't sing
Like a fish on dry land
Like I'm swimming in sand
Like a bird without wings
Like a bird who don't sing
Like a fish on dry land
Like I'm swimming in sand
Like I've fallen for you
