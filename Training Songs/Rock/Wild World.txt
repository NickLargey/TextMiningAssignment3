It's a wild
Wild world
It's a wild
Wild world

And there's money to be made off someone else's shame
Every day and every night there's something going wrong
City rats to suburbanites hold tight 'cause this is your song

It's a wild
Wild world
That you might not believe in

It's a wild
Wild world
That can be so deceiving

And there's money to be made off someone else's shame
And there's money to be made off someone else's pain

Time can turn it's back on you, leave you broken and asking for
A little bit more and less to lose, you lie and cheat and steal just to score

It's a wild
Wild world
It's a wild
Wild world

It's a wild
Wild world
It's a wild
Wild world

And there's money to be made off someone else's shame
And there's money to be made off someone else's pain

Broken glass and alcohol, bars on windows, security walls
You don't belong here in this place, you're too good for that
I can see it in your face

It's a wild
Wild world
That you might not believe in

It's a wild
Wild world
That can be so deceiving

(It's a wild
Wild world)
It's a wild
Wild world

(It's a wild
Wild world)
It's a wild
Wild world
