Don't be alarmed 
It's not the end of the world 
If we're breaking the rules it's fine 
I disregard this kind of problem all the time
It's not as if it's gonna kill anyone 
If there's no victim then there's no crime 
Just draw another if you think we've crossed the line

Rules don't stop me 
Forget about it 
Rules don't stop me 
We'll get around it 
Rules don't stop me 
Forget about it 
Don't stop me, don't stop me

Although it may seem unconventional sometimes 
Indiscretion is worth a try 
If you just play along I promise we'll be fine
So leave your hang-ups back at the door 
When you and I are down on the floor 
Will you know what to do about it 
You know what to do about it

Rules don't stop me 
Forget about it 
Rules don't stop me 
We'll get around it 
Rules don't stop me 
Forget about it 
Don't stop me, don't stop me

It's not as bad as they say 
If this is such a mistake 
Why does it seem to make you so damn happy? 
This is no time to behave 
Let's both get carried away 
If there's a price to be paid 
It won't stop me

Rules don't stop me 
Forget about it 
Rules don't stop me 
We'll get around it 
Rules don't stop me 
Forget about it 
Don't stop me, don't stop me 
They don't stop me, they don't stop me
