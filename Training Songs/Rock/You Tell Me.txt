Baby I heard thunder 
I woke up, middle of the night 
Baby I saw fire 
I went left, I went right 

So you tell me what you want me to do 
This might be over honey, it ain't through 
Let me know when you're finished with me 
What you want me to be 
Baby you tell me 
Honey you tell me 

Baby I don't understand this 
But that's alright, I can take a little pain 
I've been winnin' and losin' 
Baby I've been in and out of reach 

So you tell me what you want me to do 
This might be over honey, it ain't through 
Let me know when you're finished with me 
What you want me to be 
Baby you tell me 
Honey you tell me 

Well you put me to your faces 
And you twist me so felt I died 
Yeah the last thing now you're leaving 
Was I finally realizing you lied 

So you tell me what you want me to do 
This might be over honey it ain't through 
Let me know when you're finished with me 
What you want me to be 
Baby you tell me 
Honey you tell me 
Baby you tell me 
Will you tell me?
