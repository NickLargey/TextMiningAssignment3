Little bird
Hoppin' on my porch
I know it sounds kinda sad
But what's it all for?
Right now you're the only friend I have in the world
And I just can't take out very much
Goddamn
I miss that girl

Little bird
You look all right
I'm sure it's not easy
Gettin' through your night
So tell me this can't be how it's gonna end
Tell me my heart
Somehow
Dear God
Is gonna mend

Little bird
I guess you're right
Can't let her take me out
Without a fight
But right now I can't see making sense of this world
I just can't take out very much
Goddamn
I miss that girl
