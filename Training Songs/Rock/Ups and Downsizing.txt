There’s so many songs of sitting cold in the waiting cars outside.
But someone had to build them right.
And if we ever sell this house,
we’ll pack our bags and move down south.
Somewhere warmer where no one will notice
the car we drive for the first time.

And so we freeze and then thaw out.
Do you ever wonder if we should leave
or ride this out?
Do you ever wonder
was it worth it now?

It’s hard to be afraid.
You’re singing rustbelt lullabies.
I’ll fall asleep if you give me time
to find out where I’ll wake up.
There's not much room left in this state.
It hits home harder when you're still days away.
The “for sale” sign is familiar but never feels right.

And so we freeze and then thaw out.
Do you ever wonder if we should leave
or ride this out?
Do you ever wonder was it worth it now?

I’m finding the beauty in everything since we said our goodbyes.
Now we take what we get.
I have clothes for every occasion now.
I know. Don’t feel so alone.
It’s looking up.

Do you ever wonder was it worth it now?

And so we freeze and then thaw out.
Do you ever wonder if we should leave
or ride this out?
Do you ever wonder was it worth it now?
