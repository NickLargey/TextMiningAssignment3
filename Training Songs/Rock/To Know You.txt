Look away, you paint me in
Sometimes I grow bolder
Funny how the moment comes
Closer still to know you

So you gave a quiet light
My one chance at order
I won't toss your way aside
For any corner of the world

There is no answer to the question
We are in mutual possession
This is the circle that we live in
These are the people that we've been
