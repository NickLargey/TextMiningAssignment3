I know a girl in a new blue dress
Ready to meet a stranger with good intentions
She's so tender with no corners at all
She is one of nature's unique inventions
I know a girl waving goodbye
I love a girl in motion

Some day's the job I get tied up in knots
I come home drunk and angry, so demanding
She lay me down and squeeze it out
Rub my head while I cry, so understanding
Understanding

I know a girl with a tear in her eye
I know a girl with a notion
I know a girl waving goodbye
I love a girl in motion

Guess it got to be too much taking care of me
Guess it got to be too much, I guess it gotta be
I know a girl with a suitcase packed
I love a girl with a train ticket, takin' her away from me
Takin' her away
I know a girl with a tear in her eye
I know a girl with a notion
I know a girl waving goodbye
I love a girl in motion

Girl in motion
I know a girl
Girl with emotion
I know a girl

Girl in motion
I know a girl
Girl with a notion
I love a girl
Girl in motion
