I fall in love at least once every night
Another volume just keeps catching my eye
I can keep picking one off every shelf
I made a promise, it's one in and one out

That's why I stopped right where I stood
When I saw you
That's why I stopped right where I stood
When I saw you

I'm breaking myself trying to catch you in that
A million thoughts all race anew round my head
You know I want you but I'm clipped by this doubt
Born on this promise, it's one in and one out

That's why I stopped right where I stood
When I saw you
That's why I stopped right where I stood
When I saw you
There was a lot I could have done
But nothing good
That's why I stopped right where I stood
When I saw you

That's why I stopped right where I stood
When I saw you
That's why I stopped right where I stood
When I saw you
There was a lot I could have done
But nothing good
That's why I stopped right where I stood
When I saw you
