Oh, were you not told? Do you not know?
Everything around you is being sold
Do you not care? Will you not bear?
Everybody else is going spare

What's yours and mine
Does this escape you all the time?
Sometimes I wish
Protesting was sexy on a Saturday night

Would you ever, would you ever
Go down, down, down, down
To fight, fight, fold your snap
Fold your snap and fight

Over here, over there
Over here, every fucking where

I just don't know
Who's in control
Please, no, don't say
It could go either way

It's militant, not military
Welcome everybody, we're not all that scary
I'm a big fan of the local library
I just read a book but that's another story

Yours and mine
They get mixed up all of the time
I wish sometimes
Protesting was sexy on a Saturday night

So would you ever, would you ever
Go down, down, down, down
Fight, fight, fold your snap
Fold your snap and fight

Over here, over there
Over here, every fucking where

I'll never be, I'll never see
I'll never be what you want me to be

I just don't know
Who's in control
Please, no, don't say
It could go either way

Over here, over there
Over here, every fucking where
Over here, over there
Over here, every fucking where

I just don't know
Who's in control
Please, no, don't say
It could go either way
