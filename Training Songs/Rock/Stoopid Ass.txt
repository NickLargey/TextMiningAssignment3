It's a new dawn now gotta real cold shower to greet me
It's just the same fake smile makes it all worthwhile believe me
I gotta new plan now gonna use this hour to kill you
Don't look so sour I'm please to meet you

It's a new joke now and I'm your grinning jester
There's only one clown here and the bastards sure to get you
Well is it just payback when the knives in your back surround you
Who give a shit? I'm please I found you

Do you think you can beat me? No

Nothing left to say and I think you know that feeling
Someone's gotta pay and you're never gonna see me leaving
I gotta new plan now gonna gonna use this beat to kill you
Don't look so scared, I'm pleased to beat you

Do you think you can beat me? No!
