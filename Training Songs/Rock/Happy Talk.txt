Happy talk
keep talkin' happy talk

Talk about things you'd like to do.
You gotta have a dream
if you don't have a dream
How you gonna have a dream come true?
Talk about a moon floatin' in the sky

Lookin' like a lily on a lake;
Talk about a bird learnin' how to fly
Makin' all the music he can make.

Happy talk
keep talkin' happy talk
. . .
Let's talk about a star lookin' like a toy

Peekin' through the branches of a tree; 
Talk about a girl
talk about a boy
Countin' all the ripples on the sea.

Happy talk
keep talkin' happy talk
. . .
Talk about a boy sayin' to the girl: 
Golly, Baby ! I'm a lucky cuss !
Talk about a girl sayin' to the boy:
'You and me are lucky to be us !"

Happy talk
keep talkin' happy talk
. . .
If you don't talk happy and you never have a dream
Then you'll never have a dream come true !
