I'm out of the game
I've been out for a long time now
I'm lookin' for something
Can't be found on the main drag, no
I'm out of the game
I've been out for a long time now
I'm looking for something
Can't be found on the main drag no

Look at you, look at you, look at you, look at you, suckers!
Does your mama know what you're doin'?
Look at you, look at you, look at you, look at you, suckers!
Does your mama know what you're doin'?

You're only a child
With the mind of a senile man
You're only a young thing
'Bout to sleep with a sea of men
Just hangin' around
Wearin' somethin' from God knows where
Just havin' a ball
Makin' all of the thin cards fall

Look at you, look at you, look at you, look at you suckers!
Does your mama know what you're doin'?
Look at you, look at you, look at you, look at you suckers!
Does your mama know what you're doin'?

Say, come over here,
Let me smell you for one last time
Before you go out there (out there)
And ruin all of the world, once mine

I'm out of the game
I've been out for a long time now
I'm lookin' for something
That can't be found on the main drag, no

Look at you, look at you, look at you, look at you, suckers!
Does your mama know what you're doin'?
Look at you, look at you, look at you, look at you, suckers!
Does your mama know, what you're doin'?
