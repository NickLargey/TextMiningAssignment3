It was my fault, my move, my game
If I’d known a little more, I’d a run away
It was dark out and I held the cards
I was the dealer and it wasn’t hard

I was the mistress of my fate
I was a card shark
If I’d a looked a little ahead
I’d a run away
I was the mistress of my fate
I gave it all out
If I’d really known you then
You’d a had to watch out

It was my fault, my move, and my wine
I see the sun now
And it still shines
But it was dark out
And I held the cards

Ooh, I was the dealer
And it wasn’t hard
I was the mistress of my fate
I was the card shark
If I’d a looked a little ahead
I’d a run away

I was the mistress of my fate
I gave it all out
If I’d really known you then
You’d a had to watch out

I’ll be the dancer
You be the player
I’ll just almost hold you
You just almost stay here
I’ll be the passion
You be the play
I’ll just almost hold you
You just almost stay here
I’ll just almost hold you
You just almost stay here

I was the mistress of my fate
I was the card shark
If I’d a looked a little ahead
I’d a run away
I was the mistress of my fate
I gave it all out
If I’d really known you then
You’d a had to watch out
If I’d really known you then
You’d a had to watch out
