Five o'clock and the day begins
I drown my head
To watch it sink or swim
Coming down from yesterday
We might get through
Weigh yourself
Then you weigh your friends
You weigh the truth
You feel it slipping in
I'll give it up in an hour or two
Well be back soon

I live my life
Its getting better every day
I don't feel quite right
Its getting better every day

And it comes and goes by now
Yes it comes and goes by now
Well it comes and goes but now its
Getting better every day

Trick myself just to pass the time
To kill the day
Its starting to unwind
Sinking fast in the morning light
We came unglued
Another drink just for yesterday
To stem the tide
I feel it slip away
Another trip just to drown my head
Well be back soon

I live my life
Its getting better every day
I don't feel quite right
Its getting better every day

And it comes and goes by now
Yes it comes and goes by now
Well it comes and goes but now its
Getting better every day

Satans on the line
Santas on the line
Ice creams on the line
Major barbaras on the line
If god is on the line
Then guilt is on the line
Jealousies on the line
I got you on the line

Well be back soon
Well be back soon
Well be back soon
Well be back soon

and it comes and goes by now
yes it comes and goes by now
well it comes and goes but now
now its getting better every day
