This one' called Martin Scorsese
He makes the best fucking films (x2)
If I ever meet him I'm gonna grab his fuckin' neck and just shake him
And say thank you thank you for makin' such excellwnt fuckin' movies

Then I'd twist his nose all the way the f*ck around
And the rip off one of his ears and throw it 
Like a like a like a fuckin' frisbee 
I want to chew his fuckin' lips off and grab his head and suck out one of his

Eyes and chew on it and spit it out in his face
And thank you thank you for all of your fuckin' films
Then I'd pick him up by the hair swing him over my head a few times
And throw him across the room and kick all his fuckin' teeth in and then

stomp on his face 40 or 50 times
'Cause he makes the best fucking films he makes the best fucking films
I've ever seen in my life
I fuckin' love him
I fuckin' love him
