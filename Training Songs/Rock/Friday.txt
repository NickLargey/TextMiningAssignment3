Another she will anyway 

Colliding on old photographs. 

Some other candy matrimony 

that strips the night I 
breathe... 

Maybe next time 

tread wire on jaded memory 

against every line I know 

I threw my wish in there 

and tripped the night I 
breathe... 

Maybe next time
