Clock strikes eight up on a Monday
Got to bed half past five
Can't remember Saturday or Sunday
Life is grand

Doesn't it feel good to be alive
When you're going somewhere
Going somewhere

Paint the food through bricks and mortar
Bide my time trying to have some fun
Half past ten I drink a little water
Time stands still

I'm seeing my future slip through my hands
Watch the wind whip through desert sand
Then I remember I'm no ordinary man
And I'm going somewhere
Going somewhere

It's been years since I was a builder
Working with my head and hands
Dreams of crystal, glass and silver
Gold flashing past

So tantalizing, the things that I've seen
I know you know exactly what I mean
Can't ever look back to where you've been
When you're going somewhere
Going somewhere

Clock strikes eight up on a Monday
Got to bed half past five
Can't remember Saturday or Sunday
But life is grand

Doesn't it feel good to be alive
To laugh until the tears roll from your eyes
I'll drink to your health from five miles high
And I'm going somewhere
Going somewhere
Going somewhere
Going somewhere
