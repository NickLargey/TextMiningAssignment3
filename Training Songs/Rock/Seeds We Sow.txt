Soldiers of fortune they do conceal
Everything they're afraid to show
Everything they once gave now they just steal
Oh, but the seeds we sow

Soldiers of fortune in paradise
Have to let ourselves let go
Running through our vein with water cold as ice
Oh, the seeds we sow

Ah, ta, ta, ta
Ah, ta, ta, ta

Sweet things, pretty things are dying
In the penny arcade of Edgar Allan Poe
Medicine men have all gone spying
Oh, the seeds we sow

Had a dream that you reached for me in the night
Touched me soft and slow
Everything was wrong but everything was right
Oh, the seeds we sow

Oh, ta, ta, ta
Oh, ta, ta, ta
Oh, ta, ta, ta
Oh, ta, ta, ta

Oh, oh, the seeds we sow
Oh, oh, the seeds we sow
Oh, oh, the seeds we sow
Oh, the seeds we sow
