Peace full, quiet as a mouse
Fireside, night at our house
Oh, all is well I say
Oh for another day
Oh for another day

Sleep, sleep, lady Elaine
See your, manger please stay
Oh silent world, so loud
Oh another field is plowed
Oh by your face in the crowd
Oh for another day
Oh for another day
