Get up early in the mornin'
Beat the clock, get out on the line
I'm part of the assembly
I'm just puttin' in time
There's only one thing in life
That helps me through
Just dreamin' of the weekends baby
And being with you
Just dreamin' of the weekends baby
And being with you

I'm gonna make it alright
From Monday mornin' to Friday night
I'm double shiftin' my time
Saving my money and waitin' in line
I'm gonna make it alright
From Monday mornin' to Friday night
I'm double shiftin' my time
Saving my money and waitin' in line

For The Weekend, I just can't wait
For The Weekend, I just can't wait

Woo

Get home late in the evenin'
I'm much too tired to move
Sick and tired of the late night people
I'm just not in the mood
There's only one thing in life
That helps me through
Dreamin' of the weekends baby
And being with you
Just dreamin' of the weekends baby
And being with you

I'm gonna make it alright
From Monday mornin' to Friday night
I'm double shiftin' my time
Saving my money and waitin' in line
I'm gonna make it alright
From Monday mornin' to Friday night
I'm double shiftin' my time
Saving my money and waitin' in line

For The Weekend, I just can't wait
For The Weekend, I just can't wait
