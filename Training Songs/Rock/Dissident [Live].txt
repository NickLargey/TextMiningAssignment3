She nursed him there, ooh, over a night
Wasn't so sure she wanted him to stay
What to say, what to say
But soon she was down, soon he was low

At a quarter past a holy no
She had to turn around

When she couldn't hold, oh, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here

And to this day, she's glided on
Always home but so far away
Like a word misplaced
Nothing to say, what a waste

When she had contact with the conflict
There was meanin', but she sold him to the state
She had to turn around

When she couldn't hold, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here, oh

She gave him away
When she couldn't hold, no, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here, oh

Couldn't hold on, she couldn't hold, no, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest place, oh
A dissident is here
