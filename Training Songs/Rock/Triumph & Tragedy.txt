All I want is the best for myself. Triumph over tragedy. The overwhelming power of death is there just to inspire. Translation, life is different ways of not dying. My Relationship with reality, it comes and goes. We rarely see eye to eye. She's disappointed when I try, and upset when I don't. Her smell lingers in my sheets, and in my shirts. It teases my memories, from time to time. And from time to time, I cradle desire into slumbering fantasies.
