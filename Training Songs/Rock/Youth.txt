don´t be mislead, ´cause all the others say...
you´re insane, for beeing different!
you´ve gotta stick to yourself and what you stand for...
´cause when you show em the truth they´ll understand more of what you want and who
you really are...
´cause we´re no different!
"i can feel it!...can you feel it too?"

´cause its our youth
and you´re in it too
and that´s (this is) all we do,
so let´s celebrate it!

don´t break away, from all you ever felt,
you´re not insane, whatever they say...
you´ve gotta rip it apart if it hurts you,
listen to your heart it deserves to be all you trust
and all you really are...
´cause we´re no different!
"i can feel it!....can you feel it too?"

´cause its or youth
and you´re in it too
and that´s (this is) all we do,
so lets celebrate it!!

now i know these words sound so much like you´ve heard em before and you can´t stand
it...
it´s all that "you and me and the ´world´ thing" you can´t handle..."you decided to
have it your way but please let me have mine!" god, i must have heard that line a
hundret-million times!!
you want to drown in your sorrow "poor little me" you don´t care about "tomorrow"
please excuse me (?) how fucked (messed) up can you be, emotionally, not to feel
what we´re in this for?!
not to see what we´re in this for!!!??!!!

´cause its or youth..
and you´re in it too..
and that´s (this is) all we do,
so lets celebrate it!!
