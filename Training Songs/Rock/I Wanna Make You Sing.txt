I’m standing here
Next to you
Wondering if
This time I might pass
As something else, something more
Not a friend
I’m not your friend

I wanna make you sing
I’ll tell you everything
If I can make you sing
I’d give anything
Just to hear you sing
I wanna make you sing
I wanna make you sing

I’m so sorry
I made you worry
I wasn’t sane
I acted like a mad man
But I couldn’t stand
Your proposition
Let us just be friends
I’m not your friend

But I’m not that lucky
I’m never that lucky
