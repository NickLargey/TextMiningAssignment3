Ever since you have gone the days don't seem so bright
And I wish I could forget you but I can't
Ever since you have gone I haven't felt quite right
And I promised I forget all that you meant
But now that I'm alone I can't stop my self from thinking
I can't stop myself from breaking promises I've made to myself
Babe, you must believe
I have promised myself I wouldn't dream of you
But I find that awful hard sometimes to do
I have promised myself I wouldn't think of you
But I find that just as hard you know it's true
Because when I'm alone I can't stop my self from thinking

I can't stop myself from breaking promises I've made to myself
Babe, you must believe
I have promised myself I wouldn't think of you
But I find that awful hard sometimes to do
I have promised myself I wouldn't dream of you
But I find that just as hard you know it's true
Because when I'm alone I can't stop my self from thinking
I can't stop myself from breaking promises I've made to myself
Babe, you must believe
I need to see you in the morning, feel your arms around me at night
