Don't hide your heart behind the wall
Don't walk alone in grey and dark nights
Look to the sky and you'll be allright
There is a sun for you to shine
Lookat yourself, what do you see?
A childhood fear to be alone, maybe a heart
Without a home, but someone's waiting there for you.

Morning sky let me touch your golden sunlight
Let me dream away the dark night, let me ride
Your silver cloud, morningsky promise me you
Live tomorrow push away my pain and sorrow
In God's golden morning sky.

Be like a river wide and strong, don't be afraid
To trust a friend, so let your life be like a song
Sing with a feeling in your heart.

Morning sky let me touch golden sunlight........
