Saw her out last night on the town
A makeshift alibi under her sleeve
I can't take this anymore
Don't know what I love her for
I'm gonna lock away my heart this time

But if you see her
Tell her you're a friend of mine
Oh, promise me you will

Tell her to send a little love my way
Send a little love my way
'Cause I know she'll come back to me
And it will be like always, like always

Treat me like the kid with the clues
Why she is as cold as she can be
When you never tell a lie
Even when it makes her cry
That's the choice I made so now you see

That I can't wait
So if you are a friend of mine
Tell her I'm to blame

Tell her, tell her
To send a little love my way
Send a little love my way
'Cause I know she'll come back to me
And it will be like always, like always

Tell her I'm to blame
Oh, promise me you will
Send a little love my way
Send a little love my way
Send a little luck my way
