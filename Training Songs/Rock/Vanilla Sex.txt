Don't ever take away from me my pornography
We obviously don't agree on what's obscene
I have the right to choose what I
Want to see and read

Don't try to take away from me
My right to privacy what I
Do is no one's business but me

So stay in your missionary position
I hope that you get bored to death
There's no way I'm going through life
Having vanilla sex

The government's trying to get in
Your bedroom you better lock your
Door and close your shades because
There could be someone watching you today

Why do you try to make things illegal
Why do we have to be twenty one
Are you afraid that people are having
Too much fun
Why do you care what I do in my bedroom
Why do you want to know how I screw
It seems to me you've got nothing better
To do.
