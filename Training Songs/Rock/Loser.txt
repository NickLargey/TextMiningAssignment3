Now I know you don't love me baby
I'm just trying to find a friend

Darling, don't deny cause you're a beauty
In everybody's eyes
I'm in the gutter
You're in the skies
Shining like a star

Baby, don't be cruel
'Cause if you're dreaming
Into loving you
My poor heart would surely break in two
And these tears I can't take it

Don't think I'm stupid
But I don't understand
Why you're talking to me
And holding my hand

What you want with a loser like me
'Cause I'm so confused
Look at any other man and you'll see
And I was born to lose
This is reality
'Cause I ain't even been to shine my shoes
I'm just a loser with the blues

Darling, think again
'Cause you don't love me
You're just trying to find a friend
Your on the rebound
And this has got to end
So save yourself please

When I see you smiling
And laughing on the wind
Well I'll be here crying
You'll hear me someday

What you want with a loser like me
When the worlds in your hands
I didn't hold you on me
I'm just running out of plans
Guess there's nothing I can say
Now I'll make you try and understand

What you want with a loser like me
'Cause I'm so confused
Look at any other man and you'll see
And I was born to lose
This is reality
Just a loser with the blues

What you want with a loser like me
When the worlds in your hands
I didn't hold you on me
I'm just running out of plans
Guess there's nothing I can say
Now I'll make you try and understand

I'm just a loser in a band
Just a loser in a band
