I don't have a problem in staking a claim 
While all the time you change the signs 
Give us the right means to run on it's own steam 
Finding the time you change the signs 

Gotta run on time 
Change this old mind 
What a life to find 
I don't remember being a face on your wall 
For all your sins 
You do it with a smile and a grin
