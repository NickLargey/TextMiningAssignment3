You turn the radio on
Play your favorite song and cry (Cry)
You let it all disappear
Push back the doubt and fear they try (Try)

To hold your head under the waves
But you’re breathing all the same
You are stronger than their hate

Time for you to walk out walk in your own shoes
Lay down your footprints wherever you choose
Leave it all behind and move on you are your own woman

You never asked for trouble
But you’ve got fire that burns so bright (Bright)
You turn and face the struggle
When all the others turn and hide (Hide)

You hold your head above the waves
Above the war they try to wage
You are stronger than their hate

Time for you to walk out walk in your own shoes
Lay down your footprints wherever you choose
Leave it all behind and move on ’cause you are your own woman

Ooh ah yeah
Ooh ah yeah
Ooh ah yeah

Time for you to walk out walk in your own shoes
Lay down your footprints wherever you choose
Leave it all behind and move on
You are your own woman
Move on yeah
Time for you to walk out walk in your own shoes
Lay down your footprints wherever you choose
Say what’s on your mind with pride
‘Cause you are your own woman

(Ooh ah yeah) You’ve got a light that always guides you
(Ooh ah yeah) You speak of hope and change as something good
(Ooh ah yeah) Live your truth and know you’re not alone

You turn the radio on
Play your favorite song and sing out so loud
