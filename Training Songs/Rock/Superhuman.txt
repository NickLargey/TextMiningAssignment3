You wanna touch the sky
You want the stars to shine your name, yeah
You wish the world would stop when you get in the mood
But only God can do that

You got nothing to lose and everything to prove
Wanna climb to the top till you get to the clouds
You can't do that for crying out loud

If you wanna fly away
I'd give you wings today if I could
I'd stop the rain, take all the pain away
I'd do all I can but I ain't superhuman

If I can't help you out
And you can't help yourself, yourself, no
Then what's it all about, does it mean anything?
Should we be living like that

You've got something to say but nobody hears
So you talk in your sleep like a runaway train
Without a dream, you'd be going insane

If you wanna fly away
I'd give you wings today if I could
I'd stop the rain, take all the pain away
I'd do all I can but I ain't superhuman

For only a moment
If only for a day, you could go crazy
Then all of the world would be following you
Doing the things that you want them to

If you wanna fly away
I'd give you wings today if I could
I'd stop the rain, take all the pain away
I'd do all I can but I ain't superhuman
I'd do all I can but I ain't superhuman
Yeah, I'd do all I can but I ain't superhuman

If you wanna fly away
I'd do all I can but I ain't superhuman
Yeah, I'd do all I can but I ain't superhuman
