She calls and send you, stuff you letters
Yeah you can sweet talk all you like
But pretty word don?t make it better, you let the fire burn all night
Yeah all night
The front door was open, I left the keys in
Guess I?ve been lucky all my life 
Now she?s so fed up with my easiness, I won?t get any tonight 

I don?t know why I gave my love away
Shure don?t know why you took the bate 
Maybe the balance seem to sudden a bit more than it did to hating me
I apologize for everything, for all the times I?ve done you wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
But I gathered all my dreams around you, 
Hope you?ll put ?em with your own, where they belohohong

(chorus)
Okay, okay, okay my lovely
I?ll always look for other ways to say, to say, to say your lovely
I?ll always look for better ways to say that I love you anyway
Ooh I love you anayway
Whoa

(chorus)
So I say, okay, okay, okay my lovely
I?ll always look for other ways to say, to say, to say your lovely
I?ll always look for better ways to say that I love you anyway
Oohhhhh I love you anayway

I love you anyway..
