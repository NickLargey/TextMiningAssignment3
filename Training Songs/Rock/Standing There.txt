Hey creepo's
I'm talking to you
I've got a message
To give to you
You've got a problem
We know
But there is something
You ought to know
Standing there
Across the thoroughfare
They stand and stare
With that gormless air
So funny to see how dumb some grown men can be
An unwanted weed
A dying reed
Left to consider life
As it passes by
Ignoring your calling
Ignoring your taunting
Ignoring you feelings
Of self-hate and loathing
How empty and pointless your life must seem
See them standing
See them staring
See them wearing that same stupid face
Sticks and stones
May break bones
But these taunting crones
Only cause inner groans
We ignore all your calling
Ignore all your taunting
Ignore all your problems of
Self-hate and loathing
Some body should show them where to go
See them standing
See them staring
See them wearing that same creepy face
Standing there
Across the thoroughfare
They stand and stare
With that gormless air
Does what you won't understand scare and make you mad?
Resentful and envious, don't you disgust yourself?
So funny to see how pathetic some men can be.
See them standing
See them staring
See them wearing that same stupid face
Ignore all their calling
Ignore all their taunting
Ignore all their faking
Their self-hate and loathing
Some body should show them where to go
