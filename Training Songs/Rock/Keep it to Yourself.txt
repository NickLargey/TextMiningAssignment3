I've been sleeping on my own
Ever since you've been away
You've been moving all around
You came home today
Well maybe you've been with someone
You met after the show
Keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself
Baby I don't want to know
If you're guilty in your heart
Just try and hold your tongue
If you want to let it out
Baby save it for a song
I don't want your honesty
Or descriptions blow by blow

Keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself
Baby I don't want to know
Look around you; we're living in amazing times
They're not so important - your little crimes
I've been sleeping on my own
But I don't sleep all of the time
Twenty-four hours in one day
And sleeping's only nine
There are many places in the sun
And many corners without you
Keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself
And I'll keep my secrets too
