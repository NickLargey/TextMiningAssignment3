Separated and negated, it seems fated
We have to find out more
Do you want me? Tell me properly
Or just stop me, it’s you that I adore

I can’t wait for another second minute or hour
I can’t wait, it’s all your choice, it’s in your power
I can’t wait for another second minute or hour
I can’t wait, it’s all your choice, it’s in your power

I lost my head when I found my heart
But now with neither I’ve fallen all apart
With this voice and chord I’ll tell you from the start
She never wanted me, she never wanted me

I act stupid due to Cupid
My love's rooted, you'll have to dig down deep
Mixed emotion, fixed devotion
Your magic potion you sprinkle as I sleep

I can’t wait for another second, minute or hour
I can’t wait, it's all your choice, it's in your power
I can’t wait for another second, minute or hour
I can’t wait, it’s all your choice, it’s in your power

I lost my head when I found my heart
But now with neither I’ve fallen all apart
With this voice and chord I’ll tell you from the start
She never wanted me, she never wanted me
She never wanted me

With you I can't imagine being alone
Without you I can't see how much I’ve grown
'Coz you made me what I am today
Have you gave me all that I can take

I lost my head when I found my heart
But now with neither I’m falling all apart
With this voice and chord I’ll tell you from the start
She never wanted me, she never wanted me
She never wanted me, she never wanted me
