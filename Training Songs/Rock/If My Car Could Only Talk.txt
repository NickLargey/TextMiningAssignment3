She met me at the station 'cause I'm coming home on my leave 
I let her use my XKE so she could drive around & think of me 
Baby I'm home, you look surprised, I see it on your face 
Where's the old crowd? Do they still hang out at the pizza place? 
A flash of suspicion, you learned a new way of kissin' 

(Watch your step, Sarah Jane, I'll catch you yet) Sarah Jane 
(Watch your step Sarah Jane I'll catch you yet) 
Sarah Jane, if my car could only talk to me 
If my car could only talk to me 
It would tell me Ã¢??bout you baby 
(Where you are, baby) 

When I cleaned my car I found pictures from the penny arcade 
In my ashtray 
Underneath the seat I found a cigarette lighter 
Engraved "Love, your baby Sarah Jane" 
Since I've been home, I found evidence of a love affair 
Tickets to the drive-in show; a fool but once, this I swear 
Don't make excuses & cry; I can't stand girls who lie 

(These eyes, these eyes, these eyes these eyes) 

So it's back to red, white & blue 
I spent my leave finding out that we were through 
Breakin' up is so hard to do 
Walk away before I start crying too 
Baby, I'm gone
