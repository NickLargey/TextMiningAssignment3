We're passengers in time lost in motion
Locked together day and night by trick of light
I must take another journey
We must meet with other names
Oo, we must meet with other names
 
You touched my heart so deeply
You rescued me, now free me
Don't watch me cry, just see me go
I'll take away the strongest feelings you will ever know
There will be no more isolation in our secret separation
You touched my heart so deeply, you rescued me
Now free me
 
We're passengers in time lost in motion
Locked together day and night by trick of light
I must take another journey
We must meet with other names
Oo, if only you and I be brave
 
You touched my heart so deeply
You rescued me, now free me
Don't watch me cry, just see me go
I'll take away the strongest feelings you will ever know
There will be no more isolation in our secret separation
You touched my heart so deeply, you rescued me
Now free me
 
We are matching spark and flame, caught in endless repetition
Life for life, we'll be the same
I must leave before you burn me
I'm the stranger who deserts you, only to love you in another life

There will be no more isolation in our secret separation
You touched my heart so deeply, you rescued me
Now free me
I'll bear one precious scar that only you will know again
We're passengers in time, free me
I'll bear one precious scar that only you will know again
We're passengers in time, free me
I'll bear one precious scar that only you will know again
We're passengers in time, free me
