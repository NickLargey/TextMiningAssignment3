When in motion 
While it's frozen
Talks in circles
And Greek

He's into epiphany
He's into philosophy
He's into methyl amphetamines
He's into science
But he's lost his way

Oh oh
He is not the real me
But I can hear I can hear I can hear I can hear him
From my future
Show show show show me
Show show show show me
 
You got to show me the way

You got to show me the way
Oh the present
A super impulse
He has seen this
Before

He's into conspiracy
He's into the?
He's into phenomenology 
He's into deeds
He don't mix his words

Oh oh
He is not the real me

But I can hear I can hear I can hear I can hear him
From my future

Show show show show me 
Show show show show me
You gotta show me the way
