I wanna be,
I wanna be wherever you are,
I was around,
I was around from the start,
I've got you in my sights,
I want you there, the rest of tonight,
And I'll say

Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
No.
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
No.

I'll tie myself,
I'll tie myself all into knots
I guess we're lost,
Yeah I felt so lost in my own skin,
It might take a sign, it might take faith,
The things we build, they'll never break,
There are some nights, where the world's apart,
Not this time, no goodbye's

Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
No.
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?

We're the wild ones,
We're the wild ones,
When you go there's no wondering round,
It's me, myself,
We're the wild ones,
We're the wild ones,
When you go there's no wondering round,
It's me, myself and I

You and I will go so far,
You and I will light the dark,
You're the better half of me,
You're the only half I need,

Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
No.
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
No.

Yeah, we're the wild ones,
We're the wild ones,
When you go there's no wondering round,
It's me, myself,
We're the wild ones,
We're the wild ones,
When you go there's no wondering round,
It's me myself and I

Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
Are we gonna live forever?
