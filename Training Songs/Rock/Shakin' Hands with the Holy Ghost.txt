Spend the night like wide open
I ain't got nowhere to go
Yeah my baby's out and mad at me
Yeah she tearing up the floor

We got the Tennessee champaign
And the moon just fine
And my Johnson said it baby
Yeah she helps me draw the line

As the crow flies baby
Gonna get me apart time
Gonna light me up here
Like the 4th of July

Everybody knows, baby take it slow
Feel just like I'm singing
With the heavenly host
Everybody said,everybody knows
Just like shaking hands 
With the Holy Ghost

She got the stuff that I need
Keeps me coming back for more
I ain't never gonna break away
Got a humpkin me for sure

As the crow flies baby
Gonna get me apart time
Gonna light me up here
Like the 4th of July

Everybody knows, baby take it slow
Feel just like I'm singing
With the heavenly host
Everybody said,everybody knows
Just like shaking hands 
With the Holy Ghost
Alright,mhm yeah

Everybody knows, baby take it slow
Feel just like I'm singing
With the heavenly host
Everybody said,everybody knows
Just like shaking hands 
With the Holy Ghost

Everybody knows, baby take it slow
Feel just like I'm singing
With the heavenly host
Everybody said,everybody knows
Just like shaking hands 
With the Holy Ghost
