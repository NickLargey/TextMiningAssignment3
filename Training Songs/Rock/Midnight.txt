Looking back at the fun we had
I hadn't left you yet
I'm still too young on a road too long
What did you expect?
Don't make excuses, I'm the lucky one
I was the one to save
You helped me carry on

It was midnight when I saw him
Standing with the look I've seen
I never forget the way that it touched me
Maybe this is what I need

This was never a great romance
And you were too expert
I didn't give it a second chance
I wasn't at my best
There's no excuses
I know that I wasn't wrong
Cause you know it from of me
I know that you're the one

It was midnight when I saw him
Standing with the look I've seen
I never forget the way that it touched me
Maybe this is was what I need

You say you don't love me
You say you don't want me
You tell me you don't wanna know
What's going on with me

It was midnight when I saw him
Standing with the look I've seen
I never forget the way that it touched me
Maybe this is what I need
It was midnight when I saw him
Standing with the look I've seen
I never forget the way that it touched me
Maybe this is what I need
