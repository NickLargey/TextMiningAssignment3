Everybody knows a little bit of something
Everybody's got the time to make it last
Even if tomorrow's looking like a day dream
It ain't enough to slowly watch it pass, oh yeah

'Cause you will have your day in the sun
You will have your day in the sun
Your day will come, your day will come

Now your life is moving in a strong direction
And your eyes are getting clearer by the day
You ain't an angel but I know you ain't no felon
And it's good to see you getting on your way and I say

That you will have your day in the sun
You will have your day in the sun
And when your road is finally run
Your day will come, your day will come

Now speak up loud above this crowd
So I can hear your story
Tell me all about the road
Of your misguided glory

So now I'm gonna speak to you in just a whisper
And I'll try to show you all the world in just one glance
Even though tomorrow seems like such a long time
Come down and give yourself another chance, oh yeah

'Cause you will have your day in the sun
You will have your day in the sun
You will have your day in the sun
You will have your day in the sun

Your day will come, your day will come
Your day will come, I know your day will come
It's gonna come
