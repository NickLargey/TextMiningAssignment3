Trying to tear me apart
Breaking me down to the bone
So listen closely, 'cause what you don't see
Is there's still blood inside this bleeding heart.

Still beating, still breathing
Falling from grace, you laugh in my face
But you are the one who will leave with the beating

With bleeding hands I fight for a life that's beat me down
Stand up and scream while the rest of the won't make a sound

Rising again from the fire
A Phoenix alive and inspired
You can't erase me, won't phase me
No one hears a fucking word you say

Still beating, still breathing
Falling from grace, you laugh in my face
But you are the one who will leave with the beating

With bleeding hands I fight for a life that's beat me down
Stand up and scream while the rest of the won't make a sound

With bleeding hands I fight with the pride left in me now
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won't make a sound

Stand and scream
Stand and scream
Stand and scream
Stand and scream

With bleeding hands I fight for a life that's beat me down
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won't make a sound

With bleeding hands I fight with the pride left in me now
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won't make a sound

With bleeding hands (stand and scream)
These bleeding hands (stand and scream)
We stand up and scream while the rest of the world won't make a sound
