Why are we trapped here in the dark so long?
It's so wet and dark and cold
We've done everything you told us to do
We've done everything you told us to do
Are we going to have to suffer forever?
Why are we trapped here in the dark so long?
We've done everything you told us to do
We've done everything you told us to do
We don't belong here
We were meant to sing
Let us out
Let us

We're drowning in quicksand
We're freezing in the water
We hallucinate in the darkness
We're praying for deliverance
We've done everything you told us to do
We've done everything you told us to do
We don't belong here
We want to go out and play
We don't belong here
We were meant to sing
Let us out
Let us out
