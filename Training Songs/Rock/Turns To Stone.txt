A thousand miles underneath my emotions
Hidden from the eyes of everyone
No one must know
All the secrets if my soul anymore
No never again

Girl you've got the only key
To open up the door only you
Eventually, even that could change

[Chorus]
I will wait for you
But I don't want to wait forever
Cause I'm on my own
I'm trying to keep the fire from getting cold
I will wait for you
But I don't want to wait
Until our love turns to stone

I don't want to turn to stone

I don't want to spend another night without you
I'm afraid my mind will start to wander
Time between us,
Hours turning into days, into years
Oh, oh, oh
Looking back at what went wrong
Some things we must let you
Eventually, something's got to give

[Chorus]

I don't want to turn to stone

[Chorus]
