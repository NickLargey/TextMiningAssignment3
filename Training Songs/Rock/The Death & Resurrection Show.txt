Mark out the points, build the pyre
Assemble different drummers, light up the fire
Put on your masks and animal skins
Illumination, illumination

Listen to the drums
Between each beat, each beat of the drum
Oh beloved mother of liberty
Hold me in your arms

Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat
Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat

And the day will come before the lights go out
Who will you turn to, who will you turn to
Choose the crucifixion or Osiris slain
Recurring themes, time again

Illumination, illumination
Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat

Oh, how ingenious the centuries of lies
Ezekiel?s chariots streak across the skies
Holy books and history texts forget because we know
Souls are recycled in the death and resurrection show
Oh beloved mother of liberty, come to me

Everything I'm taught, amounts to not
Everything I learn, the fire shall burn
Notions of myself that I'm not
Whoever I was is now lost

Illumination, illumination
Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat

Oh, how ingenious the centuries of lies
Ezekiel?s chariots streak across the skies
Holy books and history texts forget because we know
Souls are recycled in the death and resurrection show

Oh, beloved woman of liberty, come to me
Burn away all my impurities
Hold me in your arms

Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat
Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat

Oh, how ingenious the centuries of lies
Ezekiel?s chariots streak across the skies
Holy books and history texts forget because we know
Souls are recycled in the death and resurrection show

Oh, beloved woman of liberty
Hold me in your arms
