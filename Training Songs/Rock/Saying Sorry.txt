These colors will not change
You change the way I see them
These words will fade
Can you explain
Why you hate them
We are the same

She keeps repeating
All that she needed
She said she's right here
She seems so distant

Saying goodbye, this time
The same old story
Seeing you cry
Makes me feel like saying sorry

Just a few last hours
We gotta make this count
(we gotta make this count)
We're counting backwards
Just a few last hours
We gotta make this count
We're falling forwards

She keeps repeating
All that she needed
She said she's right here
She seems so distant

Saying goodbye, this time
The same old story
Seeing you cry
Makes me feel like saying sorry

Saying goodbye, this time
The same old story
Seeing you cry
Makes me feel like saying sorry

Saying sorry we're falling apart
Wish we knew this from the start
Saying goodbye's the hardest part
Wish we knew this from the start

Saying goodbye, this time
The same old story
Seeing you cry
Makes me feel like saying sorry

Saying goodbye, this time
The same old story
Seeing you cry
Makes me feel like saying sorry
