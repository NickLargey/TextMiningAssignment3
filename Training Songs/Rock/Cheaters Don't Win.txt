Well, everything you gave me
I’m giving back to you
And that’s what’s going to save me
and maybe save you too
and if to you that’s heavy
Well, say, you may be right
The dope that you been giving me
Just ran out tonight
The least that I could do for you
Is what you did for me and give some (givin’ you, givin’ you some)
Of your own (givin’ you, givin’ you some)
Medicine
And give some (givin’ you, you some)
Of your own (givin’ you, you some)
Medicine (watch out, for cheaters don’t win)

(Watch out, for cheaters don’ win)
(Watch out, for cheaters don’ win)
(Watch out, for cheaters don’ win)

I hope that you can take it (Watch out, for cheaters don’ win)
But I’m sure you can (Watch out, for cheaters don’ win)
And I’ll be sure to make it (Watch out, for cheaters don’ win)
As easy as I can (Watch out, for cheaters don’ win)
The mess you made out of my head (Watch out, for cheaters don’ win)
Needs some company (Watch out, for cheaters don’ win)
The least that I could do for you (Watch out, for cheaters don’ win)
Is what you did for me and give some (givin’ you, givin’ you some)
Of your own (givin’ you, givin’ you some)
Medicine (Watch out, for cheaters don’t win, watch out for cheaters don't win)
And give some (givin’ you, givin' you some)
Of your own (givin’ you, givin' you some)
Medicine (watch out, for cheaters don’t win)

Don’t come in a bottle, d-d-don’t come in a can
How you get it don’t really matter, don’t really give a damn
