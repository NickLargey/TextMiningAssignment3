A cigarette fills an empty room
Smell of heartbreaks and cheap perfume
Photos scattered across my wall
Maybe someday I'll take them off, but I miss you
Yeah, I still miss you

Yeah!
In the middle of the night
When I feel you by my side
Well it's nothing but a memory
What if we never said goodbye
If I never made you cry
Baby this is killing me
So love me bad, love me bad
Yeah love me bad again

All those words I never said
On my lips taste like regret
Promises like fake tattoos
After all that we've been through
Well I miss you
Yeah, I still miss you

Yeah!
In the middle of the night
When I feel you by my side
Well it's nothing but a memory
What if we never said goodbye
If I never made you cry
Baby this is killing me
So love me bad, love me bad
Yeah love me bad again
and again, and again and again and again
Again and again and again and again

Love me bad, love me bad, love me bad

In the middle of the night
When I feel you by my side
Well it's nothing but a memory
What if we never said goodbye
If I never made you cry
Baby this is killing me
So love me bad, love me bad
Yeah love me bad again
So love me bad, love me bad
Yeah love me bad again, and again, and again
