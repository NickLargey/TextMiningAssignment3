I was sick of restrictions, sick of the boundaries, about to close the door
Such a lack of conviction, no real connection, what should I settle for?
But you caught my attention, you built on the tension, and you left me wanting more
Now I don't know what to do with myself, do with myself
I don't want nobody else

I let you in, I let you in and you infected me
Can't get enough of you, Can't get enough of you
I breathed you in, I breathed you in and now I'm in too deep
Don't think I'm pulling through, Don't think I'm pulling through
Can't get enough of you, Can't get enough of you

You're so contagious
Running through my veins you're so contagious
Hanging onto every word you're so contagious
And I can't get away
You're so contagious and now I know for sure there is no cure

I saw your intentions, i gave you permission, go ahead and start the war
I was out of addictions, by my own admission, oh I've been keeping score
But you made an exception you taught me a lesson
Who cares where I've been before?
You would never leave me all by myself, all by myself
You don't want nobody else

I let you in, I let you in and you infected me
Can't get enough of you, Can't get enough of you
I breathed you in, I breathed you in and now I'm in too deep
Don't think I'm pulling through, Don't think I'm pulling through
Can't get enough of you, Can't get enough of you

You're so contagious
Running through my veins you're so contagious
Hanging onto every word you're so contagious
And I can't get away
You're so contagious and now I know for sure there is no cure

And I am burning in your fire (There is no cure)
And I have only one desire (There is no cure)
(Now I don't know what to do with myself, do with myself)
I can not deny her (There is no cure)

Now I don't know what to with myself, do with myself
I don't want nobody else

I let you in, I let you in and you infected me
Can't get enough of you, Can't get enough of you
I breathed you in, I breathed you in and now I'm in too deep
Don't think I'm pulling through, Don't think I'm pulling through
Can't get enough of you, Can't get enough of you, Can't get enough of you

You're so contagious
Running through my veins you're so contagious
Hanging onto every word you're so contagious
And I can't get away
You're so contagious and now I know for sure there is no cure

You keep running, you keep running, you keep running through my veins
You keep running, you keep running, you keep running through my veins
You keep running, you keep running, you keep running through my veins
You keep running, you keep running, you keep running through my veins
