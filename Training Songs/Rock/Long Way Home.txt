Father
Give me just a sign
That I'll survive how can I stay alive
When guns shoot fire

People
I can feel the hate behind their eyes
Insanity rules my life
Got no tomorrow

It's such a long long way from home
And in my heart I can't go on
Lost on this battlefield of hope
I feel so lonely
It's such a long way from home
My bleeding heart
Can't take no more
Another day of war
That's waiting on my way

Darling
There's so much pain
I keep inside
I couldn't believe my eyes
The sky's are burning
Help me
Understand this fight
For wrong or right
What dots it matter now
The world is dying

It's such a long long way from home
And in my heart I can't go on
Lost on this battlefield of hope
I feel so lonely
It's such a long long way from home
My bleeding heart
Can't take no more
Another day of war
That's waiting on my way

It's such a long long way from home
And in my heart I can't go on
Lost on this battlefield of hope
I feel so lonely
It's such a long long way from home
My bleeding heart
Can't take no more
Another day of war
That's waiting on my way
