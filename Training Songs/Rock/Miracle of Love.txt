Days are growing shorter the night is closing in,
Time is so much older and hope is getting thin.

We seem quite content believing nothing can go wrong so we go on,we go on.
Lost in some euphoria we dream our lives away. Certain thattomorrow will be better than today.
We seem quite content to do exactly as we please. Let it set ourminds at ease and we go on.
So we look to the Miracle of Love,
So we look to the Miracle of Love.

Truth is our deception and pleasure is our friend. Just aroundthe rainbow lies a treasure at it?s end.
Could it be that what we seek is all with in our hands? Only no one understands and we go on.
So we look to the Miracle of Love,
So we look to the Miracle of Love.

Panic screams for order but no one hears the cry.
Film is on the water, Hate is in the sky.

Organized confusion is working out it?s plan.
Though we try to stop it, it spreads throughout the land.

(guitar solo)
And we who understand it all do nothing more than say, that thereis no othere way and we go on.
Will we look to the Miracle of Love?
Still we look to the miracle of Love.

Will we look to the Miracle of Love?
Still we look to the miracle of Love.

Will we look to the Miracle of Love?
Still we look to the miracle of Love.

Will we look to the Miracle of Love?
Still we look to the miracle of Love.

Will we look to the Miracle of Love?
Still we look to the miracle of Love.
