Watch another day go drifting over
It really doesn't matter anymore
'Long as I keep slipping down my medicine
Gonna be a superstar for sure
You are superstar
You are star
You are superstar
The world's alright with me
Just for today
The people down on Picton Street already are superstar
You can see it subtle in their eyes
The music of the traffic is a gentle symphony
'Long as you are by my side
You are superstar
You are star
You are superstar
You know you are
You are, you are, you are
Star
Star
Star
And the world's alright with me 
Just for today
Oh
Thankyou for the coming up each morning
Thankyou for the taking down each night
Thankyou for the inside and the outside
I thank you from the bottom of my heart
From like the bottom of my heart
You are superstar
You are star
You are superstar
You know you are
You are, you are, you are
Star
Star
Star
Star
You are superstar
