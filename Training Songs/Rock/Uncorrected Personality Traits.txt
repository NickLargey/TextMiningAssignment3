Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to
Be ugly in a fully grown adult.

Lack of involvement with the father, or over-involvement with the mother,
Can result in lack of ability to relate to sexual fears, and in homosexual
Leanings, narcissism, transexuality 
(Girls from the waist up, men from the waist down), 
Attempts to be your own love object. 

Reconcile your parents to you by becoming both at once!
Even Marilyn Monroe was a man, but this tends to get overlooked by our
Mother-fixated, overweight, sexist media.

So,
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to
Be ugly in a fully grown adult.

If you give in to them
Every time they cry
They will become little tyrants
But they won't remember why
Then when they are thwarted
By people in later life
They will become psychotic
And they won't make an ideal husband or wife
The spoiled baby grows into
The escapist teenager who's
The adult alcoholic who's
The middle-aged suicide (Oy)

So,
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to
Be ugly in a fully grown adult.
