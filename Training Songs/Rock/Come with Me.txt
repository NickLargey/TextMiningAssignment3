We're acting like a pair of stranger's
Afraid of what to say
Just throw away your inner visions
Cash your doubt away
Stop holding back from same exactly
What it is you need
I can take away your hunger
Satisfy your greed
Oehhhhhh
Hold on tight
Let's do what we do
Here all night
Come with me
Any close to my heart 
want to feel you nice and warm
Locked inside in of arms
Got me running like the ways 
On the eye of the storm
Come with me 
Come with me
Any close to my heart 
Love to feel you every time we're together as one
Only you can make the way 
That you move me so strong
Come with me 
The moods goes like the fallen inning, 
There is no escape
But I feel safe inside here with you, 
Shelted from the rain
Oehhhhhh 
Hold on tight
Let's do what we do
Here all night
Come with me; any close to my heart
want to feel you nice and warm
Locked inside in of arms
Got me running like the ways on the eye of the storm
Come with me 
Come with me 
Any close to my heart
Love to feel you every time we're together as one 
Only you can make the way that you move me so strong 
Come with me 
Deep inside me 
I feel that were both connecting nowâ?¦ 
Heyyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah (3x) 
Come with me 
want to feel you nice 
And warm locked inside my arms 
Come with me
