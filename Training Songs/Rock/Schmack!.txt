It's the same old guys
In the same old house
Lying around doing nothing
On the same old couch
Oh no not another day doing nothing
The only thing we get is the TV lovin'
Then it happened our boy had an idea
Put this ad in the paper
And see what would appear
Boredom's the matter with me
I want to fight it
You wash the dishes baby
I'll do the dryin'
Then it happened boy
Then it happened boy
Then it happened boy
The ad was pretty simple and this is how it read
Female flatmate wanted
Beautifully fully furnished water front views
Female flatmate wanted
Deluxe apartment would you like to move
Female flatmate wanted
Ring the number provided and come on over
If you're pretty come on
If you're pretty come on
If you're pretty
Well they got so many calls that the lines were jammed
So many girls' numbers 
They had too much on their hands
When they turned up they knew they would survive
Beautiful women turning up
Four or five at a time
When they left their gave their name and number
And said don't forget to call you gotta remember
This went down in history
As the slickest and biggest girls you've ever seen
Boredom's the matter with me
I want to fight it
You was the dishes baby
I'll do the drying
On the weekend
The weekend
Weekend
