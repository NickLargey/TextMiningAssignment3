And the classic way is still on play
Violins bitter sweet
String quartet, pass around the hat
You broke my heart, don't you hurt my head
After Violet and me, saw the Paganini movie
We took a walk around the block to digest
The grand finale
A street-music man with shades and cane
Played the fiddler insane
For a case load of spare change
And the smiles of people passing
Between morning paper sins and waves of violins
It said they found him dead
His bow had made him bad friends
Cold blooded, warm hearted violin
Hooked on high speed energy
Cold blooded, warm hearted violin
Cats gut pumpin' adrenalin
Warm blooded, cold hearted violins
See 'm live tonight in the city
And the classic way, still on play
Violins bitter sweet
String quartet, pass around the hat
You broke my heart, don't you hurt my head
I've gotta find a little peace of mind
Cause the real thing is a mean thing
I guess nobody knew, the Barcelona Zoo
Has an albino monkey, that can trigger the mood
And provoke monkey motions
So when the shit flies high
Through the Barcelona sky
The crowd stands by, a cheering
Cold blooded, warm hearted violin
Hooked on high speed energy
Cold blooded, warm hearted violin
Cats gut pumpin' adrenalin
Warm blooded, cold hearted violins
See them lives tonight in the cityI can hear 'm playin'
Kind a light 'n neat
All the gals 're swayin'
The guys are in for meat
It's all cute 'n rosy
Till the needle hits a crack
Listen to that screech repeatin'
Watch the flags go slack
Listen to that screech repeatin'
Watch the flags go slack
