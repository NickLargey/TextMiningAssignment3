I can't give you stars that shine
Or the moon above
All I have to offer you
Is a true, true love

A true, true love
That grows and grows forever and a day
Not like the rose
That only grows awhile, then fades away

Tomorrow’s true, true love
Will be more than it is today
Tomorrow’s true, true love
Will be more than it is today
