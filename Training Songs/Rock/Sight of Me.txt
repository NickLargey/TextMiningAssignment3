See all the people want in my eyes 
They all seem to want to share my light 

I'm gonna be there when your soul comes down 
I see you running on your own intentions 

Have you seen the sight of me 
I won't be there when you run out of changes 

Look into your life what's on tonight 
Dressed up in fame you're gonna see the sights 

I'm gonna be there when you're soul comes down 
I see you running on your own intentions
