Last night 
When the moon was new
I couldn't sleep 
I was thinking of you
And how much I need ya

How bout that?

I act like like I'm tougher than steel
With a heart like stone
But ya know it ain't real
I really need you baby

How bout that?

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, how bout that?

I used to spend my life on the town
It took your loving to turn me around
I'm crazy about ya

How bout that?

People used to tell ya I'm a crazy fool
But you taught me more than I could learn in school...
(I said) I really need ya baby...

How bout that?

If ever you need time and space
Don't run away just tell me face to face, yeah

[Chorus:]

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
How bout that? (how bout that)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
How bout that?
(Baby)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
How bout that? (Yeah)
Oh baby...

Yeah
When I think back how it used to be
Before we met is just a mystery
I can't live without you , no

How bout that?

But you got my heart
And you got my soul
You got my whole life under control
Looks like we made it yeah

How bout that?

And every time I see your face
It lightens up the whole damn place
And I want to see this whole thing through
Yeah there's nothing I won't do for you oh yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
How bout that? (how bout it baby)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
How bout that? (Tell me)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
How bout that (how bout it baby)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah

Last night when the moon was new
I couldn't sleep
I was there looking at you
Yeah I'm glad that I found ya

How bout that?

Every time I see your face
It lightens up the whole damn place
And I want to see this whole thing through
And I want to spend my life with you oh yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
How bout that
