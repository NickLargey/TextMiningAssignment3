Wind is raw, the air is stale
On this cold winter's night
Sent alone to tell a tale
From the land of Delmite
Journey starts at the edge of town
With the stars as my guide
There's no one here but my empty thoughts
And the sword by my side

Chorus:
Just a light, from a tower
Burning on from dusk to dawn
Just a light, from a tower
Burning on from dusk to dawn

Sun is leaving the darkened clouds,
As it slips past the hills
Slow moon climbs way up in the sky,
Keeps the heavens so still
Come this far, though I know not why
Said the things I've been told
Greedy village that has sent me here
For its own pot of gold

Chorus:
Just a light, from a tower
Burning on from dusk to dawn
Just a light, from a tower
Burning on from dusk to dawn

Everywhere the wind did sail,
The castle lies just ahead
Blade is drawn, still I carry on
On my brow a cold sweat.
As I look there upon the hill,
There it stands so tall
Said that stone structured wall of gold,
Will heed the voice of us all.

Chorus:
Just a light, from a tower
Burning on from dusk to dawn
Just a light, from a tower
Burning on from dusk to dawn

Just a light, from a tower
Burning on from dusk to dawn
Just a light, from a tower
Stands the victor and his gold,
And that's all!!!
