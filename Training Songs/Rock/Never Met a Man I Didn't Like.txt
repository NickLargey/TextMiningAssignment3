I never met a man I didn't like
Then I saw her at a barnyard show
Spanish soup to go 
Watch out or it'll burn your hand
With the clarity to show you where to stand
And I never met a man I didn't like
Except those Spanish dudes on a good night
Say it again
In time I'll come to believe

Nervous mind is craving more
Like the stopped watch I bought at the store
I got a watch and it just shows me
Bout time I bought my own TV
On the way car decided to quit
Never saw such a piece of Jap shit
And I never met a man I didn't like
Except you my friend, on a good night
Say it again
In time I'll come to believe

Down on Kettner Boulevard
I called on my friend Gerard
Said 'Gerard, gimme two hundred bucks
It's been weeks since I've had a good f*ck'
And I heard him and I knew he was bored
Put down the phone and thanked the lord
And I never met a man I didn't like
Except you my friend, on a good night
Say it again
In time I'll come to believe
Say it again
In time I'll come to believe it
