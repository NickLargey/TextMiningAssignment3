I see the people standing on the shore
I see a big chief there standing on the shore
I ask my mama what they crying for

I saw a black cloud hanging in the sky
I saw a big black cloud hanging in the sky
And I ask my papa when will it roll by

Oh we're standing on the edge of the world (Ooh)
Oh we're standing
Standing out of here
On the edge of the world (Ooh)

Come on brother (brother) we gonna shake this town
Come on sister (sister, sister) we gonna shake this town (burn it up)
Come on children (children come on) we gonna shake this town
(Down to the ground)

Can't draw no water no more
From the drinking well
Can't grow no corn no more, no more, out here on my land
We're at the mercy, mercy of the government man

And then I followed you (followed you followed you) we did pray
How can you promise me (promise me, promise me)
Come what may
Where you gonna turn to on a judgement day

Oh we're standing on the edge of the world (Ooh)
Oh we're standing
Standing out of here
On the edge of the world (Ooh)

Come on brother (brother, brother) we gonna shake this town
Alright
Come on sister (Sister come on)
We gonna shake this town (Singing alright out loud)
Come on children (Children come on)
We gonna shake this town

Come on brother brother brother
We gonna shake this town
Come on sister sister sister
We gonna shake this town (Shake this town)
Come on children children children
We gonna shake this town
Oh

We're standing (standing, standing)
On the edge of the world
Oh
Oh we're standing (standing out of here)
On the edge of the world
