Those days are over, those days are over 
Those days are over, those days are over 

Nothing ever happens come what may 
And snow never falls on Christmas Day 
And all around I see is war 
I can't stand this anymore 

Those days are over, those days are over 
Those days are over, those days are over 

These are friendly times 
These are strange times 
Soldiers to the left of me, soldiers to the right 
I can't take this anymore 

Those days are over, those days are over 
Those days are over, those days are over 

Nothing ever changes for all we say 
It's the same tomorrow as yesterday 
Yes all around I see is war 
I can't stand this anymore 

Those days are over, those days are over 
Those days are over, those days are over
