You gave me a reason, to laugh when I was down 
And you are all I feel for, or care for in this town 
Where we are the only two dreamers alive 
We've got to leave, we can only survive 
Where all of this will be, a vague memory 
We see old friends and lovers, with sadness in their eyes 

Dark empty places, we don't quite recognize 
Yes baby the world that we once knew now seems 
To be be fading like scenes from old dreams 
It's fading gradually, like a vague memory 
A vague memory, may never go away 
But it won't bring you down, day after day 
For those who can't feel what a young heart can feel 

This place holds something familiar and real 
But for you and me, it's a vague memory 
You gave me a reason to laugh when I was down 
And you are all I feel for, or care for in this town 
Whenever I hold you I know in my heart 
That it soon will move on and restart 
And all of this will be, just a vague memory. 

A vague memory, may never go away 
But it won't bring you down, day after day 
For those who can't feel what a young heart can feel 
This place holds something familiar and real 
For you and me, it's a vague memory 
Yes, for you and me, it's a vague memory 
Just a vague memory. 
A vague memory.
