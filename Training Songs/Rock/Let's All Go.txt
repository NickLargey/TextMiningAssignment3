Running through this maze cry at what I see
A civilization with values alien to me
All the role models, lost souls, false gods that I am shown
Ordeals that I pass through for purposes unknown?
In the cul-de-sac turn back on my trade from the cul-de-sac

Help try getting me out
In a transient phase
At the end of an age
Running through this maze
Some born again idiot tracks me down and I couldn't escape
Trying to notch up points for his entrance fee to new Jerusalem
