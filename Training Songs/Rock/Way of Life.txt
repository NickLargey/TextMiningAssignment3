Getting put down by everyone, we are on our own
You can hear all the scenes talking against us

[Chorus]
Way of life, way of life
It's a fucking way of life

Boot boys Mohican's with studs & spiky hair
While others have the same fucking patches and roll in the dirt

[Chorus]

Life ain't fucking easy for the punx of today
Even at our own fucking shows, we take their shit

[Chorus]

Nazis of the past wore boots and kicked you in the head
The new Nazis wear punk clothes and talk a lot of shit

[Chorus]
