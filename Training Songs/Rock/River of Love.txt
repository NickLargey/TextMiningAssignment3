When I'm in trouble
When I'm sinking down
Caught up in this struggle
Stuck out on the wrong side of town
Lord I know you won't forsake me
You help me rise above
Let your spirit take me down
To the river of love

Wash my soul in your water
Turn me around
And I'll surrender all like I ought to
When I go down
To the river of love
River of love
Take me down, down down
To the river of love

Dip my hands in your water
So cool and clear
Pouring down from the altar
There's healing here
Lord I know you won't forsake me
You help me rise above
Let your spirit take me down
To the river of love

Wash my soul in your water
Turn me around
And I'll surrender all like I ought to
When I go down
To the river of love
River of love
Take me down, down down
To the river of love
