Well look-a here baby
You've been playin' up to me
But, we both know that it just can't be
You told me that you loved me
But now I can see
That's a-where you told an f-I-be (Rock!)

Well now givin' me that sweet talk
A-changed my mind
'Cause I just found you out in the nick of time
You told me that you wanted me to be your turtle dove
But I can't make it offa promises of love
That's where you lied, that's a-where, that's a-where you lied
That's where you lied, that's a-where, that's a-where you lied
Livin' offa promises ain't for me
'Cause that's where you told an f-I-be
(Rock Cliff, go)

That's where you lied, that's a-where, that's a-where you lied
That's where you lied, that's a-where, that's a-where you lied
A-livin' offa promises ain't for me
That's where you told an f-I-be
(Rock it)

Well look-a here baby
You've been playin' up to me
But, we both know that it just can't be
You told me that you loved me
But now I can see
That's where you told an f-I-be

Well now givin' me that sweet talk
A-changed my mind
'Cause I just found you out in the nick of time
You told me that you wanted me to be your turtle dove

That's where you lied, that's a-where, that's a-where you lied
That's where you lied, that's a-where, that's a-where you lied
A-livin' offa promises ain't for me
'Cause that's where you told an f-I-be
You told a fib, you told a fib, you told an f-I-be
You told a fib, you told a fib, you told an f-I-be
You told a fib, you told a fib, you told an f-I-be
You told a fib, you told a fib, you told an f-I-be
