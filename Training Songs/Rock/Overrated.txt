Look across the room, I see her rise I see her gloom,
I don't know why she's sad now

Slip inside my dreams, I'll make you whole, you'll make me clean,
I say we give it a try now

I swear that I felt you breath, it's overrated,
In dreams I have cried at your feet, was it wasted?

Look into my eyes, see my heart and see my crimes,
I don't know why it's hard now

I swear that I felt you breath, it's overrated,
In dreams I have cried at your feet, was it wasted?
My eyes have betrayed me, this pain is my prize,
The road's just a memory, it's warm here inside...

I swear that I felt you breath, it's overrated,

The road's just a memory, it's warm here inside...

It's warm here inside.
