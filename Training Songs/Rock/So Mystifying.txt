You know you're so mystifying 
You know you're so mystifying 

Well, help me, baby, get a message too 
You leave my mouth wide open by the things you do 
First say you love me, then say we're through 
You know you're so mystifying, I can't believe it's true 

You know you're so mystifying 
You know you're so mystifying 

Well, every time I see you walking down the street 
Try a mystifying wiggle from your head to your feet 
Drive a shock wave pulsing into my brain 
You know you're so mystifying, you're just everything

You know you're so mystifying 
You know you're so mystifying 

You know you're so mystifying 
You know you're so mystifying 

Well, mystify me by the way you walk 
You're even mystifying by the way you talk 
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday night and you'll be mine 
Oh, little baby, you're so mystifying 

You know you're so mystifying 
You know you're so mystifying 
You know you're so mystifying
