When everything is cloudy, and the sun won't shine for me
And it seems like nothing's goin' right, there's a place I want to be
Just laying there beside you in the shelter of your room
I leave the world outside your door, lose myself in you

When you're in my arms, I find all that I need
I could never live without the heaven that you showed me

I've been waiting all my life, just to look into your eyes
Only for the time alone with you
And when I climb the stairs to find you, and we reach for the light
I thank God I've got this time alone with you

Your kiss can captivate me, and your touch can set me free
I count the hours, baby, till you are next to me
And it's taken such a long time, to find someone that understands
When I reach out for love now, I reach out for your hand

When I feel your heart beat, it makes me come alive
I don't want to live without something that is so right

I've been waiting all my life, just to look into your eyes
Only for the time alone with you
''cause everytime I see your face, all my troubles fade away
Only for the time alone with you
And when I climb the stairs to find you, and we reach for the light
I thank God I've got this time alone with you

(Instrumental break)
Oh, this time alone with you
