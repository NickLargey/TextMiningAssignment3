I want to sing a song for You, Lord
Lord, for You I want to sing a song
And I want to lift my voice to Heaven
And listen to the angels sing along

A song of Your faithfulness
A song of Your grace
And of Your loving kindness
To the glory of your name
With everything that's in me
Listen to me say
I want to sing a song for You
I want to sing a song

I want to live my life for You, Lord
Lord, for You I want to live my life
I want to praise the name of Jesus
Pray above all things You're glorified

A song of Your faithfulness
A song of Your grace
And of Your loving kindness
To the glory of your name
With everything that's in me
Listen to me say
I want to sing a song for You
I want to sing a song

And I sing about Your mercy
And I sing about Your love
Your goodness, Lord
Your righteousness
I want to sing

And we'll sing holy, holy, holy 
We'll sing holy, holy, holy
We'll shout holy, holy, holy
Are You Lord almighty

Yes, You are Lord
