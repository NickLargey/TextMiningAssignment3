You tell me lately I've been changing
And I'm not the man you met
You say I'm distant and evasive
Like I'm hiding some regret

And you're going on and on, but you've got something wrong

'Cause if I can't feel love then why do I break
Whenever I see you smiling my way?
If I can't feel love and all that love is
And I'm lying then what are these tears?
If I can't feel love

I know sometimes I get caught up
In whatever's on my mind, yeah
But if I keep it all within me
I don't mean to be unkind
You know I don't, oh baby

So when it all gets out of hand, sweet darling
You must understand

That if I can't feel love I'd be wasting your time
And I couldn't live with all the guilt that I'd find
If I can't feel love when I look in your face
I'd be worthless, as empty as space

If I can't feel love

So anytime any day, sweet darling
Don't hesitate
Just talk to me and I'll make you see
All you gotta do is believe what I say, darling

'Cause if I can't feel love then why do I break
Whenever I see you and you're smiling my way?
If I can't feel love and all that love is
And I'm lying then what are these tears?
If I can't feel love
Oh, if I can't feel love
