No you don't, not while I'm around
Don't you think it's about that time
You let the little things fall away?
Baby, can I call you back?
Say it won't hurt till you get out
Then you'll be serenading doubt
If ever you can reclaim what you lost
Baby can I call you back?

When I see you baby it's well well well
When I see you baby it's a-okay
When I see you baby it's well well well
Never forget

Same excuse every other time
So don't assume you can draw the line
If only knowing the truth was good enough
Baby can I call you back?

When I see you baby it's well well well
When I see you baby it's a-okay
When I see you baby it's well well well
Never forget
