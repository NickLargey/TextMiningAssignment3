Your grace is enough, more than I need
At your word I will believe
I wait for you, draw near again
Let your spirit make me new

And I will fall at your feet
I will fall at your feet
And I will worship you here

Your presence in me, Jesus light the way
By the power of your word
I am restored, I am redeemed
By your spirit I am free

And I will fall at your feet
I will fall at your feet
And I will worship you here
Oh lord

Freely you gave it all for us
Surrendered your life upon that cross
Great is the love poured out for all
This is our God

Lifted on high from death to life
Forever our God is glorified
Servant and king rescued the world
This is our God

And I will fall at your feet
We sing I will fall at your feet
And I will worship you here

And I will fall at your feet
I will fall at your feet
And I will worship you here

Freely you gave it all for us
Surrendered your life upon that cross
Great is the love poured out for all
This is our God

Lifted on high from death to life
Forever our God is glorified
Servant and king rescued the world
This is our God
