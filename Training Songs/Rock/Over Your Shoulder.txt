There's a mark on my back
From my last heart attack
A whiskeymouthbottleneckcardstack

There's a source, of course,
She says: It's whispering at night
Like air leaks from a tire
The truth outruns your lies (life)

If you jump track, thinkin' it's over
Remember
Sooner or later it's over your shoulder

I've got a bigmechanicmouth
It resonates with sound
A forkedmetallictongue
It's green with what it's found

Spin my head around
For a different view
You can't look straight ahead
To see what's in front of you

If you jump track, thinkin' it's over
Remember
Sooner or later it's over your shoulder
