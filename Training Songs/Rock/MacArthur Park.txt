Spring was never waiting for us, girl 
It ran one step ahead 
As we followed in the dance 
Between the parted pages and were pressed 
In love's hot, fevered iron 
Like a striped pair of pants 

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark 
All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
'Cause it took too long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 

I still see the yellow cotton dress 
Foaming like a wave 
On the ground around your knees 
And the birds, like tender babies in your hands 
And the old men playing checkers by the trees 

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark 
All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
'Cause it took so long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 

There will be another song for me 
For I will sing it 
There will be another dream for me 
Someone will bring it 
I will drink the wine while it is warm 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it 
I will have the things that I desire 
And my passion flow like rivers and the sky 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the love of my life 
You still be the one
You keep wondering wanna know why 

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark 
All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
It took so long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 
Oh, no
