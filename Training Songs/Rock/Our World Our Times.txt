See the tramp coming up the strip with the a hundred dollar smile
Sparks flying off her finger tips, driving a young cunt wild
Some nights, I'm wound so tight, like a storm about to break
Better stand in a doorway when everything starts to shake
You get restless, like a cat waking up at midnight
Hungry, never quite satisfied
This is our world, and these are our times
This is our world, and these are our times
Layer other like a street god, with a drop-dead attitude
Scenes looking like a shadow now, and I know I'm being fooled
Sometimes I'm wound so tight like a wave about crash
Hard times seem to multiply, but the joy runs out so fast
You get restless, like a kid crawling out of a bad dream
Hungry, never quite satisfied
This is our world, and these are our times
This is our world, and these are our times
This is our world, and these are our times
This is our world, and these are our times
Make way for the son of a rebel
He's got two black eyes, and a bitter heart
And a bone hanging on a chain
These times, like dynamite
A head on history
Some fools gonna bed it all down
And don't care about you and me
You get desperate, like a child in the eye of a nightmare
Hungry, never quite satisfied
This is our world, and these are our times
This is our world, and these are our times
This is our world, and these are our times
This is our world, and these are our times
Ooooover
Ouuur worrrld, ouuur tiiimes
Our world, our times
Our world, our times
Our world, our times
