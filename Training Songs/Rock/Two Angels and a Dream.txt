Been searching for some answers 
To the questions I should know 
There's an angel up above me 
And another down below 

They offer me the world 
But I don't exactly know 
If these visions here they come to me 
To stay or finally go

And I'm caught between two angels and a dream 
One is pulling at my heart while the other rips the scenes 
Caught between two angels and a dream 
And I don't know where to go 

That's a vision of a kingdom 
And its twice is black as night 
They're no brighter than the sun 
With growing rays of light

And somewhere in between 
Is the place that I ignore 
My decision last and win 
And to where I want to go 

And I'm caught between two angels and a dream 
One is pulling at my heart while the other rips the scenes 
Caught between two angels and a dream 
And I don't know where to go 

I've got to find 
Find the answers 
I've got to find 
My equilibrium 
I've got to dream 
Within the balance
I've got to keep 
My equilibrium 

Between the black and white 
Between what's wrong and what's right 
It's where I feel myself fall upon 
Between you and me 
Between what's cash and what's free 
And I found where I belong 

And I'm caught between two angels and a dream 
One is pulling at my heart while the other rips the scenes 
These eyes have shown no future to be seen 
Then to throw it all away for something in between
