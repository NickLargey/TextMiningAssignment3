When you hold me I can't breathe
When you kiss me your whole world gets weak
When you say my love has gone away
Well you know it's you who's half to blame

And love is second nature
And you don't believe you do
When you say it's all for nothing
But you know it's all for you

'Cause when you hold me I can't breathe
When you kiss me your whole world gets weak

When the river breaks
Float the water brings down
Bring down the house
Lord, I hope you don't
Bring down the house
Lord, I hope you don't
Bring down the house
But no one ever goes inside

Oo-oh-oh-oh, Ah-ah-ah-ah
Oo-oh-oh-oh, Ah-ah-ah-ah
Oo-oh-oh-oh, Ah-ah-ah-ah
Oo-oh-oh-oh, Ah-ah-ah-ah
(repeat)
