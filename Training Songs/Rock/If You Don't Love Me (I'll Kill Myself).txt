If you want I'll be by your side, and if you don't maybe suicide
And it's my love that'd kill me dear, if you won't hold me and have me near
But don't you fret and don't be scared, cuz baby I am a millionaire
I'll make you a star and I'll make you a queen. I'll put your face in all the 
magazines.

Okay so I lied and none of that's true, but not having you is making me blue
And I want you for the rest of my life, yes I want you to be my wife,
I'll give you a ring and a home sweet home, and if you want you'll be free to 
roam
But not too far I'm begging you please. Begging you please upon my bended knees.

If you don't love me I'll kill myself

I need you more than a sailor needs a breeze
I need you more than an eskimo freeze
I need your loving more than money or air, and if you don't love me baby that's 
not fair
Cuz I'll be good to you in every way, I'll give you loving baby everyday
A loving that's good a loving that's all right. A loving like an oven on the 
coldest night. 

If you don't love me I'll kill myself
