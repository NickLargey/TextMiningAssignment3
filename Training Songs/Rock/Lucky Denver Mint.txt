This time it's on my own
Minutes from somewhere else
Somewhere I made a wish
With lucky Denver mint
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
Hurry go on ahead
Good things won't let you wait
I'll catch up when we get home
At home I'll leave
A dollar under water keeps on dreaming for me
You're not bigger than this, not better 
Why can't you learn?
