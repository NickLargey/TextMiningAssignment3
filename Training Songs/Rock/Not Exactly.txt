I am sad alright
But what a waste of time
I held you much too close
And now there's something missing
But I can't see the empty space
Something else has taken place
I am sad alright
But what a waste of tears
I held you much too close
And now there's someone missing
She is gone without a trace
Just the expression on her face:
What a waste
There's a flame and a fire and a body burning up
And a bird on a shape made of steel ohoh
He keeps on singing

it's not exactly what you think
Not exactly what you see
Not exactly what you've learned
And what you will be learning

I am sad alright
But what a waste of breath
I'm only talking to relieve
Although there's no one listening
He is gone without a trace
Just the expression on his face:
Who's to blame?
There's a flame and a fire and a body burning up
And a bird on a shape made of steel, ohoh
He keeps on singing

it's not exactly what you think
Not exactly what you see
Not exactly what you've learned
And what you will be learning
