I don't mind you coming here
And wasting all my time
'Cause when you're standing oh so near
I kinda lose my mind

It's not the perfume that you wear
It's not the ribbons in your hair
I don't mind you coming here
And wasting all my time

I don't mind you hanging out
And talking in your sleep
It doesn't matter where you've been
As long as it was deep

You always knew to wear it well
You look so fancy i can tell
I don't mind you hanging out
And talking in your sleep

I guess you're just what i needed
I needed someone to feed
I guess you're just what i needed
I needed someone to bleed
