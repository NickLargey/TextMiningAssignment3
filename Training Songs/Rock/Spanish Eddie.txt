There was heat in the air 
And cops everywhere you looked 
So there wasn't a lot 
And the breaks that you got You know you took 
And I remember wonderin' Where you been 
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in 
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in 
They were playin' "Desolation Row" On the radio 
The night Spanish Eddie fell from grace 
There was amazement on his face 
On the night that Eddie failed Sanity prevailed 
It was June or July 
When the heat from above beat down 
It was famine or drought 
When the brothers went out Of syle uptown 
And we was mixin' Vicks with lemon gin 
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in 
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in 
They were playin "Desolation Row" On the radio 
The night Spanish Eddie made front page 
His revolution came of age 
He wrote "Surrender" on the wall 
The night he took the fall 
I heard someone say "He's tryin' to fly" 
Like Eddie used to say We'll do when we die 
I know someone turned you For a spin 
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in 
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in 
They were playin' "Desolation Row" On the radio
