My computer thinks I'm gay
I threw that piece of junk away
On the Champs-Élysées
As I was walking home
This is my last communicate
Down the super highway
All that I have left to say
In a single tome

I've got too many friends too many people
That I ll never meet, I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for, 'cause I'll never be there

If I could give it all away, would it come back to me someday?
Like a needle in the hay, or an expansive stone
I've got a reason to declaim,
Applications are to blame, for all my sorrow,
My pain, feeling so alone

I've got too many friends too many people
That I ll never meet, I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for, 'cause I'll never be there
Too many friends too many people
That I ll never meet, I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for, 'cause I'll never be there

My computer thinks I'm gay
What's the difference anyway?
When all the people do all day
It staring into a phone

I've got too many friends too many people
That I'll never meet, I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for, 'cause I'll never be there
Too many friends too many people
That I ll never meet, I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for, 'cause I'll never be there
I'll never be there, I'll never be there
I'll never be there, I'll never be there
