I don't pick up pennies, I don't knock on wood
Step on the cracks a little more than I should
Lucky it ain't nothin' now I got you

I don't cross fingers behind my back
And I don't mind dark cats crossing my path
Silly superstitions don't mean a thing

One way of another
We were meant to be together
I waited my whole life
Just to be with you
I know it sounds crazy, but listen to me baby
I swear that it's true
I've waited my whole life
Just to be with you

I like your smile, get lost in your face
The sound of your feet across the floor of my place
Make y'self at home, come settle on in

The way you wake up with your hair all a mess
Driving me crazy girl, I just confess
If there's a fault, I can't find it with you

One way of another
We were meant to be together
I waited my whole life
Just to be with you
I know it sounds crazy, but listen to me baby
I swear that it's true
I've waited my whole life
Just to be with you

(Just to be with you)
(Aah)

(Just to be with you) One way or another
(Just to be with you) We were meant to be together
(Aah) I waited my whole life just to be with you
