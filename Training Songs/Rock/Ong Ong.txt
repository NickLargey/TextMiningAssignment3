(La la la)

I got on a boat on a hot sunny day
To get out of this town
'Cause the tarmac was melting and the people seemed to sway
Stuck in the underground

To the isle of the black kites and the wishing tree
I wanna be with you
On the slow boat to Lantau through misty seas
I wanna be with you

I pulled out the harbour with precession behind
And I'm feeling the love of you
So you better get to charge until I see you again
You know just what to do

If you're caught up in the gales on the junk boat sea
I wanna be with you
Whit the pilgrims the mountains in the high trapeze
I wanna be with you

If you're the landlord, the social on P.S.T
I wanna be with you
On an island of rainclouds and verdant seas
I will be there with you

Oh
(La la la)
