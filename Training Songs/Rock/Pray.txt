Never much of a hopeful man
Nothing good to say
But I couldn't help it when I saw her
I had to know if

She don't know where to go
She don't know how to stay
And she don't know how good I can be
Or how much I can pray

I pray
And soon I know her a little more
She's everything I dream
But still I wonder what it would be like

If she left me
She don't know where to go
She don't know how to stay
But she don't know how good I can be

Or how much I still pray
I pray
There must be something that's following her
That keeps her from the stay

There must be something that makes me want to pray
Pray
Pray
I pray

She says she's alright, but she's not sure
And I'm not sure what that means
She says she's alright, but she needs some help
I don't know how

I don't know how
I don't know how
