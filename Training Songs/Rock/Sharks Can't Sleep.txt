Saw a shark today 
Ate a man and then, just swam away 
But it wasn't OK 
No, it wasn't OK 

Saw a snake today 
Ate another snake, then squirmed away 
But it wasn't OK 
No, it wasn't OK 

Oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh 
But it wasn't OK 
No, it wasn't OK 

Met a star today 
Looked like flesh and bone and tooth decay 
But it wasn't OK 
No, it wasn't OK 

Oh, oh, no 
Oh, oh, no 
But it wasn't OK 
No, it wasn't OK 
No, it wasn't OK 
No, it wasn't OK 

No, no, not I 
No, not me 
No, no, not I 
No, not me 

Ate a man today 
Ate a man and then, just walked away 
But it wasn't OK 
No, it wasn't OK 

Oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, whoa 
But it wasn't OK 
No, it wasn't OK 
No, it wasn't OK 
No, it wasn't OK
