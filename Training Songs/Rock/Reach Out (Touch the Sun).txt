It seems that I've
Fallen to the ground
It seems like I'm whole again
What can they do
I've learnt to take it
If only I knew then

The world is turning night and day
So love let it shine away

Reach out and touch the sun
Reach out and feel again
You've gotta reach out
Again

This situation,
Coming to the end
Now the light is back again

And I will never be afraid
So love let it shine away

Reach out and touch the sun
Reach out and feel again
You gotta reach out
Again

Reach out and touch the sun
I know that you'll make it
Through the rain
You gotta reach out
Again

And it's good that
We won't be afraid
'Cause every night and day
When you're trying to make it
And you know you'll find a way

Reach out and touch the sun
Reach out and feel again
You've gotta reach out
Again

Reach out and touch the sun
I know that you'll make it
Through the rain
You gotta reach out
Again
