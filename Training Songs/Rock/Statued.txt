Watch the dark clouds bruising
Bellies flushed with water
They swell above your heads

Pull your coats around you
Feel the wind cut through them
Scraping at your bones

Hold her in the falling rain
Hold him like you've never done
Let this be a moment
That you won't forget

That you won't forget 
That you won't forget
All your life
â??Til you die

Statued close together
A precious, tender moment
A solemn, sombre time

Hold her in the falling rain
Hold him like you've never done
Let this be a moment 

That you won't forget
That you won't forget
That you won't forget 
All your life
â??Til you die
