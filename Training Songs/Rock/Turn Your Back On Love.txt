Is this a prison 
Or do you call it love? 
You will know for certain some day 
It'll never be tough enough 

When love is hidden 
It is below/above 
And you know when you run away 
You turn your back on love 

[Chorus]
Lonely days and lonely nights 
Will we ever get it right 
Don't be blinded by the light 

Turn your back on love 
No, no 

You're dying to prove 
That you are never wrong 
You're so right, you'd rather be sad 
But you won't go along 

You built a wall didn't ya 
'Round what you're thinking of 
Never mind what anyone says 
You're turning your back on love 

[Chorus]

Turn turn turn 
Would you turn your back on love 

Isn't it my life 
Tell me what else it is 

You can do whatever you want 
If you will take a risk 

When is it my love 
How will you handle it 
To wit, 
There are two whenever we are 
If you can hear the kiss 

If you believe it 
Love is quite strong enough 
Be together, honest and free 
No turning back on love 

[Chorus]

Turn your back on love 

Turn your back 
Turn your back on love 
(Don't turn your back)
