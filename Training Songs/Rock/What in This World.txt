I see you smile
And I wonder what you mean
With that expression
I can't be sure
Cause you have
Fooled me before
And every day
I try so hard
To find you
Gettin' your attention
In every way
That I possibly can
But I don't wanna cry no more
I'm beggin' you please
Not to play with my feelings
So tell me just what I have to do
To get you
So tell me
What in this world
Could make you mine
Oh baby
I wanna know for sure
This time
I don't wanna wait no longer
Please tell me I need to get stronger
Oh baby
What do I have to do
I shall be strong
And I will keep on searchin'
In time our eyes will meet
I wish I knew
If you think of me too
But I don't wanna cry no more
I'm beggin' you please
Not to play with my feelings
So tell me just what I have to do
To get you
So tell me
What in this world
Could make you mine
Oh baby
I wanna know for sure
This time
I don't wanna wait no longer
Please tell me I need to get stronger
Oh baby
What do I have to do
So tell me
What in this world
Could make you mine
Oh baby
I wanna know for sure
This time
I don't wanna wait no longer
Please tell me I need to get stronger
Oh baby
What do I have to do
