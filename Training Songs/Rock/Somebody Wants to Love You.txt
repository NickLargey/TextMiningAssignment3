[INTRO:]
On your own, far away from home
There doesn't seem to be a friend when you're alone
People stare, you wonder if they care
So, you turn your back on someone with love to spare
Try to see, it's gotta be
Lovin' one another is the only possibility
So, when you're down and losin' ground
Don't get to thinkin' love can't be found

[CHORUS:]	Hey, stop, stop! And look around
		Somebody wants to love you
		Stop, stop! And turn around
		Somebody wants to love you
		Somebody wants to love you

Ooooo....
Hey, you! It's nothin' new
Love will be around no matter what you do
Or will you try every alibi
and fool yourself some more then wonder why
So try to see, it's gotta be
When you turn your back on love, you miss the opportunity
And once again, you're at a dead end
And nowhere to turn without a friend

[CHORUS]
Love you....
[BRIDGE:]
[CHORUS:]	Hey, stop, stop! And look around
		Somebody wants to love you
		Stop, stop! And turn around
		Somebody wants to love you
		Somebody wants to love you
