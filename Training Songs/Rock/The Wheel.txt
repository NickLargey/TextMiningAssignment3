I got a real bad feeling about where you're coming form 
I got a real good sense of evil and it tells me you're the one
And I'd love to sit and have a drink to feel 
And I'd love to quit the war and think, but I must grease the wheel 

I don't meet what's called you kind everyday 
I have sun across the universe, on the funeral highway 
And I love to sit, to lick my wounds and heal 
Or soar around the blue moon, but I must fix the wheel 

I am the wheel, a turbine that is spinning the in night, and I'm all right 
Of stone and steel, yes a reflection what you think about me
Yes but can you live without me, yes I feel, I am the wheel 

Turn like a spinning top, burn and you never stop, I got the fever and the feel for the wheel 
Here comes Mr. Wonderful, with his new magnetic deal
There goes Mr. Kiss My Ass with everything he steals 
Turn like a spinning top, burn and you never stop, I got a feel for the wheel 

I'd love to sit to have a drink to feel 
And I'd love to quit this war and think, but I must grease the wheel 
And I love to sit, to lick my wounds and heal 
Or soar around the blue moon, but I must fix the wheel
