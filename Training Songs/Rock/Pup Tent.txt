Sneakin' a kiss 
On the fire escape 
A little game of pup tent 
With a blanket and a broom 
My mind is taking photographs 
Of every little thing 
Exhibit number 2 ...
A piece of white chocolate 

And if you want me to, 
I'm gonna cry you a river tonight 
And if you ask me to,
I'm gonna crawl right into your dreams 
And did you know, 
I feel a chokin' in the back of my throat 

I see you walkin'
Walkin' on tippytoes 
Swayin' like a sunflower 
On a Spanish afternoon 
My mind is taking photographs 
Of every little thing 
Exhibit number 8 ...
don't be late 

You crept in 
Underneath the radar 
Living in a glass house 
Sleeping on a glass bed 
But my mind has taken photographs 
Of every little thing 
Honey turn around 
And the shame remains
