I'm the same old guy that I used to be, I haven't changed at all
I got the same old walk and the same old talk that would run you up the wall
I got the same old face, the same old smile and the same old baby blues
And I'm still doing the rhumba, baby, so I'm still the man for you

I'm still doing the rhumba, baby, I can't seem to quit
If my mama catches us doing the rhumba, mama would just pitch a fit
But I can't help myself, it's much bigger than me
If I were you, I'd hang onto a rhumba man like me

There's lots of guys on the floor tonight with a lot slicker steps than me
The boogaloo and the funky broadway are such a pretty sight to see
My step might be old fashioned but it's just fine with me
I got a couple of rhumba steps you might like to see

I'm still doing the rhumba, baby, I can't seem to quit
If my mama catches us doing the rhumba, mama would just pitch a fit
But I can't help myself, it's much bigger than me
If I were you, I'd hang onto a rhumba man like me
