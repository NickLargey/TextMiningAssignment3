If today weren't just like any day, perhaps I'd try
To shed this worn out skin so thick and learn to fly
But I came home to face your ice and steel
If looks could kill I would be gone today

There's a fire that's burning in your eyes, not in your heart
And I can fan the flames but I can't make a spark
And I don't like the way I make you feel
If looks could kill I would be long since gone

And if looks could kill then I'd be pushing up your daisies
If looks could kill then I would not be going crazy

There's a stool that I've been glued to for so many nights
And a bar to pour my heart out on and make it right
And I don't have to tell myself it's real
If looks could kill my heart would beat no more

And if looks could kill then I'd be deep in peaceful slumber
If looks could kill then I would not be going under

There's a gun out in the hallway covered up in dust
That works well enough to turn this heartache into dust
So go on and let your lawyer make a deal
If looks could kill, if looks could kill I would be long since gone
