If you'd agree to be my love,
I'd build you a world to fit like a glove,
And there you would rule and be queen,
A world with no crying.

Bathe in the waters warm by stone,
Shot with love from volcanoes,
Drawn by a chariot, pulled by man,
And view the ocean, gaily laughing.

Seahorses ride ahead in formation,
Lady in waiting with the information,
Dolphin race, spread word on the tide,
That you were coming like heavens light.

Oh, I know,
Lady Percy will never come to my show,
Up in the highlands, racing cars,
Building guns and breaking hearts.
Oh, I know,
Lady Percy will never come to my show,
Up in the highlands, racing cars,
Building guns and breaking hearts.

Every time I see that you're walking by,
I look at you with my eagle eye,
And I know that you're the girl,
That's meant for, that's meant for me.

Oh how can I, how can I make you see,
If I make you love me, it's make believe,
And like I believe in you,
I want you to believe in me.

Oh, I know,
Lady Percy will never come to my show,
Up in the highlands, racing cars,
Building guns and breaking hearts.
Oh, I know,
Lady Percy will never come to my show,
Up in the highlands, racing cars,
Building guns and breaking hearts.

Raging fires, beech my soul
The water of life is drying out slow,
My soul is burning fiery red,
Oh take me now, lest I be dead.

Every time I see that you're walking by,
I look at you with my eagle eye,
And I know that you're the girl,
That's meant for, that's meant for me.

Oh how can I, how can I make you see,
If I make you love me, it's make believe,
And like I believe in you,
I want you to believe in me.

Oh, I know,
Lady Percy will never come to my show,
Up in the highlands, racing cars,
Building guns and breaking hearts.
Oh, I know,
Lady Percy will never come to my show,
Up in the highlands, racing cars,
Building guns and breaking hearts.

Oh, Lady Percy,
Oh, Lady Percy, take me higher.
Oh, Lady Percy,
Oh, Lady Percy, take me higher.
