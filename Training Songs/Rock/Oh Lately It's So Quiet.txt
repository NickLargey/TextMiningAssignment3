(Oh no)
Oh lately it's so quiet, in this place
You're not round every corner
Ohhh
(oh no)
Oh lately its so quiet in this place
Oh darling if you're not here haunting me
Im wondering
Whose house are you haunting tonight?
Oh whose sheets you twist?
Or whose face you kiss?
Oh whose house are you haunting tonight?

(oh no)
I don't think much about you anymore.
(oh no)
Youre not on every whisper
Ohhh
(oh no)
I don't think much about you,
But if you're not lurking behind every curtain,
I'm wondering
Whose house are you haunting tonight?
Oh whose name you hiss?
Or whose clutching fists?
Oh whose house are you haunting tonight?

Now whose house are you haunting tonight?
Who can't resist,
Who's crying â??whose house are you haunting tonight?â?? 
Whose name you hiss
Or whose sheets you twist?
Oh whose house are you haunting tonight?
(oh no)
