I closed the door and half expected
The party would be under way
I'd have the single life perfected
But the whole house was empty,
That's when it hit me

Who do I kiss goodnight?
How come I sleep so late
When did this bed get so wide
Why can't I concentrate?
What good's a brand new start
After true love walks out?
Where do I put my heart?
Nowhere now, nowhere now

I made a slight miscalculation
Of just how forgiving you would be
Now there's a minor complication
When I come home,
I'm all alone

Who do I kiss goodnight?
How come I sleep so late
When did this bed get so wide
Why can't I concentrate?
What good's a brand new start
After true love walks out?
Where do I put my heart?
Nowhere now, nowhere now

Our tragic disses
A million kisses, 
Give or take a few
No one to give them to

Ahh
Who do I kiss goodnight?
How come I sleep so late
When did this bed get so wide
Why can't I concentrate?
What good's a brand new start
After true love walks out?
Where do I put my heart?
Nowhere now, nowhere now
Nowhere now, nowhere now
