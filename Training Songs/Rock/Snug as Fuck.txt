When you hunt me up
And my heart dried out
Just like the flu
On a windowsill
I'm taking us back to the city
And your mind don't know
I can hear her cry
Was it something I did
In a past life
But you can't compare it to the sister
I was the leader of a pack
But now I hollow in?
I've done what you will never do
Look away?
'Cause I'm a hopeless sack
And I'm sleeping in the wilderness 
With my feet by the fire
You know, you know, you know
I'm snug as f*ck
And someday soon
Like I'm all wrapped up
In the innocence
Won't you get it over so quickly
I have a habit of attack
To smell the
This the type of a girl you would fight for
I've seen what you will never see
Doesn't make me careful
I've done what you will never do
Look away if I fool
