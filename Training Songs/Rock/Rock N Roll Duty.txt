My rock n roll heartaches end up in song 
Sometimes I get it right sometimes I'm wrong 
And my love of rock n roll makes me a one-night-stand 
Sometimes I'm enriched sometimes I'm tanned 
I'm just doing my rock n roll duty 
I'm just doing my
I'm just doing my rock n roll duty 
Creating a buzz buzz buzz 
Some say I'm in it for the money 
Man I'm in it for love love love 
The love of rock n roll is never right or wrong 
That's why you can identify as the day is long 
So this is for us 
The hard-driving beauty 
We can dance in our minds 
We can do the tutti-frutti 
I'm just doing my rock n roll duty 
I'm just doing my
I'm just doing my rock n roll duty 
Creating a buzz buzz buzz 
Some say I'm in it for the money 
Man I'm in it for love love love 
I'm just doing my rock n roll duty 
Creating a buzz buzz buzz
