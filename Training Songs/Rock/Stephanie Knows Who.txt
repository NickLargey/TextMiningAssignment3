What's in your life, dear Stephanie
What's in your life for me
Aches and pains they cloud your sight
But tired you did you said you did
What can I say, dear Stephanie
Who shall I next inform
Of love and poetry that you bring
Your eyes, your hair, your everything
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on
What am I now, dear Stephanie
Am I you in disguise
The words they come so naturally
I save them all for Stephanie, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Hey, all right
Talk to me all the time
From a to z and in between
Say it sweet all the time
All the time, yeah
