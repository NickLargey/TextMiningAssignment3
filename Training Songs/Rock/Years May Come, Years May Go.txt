Let's take a look behind 
And see what we can find 
Last year has gone for everyone 
Passed with time 

What happened to us then 
Can't happen once again 
And what's now all to me? 
History 

Years may come (Many years are still ahead) 
Years may go (Many years have passed) 

Some go fast (They belong to yesterday) 
Some go slow (Still the memories last) 
Some are good (Couldn't stop the laughter flowing) 
Some are bad (Couldn't stop the tears) 

For each one (Thank the Lord that we have been) 
Just be glad (Together through the years) 
Whenever I review 
The lovin' times with you 

I wouldn't change a single page 
We've lived through 
It wasn't always smooth 
Sometimes we'd jump the groove 

We've shed some tears and then 
Loved again 
Years may come (Many years are still ahead) 
Years may go (Many years have passed) 

Some go fast (They belong to yesterday) 
Some go slow (Still the memories last) 
Some are good (Couldn't stop the laughter flowing) 
Some are bad (Couldn't stop the tears) 

For each one (Thank the Lord that we have been) 
Just be glad (Together through the years) 
Heartaches I don't doubt 
Life's sure to dish us out 

We'll beat the lot and that is what 
Life's all about 
Whatever may come true 
Ahead for me and you 

Some day it all will be 
Memories 
Years may come (Many years are still ahead) 
Years may go (Many years have passed) 

Some go fast (They belong to yesterday) 
Some go slow (Still the memories last) 
Some are good (Couldn't stop the laughter flowing) 
Some are bad (Couldn't stop the tears) 

For each one (Thank the Lord that we have been) 
Just be glad (Together through the years)
