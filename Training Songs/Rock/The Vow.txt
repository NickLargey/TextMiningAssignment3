(Words Willcox / Music Bogen/Spalding)
In every waking hour I miss you
In my dreams I never kiss you
And in the shadows creatures want to hurt you
But in love and war I'll never desert you
And I breathe white fire in anger
I breathe white fire in anger
In every waking hour I miss you
In my dreams I never kiss you
And somewhere on another star a man holds his brother
Looking at the faded scars of their land
And he wonders if another planet has survived man
And I breathe white fire in anger
I breathe white fire in anger
In every waking hour I miss you
In my dreams I never kiss you
And in the shadows creatures want to hurt you
But in love and war I'll never desert you
I'll never desert you
I'll never desert you
And somewhere on another star a man holds his brother
And he loved him, he loved him
Like he loved no other
