You took her off my hands when you've stepped in
You changed everything we're not even friends
Now don't leave the job half done leave nothing behind
For you took her off my hands now please take her off my mind

Please take her photograph my heart's so blue
And take all her memories she now belongs to you
But don't leave the job half done leave nothing behind
Well you took her off my hands now please take her off my mind

Please take her photograph
