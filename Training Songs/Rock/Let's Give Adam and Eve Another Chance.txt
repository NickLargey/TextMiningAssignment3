He raised His hand & said "They'll need a place to stand"
And created what we now call the land
He raised His hand & said "They'll need a place to fly"
And created what we now call the sky
And then He gave life life to a man & a woman
And said "The rest is in your hands"
So many years have passed since these 2 people loved
Three billion represents the children of their love
Too many tears have fallen from the eyes of the people
But ooo, the sun is ice

Let's give Adam & Eve another chance
To bring their children back together
Let's give Adam & Eve another chance
To show us how to love one another
(Got to learn to love one another)
Show us how to love one another
(Got to learn to love one another)

When He created all the beauty that we see
I know He had in mind a better life for you & me
But as we grow stronger, all people hunger
Just for the right to be free

Let's give Adam & Eve another chance
To bring their children back together
Let's give Adam & Eve another chance
To show us how to love one another
(Got to learn to love one another)
Show us how to love one another
(Got to learn to love one another)
