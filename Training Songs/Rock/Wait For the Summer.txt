Life is easier when one of us is dead
Hey
I will wait a year
No one starts to hear an accidental fall
And they won't suspect a thing at all

Wait for the summer
We'll sleep when we wanna
Don't tell your mother
We'll leave when we
We'll leave when we wanna

And I have dreamed about it
Now I read about it
And I can't grieve about it
And I can't hey

Someone help me
Someone help me
Someone help me please
Someone help me
Someone help me
Someone help me please

It's an accidental fall
And they won't suspect a thing at all

Wait for the summer
We'll leave when we wanna
Look at your mother
Is that who ya
Is that who ya wanna?

I hear her voice sometimes, when I've been dreaming

One last shot right into her head
And I'm falling falling falling down

Sink into the river!
