Satin and lace
There before my eyes
Walking through a dream
Bearing no disguise
Holding out my hand
I've told my share of lies
But now I understand

Places I've seen
I've searched a million times
To find someone who knows
And understands my mind
No one can hurt me now
No need for me to hide

I've made it
I've played it
I've sang my songs to please them
I've seen them falling from the highest highs
They owned me
But they're lonely
They ended up with nothing
I took my chances and I learnt to fly
Fly away

Time after time
Tried to live with pain
Closed so many doors
But walked back in again
No one to turn and say
No one to show the way
And help me make the change

Satin and lace
There before my eyes
I know it's not a dream
But now that I've arrived
The time has come to see
The chains are gone I.m free

I've made it
I've played it
I've sang my songs to please them
I've seen them falling from the highest highs
They owned me
But they're lonely
They ended up with nothing
I took my chances and I learnt to fly
Fly away

I've made it
I've played it
I've sang my songs to please them
I've seen them falling from the highest highs
They owned me
But they're lonely
They ended up with nothing
I took my chances and I learnt to fly
Fly away
