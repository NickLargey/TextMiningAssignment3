Whoa-whoa-whoa (midnight spookshow)

Spirits returns, with laughs and chills
Living zombies and (graveyard thrills)
Smell and feel your flesh, sizzle and sputter
When being (burned alive)

Whoa-whoa-whoa (midnight spookshow)

Horror strikes, at midnight tonight
Living mummy (terror of the tomb)
Weird woman unearthly creature
Face to face (with the spirit world)

Spirit world, whoa
