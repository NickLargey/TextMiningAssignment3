In your soft asylum come to vanish again
When your thoughts are crushing
And you're broken again
And you're broken again

No way in, no way out you hit the ceiling
No way, not if you won't let it
Oh, you're trying hard to overcome the feeling
No way in, no way out

In the soft asylum wander out of the rain
When you've all but given out
And you're broken again
And you're broken again

No way in, no way out you hit the ceiling
No way, not if you won't let it
Oh, you're trying hard to overcome the feeling
No way in, no way out

No way out, only you can save the hero of the story
How much longer can you wait to slay you're misery

No way in, no way out you hit the ceiling
No way, not if you won't let it
Oh, you're trying hard to overcome the feeling
No way in, no way out, no way in, no way in, no way out
No way in, no way in, no way out, oh
