Well, I gave you love, you know it
So when did you outgrow it
And decide that you would find another man?
Well, you've been out there shakin'
Tell the boys you're chasing
When you get home, I'll be the bigger man

Been thinking 'bout somethin'
Been thinking 'bout somethin' other than you

I ignored your reputation
'Cause you send my heart racing
You think I would always be the fool
Well, I've run out of patience
For this sticky situation
You won't find me crying that we're through

I've been thinking 'bout somethin'
I've been thinking 'bout somethin' other than you
It's sad to say, but, baby, everyday
I've been thinking 'bout somethin'
I've been thinking 'bout somethin' other than you
It's sad to say, hey

Well, if you're not too proud to beg
I could give you some respect
That tune you're humming is never gonna change
You didn't have to do what you did
I didn't think you'd end it like this
'Cause the love I've got is better than what you gave
Well, I've got girls in line
Waiting for these arms of mine
Listen up to what I say

I've been thinking 'bout somethin'
I've been thinking 'bout somethin' other than you
It's sad to say, but, baby, everyday
I've been thinking 'bout somethin'
I've been thinking 'bout somethin' other than you

Hey, hey, I took my best shot
I've had enough of your tainted love you give me everyday
I tried to limit the lonely nights
But, darlin', please, come on, come on
I'm not gonna make that same mistake

You've been out there foolin'
But I'm not thinkin' about you
I've been gettin' the love that moves me
While you've been getting around
You've been out there foolin'
But I'm not thinkin' about you
I've been gettin' the love that moves me
While you've been getting around
You've been out there foolin'
But I'm not thinkin' about you
I've been gettin' the love that moves me
While you've been getting around
