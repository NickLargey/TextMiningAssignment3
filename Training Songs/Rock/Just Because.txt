Well now just because you think you're so pretty just because you think you're so hot
Just because you think you've got something that nobody else has got
Though you make me spend all my money you laugh and call me old Santa Cause
Well I'm telling you honey I'm through with you just because just because

Yeah well now just because you think I'm so lonesome just because you think I'll be blue
Just because you think I'd be foolish to stay around at home and wait for you
Though you made me drop all my boyfriends you laugh and call me old Santa Cause
Well I'm telling you honey I'm through with you just because just because
Though you make me spend all my money
