Hello Jimmy! 
Hello Campi! 

For once in my life I've got something to say 
I want to say it now for now is today 
Life has been given to grab and enjoy 
So let's all grab and let's all enjoy 

If the kids are united 
They will never be divided 
If the kids are united 
They will never be divided 

Just take a look around you what do you see 
Before with feelings like you and me 
Understand him and he'll understand you 
For you are him and he is you 

If the kids are united 
They will never be divided 
If the kids are united 
They will never be divided 

I don't want to be rejected 
I don't want to be denied 
And it's not my misfortune 
That I've opened up your eyes 

Freedom is given to speak how you feel 
I have no freedom how do you feel 
They can lie to my face but not to my heart 
If we stand together this will just be the start 

If the kids are united 
They will never be divided
If the kids are united 
They will never be divided
If the kids are united 
They will never be divided
If the kids are united 
They will never be divided
