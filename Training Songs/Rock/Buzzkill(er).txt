Oh, Lord, forget about me
I'm doing fine
Oh, Lord, forget about me
Let me ride
Oh, Lord, I got no minds for you
I will not please
No mercy shall be given me
Down in Tennessee

Stop
Buzzkillin' me, why don't you
Stop
Buzzkillin'

I've got my boots and my jacket on
My cash and key
Got my highs and my lows and I
Come and go as I please
Good Lord, I've got no time for you
I've gotta run

Stop
Buzzkillin' me, you gotta
Stop
Buzzkillin'

Good Lord, won't you forget about me
I'm gettin' mine
Good Lord, won't you forget about me
Let me ride (hey)
Oh, Lord, I will not follow you
I'm in the lead
Oh no, you will not get to me
Down in Tennessee
