I promise you will get old
I promised you everything
To protect you wherever you go
I'll give you this diamond ring

Just promise you will remember
A promise should last forever
Right up to the dying embers
Of a fire that burns so slow

It's a different day everyday
Don't want you to walk alone
But how will can we carry on
When all of these things have gone?

Just promise you will remember
That promises last forever
Still after the last dying embers
Of a fire that burns so slowly

It's a beautiful thing to do
Sometimes you just have to walk away
Remember, I do love you
Have courage in what you say

And promise you will remember
That promises last forever
Still left of the dying embers
The fire that burns so slowly

And sometimes you just have to walk away
Sometimes you just have to walk away
Wishing that today was yesterday
Yeah, sometimes you just have to walk away
