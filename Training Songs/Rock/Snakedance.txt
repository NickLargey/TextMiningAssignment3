This is the lion?s den
I hope you knew that before you came in
This is where the angels and the devils fight
And their choosing up sides tonight

Well, I am the son of the wild, wild west
And I know that earth is black
So I was sailing my prairie schooner one day 
When I fell off the edge of the map
And my, oh my to my surprise I landed on foreign soil
I was another planet, another world 
And it was populated by boys and girls, come on 

Snakedance - all over the world
(snake, snake, dance, dance, ah)
Snakedance - all you boys and girls
(snake, snake, dance, dance, ah)
Snakedance - you got to form a big line
(snake, snake, dance, dance, ah)
Snakedance - you got to have a good time
(snake, snake, dance, dance, ah) 

Good time

Well, the kids in Boston all wear black
New Yorkers never seen the sun
And the kids in Minneapolis don?t wear hats
And everyone from Texas is from someplace else 
And if you've ever seen that L.A. scene, man
You know it ain?t no Jan & Dean
Come on

Snakedance - all over the world
(snake, snake, dance, dance, ah)
Snakedance - all you boys and girls
(snake, snake, dance, dance, ah)
Snakedance - you got to form a big line
(snake, snake, dance, dance, ah)
Snakedance - you got to have a good time
(snake, snake, dance, dance, ah) 

(come on Steve, show these folks a good time)

This is the lion?s den
I hope you knew that before you came in
This is where the angels and the devils fight
And their choosing up sides tonight

I?m part man (part man)
I?m part monkey (part monkey)
I?m part man, part monkey, part mystery
And the angels (and the angels) and the devils (and the devils)
Are play tug-of-war with my personality now

Snakedance - all over the world

Snakedance - all you boys and girls

Snakedance - you got to form a big line
