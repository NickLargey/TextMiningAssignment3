Sweet pea, my sweet pea
You're the one to get my heart a-jumpin'
Light of love all around your
Being to see

The future, it's looking at ya
It only exists because you're alive
So close your eyes and smile
Your smiles of sweet dreams

Fill them with love again
Sweet pea
Fill them with joy again

Each pace I take and you know why
I write for you and I to try
To take the things that lie around
And turn them into dreams so swift, so proud

It's on a time again
And it's mine again

Sweet thing, loving you is easy
Goodbye sadness when I'm around you
Giving me something I can feel
Down in my bones

Ah, sometimes, maybe just sometimes
Look back on these times and smile
And have the grace to know
What you have seen

Fill them with love again
Sweet pea
Fill me with hope again
My sweet pea

Recollected thoughts and songs
Emblems of forgotten words
Remnants of a time so clear
Still rings fresh and true when the wind is here

It's on a time again
And it's mine again

Sweet pea, my sweet pea
Heaven knows I got a thing about ya
You're the girl to get my heart
Start jumpin' again

Ah, sometimes, baby, just sometimes
Look back on these times and smile
And have the grace to know
What you have seen

How it should be, my sweet pea?
Only God knows what I feel about ya
You're the girl to get my heart
Start pumpin' around

The future if we're lookin' at ya
It only exists because you're alive
So close your eyes and smile
Your smiles of sweet dreams

Fill them with love again
Sweet pea
Fill them with joy again
Yes, sweet thing

Fill them with hope again
My sweet pea
