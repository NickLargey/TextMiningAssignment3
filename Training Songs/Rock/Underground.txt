Sitting by a Judas mantel
Underneath where I can't tell 
Found the places I'm destroying 
Only hoped you'd be there still 
Could not find a way to be it 
I don't even mind this time 
Here wed like to get things over 
Life love anything at all

And when the morning comes
Well sit here and when the atom 
Breaks well just stare
And my life goes underground 
And my life goes underground 

Sitting by a Judas mantel
Underneath well I've been there 
Could not right
The only pieces
Test out anything you will

And when the morning comes
Well sit here and when the atom 
Breaks well just stare
And my life goes underground 
And my life goes underground 

Sitting by a judas mantel
Very well what we define
Counted up the broken pieces 
Here we want to redefine
All dementia memory brought for 
All the weakness we can't tell 
Understood that I discover
Right here everything is well 

And when the morning comes
Well sit here 
And when the saddle breaks
Ill stand still
And my life goes underground 
And my life goes underground 

If I left it all the same well it 
Doesn't mean that its
Not personal
And I never understood why the 
Faces faded its so irrational 
As the atoms start to phase and 
I knew it couldn't mean that 
Much to me
And I never understood where 
The friends all go its
Not personal now
