Girl, I think I love you 

I say, girl, I want to ask you your name
Yeah, girl, why don't you answer me your name?
They say, your name is Jane
And you make me feel ashame

And such a sweet girl like you
Oh, you're telling me lies
You're telling me lies

Well, I'm gonna make you at a party
And could you make me feel so happy?
And every man
Is just a one night stand

And such a sweet girl like you
I can't believe it
You're telling me lies [x2]

Pure lies

And the tragedy is...

You know I love you just the same
But they say, I'm insane
Because no one man
Never loved you for long

And such a sweet girl like you
You're telling me lies [x2]
I can see it in your eyes
You're telling me lies

You're telling me lies
I can see it in your eyes
