I will be waiting right here only to roam
When the bells chime like there is no tomorrow
(And you're gonna take me home)

Never gonna ever gonna belong to another, no
Never gonna ever gonna belong to another, no

Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet

My candle shines at night time through the dawn
But my darling you have fallen and don't belong
(And I can't carry on)

My candle shines without a doubt
But the wind in your wings blows them out
And for my arms it is too late
And your wings are gonna have to wait

Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet
Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet
Not an angel yet

Never gonna ever gonna belong to another, no

My candle shines without a doubt
But the wind in your wings blows them out
And for my arms it is too late
And your wings are gonna have to wait

Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet
(Not an angel yet)
Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet

Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet
(Not an angel yet)
Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet
Not an angel yet
Not an angel yet
