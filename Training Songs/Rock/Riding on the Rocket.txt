Riding on the rocket, I want to go to Pluto.
Space foods are marshmallow, 
Asparagus, and ice cream.
Blue eyed cat said,"Let me go with you."
Let's go, let's go, let's go with me. 
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. 

Be in radio communication with you, hello, hello.
Blue eyed cat is dancing the mambo shaking hip.
Floating, floating, floating in the air.
Space walk dance party.
Bottoms up, drink to space walk
