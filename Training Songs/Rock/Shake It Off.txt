Seven green romeo clowns
With the road map upside down
Shooting the breeze once we'd lost the keys
While I thought we were bright light bound
I started the whole damn deal
Then gave everybody else the wheel
I need some help
But keep your hands to yourself
I don't know what I feel
Shake it off
And stick it out
It gets hard and there ain't no doubt
It's gonna hurt but there's joy in the sorrow
Pick yourself up and do it all tomorrow
Shake it off and walk tall
You learn fast how to break a fall
It hurts a lot but there is joy in the pain
I can't make much sense of it
I can't explain
Misfit brothers in arms
From cornflake fields and dairy farms
Blazing a trail
Looking sure to fail
With no good luck charms
Bondage full of leather and sweat
Death-defying without a net
Belt buckles and boots
Another crowd salutes
They ain't forgotten us yet
Shake it off and stick it out
It gets hard and there ain't no doubt
It hurts a lot but you'll get use to the pain
I can't make much sense of it
I can't explain
Shake it off and walk tall
You learn fast how to break a fall
And take some comfort in your own design
And take a chance in your own lifetime
Better shake it off
Shake it off and stick it out
It gets hard and there ain't no doubt
It gonna hurt but there's a joy in the sorrow
Get some sleep, man
We do it all tomorrow
Shake it off and walk tall
You learn fast how to break a fall
It hurts a lot but you'll get used to the pain
I can't make much sense of it
I can't explain
