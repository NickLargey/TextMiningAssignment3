Did you really believe
It would be
A different voice it
Inevitably
Will all come down to one of two choices
So come on now we've got our sides to pick
There's the shining ocean
And there's old nick
But i don't like hellfire
And you get seasick

And oh here it comes, here it comes, here it comes now darling
Oh here it comes, here it comes, here it comes free falling
Oh you and me, you and me and that old glass ceiling
And the radio the saviours and all

There're cracks in the road
There's a pact
Between the ozone and the tarmac
Its closing time
And the drunks
Sing some stray lines of bacharach
Its too late now to even out the score
As you drain the glass and raise your hand for more
So i'll take cover while you just take the floor

And oh here it comes, here it comes, here it comes now darling
Oh here it comes, here it comes, here it comes free falling
Oh you and me, you and me and that old glass ceiling
And the radio the saviours and all

Baby is it drama is it comedy
You know my character witness just went down for perjury
Any-one else got any good ideas
Or will we just lay low until the black smoke clears

And oh here it comes, here it comes, here it comes now darling
Oh here it comes, here it comes, here it comes free falling
Oh you and me, you and me and that old glass ceiling
And the radio the saviours and all
