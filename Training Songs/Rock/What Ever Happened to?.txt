Whatever happened to, twin sets
Whatever happened to, hi-fi
Whatever happened to, TV sex
Whatever happened to, you and I

Your passion is a product
(of) highlight and detail
That come hither look
Bonus offer retail

Whatever happened to, pick-up trucks
Whatever happened to, yellow pages
Whatever happened to, burning books
Whatever happened to, new ages

Your emotions are cheap
Cut price cash and carry
Your heart on your sleeve
For any Tom, Dick or Harry

Your love is a cashed-in check
Oh oh that's the way of all flesh

Whatever happened to, Chairman Mao
Whatever happened to, God above
Whatever happened to, the cow
Whatever happened to, plug-in love

Your pasteurized life so fit for consumption
Ooh those undressing eyes so strictly commercial

Your love is a cashed-in check
Oh oh that's the way of all flesh
All flesh
All flesh
