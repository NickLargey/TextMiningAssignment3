There's a woman, oh don't you know
Always on my mind
I don't think that she really knows
How much I've tried
Met her one time so long ago
I was so untrue
I was lost had no place to go
And I was asking you
Baby pull me through

Come the weekend, out with a friend
Who do I see
There's the girl I've been waiting to know
Looking so carefree
I was not gonna spoil it for myself
Like the time before
Ask her kindly, girl won't you dance
Lead her to the floor
Ask her just once more

Baby listen, won't you listen
You don't know just what we've been missing
I just think of you all the time
C'mon baby just say you're mine
I ain't living for nothing but you

Oh this woman, I tell you so
She's the loving kind
I will get her one day, I hope
It's a matter of time
Left my number, she said she'd call
Call me anytime
I'll be waiting, ready to go
We could be doing fine
Just you give me a sign

Baby listen, won't you listen
You don't know just what we've been missing
I just think of you all the time
C'mon baby just say you're mine
I ain't living for nothing but you
Nothin' but you
