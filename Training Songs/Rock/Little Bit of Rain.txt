If I should leave you
Try to remember the good times
Warm days filled with sunshine
And just a little bit of rain
And just a little bit of rain

And if you look back
Try to forget all the bad times
Lonely blue and sad times
And just a little bit of rain
And just a little bit of rain

And if I look back
I'll remember all the good times
Warm days filled with sunshine
And just a little bit of rain
And just a little bit of rain

If I should leave you
Try to remember all the good times
Warm days filled with sunshine
And just a little bit of rain
And just a little bit of rain
