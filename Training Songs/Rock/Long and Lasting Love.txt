Long and lasting love
Not many people find it
But don't you do their whole life through
Put their hearts and souls behind it
Long and lasting love

Long and lasting love
It's what I've always dreamed of
And when I looked into your eyes
I knew I'd really seen love
Long and lasting love

We've got a once in a lifetime
All the dreams we're waiting for
I'm just beginning to come true
It happens once in a lifetime
When you find the special girl
Who knows the meaning of love like you

Long and lasting love
We share for many reasons
A special bond that caused me on 
The changing of the season
Long and lasting love

When our love like goes up here 
As care as you through all the years
Long and lasting love

We've got a once in a lifetime
All the dreams we're waiting for
I'm just beginning to come true
It happens once in a lifetime
When you find the special girl
Who knows the meaning of love like you

Long and lasting love
It's what I've always dreamed of 
When I looked into your eyes
I knew I'd really seen love

A long and lasting love
It's what I've always dreamed of
My long and lasting love
