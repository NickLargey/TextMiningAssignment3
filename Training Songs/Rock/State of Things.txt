Blindfold me tie me up or tie me down yeah take me anywhere
Keep your ears close to the ground
Listen to me but don't die laughing
And all things must end yeah
But I can see my fate in your eyes
As I'm stitched up by my friends again
They just can't defend the state of things between

You and me
Used to be on fire

So slip off your shackles
Cause you don't need them where we're going
See what happens just happens
There ain't no straight lines in the state of things
So try to cling on for dear life
And don't forget the world keeps on turning round despite

You and me
Used to be on fire

Now look now
See when we're going
I don't know where I'm going
I don't know
