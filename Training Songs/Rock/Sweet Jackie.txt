They teach her to be nothing at all
They teach her to shut up
And to sit where they want her to
Silence touching her combing her hair
Paint her lips like Rembrandt
Her eyes like silver suns

We want you to fallow the rules we made
If you obey your nature
You'll be send to a shady prison cell
We gonna teach you to watch out
And sit where we want you to

Sweet sweet Jackie sweet sweet Jackie
Let us touch your hair
Let us lick your eyes dry
Sweet sweet Jackie where you gonna run when the wall starts falling down
Oh Jackie sweet sweet Jackie
Let us touch your hair
Let us lick your eyes dry
Sweet sweet Jackie where you gonna run When the wall starts falling down

And now a million years has gone
Man has his will fulfilled smiles are the usual scene
In this world of perfection
Don't try to kill the code of how to live
Your life we've got it all made up
Smile when words are said
Don't speak when signs are given
Sit where we want you to this is the new world order
When you're wrong you know you're right

Oh Sweet sweet Jackie sweet sweet Jackie
Let us touch your hair
Let us lick your eyes dry
Sweet sweet Jackie where you gonna run 
When the wall starts falling down
Oh Jackie sweet sweet Jackie
Let us touch your hair
Let us lick your eyes dry
Sweet sweet Jackie where you gonna run 
When the wall starts falling down

Everytime I look deep in your eyes
I see the dreams go by

Oh sweet sweet Jackie sweet sweet Jackie
Where you gonna hide?
When democracy stains your perfect world
