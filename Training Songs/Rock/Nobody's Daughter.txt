Made something better, he kept it for himself
I'm not that stupid, I just need a lot of help
To understand how stupid you really are
Down at the bottom of the ocean I lay down

Nobody's coming, just continue to drown
And no one here could ever stop my ruin now now
And I know I've got not to fear
You'll get me out

Oh god just get me out of here
Are you astounding us, surrounding us
And asphyxiate all your pain away
Don't try to win it will only end in disgrace

Nobody's daughter, she never was, she never will
Be beholden to anyone she cannot kill
You don't understand how damaged we really are
You don't understand how evil we really are

And I will dig my own grave
I'm miss begotten
I am the last one you save here
Of course I'll sleep forever and forever

Anesthetize all your horrors away
We live inside this black web that you have spun
Greed, your bile is miles away
Don't tell me I have I lost when clearly I've won

I want to see you stretched out on the floor
The world broken doll
The world's shattered whore
And you you can't walk

But you you can crawl
Come on infect us all
Asphyxiate all your pain away
Don't try to win it will only end in disgrace

Translucetize the cold light of day
It's glorious, its terrible god I need it
It's beautiful it's ravenous; I'll just feed it
Coil down to your black dark decay

And I will dig my own grave now
I'm miss begotten
I am the last one you save here
It's all gone rotten
