Hey! Keep on rolling
Baby I want to explode
Oh yes, need you darling
With the growling exhaust note

I'm a love addict
Come light my fire
A love addict
I'm already a love addict

Yeah just free your mind
Yeah let's get it on now
Yeah just free your mind
Yeah let's get it on now

Mom, I'm sorry
Am I playing some bad games
We starve like cherries
Baby I want to explode

I'm a love addict
Come light my fire
A love addict
I'm already a love addict

Yeah just free your mind
Yeah let's get it on now
Yeah just free your mind
Yeah let's get it on now

Ride on time let go [Repeat x4]

I'm already a love addict
A love addict
I'm already a love addict
Come light my fire
I'm already a love addict
A love addict
I'm already a love addict

Come light my fire

Yeah just free your mind
Yeah let's get it on now
Yeah just free your mind
Yeah let's get it on now

Ride on time let go
Ride on time let go
Ride on time let go
Ride on time let go
