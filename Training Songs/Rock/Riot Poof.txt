You know what you know so you go break the terror of the urban spell 
This alliance you say 'I'm on the threshold of greatness girl' so you burn 
Your pagoda through the congo till there's a broken bond 
On the birth of the search white trash 
My native son 
It will all find its way in time 
Blossom riot poof 
You know what you know so you go chain her to your flow 
She bites through your lean dried meatas she's 
Going to the movie show 
In a bath of gliter and a tiny shiver 
She crawls through your lava sea 
Black sahara 
I'm stepping into your space oddity 
It will all find its way in time 
Blossom riot poof 
The sun is warming 
My man is moistening 
On the bomb 
On the bond 
On the bomb
