I must say it was love from the start
when you gave me a tune to sing
But I guess you'll never know
'cause some things are meant
to stay unrevealed

I heard a song on the radio
and it was sung for your ears only

When you're lost though you know
all directions by heart
take a look what's behind the scene
There are hills and trees to be climbed
when you know someone awaits your return
