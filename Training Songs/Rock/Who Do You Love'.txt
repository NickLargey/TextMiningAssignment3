I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire, I got a cobra snake for a necktie
A brand new house on the road side, and it's a-made out of rattlesnake hide
Got a band new chimney put on top, and it's a-made out of human skull
Come on take a little walk with me baby, and tell me who do you love?
Who do you love?

Around the town I use a rattlesnake whip, take it easy baby don't you give me no lip
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

I've got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind, I'm just twenty-two and I don't mind dying
Who do you love?
Yeah, who do you love?
Ah, who do you love?

Now Arlene took a-me by my hand, she said lonesome George you don't understand
Who do you love?
The night were dark and the sky were blue, down the alleyway a house wagon flew
Hit a bump and somebody screamed, you should've heard what I'd seen
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Yeah who do you love?
Ah, who do you love?

Yeah, I've got a tombstone hand in a graveyard mine
Just twenty-two baby I don't mind dying
Snake skin shoes baby put them on your feet
Got the good time music and the Bo Diddley beat
Yeah, who do you love?
Ooh, who do you love?

I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire, I got a cobra snake for a necktie
A brand new house on the road side, and it's made out of rattle snake hide
Got a band new chimney put on top, and it's made out of human skull
Come on take a little walk with me child, tell me who do you love?
Yeah, who do you love?
Who do you love?

Who do you love
Oh
