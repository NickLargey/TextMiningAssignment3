Nanana, nananana, nanana, nananana, nanana, nanana, yeah.. 
One, two, one two three! 
Spin around come back home you running out on a line 
Sometimes feel I'm going out of my mind 
Stunned here waiting for anyone to take the time 

Spin around we get further and further away 
Smile and wave and ain't got nothing to say 
Stunned here waiting for anyone to take the time 
to change my mind, this time 

Well I've been staring at the sun for some time 
And it get's dark inside but I don't mind 
And if you're gone it's like I'm going blind 
I can't get by this time. 

Spin around jump and take another look at yourself 
You've been hiding all alone on a shelf 
Frozen waiting for anyone to change you mind 

Spin around come down now cause it's all getting clear 
Everything you ever wanted is here 
You ever needed anyone to change you mind 
Don't waste our time, we're fine 

'Cause I've been staring at the sun for some time 
And it get's dark inside but I don't mind 
And if you're gone it's like I'm going blind 
I can't get by this time 

Nanana, nananana, nanana, nananana, nanana, nanana, yeah.. (Repeat) 
Spin Around and around and around and around 
Never want to come back down, everything you lost is found (repeat)

Spin Around and around and around and around 
Spin around and around and around and around

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah.. 
WooHH!!!!!
