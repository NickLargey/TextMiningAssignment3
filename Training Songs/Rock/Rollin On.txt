Oh
Oh Lord
Yeah

It came as a daybreak
But surely arrived
Opened my eyes
Just to be sure I was alive

Another day
Ends much the same
Twenty four hours
For me to try again

I'm rollin' on
(Rollin' on)
I'm rollin' on
(Rollin' on)
I'm rollin' on
(Rollin' on)
I'm rollin' on
(Rollin' on)

It came as a judgment
We all have to face
Think of how you bring me joy
You bring me disgrace

I'll take your challenge
Man, I get some motion
I reach on my beliefs
Against my sin

I'm rollin' on
(Rollin' on)
I'm rollin' on
(Rollin' on)
Yeah, I'm rollin' on
(Rollin' on)
Yes, I'm rollin' on
(Rollin' on)

Oh yeah
Rollin' on and on and on forever
Yes, I am
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on together
Rollin' on and on and on forever
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on

Rollin' on
Rollin' on
Rollin' on
Rollin' on

Yes I'm, I'm rolling on to where I don't care
Crystal ball, you let me down again
Rollin' down, the road I've never seen
Meeting people seeing places I've never been

I'm rollin' on
(Rollin' on)
I'm rollin' on
(Rollin' on)
I'm rollin' on
(Rollin' on)
I'm rollin' on
(Rollin' on)

Oh
Rollin' on and on and on forever
Yes, I am
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on together
Rollin' on and on and on forever, oh
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on together

I'm rollin' on
I'm rollin' on
I'm rollin' on
Crystal ball, you let me down again

I'm rollin' on
I'm rollin' on
I'm rollin' on,

(Rollin' on)
Yeah
(Rollin' on)
Yeah
(Rollin' on)
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on
(Rollin' on)

(Rollin' on)
Yeah
(Rollin' on)
[Incomprehensible]
(Rollin' on)
Oh, rollin' on

(Rollin' on)
Tonight I don't care
(Rollin' on)
Well, I am rollin' on
