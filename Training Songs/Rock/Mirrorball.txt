I plant the kind of kiss
That wouldn't wake a baby
On the self-same face
That wouldn't let me sleep,
And the street is singing with my feet,
And the dawn gives me a shadow I know to be taller.

All down to you, dear.
Everything has changed.

My sorry name
Has made it to graffiti.
I was looking for
Someone to complete me.

Not anymore, dear,
Everything has changed.

When we make the moon our mirror ball
The street's an empty stage;
The city sirens, violins.
Everything has changed.

So lift off love.
(down to you, dear)
Lift off love.
(down to you, dear)

We took the town to town last night.
We kissed like we invented it!
And now I know what every step is for:
To lead me to your door.

Know that while you sleep,
Everything has changed.

We made the moon our mirror ball.
The street's an empty stage;
The city sirens, violins.
Everything has changed.
Everything has changed.
Everything has changed.

Down to you, dear, so lift off love
Down to you, dear, lift off love
Down to you, dear, lift off love
Down to you, dear, lift off love
Down to you, dear, lift off love
Down to you, dear, lift off love
Down to you, dear, lift off love
Down to you, dear
