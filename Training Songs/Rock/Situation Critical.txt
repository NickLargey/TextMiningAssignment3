I live alone
I live alone and I like it
Some people live alone
They live alone and look it
But I'm on the roam
And I like it

Some people say
I've lost my reason
I don't give a damn
For opinions out of season
'Cause I'm on the roam
And I like it

Don't you go messin' with my heart again
Don't you go messin' with me

Situation is critical, oh oh oh
It's critical, yeah yeah, oh

Some people say
Some people think I'm crazy
I'm not the lonely boy
My memories aren't hazy
Since I'm on my own
And I like it

Don't you go messin' with my heart again
Don't you go messin' with me

Situation critical, oh oh oh
It's critical, yeah
Situation is critical, oh oh oh
It's critical, yeah yeah, oh

Don't you go messin' with my heart again
Don't you go messin' with me

Situation critical, oh oh oh
