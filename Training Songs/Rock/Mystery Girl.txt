In my mind, I've acquired a tangle I can't undo
I've been thinking about nothing else
Lately

Does it feel as if somebody's keeping an eye on you?
Peripheral visions
Playing tricks on me

'been meaning to say
I just wanna be where you are
Before you escape

Hush now, don't explain
Wound up with a heavier heart
From waiting in the rain

Pardon me, baby
But who's the mystery girl?

Don't you try to calm me down
Don't you try to calm me down

Pardon me, baby
But who's the mystery girl?
Mystery girl

Was it just you and her? Did you go in the photo booth?
Was it loud? Was it hot? Was it lively enough
For you?

Is she likely to be there if I were to show up soon?
The little suspicions
Clinging onto me

Awoooh
'been meaning to say
I just wanna be where you are
Before you escape

Hush now, don't explain
Wound up with a heavier heart
From waiting in the rain

Pardon me, baby
But who's the mystery girl?

Don't you try to calm me down
Don't you try to calm me down

Pardon me, baby
But who's the mystery girl?
Mystery girl

And you know that we're growing apart
Because you planted the seeds yourself
And you know that we're growing apart
Because you planted the seeds yourself

Don't you try to calm me down!
