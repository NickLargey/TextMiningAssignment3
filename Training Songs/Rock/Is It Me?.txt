Is it something
Is it something said
I know you're lost
Like someone who's lonely
And cannot see the way

I still love you
There's some things that bind
And so the tale is just a moral of love
It comes and it goes with time

Don't think about the worries
My love will change you
Someday you'll find room
In your heart for my love again

Is it me
Is it me that
Hurt you so badly
Are you ready
Are you changed for this
Because I know that it's not always going

The way you see
Things don't easily change
Those facts of life
That come with the moment
Just memories remain

Don't think about your worries
My love will change you
And open up this feeling of love
In your heart again

Was it me
Was it me that
Hurt you so badly
Are you ready
Are you changed for this
I couldn't stand another day without you

Is it love
Is it this live
Are you ready to be counting
I'm your lover
I'm your everything
And you won't always be telling me
It's all over

Was it me
It's another world
Was it me that
It's another time
Hurt you so badly
I can't believe in love without you

Are you ready
It's another day
Are you changed at all
It's another place
I couldn't stand another day without you
I can't believe in love without you

I'm in love
It's another world
I'm in this love
It's another time
It's not easy when I feel so strong about you
I can't believe in love without you

There's no other
It's another day
There's no one but you
Is it me?
