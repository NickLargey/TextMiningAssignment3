You ask me questions when you know the answer
Now that's silly, silly to me
Now you wondering if I should love ya
That's silly, silly to me
How could I love someone who
Who only breaks me into, a million pieces, what do I do
Put it back together, but without you

I think it's best (I really do) we just don't fit (Not me and you)
All I can say, there's a better way, this is not a game, I'm gonna play
I sympathize (I really don't), I realize, (You only want)
Everything you said, never again,
I'm good with that, if that's where it's at

Love is no longer in the building
Everybody's losing, everybody's losing
Nobody is winning here baby
Everybody's losing, everybody loses here

Stop telling people that we're still together
Now that's crazy, crazy to me
Cause everybody know we ain't together
Now that's crazy, crazy baby
I can't be loving someone who
Who only breaks me into, a million pieces, what do I do
Put it back together, but without you

I think it's best (I really do), we just don't fit (not me and you)
All I can say, there's a better way, this is not a game, I'm gonna play

I sympathize (I really don't), I realize, (You only want)
Ever be the same, never again, I'm good with that
If that' where it's at

Love is no longer in the building
Everybody's losing, everybody's losing
Nobody is winning here baby
Everybody's losing, everybody loses here

I can't say that I don't think about you
Because we both know that isn't true
The fact is that I think about you
Why do we have to lose
I hate that we, won't get the chance to see, our potential baby
We're too far to get all that back

Love is no longer in the building
Everybody's losing, everybody's losing
Nobody is winning here baby
Everybody's losing, everybody loses here

Love is no longer in the building
Everybody's losing, everybody's losing
Nobody is winning here baby
Everybody's losing, everybody loses here
