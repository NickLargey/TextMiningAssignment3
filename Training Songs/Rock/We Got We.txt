I got you, you got me
We are where we belong

Safe places, warm faces
All have been gone too long

Sky writing, inviting
Disappears amidst the clouds

False promise, the last cold kiss
All seem so distant now

Just with each other
We are all so well armed
And with a little care we need
Never be harmed

We've got we, and there's love
Before our eyes

We can have it and hold it
If we realize

Just with each other
We are, we are so well armed
And with a little care we need
Never, no never be harmed

La la la
