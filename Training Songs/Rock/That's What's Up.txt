I'll be the church, you be the steeple
You be the king, I'll be the people
Well I was feeling such a mess I thought you'd leave me behind
Well I was being such a wreck I thought you'd treat me unkind
But you helped me change my mind

I'll be the sun, you be the shining
You be the clock, I'll be the timing
Well I was feeling such a mess I thought you'd leave me behind
Well I was feeling so upset I thought the sun never shined

Then I found forever
Hey hey love
We've been best friends forever darling
That's what's up

Forever
No matter what
You've got my love to lean on darling
That's what's up
You've got my love to lean on darling
No matter what

You be the book, I'll be the binding
You be the words, I'll be the rhyming
While I was feeling such a wreck I thought I was losing my mind
While I was feeling such a mess I thought the sun never shined

You be the bird, I'll be the feather
We'll be the best of friends forever
While I was feeling such a mess I thought you'd leave me behind
While I was feeling such a wreck I thought you'd treat me unkind

Then I'll find forever and always
You've got my love to lean on darling
All the days
Forever, come what may
You've got my love to lean on darling
All the days
You've got my love to lean on darling
All the days of our days, yeah

Love is our shelter
Love is our cause
Love goes on forever
Yeah love will lead us all

Love, it is our honor
Love, it is our all
Love goes on forever
Yeah love it is our home

Oh, yeah, that's what's up
