We like explosions. 
We like explosions that leave you feeling good. 
We like ideas that change the world for good. 
There's nothing past the stop 'n go, but the ebb and flow.
Like some in and out; more than what you know.
Yes, (we like,) oh, yeah, (explosions.)  
We like new places that jets can't take you to.
We do like music when it does what it should do.
We like explosions; it's only right we should. 
We like ideas we thought you understood. 
We like new places until they're overrun, 
We do like music - loud shots from the big spudgun!
