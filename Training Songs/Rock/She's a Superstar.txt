Here she comes
Seven suns
A burning flame
She got my love
Got my head
But it's all the same
She climbed so high
I don't know why
High
On her own

She got my woe
Got my hand
Took the dreams
Right outta my head
She bought the world
I paid the bills
I took those pills
It was wind in her sails
She climbed so high
I don't know why
High, 
On her own
