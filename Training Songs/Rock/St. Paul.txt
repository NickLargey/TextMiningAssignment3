St. Paul in the winter-Kids are crying for their dinner
Quick smoke and a drink, then it's time for bed
He said, "Why do you always seem so down?
Is something lost that can't be found?"
You wait, hesitate, and tell him you're okay
But it's a lie-You can't look him in the eye
'Cause he won't ever understand you
You want to believe, that things will change
It worries your heart, oh to feel this strange
Bu you can't stop the world-No, from spinning around
You'll never stop the rain from falling down, down, down
Down, down, down
It's colder than I remember, at this time last December
The win was blowin' and, the skies are always grey
You said someday you're gonna leave that man...realize all that we've planned
Start all over again, under the southern sun
But it's a lie-You can't look me in the eye
Knowin' I won't understand you
Yeh I want to believe, oh that things will change
And it worries my heart, yeh to feel this strange
But I can't stop the world-No, from spinning around
You'll never stop the rain from falling down, down, down
I hope that you understand-You're always welcome at my door
And I hope you understand, that I"m not hoping anymore...hoping anymore
Yeh you want to believe, oh that things will change
And it worries your heart, mmm to feel this strange
But you can't stop the world-No, from spinning around
You'll never stop the rain from fallin' down, down, down
Down, down, down
