Every time we kiss
Something tells me this isn't what it could be
Every time we touch
You only give so much and it's getting to me

No, I can't take this anymore
No, I can't take this anymore

Love has always let
My heart before my head I keep losing my way
I've known you much too long
For you to lead me on, should I go or stay?

No, I can't take this anymore
No, I can't take this anymore
How many times can I say
How can you treat me this way?
How any heart aches today to ignore?

How many times can I try?
How many tears must I cry?
Watchin' life slippin' by, what for?
No, I can't take this

I need you to be near
Even when you're here you're never honest with me
I've waited much too long
A woman's just as strong as a man can be

No, I can't take this anymore
No, I can't take it anymore
How many times can I say
How can you treat me this way?
How any heart aches today to ignore?

How many times can I try?
How many tears must I cry?
Watchin' my life slippin' by and what for?
No, I can't take it anymore

I can't take it, can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore

How many dreams will it take
Till I feel my heart break?
Is this just a mistake?
I'm not sure

How many times can I try?
How many tears must I cry?
As life slips on by, what for?
No, I can't take this, no, anymore, anymore

No I, I can't take it anymore, anymore
No, I can't take it anymore

How many times can I say
How can you treat me this way?
How any heart aches today to ignore?
No, I can't take it any more

How many dreams will I dream
Until I feel my heart break?
Was this all a mistake? I'm not sure
No, I can't take it any more
