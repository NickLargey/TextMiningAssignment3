Poppa do ron day ron day, do ron day ron day ron day ooh.
I got it bad for the New Girl In School, 
The guys are flippin' but I'm playing it cool.
Ev'rybody's passin' notes in class,
They really dig her now she's such a gas.
Ooh, ooh, Do ron day ron day, do ron day ron day, do ron day ron day,
do ron day ron day, do ron day ron day, 
Ooh, I got it bad, poppa do ron day ron day, ooh,
 
The chicks are jealous of the New Girl In School,
They put her down and they treat her so cruel;
But the guys are goin' out of their minds,
But she's the finest girl you'll ever find.
Ooh, ooh, Do ron day ron day, do ron day ron day, do ron day ron day,
do ron day ron day, do ron day ron day, 
Ooh, I got it bad, poppa do ron day ron day, ooh.
 
Ooh, ooh, Do ron day ron day, do ron day ron day, do ron day ron day,
do ron day ron day, do ron day ron day, 
Ooh, I got it bad, poppa do ron day ron day, ooh,
It won't be long till we're havin' a ball,
We'll walk and talk and hold hands in the hall.
Never thought I'd make it through this year,
Sure was a drag till she transfer'd here.
Ooh, ooh, Do ron day ron day, do ron day ron day, do ron day ron day,
do ron day ron day, do ron day ron day, 
Ooh, I got it bad, poppa do ron day ron day, ooh,
I got it bad for the New Girl In School.
I got it bad for the New Girl In School.
I got it bad for the New Girl In School.
