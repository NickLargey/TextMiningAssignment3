Don't worry if you don't know what to do
I've spent a little time in worried shoes
I wore them out through walking
It wasn't any use
Don't worry if you don't know what to do

Don't give up if you just can't get away
Don't listen to the bitter things they say
Put those thoughts behind you
Tomorrow's a new day
Don't give up if you just can't get away

Life hurts
And love will burn
Don't we wish it weren't that way
And if it
Falls to bits
You should fix it
Don't throw it away

Don't let your heart get hardened into stone
Or lose yourself in looking at your phone
So many so-called friends
And still you feel alone
You should spend more time with the do's than with the don'ts

Life hurts
And love will burn
Don't we wish it weren't that way
When you
Can't pull through
I will help you
I won't push you away

Don't worry if you don't know what to do
Don't worry if you don't know what to do
Don't worry if you don't know what to do
Don't worry if you don't know what to do
I don't know what I'm doing
No-one has a clue
But you'll figure it out
And I might too
