I'm in the middle of something
And it sure feels good
It makes me feel better
Do I look like I should?

Get me on the tour bus
Then put me on a plane
Take me to the city
Before I go insane

I can feel, I can think, I can show ya
What you want, what you need, get to know ya
I don't care what they say all the time
Believe me, you're gonna feel fine

It's been a long time coming (long time coming)
It's been a long time coming down (long time coming)
It's been a long time coming (long time coming)
It's been a long time coming down (long time coming)

Shake it, shake it, shake it
About to blow my mind
A real pole grinder
I leave my troubles behind

I can feel, I can think, I can show ya
What you want, what you need, get to know ya
I don't care what they say, I can tell all the time
Believe me, you're gonna feel fine

It's been a long time coming (long time coming)
It's been a long time coming down (long time coming)
It's been a long time coming (long time coming)
It's been a long time coming down (long time coming, c'mon!)

I can feel, I can think, I can show ya
What you want, what you need, get to know ya
I don't care what they tell all the time
Yeah, believe me, you're gonna feel fine, well

It's been a long time coming (long time coming)
It's been a long time coming down (long time coming)
It's been a long time coming (long time coming)
It's been a long time coming down, yeah (long time coming)

Long time coming (long time coming)
Long time coming down (long time coming)
It's been a long time coming (long time coming)
It's been a long time coming down (long time coming)

It's a long time!
