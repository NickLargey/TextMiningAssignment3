I've got a hunger twisting my stomach into knots; that my tongue is tied off
My brain's repeating if you've got an impulse, let it out!
But they never make it past my mouth

This is the sound of settling 
This is the sound of settling

Our youth is fleeting, old age is just around the bend and I can't wait to go gray
And I'll sit and wonder of every love that could have been 
If I'd only thought of something charming to say

This is the sound of settling
This is the sound of settling

I've got a hunger twisting my stomach into knots
