[Verse 1]

Drive fast, don't crash, make your money, make it last 
Hang tight, kick back, prepare yourself for the attack- 
Buy low, sell high, take your pills, tell your lies 
Fake your tan, wear a tie ? 
Go to the gym you'll never die! 

[Bridge]

And that's the way to go! 
And that's the way to go ? to go! 

[Chorus]

Fake it baby - They won't even know! 
You can make it ? 
'cause everybody knows that that's the way to go 

[Verse 2]

Tune in, drop out, raise your voice, never shout 
Find your true love on the couch, this is what it's all about 
Change your face, keep your name, keep it real don't play the game 
? don't you know they're all the same ? don't you know they're all the same? 

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Dig deep, fly low, celebrate a tv show 
Raise the stakes, drop the pressure, happiness you'll never measure 
Bite your tongue, pay the man, time to start your five year plan 
Holiday in Vietnam, then blow a kiss to Uncle Sam. 

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
