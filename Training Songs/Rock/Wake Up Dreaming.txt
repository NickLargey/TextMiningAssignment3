Maybe there's another place 
Some other time or space 
I never have to leave something to believe 
Maybe love will find a way 
And this time come to stay 
Another way to be if love could just find me 
But I wake up dreamin' again 
And, oh, the things I see 
I wake up dreamin' again 
I only wish I knew how o make this dream come true 
 
Every new day brings sunshine and everything 
I've seen it somewhere before 
One more reason why 
 
I don't let it pass me by 
Another way to feel 
With a love that can be real 
 
But I wake up dreamin' again 
And, oh, the things I see 
I wake up dreamin' again 
I only wish I knew how o make this dream come true 
 
Close my eyes and your love, like a warm rain, 
Washes over me 
 
Maybe there's another place 
Some other time or space 
I never have to leave something to believe 
Maybe love will find a way 
And this time come to stay 
Another way to be if love could just find me 
 
But I wake up dreamin' again 
And, oh, the things I see 
I wake up dreamin' again 
I only wish I knew how o make this dream come true
