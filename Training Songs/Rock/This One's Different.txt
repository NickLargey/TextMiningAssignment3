I don't care what you said back then,
I just care what you say right now'
When the feelings there its there,
When the feelings gone its gone.
But for now I dream of you, 
For now I write this song,
Put the pen onto the page,
Let the ink scream along

I want you right now
I need you right now
I want you right now
I need you right now.

I hate the way I talk,
And I hate the way I write.
Sometimes its better to stay in bed,
Sometimes its better to stay out all night.
I said I could live without your touch,
If I could die within your reach.
I see that tan line way to much,
Like its something I have to breach

I want you right now
I need you right now
I want you right now
I need you right now
