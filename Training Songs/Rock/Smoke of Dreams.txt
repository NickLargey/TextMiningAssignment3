Smoke of dreams, they pull you in
To the crazy city's dim light
And the silhouettes that fall from grace
And they are laughing in love
Smoking ghosts find pleasure in
Your funny presence, sweetheart
They risk capture to be crushed
Aroused in tune to cheap machines

Flashing time down the street
Holding hands on the subway
And the smoking spirits, they will take you in
They wait for you in the shadow
New York City is everything
Seen the ghost dance healers

Smoke of dreams, they pull you in
To the crazy city's cool light
And the silhouettes that fall from dreams
They are laughing forever
Smoking ghosts find their way in
Inside your funny heart, girl
Flashing time down the street
They wait for you in the shadow

Smoke of dreams
Smoke of dreams
