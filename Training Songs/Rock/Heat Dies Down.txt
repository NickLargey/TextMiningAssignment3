I can just imagine you and me
Running out of steam
Going through the motions
I have no idea how you know
When I dip my toes
In other people's oceans

You have local knowledge
Of the local area
And that impressed me quite
So I tried that night
We do all the things I thought you'd like
But that just made it worse
And I impressed you not
Well not a lot

Slowly star-ting from the start

When the heat dies down
I'll be back in town
But until that time
I'll be round at mine
When the heat dies down
We'll be back in town
But until that time
I'll be round at mine

When the heat dies down,
When the heat dies down,
When the heat dies down,
When the heat dies down

I can not imagine growing old
To have and to hold
Til death do part each other
Cos right now I can stroll back 20 years
Spending time at hers
Talking to our mothers

I've got wider knowledge of the world
I just can't face another argument about the rent,
It all seems so important
In the grander scheme of things
But I was purpose built
To not feel guilt

Slowly ending at the end

When the heat dies down,
I'll be back in town,
But until that time,
I'll be round at mine
When the heat dies down,
We'll be back in town,
But until that time,
I'll be round at mine

When the heat dies down,
When the heat dies down,
When the heat dies down,
When the heat dies down
