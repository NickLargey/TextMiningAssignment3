Soaking in the rain I see me walking
I'm remotely controlled
My legs have gone invisible
I'm spinning down an endless black hole oh

Flashing lights the automated banker
Sends a signal to me oh
The message hovers over under
Blinding me from your frequency

Spaceman bring me down
And lean on me 'til I'm grounded
Stay with me 'til morning
I'll never take up flying again

Lying on the grass
I feel the signal rushing down to my heart
My shields are getting weak
My contact's hanging by a thread to the stars

I try to block the message
But it's overloading all that I am
Spaceman bring me down
And lean on me 'til I'm grounded

Stay with me 'til morning
I'll never take up flying again
I try not to breathe
Suck back a tank of gasoline

My lips are turning green
I wait to bleed
I want the sun to rise
Show me a sign

Spaceman bring me down
I'm home when I feel your gravity
I'll never find where I am
I'm miles away from dry land

Spaceman drag me down
And hold me until I'm sober
Get me through 'til morning
I'll give up on my flying
A million miles from nowhere
I wonder if you're out there spaceman
