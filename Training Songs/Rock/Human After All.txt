Open your eyes and you’ll see brightly
Provocative shapes make me surrender
Far and away she’s an old structure
Rapidly talks so you can f*ck her

Call it all off call her to censor
Thinking of fun, we never enter
Cant escape I cant escape

The control it takes, control it takes
I am I am I am a woman
I am I am I am a human
Take it all off, take it all off
That's what she wants
That's what she wants

I am I am I am a woman
I am I am I am a human
Take it all off, take it all off
That's what she wants
That's what she wants

You came to fight
She moves in circles and
Works undercover
To live for the night
She's always working and planing to hurt

Precision is sought from every member
Imagine her shock when she remembers
Far and away from all that hurt her
Adrenaline wins from all the torture
The team is surprised verses suspense
One always wins she’ll take a guess
I cant escape i cant escape

The control it takes the control it takes
I am I am I am a woman
I am I am I am a human
Take it all off, take it all off
That's what she wants
That's what she wants

I am I am I am a woman
I am I am I am a human
Take it all off, take it all off
That's what she wants
That's what she wants

You came to fight
She moves in circles and
Works undercover
To live for the night
She's always working and planing to hurt

She's human after all
She makes me lust for everything
I'm feeling visceral
I'm cleaning all the innocent
She's human after all
She makes me lust for everything
She’s human after all, again

She makes me lust for everything
She’s human after all, again
She's human after all
She makes me lust for everything
I'm feeling visceral
I'm cleaning the innocent

You came to fight
She moves in circles and
Works undercover
To live for the night
She's always working and planing to hurt
