Please don't turn me away, please don't leave me alone
Oh I'm not asking for paradise, I just got to find me a home

I said land-ho, will I be sailing forever
Oh-oh I gotta find some shelter from the cold
Land-ho, will I be searching forever
Oh-oh I gotta find an anchor for my soul

Well you may think I'm a fool, and think I'm running away
But I've had enough of the city lights, oh I've got no reason to stay

I said land-ho, will I be sailing forever
Oh-oh I need some wind to help me to my goal
Land-ho, will I be searching forever
Oh-oh, I gotta find an anchor for my soul

When you're alone there's not a sail in sight
Oh it's cold and dark and there's no one there to see you through the night
There once was a lady made me feel alright
But she couldn't stay so one lonely day, she just sailed away
And took away my life

Maybe I'll always be sad, and maybe there'll always be strife
Drifting alone with a saddened tone, afloat on the ocean of life

I said land-ho, will I be sailing forever
Oh-oh sometimes I feel my ship is getting old
Land-ho, will I be dreaming forever
Oh-oh I gotta find an anchor for my soul

Will I be sailing forever
