Where have all of our children gone?
Innocent of all, the world that's so bad
It`s no wonder that it's so wrong
When they are alone in truth they aren't that strong

Children, children, expectations great and small
From afar, we see them fall
Children, sweet children, who'll be watching out for you
Who'll be there to guide you through?

Where have all of the children gone?
Thought to be a ware of dangers out there
In the streets and in the schools
In a world so cruel who keeps changing all the rules

Children, children, expectations great and small
From afar, we see them fall
Children, sweet children, who'll be watching out for you
Who'll be there to guide you through?

Where are all of our children now?
Some hungry abused neglected confused
Hey little girl is your mama home
No I'm all alone, these are the words that say it all

Children, children, expectations great and small
From afar, we see them fall
Children, sweet children, who'll be watching out for you
Who'll be there to guide you through?

Children, who'll be watching out for you
Who'll be there to guide you through
