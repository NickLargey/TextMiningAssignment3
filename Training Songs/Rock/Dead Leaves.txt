I’m left alone again, without a plan, just remorse.
How does your best friend tire and push towards divorce?
I think it’s sad to say how I found out this place was never both our homes.
And I found all my dreams in this house, scattered abusively.
Communication doesn’t matter when we never speak.
So now I’m forced to pray and scatter like the Autumn leaves.
Dead Leaves...

Burn our photos, torch our lives. One-sided compromise? Or is it suicide?
I think it’s safe to say that I’ve lost the only hope I’ve known.

And I can’t breathe again, on this couch, on this bed.
But you’re not here, I swear to God that it’s all come to an end.
You said, “I love you. Oh, I love you.”
Well you loved me so you walked away?
Now you’ve asked me to move, cut my ties at the roots.
You told me if I really loved you I’d put down the booze.
But as I started to walk your way…
You said, “Why don’t we wait it out another day?”
