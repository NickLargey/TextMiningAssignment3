I'm the one who broke apart,
I'm the one that's free.
I'm the one who fell apart,
Yes I'm the one, that's me.
I'm the one who fell away,
The one who didn't care.
But there is a long trail,
Stretching now from here to there.

Stars will lead the way,
Stars will light the sky,
Stars will fall through for you and I.
From the darkest days to the darkest side,
There is a long trail stretching here to you and I.

I'm the one who lost the sense,
The one who couldn't see.
I'm the one who lost the chance,
Within this odyssey.
I'm the one who failed to feel,
The blackout of the sun.
There's an old tale telling me that it's just begun.

Stars will lead the way,
Stars will light the sky,
Stars will fall here, now for you and I.
From the darkest days to the darkest side,
There is a long trail stretching here to you and I.

Stars will lead the way.
Stars will light the sky.

And I'm wandering in a trance, taken over me,
Wandering in a world but I can't see.
Wandering in trance, taken over me.
Taken over me,
Taken over me.

I'm the one who broke apart,
I'm the one that's free.
I'm the one who broke apart,
The one that couldn't see.

Stars will lead the way,
Stars will light the sky.
Stars will fall here for you and I.
From the darkest days to the darkest side,
Stars will fall, fall, fall, fall for you and I.

Stars will lead the way,
Stars will light the skies,
Stars will fall, fall, fall, fall for you and I

Stars will lead the way,
Stars will light the skies
