Shoot me down in flames if I should tell a lie
Cross my heart, I promise that it's true
I've been in love so many times before
But never with a girl like you

With a girl like you
To hold and be beside
With a girl like you
To fill my heart with pride and joy

With a girl like you
I know where I belong
With a girl like you
I know I can be strong

You know I won't bring you any pain
I won't run around again
There'll be nothing to explain
With a girl like you

You know I won't bring you any pain
I won't run around again
There'll be nothing to explain
With a girl like you
