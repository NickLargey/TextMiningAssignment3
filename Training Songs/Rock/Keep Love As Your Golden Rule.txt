Put your hang ups in the closet 
Put the fears you have in a box 
Come on baby pull up your socks 
And sunbeams will shine 
They will give you light in the dark 
Don't give yourself a head start 

Cause the radios beating its tune 
All the crackles through the waves 
And there ain't nobody to blame 
So keep trying baby be brave 
Don't listen to what they say 
Keep going you've come all this way 
It's evident do as you do 
Cause your just so beautiful 

Keep love as your golden rule 
Keep love as your golden rule
Keep love as your golden rule
Keep love as your golden rule

Keep loving the way you do 
Cause that's what those stars are saying 
And count your many blessings 
And sunbeams will shine 
They'll give you light in the dark 
Lets get ourselves a head start 

Cause the radios beating its tune 
All the crackles through the waves 
And there ain't nobody to blame 
So keep trying baby be brave 
Don't listen to what they say 
Keep going you've come all this way 
It's evident do as you do 
Cause your just so beautiful
