I come believing in your light
A sweet receiver in your mind
I turn it up all the way
To hear you come and save the day
It's loud and clear, your signal, dear
Turn it on, take us out of here

Turn it up, we're in the red
Bring us back to the freak I heard
Turn on your TV beam
Turn on to the angel's scene
Turn on the radio dream
Turn on your god headlight

Bring us back to the freak I heard

Turn on to the angel's scene
Turn on the radio dream
Turn on your god headlight
Turn on your TV beam
Turn to the angel's night
Turn on the radio dream
Turn on your god headlights
