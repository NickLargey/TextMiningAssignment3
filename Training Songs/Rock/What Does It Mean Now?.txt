Thought I saw you running with the west wind in your face
You were out on the beach screaming that we are a human race
There was someone who was watching you, they were laughing in the sun
They were feeling that the day was fine and the living had begun

What does it mean now?
What does it mean now?
What does it mean now?
You'd be giving it all away, away

Crawling into light I see the meaning of it all
But I just can't work out why I still feel irrelevant and small
I will look into the night sky and I'll see a blazing sun
It's so far away but it looks like there, your life has just begun

What does it mean now?
What does it mean now?
What does it mean now?
I'm taking my time to say what does it mean?

Like a light surrounds your face
It's like a light surrounds you
What does it mean now?

Seeking out a joy of life, I turned over every stone
In my dreams it was
In reality I just stayed in alone
I was traveling over the mind I couldn't use my eyes to see
I was trying to get to somewhere that was a better place to be

What did I mean now?
What does it mean now?
You're giving it all away

Like a light surrounds your face
It's like a light surrounds you
What does it mean now?
