We're gonna have a good time, its gonna be a rock 'n' roll night
We're gonna have a good time, we're gonna play the music all night

Come on now, get the music on
We're gonna dance and sing till the night is gone
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling better now
You can really do it and I'll show you how

So come on, can't you hear me saying, don't you think about yesterday
We're gonna have a good time, its gonna be a rock 'n' roll night
We're gonna have a good time, we're gonna play the music all night

Ooh, sit down, I don't want ya rocking the boat
You got your high heels shoes and your overcoat
I believe things are better now if you just let go, I can show you how

So come on, its no time for sorrow, don't you think about tomorrow
We're gonna have a good time, its gonna be a rock 'n' roll night
We're gonna have a good time, we're gonna play the music all night...
