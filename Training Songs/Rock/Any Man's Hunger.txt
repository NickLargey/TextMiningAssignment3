Yeah, we've had our troubles
And maybe too much pride
And I've been a pain you see
But she always stuck by my side
Even though the road has been a rocky one
And we've had our ups and downs

And there's been so much uncertainty
Well, she never let me down
You won't see her hold my hand
And beg me not to go

There's nothin' left to understand
That I don't already know
She walks proud, she don't have to wonder
She's more than enough for any man's hunger

I don't have to guess what's going through her mind
When she looks up at me
No time for misplaced virtue
We ain't got time for any jealousy

She don't really need a man that's too strong
Or a man who acts too weak
She just wants a man that's honest
With a promise that he can keep

She don't give the time of day
To any passer by
She knows just where she's coming from
Yeah, she keeps her head held high

She's all mine and I'll never wander
She's more than enough for any man's hunger

Hey, oh she my girl, no, no, no
She don't give the time of day, to any passer by
She knows just where she's coming from
You could see it in her eyes

Yeah, she's all mine and I'll never wander
She's more than enough for any man's hunger
