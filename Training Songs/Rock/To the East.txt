You din't aground in this flag-wavin
I saw you waiting for the train
And you disappeared
Your face pressed up to the window
You went so far away
And I want to come there too

I want to be with you
I'm just waiting until you say these words;
''Comme back, come back, come back, Oh to me ...''

I'm living near Gd√¢nsk, there's a train, you'd be here soon
There's a life for me and you
The East means so many things 
But it could be home; it could be home, it could be home, it could be home,
For you and me
It could be home,it could be home,it could be home, it could be home,

''Come back, Comme back, Comme back, Oh to me ...''
And if you'd ever say those words
I'd come to you, where you are
It's too hard to be apart
The East's not so far away

And it could be home, it could be home, And it could be home, And it could be home
Come back. Come Back, Come back
Oh, to me...
