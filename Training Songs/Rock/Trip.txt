I see you start to trip to the 13th floor
It's running through your veins
But you still want more
Looking for the wings that can make you fly
You want to hold the world
And kiss the sky
Well hey hey hey,
Well hey hey

[Chorus]
Everybody jump inside
Everybody touch the sky
Somebody's gone insane
Everybody's dancin' in the rain

You've got bloodshot eyes
And a heavy heart
Long sleeves covering
Your needle marks
Broken dreams
And an empty hope
How does it feel when you start to choke?
Well hey hey hey
Well hey hey

[Chorus]

Well hey hey hey
Well hey hey
Well hey hey hey

Now you wish that you'd never came
Cause now you know you'll never be the same
Now you wish that you'd never came
Cause now you're never gonna be the same

[Chorus: x2]

The rain
The rain
The rain
