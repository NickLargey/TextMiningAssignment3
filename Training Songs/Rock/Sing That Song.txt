Wrecking the best of me
see me front onto past disease
what's up
wrecking the rest of me
you got no sign
you got no scene
what's up
and I believe in one
that I run and i run
and I can't stop what's been done
wrecking the best of me
see me run
cause the best's for free
and I do not care for you

Why
must
I
sing that song

Now that you got the deeds
you are forced to see
my whole entity
what's up
touching the dust of me
I got no time
but it's just for me
what's up
crawling down deep in mud
and you run and you run
you can't stop what's been done
you are running out of steam
see me pass
cause the best is not free
I do not care for you

Why
must I
sing that song

It's rock and roll
