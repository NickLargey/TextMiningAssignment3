Over mountains
That's where my love lives
A long, long ride to Sun Land
Here where I did this

Across the Great Divide
Alone
Wonderin', open, afraid and
Arive in the light
Unknown
Unknown, unwise and unaided

If I could, I might
Send my love on a plane ride
A black cross high in the blue sky
A green cross gliding on a million mines

Across the Great Divide
Alone
Wonderin', open, afraid and
Arrive in the light
Unknown
Unknown, unwise, and unaided
