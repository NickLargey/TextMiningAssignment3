Chance dreams that cut across the bed, 
Leaving colours there instead
See lines that draw it to an end, ignore them
And if I say how I feel again, 
Is it wise to do it?
Or like hearing for the umpteenth time, 
Some despise
Don't you fall asleep there's lots of things 
I need to say that just won't keep
Sweet sweet sweet sweet catatonia, 
I should have told you (ah ah)
Sweet sweet sweet sweet Catatonia, 
I should have told you (ah ah)

And with my fears in the back of my mind, 
Will they gang up on me?
And when I least expect them 
To they'll devour me
Don't you turn aside, 
Your tired ears must hear me out
There's nowhere to hide

Sweet sweet sweet sweet Catatonia,

Don't you turn aside, 
Your tired ears must hear me out 
There's nowhere to hide

Sweet sweet sweet sweet Catatonia,

Will they gang up on me?)
Sweet sweet sweet sweet Catatonia, 
I should have told you (ah ah)
(And when I least expect them to 
They'll devour me)
