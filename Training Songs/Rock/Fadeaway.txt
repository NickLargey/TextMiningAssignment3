[Chorus: x2]
Don't Runaway
Midnight Hideaway
Don't you - Fadeaway!
'til the Morning light

I see you from my window
In the shadows of the night
You're standing on Love Street
On the beat, of better things

Yeah!
I'll see you standin' there
You don't care, anymore
And love in your life
Stabbin' knife in my heart

[Chorus]

Yeah!

[Chorus]

I'll see you standin' there
You don't care anymore
And love in your life
Stabbin' knife in my heart

[Chorus: x4]

She might Fadeaway [Chorus: x8]
