For the last time
You grace me with your
Insincere cold hand
It's so tempting
Like all perils of the modern man
You slip out of the room
No slamming of a door
No picking a fight
Come on come on
Gimme some kind
Of a show

Go go go go
There'd be no smothering cries
Go go go go
There'd be no selfserving lies
Go go go go
Look here
If I could do it again
There'd be no tomorrow
You'd be gone
 
Come on come on
Give me just a bit of spite
'Cause I'm someone
You could easily ignite
You keep dropping the ball
You keep biding my time
But can we take anymore?
Revolution, tear the walls
Of your cold war

Go go go go
There'd be no smothering cries
Go go go go
There'd be no selfserving lies
Go go go go
Look here
If I could do it again
There'd be no tomorrow
You'd be gone

Go go go go (x3)
If I could do it again
There'd be no tomorrow
You'd be gone

Go go go go
There'd be no smothering cries
Go go go go
There'd be no selfserving lies
Go go go go
Look here
If I could do it again
There'd be no tomorrow
You'd be gone
