When another day has ended
And everything's been said and done
And the lights across the valley
All go out one by one

I close my eyes, I close my eyes and think of you
I close my heavy eyes and that's all I need to do

Sometimes when I get a moment
In the middle of the day
And nothing else needs my attention
I take my chance and slip away

I close my eyes, I close my eyes and think of you
I close my heavy eyes and that's all I need to do

I hear the big trucks changing gears
As they go rolling by my door
The driver counts his days 'til he gets home
If I could only count my days
But I just don't know what's in store
I've been so long on my own

I know there's a singing river
I've heard about the golden shore
But I would pass by all that beauty
Just to be with you once more

I close my eyes, I close my eyes and think of you
I close my heavy eyes and that's all I need to do
I close my weary eyes and that's when I think of you
