Gonna be a transformation in your heart and soul
Gonna be a transformation, baby, now that you know
Get used to righteousness when it makes you feel whole
Gonna be a transformation, baby, down in your soul

Remember when we were downhearted? Didn't have nowhere to go
And the wisdom of insecurity, just knowing that we know
That stuff that starts happening, feel like you're on a road 
Gonna be a transformation, baby, down in your soul 

God's like a river, keeps on wantin' to flow
Peeks on events and waits to will them you know
Time has a rhythm when the love is the law
Love is forever, baby, down in your soul

Gonna be a transformation, baby, down in your soul
Gonna be a transformation now that you know
Get used to righteousness 'cause it makes you feel whole
Gonna be a transformation down in your soul

Gonna be a transformation down in your soul
Gonna be a transformation, baby now that you know 
Get used to righteousness 'cause it makes you feel whole
Gonna be a transformation right down in your soul

Gonna be a transformation down in your soul
Gonna be a transformation now that you know 
Get used to righteousness, make you feel whole
Gonna be a transformation down in your soul
Gonna be a transformation down in your soul
