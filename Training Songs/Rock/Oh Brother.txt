I never had a brother, old friend you had three.
You always said that if you had another one it would be me.
When you come through the flames, not everything has survived;
Forget about family now, we've got our old flyers,
Lame tattoos,
The in-jokes and memories,
The misspent youth.
And yeah we ran out of miles,
I guess that's true,
But I know I'll see you when I see you.

I had a new guitar, you had a drumkit,
And I knew the chords to "Smells Like Teen Spirit".
Long summer afternoons washed out in the haze
I'll come round to your place, your folks are away
For a while,
So let's play
Till we're tired,
And then hey,
It's “Goodbye”,
But I know I'll see you when I see you.

This isn't where it ends;
The world will keep on turning,
We'll all make more mistakes, we'll all have time to make amends.
We'll carry different loads,
We'll all get different blisters,
Even so you know we'll miss them when we're finally out of road.

Time it will change us but don't you forget:
You are the only brother I've got.
I'll see you when I see you.
