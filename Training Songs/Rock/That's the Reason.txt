It's late but I'm not finished yet
I'm stuck like a half-smoked cigarette
Between mates and the chances of something happenin'
She's in a group, she might be leaving soon

For a club or just a taxi home
I'd like to be in a taxi by her
Take a chance, make my move
Could be knocked back and they would all see

My mates and hers, it will be ugly
Or maybe it'll work and this night would be
More than just jabber to my mates and me
She's just leaving holes in your memory

Swing test to a heart in her sleeve
Instead I'll be back at her under the sheets
With TV on and she would smell good
We'll wake up and go to work, the world would be alright for once

(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
There ain't no home tonight
(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
There ain't no home tonight

(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
I asked her for a light
(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
There ain't no home tonight

Yeah, I have to use your toothbrush
I know that you may not like that much
But stop for a second Freda while you touch
Most girl's magazines, blah, blah, blah

(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
I ain't going home tonight
(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
I ain't going home tonight

(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
I asked her for a light
(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
I ain't going home tonight

(That's the reason)
Then you'd wake up
(That's the reason)
You were holding my hand

(That's the reason)
Fall asleep again
(That's the reason)
Big smile on my face

(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
I ain't going home tonight
(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
I ain't going home tonight

(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
I asked her for a light
(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
I ain't going home tonight
