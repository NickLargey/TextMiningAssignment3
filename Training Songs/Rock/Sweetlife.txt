Calling all the people
Of colour race and creed
No matter what religion
The world's is on its knees
There's never any goodness
War could ever bring
The tactical destruction
Of every living thing.
'Cause I'm all right, living the sweetlife
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweetlife
There's a new religion
Compassion turns to greed
The cynical decision
Too many mouth to feed
Finding a solution
Try to make a stand
Marching down the highway
With a banner in your hand
'Cause I'm all right, living the sweetlife
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweetlife
Calling all the people
Of colour race and creed
No matter what religion
The world's is on its knees
Now heed the voice of reason
Tugging at your soul
Like the changing of the seasons
It's out of our control
'Cause I'm all right, living the sweetlife
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweetlife
