All that rain outside my window, it goes on and on, I know
It's gettin' better every day
Soon the sun will shine outside my window, when it's gonna come
No I really, I couldn't say
No no no no no no, it's gettin' better every day - thank you

Can you hear it? Oh, it's gettin' better now, every day, yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm a hard workin' man, doin' all that I can, tryin' to make ends meet
Just a-makin' my way through the jungle today, it's gettin' the best of me

But it's only gettin' better, and a change is gonna come my way
Yes it's only gettin' better, better every day, aha yeah

I've been changin' the scene, if you know what I mean
Good things are comin' my way
And now I'm livin' my life, and I try doin' it right
Sun shinin' every day

Well it's only gettin' better, and a change is gonna come my way
Yes it's only gettin' better, better every day

Now it's only gettin' better, and a change is gonna come my way
Yes it's only so much better, oh, gettin' better every day, yeah
I can feel it, feel it gettin' better, whoa, day and night
I feel it, feel it gettin' better every day
Gettin' better, it's gettin' better, it's gettin' better
