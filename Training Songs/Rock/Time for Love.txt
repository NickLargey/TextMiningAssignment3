I can do try to tell you
That I've gotta let go
Now I'm wondering why
God knows, I don't even know

I don't care what they say
I don't care what they do
I don't care if it's wrong or right

This feeling inside of me
Is more than some fantasy
Is bigger than you and me
It must be time for love

I've spoken my mind
Nothing left for me to say
Oh itÂ´s black and is white
Not to standing in your way

Stay tonight hear and see
Shake your body with me
And I'll show you two hearts on fire

You're reaching out with your eyes
Got me so, hit the tides
Now that you realized
It must be time for love

So hold me with all your might
Take me all through the night
Make everything just try
It must be time for love
