A couple weeks ago
My wife and I
Took a little trip down to
Mexico
Met this young girl there
We brought her back with us
Now she lives with us
In our home
She cleans the hallway
She cleans the stair
She cleans the living room
She wipes the baby's ass
She drives the kids to school
She does the laundry  too
She wrote this song for me
Listen
Yeah

The other afternoon
My wife and I 
Took a little ride into
Beverly Hills
Went to the private school
Our oldest child attends
Many famous people send their children there
This teacher says to us
"We have a problem here
This child just will not do
A thing I tell him to.
And he's such a big old thing.
He hurts the other children.
All the games they play, he plays so rough..."
Hold it teacher
Wait a minute
Maybe my ears
Are clogged or somethin'
Maybe I'm not understanding
The English language
Dear, you don't seem to realize

My life is good
My life is good
My life is good, you old bag
My life, my life

Just his evening
Some young associates of ours
Are flying in to see us from
New York City
They're gonna stay with us 
Oh, a couple weeks or so
I'm gonna take 'em to
Restaurants and everything
Gonna get 'em some
Real good cocaine
They don't get much
Where they come from
And this one guy's wife
Is such a pretty little brown thing
That I'm liable to give her a poke or two
Whaddaya think of that?

Teacher, let me tell you a little story
Just this morning
My wife and I
Went to the hotel in the hills
That's right
The Bel-Air Hotel
Where a very good friend of ours
Happens to be staying
And the name of that young man
Is Mr. Bruce Springsteen
That's right, yeah
Oh, we talked about some kind of woodblock or something
And this new guitar we like
And you know what he said to me
I'll tell you want he said to me
He said, "Rand, I'm tired.
How would you like to be the Boss for awhile?"
Well, yeah
Blow, big man, blow

My life is good
My life is good
My life is good
My life, my life is good
