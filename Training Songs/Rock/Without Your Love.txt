I'm not the man you think I am 
I'm not the way that I began 
Not the same as yesterday 
I'm just an ordinary guy 
And you oughta know that I 
Could give it all away 
And it's all because of you 
That I say the things I do. 
'Cause you know it's not my way 
Every night and every day 
I think of you in every way 
'Cause I need you 

[Chorus] 
For the love that you bring 
I'm a beggar not a king 
I don't mean anything 
Without your love 
Wear my heart on my sleeve 
And I die each time you leave 
I don't want to believe 
Lyric without your love 

I'm not the man I used to be 
Not the stranger that you see 
I been waiting for so long 
For a lover such as you. 
Never thought it could be true 
That a love could be so strong 
And they say that love is blind 
But you're always on my mind 
Every moment I'm awake 
And the thoughts I have of you 
Are so beautiful and new 
Oh my darling 

[Chorus] 

Lately I been waking up 
And breaking up my heart 
Baby I don't wanna live 
If we're so far, far apart 

[Chorus]
