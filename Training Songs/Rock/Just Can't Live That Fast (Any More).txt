Hey, I was out last night
Started a fight
Feeling bad this morning and a looking a sight
Stumblin' and a-bummin' and feelin' for the knob of my door
'Cause I just can't live that fast anymore

Well, I remember 'bout when
The fun begin
Noon the next day before I come in
And the morning never bothered me after the night before
But I just can't live that fast anymore

Well, take a look at me
And you can see
That that fast living brings misery
Just a messed-up wreck at the end with bloodshot eyes
Man, you just can't live that fast and get by

Take my advice
Think it over twice
Live real slow and be real nice
You better heed this warnng I'm giving you in this song
'Cause you just can't live that fast very long

Well, I remember 'bout when
The fun begin
Noon the next day before I come in
And the morning never bothered me after the night before
But I just can't live that fast anymore
