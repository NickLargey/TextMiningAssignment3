Huh! Oh, yeah! 
We've been waiting all night just to hear this song. 
Yeah, we been pushin' buttons all night long. 
Just a rollin' down the freeway with the boys. 
When on comes this beautiful noise. 
Turn up the music. 
Make it loud and clear. 
I said, turn up the music. 
Oh, you know what I wanna hear. 
Turn up the music. 
Well, I gotta hear an oldie like "Johnny B. Goode" 
You know it gets me in the mood, yeah I knew it would. 
This here radio's got to make it right, yeah. 
Anybody wanna rock tonight? 
Turn up the music.

I said to turn up the music, yeow! Huh! 
Turn up the music. 
And make it loud and clear. 
I said to turn up the music. 
Oh, you know what I wanna hear.
