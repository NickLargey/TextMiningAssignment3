What time is it
I've just got to know
What time is it (It's five o'clock)
Three more hours to go
Till I hold her in my arms
And tell her that I want her for my own

(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
(Tick-tock, listen to the clock)
(Tick-tock, listen to the clock)

What time is it
Tell me once again
What time is it (It's six o'clock)
Two more hours and then
I will kiss her sweet lips
While the magic of the moonlight makes her mine

(Tick-tock, tick-tock, better hurry up)
And put my tie on
(Better hurry up)
It's almost time

(Tick-tock, listen to the clock)
(Tick-tock, listen to the clock)

What time is it (It's seven o'clock)
Just one hour more
What time is it (It's eight o'clock)
Now I'm at her door
And my heart is beating fast
The moment's here at last

What time is it
(It's time for love)
Doo-wop...
