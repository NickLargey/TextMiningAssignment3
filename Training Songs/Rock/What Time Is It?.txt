What time is it?
Four thirty
It's not late, naw, naw
Just early, early, early

What time is it?
Four thirty
It's not late, naw, naw
Just early, early, early

It's my bread and butter
Ain't got no other
It's on the TV
The spin's on me

President, he sweat through his talcum
News paperman, he watch like a falcon
"Ah, daddy-o, oops I'm sorry
Mr. President, look where ya been man?"
Use a little English to doctor the spin

Hey, what time is it?
Four thirty
It's not late, naw, naw
Just early, early, early

It's my bread and butter
Ain't got no other
It's on the TV
The spin's on me

Ayatollah, he's hopping mad
Jibber about some damn jihad
Send me back to old Baghdad
Spin Doctor it's oh, so sad

What time is it?
Four thirty
It's not late, naw, naw
Just early, early, early

It's my bread and butter
Ain't got no other
It's on the TV
The spin's on me
