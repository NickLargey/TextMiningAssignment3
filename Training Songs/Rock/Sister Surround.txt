You´re rhyme without reason
And you know it so well

Who´s the king of the season
Well you nerver can tell
Though it´s so plain to see

You think you like to be normal
You think you out of control
But the action you take only makes you small
Just like the way it should be

Surround sister take care of me
Surround sister take care of me

You´re a book out of nowere
Being read all the time

And the things that you give me only shows that you´re blind
And when you knows it´s all over, and you´re going´ insane
I´m just there to remind you that I can´t feel no pain
Why don´t you let it be

Surround sister take care of me
Surround sister take care of me
Surround sister 

Cause I´m not afraid to fall
No,I´m not afraid to fall
I´m not afraid at all

..at all
..at all

Come on..

Surround sister take care of me
Surround sister take care of me
Surround sister

Cause I´m not afraid to fall...
