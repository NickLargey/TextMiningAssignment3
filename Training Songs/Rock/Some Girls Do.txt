Wahh.. check this out girls
Sleepin' in late on a weekday
Spend my las' penny on a glass o' wine
Skip a little school take a holiday
I'm gettin' real good at gettin' out o' line
Time.. ta turn the music loud (who cares)

Look.... here comes love (I say)

Some girls get hot some girls stay cold
Some like to lie some girls are true
Some girls don't but some, girls, do

Some girls don't get reckless
Some girls have no fun (have no fun)
Some girls never lose.. control
(Whoa-ho-ay) some girls never drink
Or say a nasty word or two..
But I gotta tell ya.., some girls do

Some girls, do
