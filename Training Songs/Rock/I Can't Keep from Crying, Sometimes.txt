I can't keep from crying sometimes
I can't keep from crying sometimes
Oh momma she's dead and gone
And I know I'm all alone
I can't keep from crying sometimes

Early in the morning
About the break of day
I fall down on my knees
I fall down and I pray
I think about my woman
My woman who's long gone

I can't keep from crying sometimes
I can't keep from crying sometimes
Oh momma she's dead and gone
And I know I'm all alone
I can't keep from crying sometimes

Later in the evening
I watch the sun go down
I think about my woman
But my woman Lord she ain't around
My heart is filled with sadness
And my eyes are filled with tears

I can't keep from crying sometimes
I can't keep from crying sometimes
Oh momma she's dead and gone
And I know I'm all alone
I can't keep from crying sometimes
