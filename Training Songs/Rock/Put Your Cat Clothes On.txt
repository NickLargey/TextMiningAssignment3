They took my blue suede shoes, down to ol' Mobile
Got to rockin' with the rhythm, run 'em over at the hill
Put your cat-clothes on
'Cause tonight we're gonna really rock it right
Yeah Kitty, put your cat-clothes on
'Cause tonight we're gonna really bop it right
Well I slicked up myself 'til I-I looked like a dilly
I run down town and get my female Billy
Put your cat-clothes on
'Cause tonight we're gonna really rock it right
Yeah Kitty, put your cat-clothes on
'Cause tonight we're gonna really bop it right
Rock it!

Well my ol' gal's slow and easy, but all the hepcats know
When she gets that rockin' beat
She knocks the polish off her toes
Put your cat-clothes on
'Cause tonight we're gonna really rock it right
Yeah Kitty, put your cat-clothes on
'Cause tonight we're gonna really bop it right
Slap cat!

Well now come on cat get with it
Keep your hands off that fruitjar
Do some be-boppin' rhythm, pick your toenails up tomorrow
Put your cat-clothes on
'Cause tonight we're gonna really rock it right
