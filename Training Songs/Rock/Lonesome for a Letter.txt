I’m lonesome for a letter
Seems so long ago
Since you told me darlin’
That you loved me so

I’m waiting every morning
Praying every night
Always thinking of you
Hoping you will write

Seems as though you’ve forgotten
Found somebody new
It may be my imagination
In my love for you
I can’t help feelin’ lonely
Or a trifle blue
Sitting here so lonesome for a letter from you

Seems as though you’ve forgotten
Found somebody new
It may be my imagination
In my love for you
I can’t help feelin’ lonely
Or a trifle blue
Sitting here so lonesome for a letter from you
