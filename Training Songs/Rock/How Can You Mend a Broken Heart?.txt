I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But no one said a word about the sorrow

How can you mend a broken heart?
Or how can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?

How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again, da da da da da

I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by

I could never see tomorrow
But no one said a word about the sorrow

How can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?

And how can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again,

Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
