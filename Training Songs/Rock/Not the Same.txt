Think of all the things I do,
'Cause I still hold the thought of you,
For someone else I know it's true so far away,
And I can only hold hold my breath,
And start to die a lonely death,
With you and me and all the rest, so far away,
Don't say I told you so,
One thing you'll never know,

You're not the same,
You've changed,
I don't need you anyways,
You're not the person, that I believed in yesterday,
You're not the same,
You've changed,
I don't need you anyways,
You're not the person, that I believed in yesterday,

I can hold it back you see,
I know it all comes back to me,
You must have practiced hard to be so far away,
You never wanted me to to show,
Just write me up, I'll let you go,
And now there's more for you to know so far away,
Don't say I told you so,
One thing you'll never know,

You're not the same,
You've changed,
I don't need you anyways,
You're not the person, that I believed in yesterday,
You're not the same,
You've changed,
Something's missing anyways,
You're not the person, that I believed in yesterday.
