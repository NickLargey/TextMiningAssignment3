You take a week, all the time that you need
Shattering glass and a lover or three
Oh, baby, you're so independent
You're on the drug of a Gemini cusp
Turn it up louder, spit on that cut
Oh, I won't keep you out of trouble
Take it from me (I do the best that I can)
Take it from me (love like it always goes bad)
Take it from me (take back the life that you gave to me)

I'm not here
Oh, I'm not here
I'm not here
Oh, I'm not here
