[Chorus]
Hey good looking what you got cooking
Hows about cooking something up for me
Hey sweet baby don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe

I got a brand new car and a ten dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
The juke box's jumping the dance is free
So if you wanna have fun come along with me

Hey good looking what you got cooking
Hows about cooking something up for me

I'm free and ready so we can go steady
Hows about saving all your time for me
No more looking, I know I've been cooking
Hows about keeping steady company

I'm gonna pull my date book over the fence
And find me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age
Cause I'm writing your name down in every page.

[Chorus]
