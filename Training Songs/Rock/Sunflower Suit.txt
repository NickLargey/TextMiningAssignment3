How can I follow suit
When nothing seems to matter anyway
Living too close to nothing new
It takes a lot to get used to today
But I follow suit
And I follow suit anyway
But I follow suit
And I follow suit everyday
And I'm in love with a sunflower suit
I'm in love with a sunflower suit
I'm in love with a sunflower suit
I'm in love with a sunflower suit
It's a fashion meant for me today
I'm in love in with a sunflower suit
Nothing else matters anyway
I'm in love with a sunflower suit
That is how I get the birds to stay
I'm in love with a sunflower suit
I'm in love with a sunflower suit
It's no wonder if I can last
Broken fingers, broken glass
No straps and no safety net
I'll make an impression they can't forget
But I follow suit
And I follow suit anyway
But I follow suit
And I follow suit everyday
And I'm in love with a sunflower suit
I'm in love with a sunflower suit
I'm in love with a sunflower suit
I'm in love with a sunflower suit
It's a fashion meant for me today
I'm in love in with a sunflower suit
Nothing else matters anyway
I'm in love with a sunflower suit
That is how I get the birds to stay
I'm in love with a sunflower suit
I'm in love with a sunflower suit
I'm in love with a sunflower suit
