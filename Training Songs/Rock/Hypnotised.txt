I was out on own
My friends weren't there
Just about to go home
When you made me stare

I fell into a trance
Just watching you dance
My world just stopped when I saw your eyes on me
H-Y-P I'm hypnotised
H-Y-P I'm hypnotised
H-Y-P

People look at me
Standing by my self
But I only can see
You and no one else

I was still in a trance
Still watching you dance
My world ...

Now the dancing just stopped
And the doors are open
But I'm still on the spot
Your spell isn't broken
I'm still in a trance
Even though you won't dance
My world
