And it was morning
And I found myself
Mourning for a childhood
That I thought had disappeared

I looked out the window
And I saw a magpie in the rainbow
The rain had gone I'm not alone
I turned to the mirror

I saw you, the child that once loved
The child before they broke his heart
Our heart, the heart
That I believed was lost

Hey you, surprised?
More than surprised
To find the answers to the questions
Were always in your own eyes

Do you realize
That you give it on back to her?
But that would only be retraced
In all the problems that you ever knew, so untrue

For she's got to carry on
With her life
And you've got to carry on
With yours

So I see it's me, I can do anything
I'm still the child 'cos the only thing
Misplaced was direction and I found direction
There is no childhood's end

There is no childhood's end
'Cos you are my childhood friend
'Cos you are my childhood friend
Oh, lead me on

Hey you, you've survived
Now you've arrived
To be reborn in the shadow of the magpie
Now you realize that you've got to get out of here

You've found the leading light of destiny
Burning in the ashes of your memory
You wanna change the world

You'd resigned yourself
To die a broken rebel
But that was looking backward
Now you've found the light

You, the child that once loved
The child before they broke his heart
Our heart, the heart
That I believed was lost

So it's me I see, I can do anything
I'm still the child
'Cos the only thing misplaced was direction
And I found direction

There is no childhood's end
There is no childhood's end
There is no childhood's end
I am your childhood friend
Oh, lead me on
