How can I tell you I hear the way you are
How can I tell you I hear the way you are
How can I tell you I hear the way you are
Days go dark the nights are drawn
How can I tell you I hear the way you are
Days don't end the nights are long
Days don't end the nights are long

Just take it
Just take it like you're strong
You're just the latest in the long list of lost loves (loves)
Just leave it
We all left where we are from
We're just the latest in the longest rank and file that's ever to exist
In the history of the protest song

It is whatever it is
And you are wherever you are
