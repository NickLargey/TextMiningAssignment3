Drawing circles on the window 
Then I'm staring at the floor 
There are places that we could go 
Cause we've been here before 

And I'm losing myself, and I'm feeling a little 
Confused, I need help, I'm outta here so 

Get out the car honey, 
Cause what you said was out of place 
Well I guess I'm walking home 
With that sad look upon my face 
Straight from the heart, no worries 
I got a lot of love to make
Can you feel it a little? 
Don't let it go to waste 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh 
Don't let it go to waste 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh 

Like a long distance conversation 
With a two second delay 
So good luck but we don't listen 
And we've got so much to say 

And I'm losing myself, and I'm feeling a little 
Confused, I need help, I'm outta here so 

Get out the car honey, 
Cause what you said was out of place 
Well I guess I'm walking home 
With that sad look upon my face 
Straight from the heart, no worries 
I got a lot of love to make
Can you feel it a little? 
Don't let it go to waste 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh 
Don't let us go to waste 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh 

And I don't want to lose you 
Even though we've got issues 
Yeah, and I know we can get through 
I've fought it all, cause I've turned the block and survived 
Yeah 

Get out the car honey
Cause what you said was out of place 
Well I guess I'm walking home 
With that sad look upon my face 
Straight from the heart, no worries 
I got a lot of love to make
Can you feel it a little? Don't let it go to waste 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh 
Don't let it go to waste 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh 
Don't let it go to waste 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh 
Don't let it go to waste 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh 
Don't let it go to waste 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh 
Don't let it go to waste 
Cause I feel it a little 
Don't let us go to waste
