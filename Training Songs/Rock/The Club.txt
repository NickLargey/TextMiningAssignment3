If you've ever had someone come along
Reach in, pull out your heart and break it just for fun
As easy as humming a song
Join the club

If you've ever had nights tossing and turning
Like a cement mixer churning 
On your own
In what used to be your happy home
Join the club
Join the club

You may think you're the only one
But my friend, you're not alone
In the club

If you've ever walked streets slick with rain 
In the cold black night, wracked with the hunger pain
Of a soul starved of love
Join the club

If you've ever come to and seen that you've been living a dream
One in which no one can hear you scream
Join the club
Join the club

Your story stays outside the door
Cause they've heard it all before
In the club

This club's not for the happy types 
Caught up in pinks and yellows
It's for all the lost and lonely 
Broken-hearted fellows

If you've ever come to and seen that you've been living a dream
One in which no one can hear you scream
Join the club
Join the club

And when they ask you why you came
Mention my name
In the club
In the club
In the club
