I can see the message, it's written in your eyes
And it's telling me what I'm telling you
We'll walk you through the danger and we'll take you for a ride
Still you see it through, we'll knock 'em dead for you, yeah

Who's gonna save you this time?
Welcome to the night machine
Who's gonna save you this time?
Welcome to the night machine

See the faceless people, they sell you pretty lines
If you only knew what they're tryin' to do
All the gold and silver, it's slippin' through your hands
Smilin' away, I tell you, boy, you're gonna pay

Who's gonna save you this time?
Welcome to the night machine
Who's gonna save you this time?
Welcome to the night machine

Welcome, welcome
Welcome to the night machine
Welcome, welcome
Welcome to the night machine

Welcome, welcome
Welcome to the night machine
I tell you, boy, you're gonna pay

Who's gonna save you this time?
Welcome to the night machine
Who's gonna save you this time?
Welcome to the night machine

Who's gonna save you this time?
Welcome to the night machine
Who's gonna save you this time?
Welcome to the night machine
