Watch me with your eyes
Been giving God a pedophile
I want to be just like you
Then I'd be cool
Maybe not, but
We lift our eyes
Big surprise
Kiss me goodbye, whore
Without you being here
I'll be giving fear
A bit more
I wish I could feel like you
When I f*ck like you
Being sore, but
We lift our eyes
Big surprise
Kiss me goodbye
And then you burn
All that you worked for
Every knuckle wiped into her 
I know if I get more style
I will never get what I want
Inside of her
This gift of mine
Resting, restring, unwind
My eyes are closed
A part of me gets pissed
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sore
And then she burns
All that you worked for
Every knuckle wiped into her
I know if I get more style 
I will never get what I want
Inside of her
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets inside of her
A part of me gets sore, a part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets so fucking sick
