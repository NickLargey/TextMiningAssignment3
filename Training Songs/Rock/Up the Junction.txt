Days begun and people rush
Off to work by 410 bus
Open eyes and open minds
Conditioned to the daily grind

Up the Junction
Up the Junction

Days begun and people rush
Off to work by 410 bus
Through the factory gates they swarm
(Can't work this line out)
Overalls like uniforms
See their faces, young and old
Filling every crack and hole
Some are floating in a dream 
But all go through the same routine
Drifting in a human stream

Up the Junction
Up the Junction

Open eyes and open minds 
Conditioned to the daily grind
Stop to lock their dreams away
There's nothing new about today
Only what the papers say

Up the Junction
Up the Junction

Lots of people down the street meet friends and say, 
"Hello,
It's not as hot as yesterday,
The better weather's on the way."
