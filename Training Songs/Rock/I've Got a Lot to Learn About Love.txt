You, you are the one, you're all I've been thinking about
And I, I'd give it all away, if only you were here beside me

For one moment, you're so close, I can feel you breathe
For one moment, now you're all I know that I need

Just when I thought you were there to depend on
Don't you know that I've tried everything I know to do
I would lie or die for you - I just want to know why, 'cause

I've got a lot to learn about love, oh yeah
The only girl I care about is gone, she's gone, teach me about love

And now, now that you're gone, I'm here with my emotions and now I'm alone
You, you can't see the love I'm feeling for you

I can't let this moment slip away
Don't you know that every single time I feel this way
Every time I turn away - someone's saying goodbye, 'cause

I've got a lot to learn about love, oh yeah
The only girl I care about is gone, she's gone, teach me about love

Show me baby, well I need your love, love, oh yeah

I've got a lot to learn about love, oh yeah
The only girl I care about is gone, she's gone, teach me about love

I've got a lot to learn about love, yes I do
I've got a lot to learn about love, love
Oh I've got a lot to learn about love, yes I do

I've got a lot to learn about love, oh yeah
The only girl I care about is gone, she's gone, teach me about love
