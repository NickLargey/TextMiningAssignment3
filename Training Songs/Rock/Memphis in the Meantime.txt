I got some'n' to say little girl
You might not like my style
But we been hangin' around this town
Just a little too long a while
You say you're gonna get your act together
Gonna take it out on the road
But if I don't get out o' here pretty soon
My head's going to explode
Sure I like country music
And I like mandolins
But right now I need a Telecaster
Through a Vibrolux turned up to 10

Let's go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Ahw, Memphis in the meantime girl
Let's go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl

I need a little shot of that rhythm baby
Mixed up with these country blues
I wanna trade in these ol' cowboy boots
For some fine Italian shoes
Forget the mousse and the hairspray sugar
We don't need none of that
Just a little dab'll do ya girl
Underneath a pork pie hat
Until hell freezes over
Maybe you can wait that long
But I don't think Ronnie Milsap's gonna ever
Record this song

[Repeat: x2]
Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Let's go to Memphis in the meantime girl
Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Let's go to Memphis in the meantime girl

Maybe there's nothin' happenin' there
But maybe there's somethin' in the air
Before our upper lips get stiff
Maybe we need us a big ol' whiff

If we could just get off-a that beat little girl
Maybe we could find the groove
At least we can get ourselves a decent meal
Down at the Rendezvous
'Cause one more heartfelt steel guitar chord
Girl, it's gonna do me in
I need to hear some trumpet and saxophone
You know sound as sweet as sin
And after we get good and greasy
Baby we can come on home
Put the cow horns back on the Cadillac
And change the message on the Cordaphone
But

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Let's go to Memphis in the meantime girl
Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Let's go to Memphis in the meantime girl

I'm a talking about Memphis
I'm talkin' 'bout Memphis
Memphis
