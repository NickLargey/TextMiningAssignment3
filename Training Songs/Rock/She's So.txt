Did I forget about the simple rule of life 
You pay a price for all you your choices 
Well I've learned my lesson 
Looking from the other side 

I thought that I was through 
Don't know who's fooling who cause 

She' so unforgettable 
She's so un-erasable 
It kills me slowly not to be around her 
She's so unforgivable 
And if I never understood 
It hits me know 
She's so damn good 

I talk myself into that bullshit all the time 
At least it made me so much wiser 
I tell my friends I really got her off my mind 

Did I say that I was through ? 
Don't know who's fooling who cause 

She' so unforgettable 
She's so un-erasable 
It kills me slowly not to be around her 
She's so unforgivable 
And if I never understood 
It hits me know 
She's so damn good 

Wish what I feel 
Could be for real 
Not just a one way cry 
That don't seem to fly
