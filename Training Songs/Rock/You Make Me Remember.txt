Whispering you stare
Wanting you don't care
Kiss me make me cry
How did I wind up here
Wishing you were dead
Why are you in my bed
Ignore what's jeopardized
It's only me denied
Ohh I'm dizzy hazy
Ohh can someone save me
Ohh hypnotize me
Anesthetize the pain
You speak my name I hear nothing
You share your dreams I see nothing
Unconscious suicide aren't you gone yet
You make me remember things I want to forget
Walk in the park fresh air
I shoot my drink you're still here
Inside a child asks why
Who used to bring me here
Ohh I'm dizzy hazy
Ohh can someone save me
Ohh hypnotize me
Anesthetize the pain
You speak my name I hear nothing
You share your dreams I see nothing
Unconscious suicide aren't you gone yet
You make me remember
You touch my face I feel nothing
You taste my lips I give nothing
This starving soul must be fed
You make me remember things I want to forget
Yes I do need to feel love
And I used yours like a glove
But the memories come flooding back
All I want to do is paint it black
This starving soul must be fed
You make me remember
You speak my name I hear nothing
You share your dreams I see nothing
Unconscious suicide aren't you gone yet
You make me remember things I want
You make me remember things I need
You make me remember things I want to forget
