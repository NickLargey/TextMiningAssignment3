If I didn't have a dime and I didn't take the time
To play the jukebox
Oh, Saturday night would've been a sad
And lonely night for me

And if you weren't standin' there
Ruby lips and golden hair, beside the jukebox
Oh, I'd have lost my chance
To hold you while you danced with me

While the records turn and turn, we danced
And learned our hearts had yearned for this
'Neath the moon we walked and walked and talked
Of love and then we kissed

Now with every sweet caress
Oh, my darling how I bless that little jukebox
Oh, love songs that they sing
Wouldn't mean a single thing

Even though you're standing there
Ruby lips and golden hair
If I didn't have a dime and I didn't take the time
To play the jukebox

Now with every sweet caress
Oh, my darling how I bless that little jukebox
Oh, love songs that they sing
Wouldn't mean a single thing

Even though you're standing there
Ruby lips and golden hair
If I didn't have a dime and I didn't take the time
To play the jukebox
