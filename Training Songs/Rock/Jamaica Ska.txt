Ska ska ska, Jamaica ska.

Not many people can cha cha cha.
Not everybody can do the twist.
But everybody can do the ska,
It's the dance you can't resist.

Ska ska ska, Jamaica ska.

Now everybody can do the ska,
It's new dance that goes like this...

Now bow your head,
Swing your arms,
Shake your hips,
Now do a dip.
