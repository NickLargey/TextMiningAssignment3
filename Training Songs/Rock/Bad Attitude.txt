It's three o'clock in the morning
I'm getting ready for bed
It came without a warning
This paper that I read

How do they know me?
How do they dare?

They spread all their lies around us
Why should they care if they're to blame
I'm just a player in the their game

I've got a bad reputation
I've got a bad attitude
Ain't nobody gonna push me down

Ain't nobody gonna shove me around
I've got a bad, bad, bad reputation

It read that I was down and out
Had no place to go
Then this chick came out of nowhere
Who I don't even know

How do you sleep at night
Knowing the things you do?
It doesn't matter at all
Til it happens to you
