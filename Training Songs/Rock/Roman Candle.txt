He played himself
Didn't need me to give him hell
He could be cool and cruel to you and me
Knew we'd put up with anything

I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames

I'm hallucinating
Hallucinating
I hear you cry your tears
Cheap wet hot red swollen cheeks
Fall asleep

I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames

I want to hurt him
I want to hurt him
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain

Make him feel this pretty burn
