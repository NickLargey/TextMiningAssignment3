I went down to the county drug store
I fought with the county law
I went out with my little boy
And I told him I can't see you no more

The cows in the field are silent
The sun lay an orange back
In blue rounded island
The people could never get back

My dog, my dog, my little black dog
He took a ride on the cuckoo train
He couldn't handle the pain
He took a ride on the cuckoo train

Went back to the shops yesterday
To look at the big blue eyes
She was passing me by, hmmmmmmm
She was passing me by, hmmmmmmm

She was passing by little me
She had love in her eyes I could see alright
Went to select the savers fruits
I had his eyes on the grapefruit tree

????? around and I sat on a stool
Somebody said to me
They said how-diddly-do to you little boy
Would you like ????? get you some ??????

???? a time you can come on home
???????????????????
Somebody hear to me in the holy light
????? by your eyes and get high on the wire
????? by your eyes and get high on the wire
????? by your eyes and get high on the wire
????? by your eyes and get high on the wire
????? by your eyes and get high on the wire
????? by your eyes and get high on the wire
????? by your eyes and get high on the wire

Sucked up my room that's in the ?????
Fucked up my life that's in the glue pot
And I ran down the road
Kicked my shoes in the air
And I
Tripped and fell in the dogshit

Sometimes (* 8)
[Next two lines are repeated and sung over the top of each other]
Put it all down
I fucked it up
