The key is so distant
I've opened doors
Know when to listen
Know what to listen for (yeah)

The shelf in the room
Has been the way of holding me
And letting me stay

Kick me out
Let me go
I don't belong here no more
A releasing sense of getting tired
Hold myself
I can't hold myself

The shelf in the room
Has been so true
I can hide in
The shelf in the room

Holding out
Never hold in
Holding out
Never hold

Know when to listen
Know what to listen for
Believe in resistance
Don't let them tell you anymore
Is there anyway/no
To get away/no
Ask myself
While I stay inside

The key is so distant
I've closed my doors
The shelf in the room
Is rain waiting to pour
