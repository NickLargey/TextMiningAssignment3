Lately I been waking to
The bluest stars that I once slept through
The morning hangs like open chords
That I fill in with my own thoughts and words

I used to worry all the time
But I slowed down to live my life
To live my life now

College campus and warmest grass
We sit and watch the people rush to class
When did we to decide that life had to be
All fasts and cheques, that we lost mystery

We used to worry all the time
But we slowed down to live our lives
To live our lives now

We used to worry all the time
But we slowed down to live our lives
To live our lives now
