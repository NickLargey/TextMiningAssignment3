Controlling my feelings far too long
Controlling my feelings far too long
Controlling my feelings far too long
Controlling my feelings far too long
Forcing our darkest souls to unfold
Forcing our darkest souls to unfold
And pushing us into self destruction
And pushing us into self destruction

They make me
Make me dream your dreams
They make me
Make me scream your screams

Trying to please you far too long
Trying to please you far too long
Visions of greed you wallow
Visions of greed you wallow
Visions of greed you wallow
Visions of greed you wallow

They make me
Make me dream your dreams
They make me
Make me scream your screams

Controlling my feelings far too long
Controlling my feelings far too long
Forcing our darkest souls to unfold
Forcing our darkest souls to unfold
And pushing us into self destruction
And pushing us into self destruction

They make me
Make me dream your dreams
They make me
Make me scream your screams
