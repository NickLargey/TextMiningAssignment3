(D. Vaughn, M. Clayton, B. St.James, M. Hudson)
I count the headlights on the highway spinning 'round
Until the sparkle blurs my eyes
I want to run until I break the speed of sound
So I can't hear the voice inside, where it hides
Where can I look to find the strength to try again?
Who knows a place I can call home?
How can I face a world that's so quick to condemn
A soul that isn't like their own, all alone
Bridge:
Where do we go from here? Running from pain and fear
Where do we go from - here we are, changed forever, always together
Chorus:
Whatever may happen, wherever you go
I will always be with you and you won't walk alone
If ever I stumble, whenever I call, you will be there to catch my fall
You said that you would walk beside me close at hand
You said that love would be my guard
One set of footprints stretched behind me in the sand
You must have carried me this far, and for so long
(bridge)
(chorus)
Road goes on, for so long, we are on our own, but we're not alone
Someone will catch my fall
(Solo)
(bridge)
(chorus)
Whatever may happen, wherever you go
I will always be with you and you won't walk alone
Into every lifetime a little rain will fall
You will be there to catch my fall
(chorus)
(Whatever may happen) to catch my fall
(Wherever you go) ooohoo, (whatever may happen) ooohoo
