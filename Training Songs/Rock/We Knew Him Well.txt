So drink up
Distrust the honest
Singe it after me
From trouble treats outs 
Word of gentleman 
Was I not good enough? 
A ten years still declined 
... mother’s brother
Or he’ll say I’m a brother.
Distrust the honest 
They say that to be blind
He is eccentric
Simple fucking eccentric
He is mistaking luck
Curses over bad 
Control with another...
... hoes and brothers
Distrust the honest
Self ... insanity 
Some say that tend to live ordeal
Self-confessed afraid.

Rise up, good luck!
Rise up, good luck!
Rise up, good luck!
Rise up, good luck!
