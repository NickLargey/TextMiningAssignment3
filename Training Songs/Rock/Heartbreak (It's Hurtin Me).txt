Heartbreak, it's hurtin' me
Weak in the knees, loose in the head
My baby has left me
And I wish that I was dead

Heartbreak, it's hurtin' me
I'm dyin' in the eye
Lost my sense of touch
My baby has left me
I love her so much

Heartbreak, it's hurtin' me
She lead me to believe
That I was all she had
This morning I was happy
Tonight I got 'em bad

Heartbreak, it's killing me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

I know been a fool
How taken I have been
If I see my baby
I'd run to her again

Heartbreak, it's a-hurting me
It's hurting me

If I was a judge
I'd send her to the chair
I'd sit right down beside her
And she wouldn't leave me here
Yea-ah

Heartbreak
It's hurtin' me

Heartbrea-yoo-hoo-hoo, yea-ah

It's what I'll do
