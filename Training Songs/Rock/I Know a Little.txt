Yes sir

Well the bigger the city, well the brighter the lights
Bigger the dog, well the harder the bite
I don't know where you been last night
I think Mama, you ain't doin' right

Say I know a little
I know a little 'bout it
I know a little
I know a little 'bout it
I know little a 'bout love
Baby I'll guess the rest
Yes sir

Well my eyes don't read them daily news
'Cause it ain't hard to figure where people get the blues
They can't dig what they can't use
If they stick to themselves they'd be much less abused

I know a little
Lord, I know a little 'bout it
I know a little
I know a little 'bout it
I know little a 'bout love
Baby I'll guess the rest

Oh play me some more [Incomprehensible]
Yeah

Well if you want me to be your only man
Said, "Listen up Mama, teach you all I can
Do right baby, do by your man
Don't worry Mama, teach you all I can"

Say I know a little
Lord, I know a little 'bout it
I know a little
I know a little 'bout it
I know little a 'bout love
Baby I'll guess the rest

Well I know a little 'bout love
Baby I want your best
Oh, I know a little 'bout love
