Love ain't worth the tears sometimes
There's nothing left in this heart of mine
I've stayed with you but I don't know why
After all you've put me through
How can you lie when you know I can't?
How can you ask for one last chance?
You let it slip right through your hands
And now it's caught up with you
 
I don't make promises I can't break
Not like before
I let you make your last mistake
Don't wanna cry no more
 
You never give back what you take
You only use things 'til they break
How many times must my heart ache
All because of you?
 
I don't make promises I can't break
Not like before
I let you make your last mistake
Don't wanna cry no more
 
Love ain't worth the tears this time
Don't wanna cry
Don't wanna fight
I know whats wrong
And I know what's right
And I know what I have to do
 
I don't make promises I can't break
Not like before
I let you make your last mistake
Don't wanna cry no more
