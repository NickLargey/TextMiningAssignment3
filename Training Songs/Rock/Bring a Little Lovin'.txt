I know that it's ten and you're stayin' in
La la la la la la la la la
And you're stayin' home and I'm all alone
La la la la la la la la la
Won't you won't you won't you
Bring a little water bring a little wine
Bring a little lovin' I feel fine
Know that you want to I know that you do
Come in here and love with me
If I enduring brain but it's all the same
La la la la la la la la la
I'm payin' for this call and I don't mine at all
La la la la la la la la la
Won't you won't you won't you
Bring a little water bring a little wine
Bring a little lovin' I feel fine
Know that you want to I know that you do
Come in here and love with me
Won't you won't you won't you
Bring a little water bring a little wine ...
