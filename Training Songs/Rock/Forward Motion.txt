Whoa-o... I've been banging my head against the wall
Whoa-o... for so long it seems I knocked it down, yeah it got knocked down
Whoa-o... and the heating bill went through the roof
Whoa-o... and the wall I knocked down was the proof
That my landlord needed to kick me out

I got evicted now I'm living on the street
My spirits lifted... oh wait, that wasn't me
Too many turns have turned out to be wrong
This time I learned that, I knew it all along

When car crashes occur
Then I'll be what you were
When I see what I should
When I see that it's good (that it's good)

To experience the bittersweet
To taste defeat
Then brush my teeth
Experience the bittersweet
To taste defeat
Then brush my teeth

'Cause I struggle with forward motion
I struggle with forward motion
We all struggle with forward motion
'Cause forward motion is harder than it sounds
 
Well every time I gain some ground
I gotta turn myself around again
It's harder than it sounds
Well every time I gain some ground
I gotta turn myself around again

Whoa-o... I've been banging my head against the wall
Whoa-o... for so long it seems I got knocked out. yeah, I got knocked out cold
Whoa-o... and the medical bills went through the roof
Whoa-o... and the scar on my head is the proof
That I'll still remember this when I get old

I got evicted now I'm living on the street
My spirits lifted... oh wait, that wasn't me
Too many turns have turned out to be wrong
This time I learned that, I knew it all along

When I grasp the concept
Then I'll sleep where you slept
When I know I need help
When I allow myself (allow myself)

To experience the bittersweet
To taste defeat
Then brush your teeth
Experience the bittersweet
To taste defeat
Then brush your teeth

'Cause I struggle with forward motion
