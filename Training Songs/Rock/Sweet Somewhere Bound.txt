Well I've been thinking, yes I've been thinking
About some women that I know
Some believe me and some deceive me
And some I wish I'd never seen at all

Where will you go now? Where will you go now?
Where will you wander, where will you roam?
Where will you go when the sun goes sinkin',
And the morning brings a new day to be born?

I can't tell you, no I can't tell you
Which train I'm riding, which plane I'm on
But I can tell you, yes I can tell you
I'm standing right where I belong

When I die Lord, when I die Lord
Lay me somewhere soft and deep
Tell my babies not to cry no
For I ain't gone, I'm just fast asleep

I know a man Lord, I know a man Lord,
He had no baby, to call his own
He had nothing, but he had everything
He had the world to call his home
