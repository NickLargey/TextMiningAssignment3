[Chorus:]
This lady got the thickness
Can I get a witness
This lovely lady got the thickness
Can I get a Hell Yeah

Grab them saddlebags and
Toss em over me
Let's ride all night

[Chorus:]

Booty big and delicious
Shake it like she's fearless
This lovely lady got the thickness
Can I get a Hell Yeah

[Chorus:]

Grab them saddlebags and
Toss em over me
This booty got the thickness
Can I get a Hell Yeah
