Pardon me sugar
I'm the man underneath your thumb
But I won't take your violence
And I won't chew your bubblegum

White heat, indiscreet, any day now obsolete
Though you've seen your best days I will still walk down your empty street
Well you look like salvation but you taste like a refugee
You say you've got no soul but you look like you do to me

If I was the melody you were the symphony
Honey loving you took the very best of me
I don't need your red wine covered sympathy
Just another punchline in your stand up tragedy

Well I've been pushing up daisies
Just to catch a glimpse of something real
When I see you coming I might just as well give up and kneel
Well if you saw me broken won't you put me out my misery
Well I don't do handsome and you don't do sympathy

If I was the melody you were the symphony
Honey loving you took the very best of me
I don't need your red wine covered sympathy
Just another punchline in your stand up tragedy

Wrong from the get go
Let it slide
Tell them what they don't know
Sing those praises far and wide

Give those speeches
Ring them bells
Mama don't know what she preaches
But she sure looks dignified
Well she sure looks dignified
Well she sure looks dignified

If I was the melody you were the symphony
Honey loving you took the very best of me
I don't need your red wine covered sympathy
Just another punchline in your stand up tragedy

Take my only guarantee
I could be your slave if you'd only beg for me
I don't need your red wine covered sympathy
Just another punchline in your

Stand up
Sit down
Lie back
Turn round
Play dead
For me
Stand up tragedy
