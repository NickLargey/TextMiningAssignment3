My love is in league with the freeway
Its passion will ride, as the cities fly by
And the tail-lights dissolve, in the coming of night
And the questions in thousands take flight

My love is a miles in the waiting
The eyes that just stare and the glance at the clock
And the secret that burns and the pain that would stop
And it's [Incomprehensible]

Leading me on
Leading me down the road
Driving beyond
Driving me down the road

My love is exceeding the limit
Red-eyed and fevered with the hum of the miles
Distance and longing, my thoughts do collide
Should I rest for a while on the side

Your love is cradled in knowing
Eyes in the mirror, still expecting they'll come
Sensing too well when the journey is done
There is no turning back, no
There is no turning back, on the run

My love is in league with the freeway
Oh with the freeway and the coming of night-time
My love
My love is in league with the freeway
