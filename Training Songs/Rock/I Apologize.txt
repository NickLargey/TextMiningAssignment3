All these crazy mixed up lies
They're floating all around
Making these assumptions brings me down
And you get tight-lipped, how do I know what you think?

Is it something I said when I lost my mind?
Temper too quick, makes me blind

I apologize

Said I'm sorry, now it's your turn,
Can you look me in the eyes and apologize?

So now we sit around staring at the walls
We don't do anything at all
Take out the garbage, maybe, but the dishes don't get done
