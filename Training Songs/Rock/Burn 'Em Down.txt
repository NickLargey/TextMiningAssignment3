At a crossroads in your life
At a point to make a decision
Do you play the game for monetary gain
Or do you follow a code of ethics
Having to deal with some
With the charm of a snake that speaks
With a forked tongue
They'll keep a casual bond to use you later on
Disconnect yourself and get away
Burn your bridges and don't look back

Burn 'em down, Burn 'em down, Burn 'em down,
Gotta burn it

They don't know what it means
Cause all they understand is their greed
They'll never know rewards of the soul
And something to set yourself free
Think of moral wealth
You're the one who's got to live with yourself
You can't hide from the ties that bind
You've got to burn those bridges
And break those ties
Burn those bridges and break those ties

Burn 'em down, Burn 'em down, Burn 'em down,
You're the one who's got to live with yourself,
You've got to
Burn 'em down, Burn 'em down, Burn 'em down,
Gotta burn it

The problem will arise you've got to look deep down inside
You're the one's who's got to live with yourself
So can you smile for a price
Will you stay with those who will only
Drag you down, or do you cut the ties
Stand up for yourself and
Hold your moral ground
Do you stand with those who will only rip you off
Or do you strike the match and don't look back and let 'em
Burn, let 'em burn, burn 'em down

BURN 'EM DOWN, BURN 'EM DOWN
You're the one who's got to live with yourself
You've got to
Burn 'em down, Burn 'em down, Burn 'em down,
Gotta burn it
