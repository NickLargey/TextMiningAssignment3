She is waiting for an answer
She is waiting for the waitress to come back
And the coffee tastes like metal
So she pours in another pack of sugar
Ain't life sweet
No not really
But it will be
If she can just get where she's going to

So she's asking for directions
As she's asking for the cheque
And she feels the truckers staring
So she bums a cigarette
From the big one in the booth
And she laughs inside
Nothing to lose
And everything to find

She's not in love
She's not in love
And she's never been happier
Her heart's not broken
She's not hurt
She's not in love
She's not in love
And she's never been happier in her life

It's late at night on the highway
And the road is all her own
Fireflies and love bugs hit the windshield
And they leave a little glow
And she likes it

Ain't life sweet
Well not always
But it will be
If she can just get where she's going to

She's not in love
She's not in love
And she's never been happier
Her heart's not broken
She's not hurt
She's not in love
She's not in love
And she's never been happier
No she's never been more content
She's never been happier in her life
