We saw the western coast
I saw the hospital
Nurse the shoreline like a wound
Reports of lover's tryst
Were neither clear nor descript
We kept it safe and slow
The quiet things that no one ever knows

Keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired
Then today's the day we drop down
Give up my body in bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals

I contemplate the day we wed
Your friends are boring me to death
Your veil is ruined in the rain
By then you like to do without
There's nothing new to talk about
And though our kids are blessed,
the parents let them shoulder all the blame

Keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired
Today's the day we drop down
Give up my body in bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals

I lie for only you
And I lie well
Halleluh

Keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired
Today's the day we drop down
Give up my body in bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals
