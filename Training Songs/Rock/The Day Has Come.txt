I've been down inside 
Waiting around really makes you tired

Letting another get past by
Time goes slow and I don't know why (don't know why)
Its in my head
Your holding me back I wanna fly instead
Don't feel alive might as well be dead
Maybe I'm wrong but I don't care why (don't care why)

Outside a world full of strangers 
Some I'd really like to know
I wanna stay but the sign says go

I know the day has come
I have just begun
No your never ever, ever gonna see me try
Your never gonna see me do anything but what I like
I know the day has come
We have just begun
No you're never ever, ever gonna see me lie
You're never gonna see me do anything but what I like

I wanna feel the light
Sun arising in the nick of time
I'm never really sure where I belong
I'm all alone and I don't know why (don't know why)
I want to raise my voice
I want to meet those good boys
I want to speak because living life's my choice
Maybe I'm wrong but I don't care why (don't care why)

Outside a world full of answers
Some I'd really like to know
I wanna stay but the sign says go

I know the day has come
I have just begun
No you're never ever, ever gonna see me try
You're never gonna see me do anything but what I like

I know the day has come
We have just begun
No your neve're ever, ever gonna see me lie
Your neve're gonna see me do anything but what I like

I wanna to make some noise (make some noise)
I Wanna to raise my voice (raise my voice)
Cause its what I like
I wanna to make some noise (make some noise)
I Wanna to raise my voice (raise my voice)
(All the sings says go)

I know the day has come
I have just begun
No your never ever, ever gonna see me try
Your never gonna see me do anything but what I like
I know the day has come
We have just begun

No you're never ever, ever gonna see me lie
You're never gonna see me do anything but what I

I know the day has come
I know the day has come (oh I know I know)
I know the day has come
We have just begun
No you're never ever, ever gonna see me lie
You're never gonna see me do anything but what I like
