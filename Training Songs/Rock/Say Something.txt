Tonight is like space invaders
There is nothing at work
The faces have become like traffic
Multi-purpose conversation
I stand like a lighthouse
I have become a lighthouse
But if we met we would exhaust this place
And if you spoke then this world would short-circuit

Say something
Make it a direct hit
Say something
Make me never forget

I don't want to stand and compute
I want days and weeks to burst out of you
I am listening for dear life
I want you to talk like it's a breakthrough
