I used to be Mr. Free, Tall, Dark and Cool
I did a solo act
Made up my own rules
Then you came along
And Changed my point of view
Oh baby what am I going to do?
Just look at me
Looking at you
I can't believe the things
I'm looking forward to
Would you believe I'm thinking about

A two car garage
And a two story house
And a couple of kids
We can brag about
Give me a two-toned Chevrolet
And too many bills to pay
And your two arms
Too make me happy living that way

I used to play such a game
Of hide and seek
I'd go looking for love
And hide if it saw me
You could find with my friends
Hanging out on the street
Now they're wondering where I could be
Well it's Saturday night
And it's just you and me
Snuggled up on the couch
Just watching T-V
Would you believe I'm thinking about

A two car garage
And a two story house
And a couple of kids
We can brag about
Give me a two-toned Chevrolet
And too many bills to pay
And your two arms
Too make me happy living that way

If we don't get to Paris
It won't break our hearts
We'll just pack up the kids
And go to Yellowstone Park

I want a two car garage
And a two story house
And a couple of kids
We can brag about
Give me a two-toned Chevrolet
And too many bills to pay
And your two arms
Too make me happy living that way

All I want is you baby
And your sweet love

All I want is you baby
And a two car garage

All I want is you baby
And a two story house
