It's all right to wait your turn
Watching as the bridges burn
So long, good luck
Promise me you'll keep my name

Take good care
I know you'll be fine
You always came back better now

All hail to myself
Let's see if we can work as one
This lines, not right
This ship crashed before it's time

Take good care
I know you'll be fine
You always came back better now

You're looking good
I'm happy for you now
You're looking real good
Such a shame

In the world of mules there are no rules
In the world of mules there are no rules
In the world of mules there are no rules

In the world of mules there are no rules
There are no rules
There are no rules
There are no rules
There are no rules

I hope your careful when you go to sleep
Won't know what hits you come the morning
Cos it kicks your ass in silence
Every ones too cold to sit and figure you out
Your finger twigs all sick and yellow
It's scaring me to let you know

I'm giving you the chance to see just what
The future holds for you because
I've got this funny sense of guilt
Cos even though I hope that this all happens
I know better than to cry for you
I never wanted you to go
