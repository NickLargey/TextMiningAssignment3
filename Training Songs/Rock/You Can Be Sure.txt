You don't have to be a dreamer
To see a better day
You have to be a believer
Just to find a better way
Don't sit in your seclusion, safely watching from afar

I don't know why, ooh
We don't learn from what's gone by

You can be sure
I'll be with you till the end
You take my word
More than this I can promise you, yeah, yeah

You know, when you feel defenseless
And it brings you to your knees
Don't keep on retreating
What can I do to make you see?

I don't know why
We don't learn from what's gone by

You can be sure
I'll be with you till the end
You take my word
More than this I can promise you, yeah

I don't know why
We don't learn from what's gone by

You can be sure
I'll be with you till the end
You take my word
More than this I can promise you

You can be sure
I'll be with you till the end
Please take my word
Don't you know, you can count on me?
I will always be there for you
