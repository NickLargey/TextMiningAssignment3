Verse 1
They are rock'n'roll rebels
With tea in their bourbon bottles
All tightly dressed up in leather and shades
And they are cute streamline boys
With diamonds in their eyes suckers
I want to wear a guitar and be rough 
'cause it's in now days
Enough!!

Chorus
But I'm not like the others
I just can't be bothered
I won't think the way they do
I won't think the way they do
I'm not omotible, anti controllable
I won't think the way they do

Verse2
They want to conquer the world
With nothing but flashy tattoos
And I'm a bit surprised that so few see through
What they're trying to do
'Cause they all went shopping in the rock-star store
A copy of the big thing the week before
They get a hit then they make one more
Repeat the formula and make me bored
Enough!!

Chorus
But I'm not like the others
I just can't be bothered
I won't think the way they do
I won't think the way they do
I'm not omotible, anti controllable
I won't think the way they do
I won't think the way they do
I just won't think the way they do

Bridge
Our feeble are tent
But no one else seems to ask why
They still haven't changed
And no one seems to give it a try

I'm not like the others
I won't think the way they do
I won't think the way they do

I'm not omotible, anti controllable
I won't think the way they do
I won't think the way they do
I won't think they way they do
I won't think they way they do / anti controllable
I won't think they way they do / not omotible
I won't thing the way they do / anti controllable
I won't think they way they do / not omotible
Just won't think the way they do / antiâ€¦
