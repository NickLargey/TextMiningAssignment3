Take the rings off your fingers
as if they were tears
and find a new kind of beauty
to put a silver lining on your golden years
All your clever talk and your glamour
bright lies you don't hear anymore
You've gone so far out
all you want is the tide to take you  back to the shore

Take courage
Take courage said the sign  
You used to wait for it every morning
Now you are looking so dumb
and they don't see you standing there
Trying to figure out why all your promises
left you hanging in mid-air
And you lost your war of words,
but your heart was strong.
You said, "the dirt can have my pretty things,
but to the earth my heart does not belong.  
if we could walk without our crutches would they have anyting to see. 
take the rings off your fingers. as if they were tears
cause all the diamonds are hollow and ring painfully in our ears. and if you want someone to help you. don't get carried away. last thing you need right now is a lesson in humility.
take courage. take courage. said the sign. you used to wait for it every morning. every morning. every morning. but now you see that it was just another woman.
