Once again I've messed it up
At cigarettes and coffee cups
But most of time we make it out
We'll make it through this

Lying here on carpet stone
I feel I've let your safety zone
But how can I feel so alone
If I'm here with you..

Promises I made to keep
Let's find the words before we sleep
There's nothing left for you and me
Nothing left to hide

And when the ceilings come crashing through
Be standing there me and you
The ceilings come crashing through
Then they'll see
You and me, you and me

Every word on every page
They speak to me of better days
Of how we used to wanna fight
For everything we thought was right
And what we believe

I know we cared of everything
Some times we're holding on by strings
But what we have where we deserved
That's you and me against the world
That's what I believe

And promises are made to keep
Let's find the words before we sleep
There's nothing left by for and me
Nothing left to hide

And when the ceilings come crashing through
Be standing there me and you
The ceilings come crashing through
Then they'll see you and me,
You and me, you and me

And when the ceilings come crashing through
Be standing there me and you
The ceilings come crashing through
Then they'll see you and me,
You and me, you and me
