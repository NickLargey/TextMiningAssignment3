River to sea
There we will be
I've found my place
Where I have longed to be
I can't erase any mistake
But I can outgrow
Rivers of love will flow
Turn around
Your life is in your hands
Nowhere to be
Found plenty things to be
Unleashing hell

Each time the answers fell
I cannot change any man's hate
But I can make known
Forgiving waters that flow
Turn around
Your life is in your hands
Don't mean you won't wake from the dead
It don't mean you can't
It don't mean you you can't wake from the dead
Don't mean you can't
