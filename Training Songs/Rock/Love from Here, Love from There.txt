Sensation sweet at my feet,
Such a strong appetite.
With love from here, love from there,
You only get one bite.

With love from here, love from there,
When everybody went stag,
With love from here, love from there,
Everybody was a drag.

Sensation sweet at my feet,
Working up to the loin.
With love from here, love from there,
They look you straight in the groin.

With love from here, love from there,
When everybody went stag,
With love from here, love from there,
Everybody was a drag.
