The tree don't care what the little bird sings
We go down with the dew in the morning light
The tree don't know what the little bird brings
We go down with the dew in the morning

And we breathe it in
There is no need to forgive
Breathe it in
There is no need to forgive

The trees will stand like pleading hands
We go down with the dew in the morning light
The trees all stand like pleading hands
We go down with the dew in the morning

And we breathe it in
There is no need to forgive
Breathe it in
There is no need to forgive

The trees will burn with blackened hands
We returned with the light of the evening
The trees will burn, blackened hands
Nowhere to rest, no where to land

And we know who you are
And we know where you live
And we know there's no need to forgive

And we know who you are
And we know where you live
And we know there's no need to forgive

And we know who you are
And we know where you live
And we know there's no need to forgive

And we know who you are
And we know where you live
And we know there's no need to forgive again
