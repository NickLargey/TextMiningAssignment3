I've been waiting patiently for the crowd to gather in
To read off my demands on the news this evening
I have not asked for much
But I want what I can't afford
Just to find myself a mess
At the steps to her door
At the steps to her door
At the steps to her door

This situation is out of my hands
I am the crossbearer in the crosshairs
Come in and get me
This situation is out of my hands
I got a new prayer for a new plan
Come in and get me

I'm making all this up
As the eyes follow along
No lines between the dots
It's the right time going wrong
We wanted something more
Than we could ever regret
And I don't ever learn
But I know I forget
I know I forget
I know I forget

This situation is out of my hands
I am the crossbearer in the crosshairs
Come in and get me
This situation is out of my hands
I got a new prayer for a new plan
Come in and get me

Didn't the dogs get the scent
Do you kids get the sense
I've come undone
Didn't the dogs get the scent
Do you kids get the sense
I've come undone

With all the love in the world
We're still one foot in the grave
For the love of god, put your sights on my heart
When all the eyes are upon me
I'm sure I'll freeze to the spot
For the love of god, put your sights on my heart

When it comes for us
Like I know it will
When it comes it takes us in its arms

This situation is out of my hands
I am the crossbearer in the crosshairs
Come in and get me
This situation is out of my hands
I got a new prayer for a new plan
Come in and get me
This situation is out of my hands
I am the crossbearer in the crosshairs
Come in and get me
Come in and get me
Come in and get me

Didn't the dogs get the scent
Do you kids get the sense
I've come undone
Didn't the dogs get the scent
Do you kids get the sense
I've come undone
