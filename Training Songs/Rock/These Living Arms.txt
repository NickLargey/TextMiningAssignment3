So a crowd he gathered around us 
I'm pining one last kiss 
I'm struggling with the lifeline 
In the shadow of this bliss 
Patience my love it'll all be alright 

But ain't it funny how the fates work 
I feel cheated by the turn 
Still this love it hovers over us 
And the lessons that we've learned 
Patience my love it'll all be alright 

With your arms around me 
You're singing softly 
And I fade from memories 
And move on 

We were lost inside a wasteland 
Of fools groping for the gold 
I wonder if they'll think of us 
Whlie they're still searching for their souls 
Patience my love it'll all be alright 

With your arms around me 
You're singing softly 
And I fade from memories 
And move on 

So never put it out my love 
The spirit is the flame that burns within 
And it'll all be alright 

Sleep now is descending like a dream 
Still I'm shaking from the softness 
Of your skin 
Hold on to me 
And it'll all be alright 

With your arms around me 
You're singing softly 
And I fade from memories 
And move on 
May nothing harm you 
I'm still inside you 
With my wings around you 
You'll go on 

Sweet lover go on 
My love be strong
