I'm sitting here with a gun
Trying to figure out what I've done
Now I just wanted to rob this place
But they forced me to shoot them

No way out
Police cards and swat teams are outside
No way out
They tell me to come out, but I'll stay inside 

It started out a simple robbery
But someone ran so I had to shoot
Everybody out there wants my blood
So I'll stay in here and take my chances
