Rosemary, Rosemary, please take my hand
And walk with me through Lover's Land
Rosemary, Rosemary, by stars above
I vow right now, you'll have my love

(x2):
You are like an angel dressed in white, so heavenly
You can answer all my prayers tonight by loving me
Rosemary, Rosemary, please say you're mine
So I can love you all the time
