Marta, Rambling rose of the wildwood
Marta, with your fragrance divine
Rosebud, of the days of my childhood
Watched you bloom in the wild wood
and I hoped you'd be mine.

Marta, now your eyes beam at twilight
sparkling like each dewdrop at dawn
Marta, when I look for your love light
I awake with a sigh
and I find you are gone.
