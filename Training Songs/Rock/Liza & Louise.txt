Liza's had enough of men,
She says, she won't get burned again,
She says, they don't know how to f*ck,
Her last boyfriend, the shmuck,
Shared with her a nice disease,
Kept her passive, on her knees,
Till one day she took his car,
And drove it to the city.

Liza had put down a few,
When she met this girl named Lou,
Who convinced her to go home with her,
She said, "My name's Louise,
Now would you take your clothes off please?
I want to take you to the moon and back,
So get on your back."

With a flick of the tongue,
She made her scream,
She made her laugh ,
She made her dance,
She was happy for the first time,
And you know she wanted more.

Now with her legs spread wider,
She needed to have Louise inside her,
She said, "I'll never forget the first time you kissed me,
Now I want you to fist me."
Louise didn't need a second invitation,
She knew just what to do,
Yeah she knew just what to do.
Liza had cum a few times before,
But she had never even seen the door,
Into the world of pleasures of the flesh,
She felt just like 16,
And her life before now was a dream,
Or even a nightmare that's over and done,
Just like warm healing rays,
Shining from the sun.

They make her beam,
They make her laugh,
They make her dance.
She was happy for the first time,
And you know she wanted more.
You know she wanted more.
You know she wanted more.
