I have had my eyes on you
Oh since the day
I learned to laugh at myself
Caught you laughing too

Then you went your way
Oh and I went mine
It's strange that in another place
That joke should hit me in my face

But you oh you make it so hard baby
To say no no no oh
You yes you baby
Make it so hard to say no no no no

All that glitters is not gold
Just like good jokes get old
That spark that makes you think of me
Don't make things like they used to be

You might say that I have changed
Its just that things are rearranged

And as I once looked out for you
Now its your turn to see me through

'Cause you oh baby you make it so hard girl
To say no no no no
You oh baby you make it so hard

You know I tried to get you out of my mind
But now I'm to the point I find
I just can't leave and not have kissed you
You know I could never resist you

'Cause you oh you make it so hard
To say no no no no
You oh you're making it so hard baby
To say no oh to say no no no no
You are making it so hard
