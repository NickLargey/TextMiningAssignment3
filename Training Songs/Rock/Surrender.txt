Waking to the silence of this quality
The one the angels decided to hand down
For the beauty of the deeds that are forgiven
I surrender and I lay me down

For Michael and Gabriel who hold me
And the wings that make the silence of that sound

[PRE-CHORUS:] And for the tender touch that comes when I stop to listen

[CHORUS:]
I surrender, I lay me down
For the letting go of all I hold so tightly
Releasing clouds and silver linings of my mind
Finding ways to see all of my horizons

For mothers and fathers who may guide
For the courage to breathe the words of fire and love
And looking out with freedom to abandon

[PRE-CHORUS:] And for the tender touch that comes when I stop to listen
[CHORUS:]
I surrender, I lay me down
Breathing with the silence of this quality
The grace the angels decided to hand down
For the beauty of the deeds that are forgiven
I surrender and I lay me down

[CHORUS:]
I surrender, I lay me down
I surrender, I lay me down
