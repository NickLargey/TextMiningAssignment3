I don't care for cruel confrontations
I don't care for cool conversations
I don't care much for a life of crime
I don't care much for violent times

But I care about love
And I care about truth
And I care about trust
And I care about you
And I care about us

I don't care about the art of war
I hate to think of what all this killing's for
I don't care for all this competition
Fortune tellers, superstitions

But I care about love
And I care about truth
And I care about trust
And I care about you
And I care about us

I don't care for phony affectations, oh no
I don't care for this manipulation, oh no
I don't care much for forced affection
I don't care to pursue perfection

But I care about love
And I care about truth
And I care about trust
And I care about you
And I care about us
And I care about us
