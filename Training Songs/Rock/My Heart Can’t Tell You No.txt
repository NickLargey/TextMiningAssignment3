I don't want you to come round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me

'Cause when you said it over with him
I want to believe it's true
So I let you in knowing tomorrow
I'm gonna wake up missing you, wake up missing you

When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture, I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself this time I won't lose control
One look in your blue eyes and suddenly my heart can't tell you, "No"

I don't want you to call me up no more
Saying you need me
You're crazy if you think just half your love
Could ever please me

Still I want to hold you, touch you
When you look at me that way
There's only one solution I know
You gotta stay away from me, stay away from me

When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture, I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself this time I won't lose control
One look in your sad eyes and suddenly my heart can't tell you, "No"
My heart can't tell you, "No"

I don't want you to come round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me

'Cause when you say it's over with him
I want to believe it's true
So I let you in knowing tomorrow
I'm gonna wake up missing you, wake up missing you

When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture, I mean it's a living hell
When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture, I mean it's a living hell, a living hell
