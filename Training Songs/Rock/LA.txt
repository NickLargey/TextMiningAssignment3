LA, can't believe I found love in the city of LA
LA, it's the city of angels, it can take you anywhere
LA, LA, LA, we found love in LA, LA, LA
We found love

In the city of the gang bang
Yeah, we still dying over red and blue stripes
Chuck my set up and it feel good
'Cause don't nobody love you more than your neighborhood
We always had bitches, we don't love those
Grew up around the gangsters and the cutthroats
Be careful where you at, you might get bust on
Yeah, all my South Central niggas, Inglewood, twist your fingers up
Compton and Watts, Eastside, always turning up
Bad bitches up at Greystone and Supperclub
Tell 'em where we're from like

LA, can't believe I found love in the city of LA
LA, it's the city of angels, it can take you anywhere
LA, LA, LA, we found love in LA, LA, LA
We found love

God, let me right my wrongs, God, let me write this song
God in the middle with a month
Let me hit the pawn shop, momma said we need a loan
God, let me dedicate this to the 80% that ain't never coming home
God, let me know you exist
In a city where a hundred hollow-tips get thrown
I'm off that Centennial
Fuckin' at the party, nigga, at the party, we fade ten or more
My hood came thinkin' we yellin', "We in this bitch"
Then we yellin', "We in your bitch"
Or you tellin' all of us our dwellin' inside of 2Pacalypse, thug life
And we off that whoopty-whoopty-whoop
And we in that hoopty with the two choppers
So we're guaranteed to shoot
Lock us in the L.A. County zoo
Watch us eat a bear alive and ooh
This feels so good to keep it true
This feels so good, I'm keepin' you
Hope I'm teachin' you all the lessons I learned
When I made that turn off the 110
Watch that marijuana just burn
This shit just make you wanna just sin
See that Staples Center high earnin' if the Lakers get me a win
I'm gon' liquor shot in memory of Pac, Makaveli live again
Bitch, I'm in L.A. yeah, yeah, motherfucker

LA, can't believe I found love in the city of LA
LA, it's the city of angels, it can take you anywhere
LA, LA, LA, we found love in LA, LA, LA
We found love

My nigga so many fell down 'round here and they won't tell
And I ain’t talking love girl but I know how you feel
And you've been living in fear
Remember I'm right here
They got your world on wheels
Girl let’s roll through them hills off the ten
Rolling, with ya cousin and 'em
Real shit ain't nobody fake, they is and they ain't from

City of LA, city of LA (City of LA)
City of LA, South Central, Inglewood
City of LA, Compton, Long Beach, Watts City, LA

LA, can't believe I found love in the city of LA
LA, it's the city of angels, it can take you anywhere
LA, LA, LA, LA we found love in LA, LA, LA
We found love
