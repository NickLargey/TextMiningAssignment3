Talk to me 'bout fantasy
You talk to me 'bout love
You filled me with empty promises
You promised sky above
You ask me what I'd do for you
Give my life and more
But would it keep you satisfied
Baby I'm not sure
I change myself most everyday
But you don't reply
How can we survive
I can't change the world
If I tried would it make you happy
I can't change the world
This timei can't change the world
From soft lips you speak to me
How's it gonna be
Everyday's a different story
Changing all the time
You come to me with promises
I listen as you speak
But the promise that you want the most
Is not for me to keep
You leave me on this withered vine / now
Stripped away and torn
Left with only fantasy
Dreams of nevermore
I can't change the world
If I tried would it make you happy
This timei can't change the world
Never said that I held the answers
I can't change the world
I'd give my spirit if you tried
A fortune lost a heart denied
I come to you in your sleep
My heart is yours for only you to keep
And when the days they pass me you will see
I can't change the world
If I tried would it make you happy
I can't change the world
This time
I can't change the world
I never said I held the answers
I can't change the world
This time
I can't change the world
Change the world
