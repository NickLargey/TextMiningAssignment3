F*ck you and your stupid smile
You make me want to strangle you
F*ck you and your disco flavor
Hot sauce on your snake skin boots

Hey you forgot your rag bag
Your sixty-nine sedan
Hey you fucking fag hag
Drop trou tossed salad man

Sucking on my thumb just like the child you think I am
You've managed to convince yourself but I don't think you can
Manage me! me, me, me
Life based on a short story

Written by a bitch named Vern
In a maroon velour sweat suit
Playing with your brand new urn
Shit has he lost his mind

Can he see or is he just blind
Sucking on your brains like the zombies want to revive
You could talk me into fucking you but I don't think you'd survive
Survive me! me, Survive me! me

It's your own technique anyway
With all the foam in your mouth when you say...
It's freedom rock baby
Turn it up here's how to order this

F*ck uncle shifter's got the night towel
I'd kiss you but you're covered in piss
Punk are you threatening me
Your style is faulty while mine is the best

Spock have you lost your mind
Are sure full duration is best
I'm sucking on your life just like the hole you're living in
You're complaining all the time but now the sucking really begins

With me!
