One, two, three, four 
You're my honeybee
I like you and you like me
It's easy can't you see
So won't you get up and dance with me
Yes I'll be waiting there for you
Yes I'll just be waiting there for you
Downtown is where it's at
Don't forget to bring your coat and hat
Take me out for tea
There's a little place that I know you might like to be
Yes I'll be waiting there for you
Yes I'll just be waiting there for you
Hey! I haven't got all day
Turn off the microwave
I'll dump the vacuum cleaner
Alright! My feet are feeling light
Let's step on out tonight
I think I've got the fever
Yes I'll be waiting there for you
Yes I'll just be waiting there for you
