Well I run through the kitchen looked in the paper
Said, oh God almighty, mama, there it says a gator, come on, come on
Every other day I got a gator on my lawn
Well you dropped your groceries in the kitchen sink
Went to work and made the bathroom stink, come on, come on
Every other day I got a gator on my lawn

Get with it Mike!

Well I jumped out of bed run across the street
Asked my neighbor said, where's my meat? 
I had a red raw steak can't find it anywhere
He looked at me and said, what the hell do I care? come on
Every other day I got a gator on my lawn

Yeah I run in the kitchen looked in the paper
Said, oh God almighty, mama, there it says a gator, come on, come on
Every other day I got a gator on my lawn
Well every other day I got a gator on my lawn
Every other day I got a gator on my lawn
