Wait behind 
Wait behind 
Wait behind 

Shadows still with us
The tides are with us
Silent sorrow with us
As long as there’s no forgiveness
Wait behind
Owl above places of the dead
And I have to believe everything she said
As long as there’s no forgiveness
Wait behind
Hymns still close to your ears
That you can still hear
Graves still close to the water
Moon still walking the shore
That mule’s head still in the sycamore
Waiting behind
Let me go, let me go, let me go
So I can wait behind
