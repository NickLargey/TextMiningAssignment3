Wasn't meant to be 
So long in silence 
But it took so long 
To belong 
I'm bored out of my tiny mind 
If this is all it is 
Then you're gone to heaven 
Race you to the high 
Openings 
I never knew of 
This is my time 
This is my time 

Wasn't meant to be 
So down underground 
Now I see the sun 
And I feel like something good is gonna happen 
It could always be 
That you're there 
And I'm here 
We'll play around 
And then 
Sleep until the nightime comes 

This is my time 
This is my time 

You want to high 
You want to fly 
Your feet are in the underground 
And different is indifference and 
Nobody's going to hear you boy 
But scream on dream on 

Wasn't meant to be 
So long in silence 

This is my time 
This is my time 
This is my time 
This is my time 
This is my time 

Coming home 
Coming home 

To you
