Chop down the cherry trees on Mango Street 
That's the council for you every week 
I'm just the kind of seafaring guy 
Who waits for the tide and the town to get high 
I don't like to do a drop of work 
Drive in cab nor paint the church 
It's been the same since I don't know when 
So I'm going Island hopping again 
Casper the suspicious ghost 
He floats the cargo down the coast 
But that's to risky for a man like me 
Whose face is known in the territory 
I'm like a fly in Harry's Bar 
don't use my wings don't walk to far 
It's been the same since I don't know when 
So I'm going island hopping again 
Been the same since I don't know when 
But I'm going Island hopping again 
Now papa Hemingway he rent this boat 
With U.S bills I'm sure she'll float 
And I ain't buying on the street 
Gotta couple of merchants that I gotta meet 
I'm waiting here for the firebell to ring 
So I can watch somebody doing something 
Its been the same since I don't know when 
So I'm going Island hopping again 
Been the same since I don't know when 
But I'm going Island hopping again
