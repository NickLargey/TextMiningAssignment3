Susie - every alchemical f*ck's a Massacio exchange 
Sex for desire 
Desire for obscenity 
And ultimately desire for pain 

And I love you 
And I hate you 
I remember the time 
That I mind raped you 

Never say repression 
Unless you're ready to mean it, baby 
Candy cane sunrise refracted in your eyes 
Candy cane sunrise refracted in your eyes 

Through the valley of death with sea air 
Flowers on your breath 
And in your hair 

Somebody's sugar daddy 
(hand in hand with a perfect tan)

You know you get so alone 
Where the hell is that promise 
Where the hell is my world 
You know you get so alone 

Like snakes detecting infrared 
Exuded by some juicy prey 
Slip the girl a little dust 
It makes 'em more receptive 
Feel the serpent twisting up the spine
