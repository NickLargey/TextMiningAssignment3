I see them look at me
When I'm passing by
I see their faces turn
I see them wondering why
When I'm walking down the street
They see my scarred-up face
It's the cross I bear, I stand on trial
Every fuckin' day

When we're walking down the road,
With our tattooed arms and rings in our ears
They're just afraid of the unknown
They try to blame us for their fears
So why should I even try?
What's the use anyway?
You'll never know what it's like
To be convicted every day

You will never understand, that this is the way it's gotta be
You will never understand, what this life means to me

I see them point their fingers
They call us the enemy
The media likes to portrait us as
The rejects of society
You're just looking for a scapegoat
Someone who can easily be blamed
But I'll never except my part
To be crucified for your mistakes

You will never understand, that this is the way it's gotta be
You will never understand, what this life means to me
