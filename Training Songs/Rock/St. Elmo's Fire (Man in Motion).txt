Growin' up you don't see the writing on the wall
Passin' by, movin' straight ahead you knew it all
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain,
You'll find you're all alone everything has changed

Play the game you know you can't quit until it's won
Soldier of only you can do what must be done
You know, in some ways you're a lot like me
You're just a prisoner, and you're tryin' to break free

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher 
Gonna be your man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where the future's lying St. Elmo's fire 

Burning up don't know just how far that I can go 
Soon be home only just a few miles down the road
And I can make it, I know I can
You broke the boy in me, but you won't break the man 

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher
Gonna be your man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where the future's lying St. Elmo's fire

I can climb the highest mountain, cross the widest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burning in me, burning in me
Just once in his life a man has his time
And my time is now I'm comin' alive

I can hear the music playin' I can see the banners fly
Feel like a vet again. I hope I ain't high

Gonna be your man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels 
Take me where the future's lying St. Elmo's fire

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher
Gonna be your man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where the future's lying St. Elmo's fire

I can climb the highest mountain, cross the widest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burning in me, burning in me
I can feel burning, uh uh inside of me
