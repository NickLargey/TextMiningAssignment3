This one's for you
This one's for me
This one's for you
This one's for me

I've got a nervous feeling over you
But who am I fooling,
I like airline food

I need to feel whole
I need to feel young again
I need to be bold
And start using my tongue again

They can laugh as they cry
They can cut till I bleed
But I ain't losing
'cause this one's for me
