Yeah, well I can't take it no more 'cause I'm going on a shopping spree, yeah
Well I can't save no money cause I spent it on a shopping spree, yeah

Flagstaff, Arizona
It's been two weeks on the road with Sean na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na na
One day before we did play
We penned a song by us, for us
We didn't have the verse but we had the chorus:

Yeah, well I can't take it no more 'cause I'm going on a shopping spree, yeah
Well I can't save no money cause I spent it on a shopping spree, yeah

After the show, there's nowhere to go
Everywhere's packed with white baseball hat frat boys
So we end up at this empty place
Got a flaming doc
The Dali Llamas were the band scheduled to rock
Benny Na Na looks at me
I think I hear what he's saying
"Atom, do you hear what they're playing?"
They're going shopping

Yeah, well I can't take it no more 'cause I'm going on a shopping spree, yeah
Well I can't save no money cause I spent it on a shopping spree, yeah

Shopping spree (x4)
So Dali Llamas...whatever
Spelled Salvador Dali and the animal, how clever
You have a five string fretless bass
You stole our song, now we rock your face

I can't take it no more 'cause I'm going on a shopping spree, yeah
Well I can't save no money cause I spent it on a shopping spree, yeah
Yeah
