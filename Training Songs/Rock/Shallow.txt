I want to awake
I am too away

And when you say I go away and I can't stay
I know I'm done, I'm done
And when you say you'll stay awake and we're away
I know it's done, so done

I won't sit here
I won't be here
I won't take it
I won't break it
In two

Awake
I'm too
Away

I won't sit here
I won't stay here
I won't sit here
In two
