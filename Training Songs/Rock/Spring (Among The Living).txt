Boy, I was ready
Boy, I was ready for spring
It's beauty changes
Changes everything
Done hibernating
We animals roam
Out of our holes
Then we spend all Spring
Looking for the next one to go down

Among the living
Among the living again
Out in the light of day's warm embrace again
(One, two, three, four)

Among the living
Among the living again
I didn't think I'd make it

Among the living
Among the living again
Out in the light of day's warm embrace again
(One, two, three, four)

Ooh yeah
Among the living again, yeah
Again, oh yeah
