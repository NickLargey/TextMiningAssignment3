Got guns 
Do you wanna take aim at each other?
Scratch the itch? Give the finger?
'Cause we don't care

Anyway

Got knives,
Have you seen 'em?
In your back's where we keep 'em
And your never gonna reach 'em
Now that sounds fair

Oh, this is bound to be good
You can't, but you thought that you could

How you like your position?
You ain't Robert Mitchum
You say you give and you give
Why don't you just give in?

Tra la la

Young, dumb, drinkin semen
Small pond kind of dreamin'
If you don't like the raft,
Why don't you take a swim?

Ooh, this is bound to be good
You can't, but you thought that you could
Ooh, how can you win?
Against yourself again
