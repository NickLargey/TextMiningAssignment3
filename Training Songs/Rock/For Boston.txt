For Boston for Boston, we sing our proud refrain for Boston 
For Boston 'tis wisdom's earthly fame
For here are all one and our hearts are true 
And the towers on the heights reach the heavens own blue.
For boston for boston 'til the echoes ring agin!

For Boston for Boston thy glory is our own
For Boston for Boston 'tis here that truth is known
And ever with a right shall our heirs be found 
'Til time shall be no more and thy work is crowned
For Boston for Boston thy glory is our own!
