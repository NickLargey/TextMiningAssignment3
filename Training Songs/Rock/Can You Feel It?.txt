I woke up late this morning
I pulled myself right out of bed.
Right outside my window,
The rain was fallin' hot as lead.
So I drank a pint of rum,
'Till rushed up to the top of my head.
Then lookin' kinda pale,
I drank a glass of ale again.

Lift a toast to the past,
Drink to the future at last.
Then fill another glass,
'Cause it's comin' up much too fast.

Now runnin' through the streets,
Lookin' for some hospitality.
I found the nearest inn,
Asn I had a fifth of gin sent to me.
When I saw a small dispute,
Over girls of ill repute, naturally.
Then the lights went out,
And I took a subtle hint to leave.

Lift a toast to the past,
Drink to the future at last,
Then fill another glass,
'Cause it's comin' up much too fast.

[Chorus]
Can you feel it, Can you feel it at all?
Can you feel it, Can you feel it at all?

Sittin' on a fence,
Breaking your defense for affection.
Watchin' every move,
Though you haven't got a clue or suspicion.
You know you're looking fine,
But you're thinkin' there's some kind of connection.
You're asking is that all,
Lookin' through a crystal ball for direction.

Lift a toast to the past,
Drink to the future at last.
Then fill another glass,
'Cause it's comin' on much too fast.

[Chorus: x2]
