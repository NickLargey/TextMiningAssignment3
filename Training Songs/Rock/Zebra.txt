I can be loud man, I can be silent
I could be young or I could be old.
I can be a gentleman, I can be violent.
I could turn hot or I can be cold.
I could be just like the calm before the storm
Waiting for all hell yeah to break loose.
I could be innocent or I could be guilty
Doesn't mean that I man believe in no noose

I could be rich like a wandering Gypsy
I could be poor like a fat wallet lost.
I could be first or I could come last
Its not who breaks the ribbon
It's how you get across.
I could be red blue black and white sunset
Darkest at day man brightest at night
I could be the sun man I could be the moon
I'm made up from the stars man
I shining so bright.

I could be asleep man, I could be awake
I can be alive or be the walking dead
I can be ignorant, I could be informed
I could lead my life or i could be led
I can be anything i put my mind to man,
all i gotta do is give myself half a chance
I can bring love back into my life
and share it with the world if i got some balance
