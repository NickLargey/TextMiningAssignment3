And I'm hearing the whispers from my window
And I'm hearing something scratching on the inside
Could I feel the sea beckoning me
Oh, could it be can I see?

Voices
On the air
Voices
On the air

And I'm feeling like a moody situation
And I feel the waves laughing with contempt
Could I feel my senses leaving me?
Oh, could it be can I see?

Voices
On the air
Voices
On the air

Voices
On the air
Could it be can I see?
Voices
