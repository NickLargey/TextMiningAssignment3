Don't let your white dress wear you out 
Oh, honey it's the look in your eyes
Oh, 'cause honey I can see you

All my life
I'd hurt the ones I loved
But baby you could turn it round

She don't love me like you
She don't know what you do
And it's so hard
She don't care what you say
So just say it, say it anyway
It's so hard

All my life
Oh they tried to push me down
Oh, but baby you can turn it round
Oh, but honey I still see you

Don't let your friends tell you why
'Cause I'm a bad bad bad I'm the one 
Oh, but baby you can turn it on

She don't love me like you
She don't know what you do
And it's so hard
She don't care what you say
So just say it, say it anyway
It's so hard

All those years gone by
I only want to find a way to make it hard for you
All those years gone by
I only want to find a way to make it hard for you

She'll never forget if the way that she wished she don't feel the same
I only want to find a way to make it hard for you
She'll never forget if the way that she wished she don't feel the same
I only want to find a way to make it hard for you
She'll never forget if the way that she wished she don't feel no pain
I only want to find a way to make it up to you
She'll never forget if the way that she wished she don't feel the same
No, I only want to find a way
I only want to find
I only want to find

She don't love me like you
She don't love me like you
She don't love me like you
She don't love me like you
She don't love
No she don't
