Get out of bed, pick up the phone, time to tell the press 
Say to myself, I can't do no one else, there's a whole world outside 
I'm gonna tell it all, I'm gonna sell it all, I'm gonna sell 
Get out of bed, come out and sing, blue skies ahead, the man who told 
everything 
And I feel, like I'm losing my head, I didn't mean to stay 
Lives have been wrecked and I've picked up my cheque, catch a plane out of here 
I'm gonna get out of here, I'm gonna get out of here, I'm gonna sell
