Guard your dreams at night
Lock your heart up tight
It could happen to you

Don't count stars
Or you may stumble
Someone drops a sigh
An' down you tumble

Keep an eye on spring
Run when church bells ring
It could happen to you

All I did was wonder
How your arms would be?
And it happened to me

All I did was wonder
How your arms would be?
And it happened to me
