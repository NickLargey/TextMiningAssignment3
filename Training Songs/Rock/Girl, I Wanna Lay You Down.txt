Girl I wanna lay you down Jack johnson 
I come over early in the morning
I'm like a heat wave, without warning
And when I touch you my heart begins to flutter
'cause you're smooth and creamy like peanut butter

Girl I wanna lay you down
I said girl I wanna lay you down 

I'm gonna flood you, like a love river
Awe baby the post man, is about to deliver
Cook you up some dinner, a little pasta
Listen to some music, a little Rasta

I said girl I wanna lay you down, 
I said girl I wanna lay you down,
(Girl I wanna lay you down)
Aww baby baby
Don't you no I need your love!

So turn out the lights, bring out the candles,
Wrap your arms around my love handles,
They say the passion may not always endure,
But this feeling that I have for you is burning up my world

girl I wanna lay you down oooohhh
I said girl I wanna lay you down
Girl I wanna lay you down
I said Girl I wanna lay you down
I said Girl I wanna lay you down
Girl I wanna lay you down
