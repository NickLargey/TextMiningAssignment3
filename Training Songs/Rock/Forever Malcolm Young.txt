Never seem to be in front
Or part of the exciting times
Destined for a life of second best
The blackmail not the bribe
Together now whatever work has gone unsung
He'll be forever Malcolm Young
Always gnocchi not linguine
Never Hitler you're Mussolini
Often the sideshow but never the circus
Always Malcolm never Angus
End up Carlton you want to be Negus
Single pluggers never sneakers
Always headphones never speakers
Shouldn't have a complex coz
He wrote Highway To fucking Hell
Together now whatever work has gone unsung
He'll be forever Malcolm Young
Don't be too cocky coz he wrote Stiff Upper Lip as well
Together now whatever work has gone unsung
He'll be forever Malcolm Young
