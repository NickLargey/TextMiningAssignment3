Fly, just swoop and soar and spin 
Glide above what you have been 
And in a moment's time the youth and the sunlight are all gone 
You're in a dimly lit room, wonderin' how you're gonna carry on 

Is it really right, is it really right? 
Is it really, really feelin' right? 

Climb, there's no ceiling now for you 
Soar and forget what you might do 
Another love is won or lost in the turn of a card 
Sittin' with an old friend talkin' wonderin' why it has to be so hard 

Is it really right, is it really right? 
Is it really, really feelin' right? 

Ooh, where does the time go? 
Ooh, where does the love that's lost end up, I wanna know? 
Ooh, where do the years run so fast 
Hold on 
Hold on 

Fly, just swoop and soar and spin 
Glide above what you have been 
And in a moment's time the youth and the sunlight are all gone 
You're in a dimly lit room, wonderin' how you're gonna carry on 

Is it really right, is it really right? 
Is it really, really feelin' right? 

Is it really right? 
Is it really right? 
I hear the young girls cryin' 
I hear the young men sighin' 
Every day, every night 
I keep on wonderin' is it really right?
