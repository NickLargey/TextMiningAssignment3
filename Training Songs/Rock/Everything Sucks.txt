There's a ska band on my street  a little ska band 
Everybody thinks they're so fuckin' neat  
There was nothin' on the radio 
Was gonna make my own band  play my own shows 

But that don't work so I'm givin' up again  
She said she loved me cause I played guitar 
That's ok  I didn't love her at all and I say
I'm givin' up 

I know everything sucks  and this is gonna be the last 
Time you hear me complain 

Well, I went down to the show 
Everybody was there, I didn't want to go 
Cause everything they do is so fuckin' cool, every song is a hit and the 
Girls like 'em too, I can't do that so 

I'm givin' up again, I don't know why I learned 
To play guitar, nobody's gonna know who we are and I say 

I'm givin' up 
I know everything sucks and this is gonna be 
The last time you hear me complain 

She said, some day, we'll get back together maybe 
She said, some day, things'll be much better baby 
But I don't believe her 
And I don't think I need her anymore

I know everything sucks 
And this won't be the last time you hear me complain.
