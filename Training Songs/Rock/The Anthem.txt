Yeah!...here we go.
It's a new day, but it all feels old
It's a good life, that's what I'm told 
But everything, it all just feels the same
At my high school, it felt more to me like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there it only made me see

That I don't ever want to be like you 
I don't want to do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna.
I don't ever want to be.you.
Don't want to be just like you
What I'm saying is this is the anthem
Throw all your hands up you.
Don't want to be you

Go to college, a university, get a real job
That's what they said to me 
But I could never live the way they want
I'm gonna get by and just do my time
Out of step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind

Do you really want to be like them,
Do you really want to be another trend,
Do you want to be part of that crowd
Cause I don't ever wanna.
I don't ever want to be you.
Don't want to be just like you
What I'm saying is.this is the anthem
Throw all your hands up.you.
Don't want to be you.

(Shake it once, that's fine, shake it twice that's okay.
Shake it 3 times your playing with yourself again.)

You.
Don't want to be just like you,
What I'm saying is..this is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
Why'll got the feeling, sing if you're with me you.
Don't want to be just like you (just like you)
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Why'll got the feeling, sing if your with me
Another loser anthem (whoa) 4x
