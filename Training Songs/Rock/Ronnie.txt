I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love

So very warm and tender
The way you loved me
Hey girl, can't you remember
And want more of me

Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie
Why did you go
Ronnie, oh, Ronnie, Ronnie
I am regretting but can't stop forgetting because
You were my first love

You said now you don't need me
Because I cheated
Why didn't you believe me
When I repeated

Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie
You'll never know
Ronnie, oh, Ronnie, Ronnie
I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love

I walk all alone
I cry at home
Night after night (night after night)
Day after day

I never cheated
I still repeat it

Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie, you'll never know
Ronnie, oh, Ronnie, Ronnie
I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love

I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love
