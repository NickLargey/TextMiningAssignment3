It's getting late, but I'll wait up to greet the dawn
Pour some Champagne and refrain, from moving on
There's got to be more than this to our simple serenades
I'm waiting 'til the spot light fades

A case of Vanity Kills, they're all up for the thrills
But not the working darlin'
Life's a roll of a dice, but you'll pay the price
When that curtain falls

Another place, another name
Another sleepless night
But still they come, they adore
How could I not oblige
There's got to be more than this to our simple serenades
I'm waiting 'til the spotlight fades

A case of Vanity Kills, they're all up for the thrills
But not the working darlin'
Life's a roll of a dice, but you'll pay the price
When that curtain falls

Caught in this constant flow of flattery
Is there no getting by the sound
But still that thoughts ringing out
There's got to be something more than, something more than this
A case of Vanity Kills, they're all up for the thrills
But not the working darlin'
Life's a roll of a dice, but you'll pay the price
When that curtain falls
