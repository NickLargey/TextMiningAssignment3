Hey boy
Why so down?
Smokin' all of your teeth brown
It's gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be good

Hey boy
Whatchu doin?
Drinkin' yourself to ruin
It's gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be good

In a moment
I'll be walkin' over
You'll forget you know her
When I kiss your world apart

In a moment
I know that I'll be the only girl
To shake your lonely heart
To shake your lonely heart

Hey boy
Hey boy
Why oh why?
You're making all your girlfriends cry
It's gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be good

Hey boy
How bout this?
I'll get right to the gist
It's gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be good

In a moment
I'll be walkin' over
You'll forget you know her
When I kiss your world apart

In a moment
I know that I'll be the only girl
To shake your lonely heart
To shake your lonely heart

To shake your lonely
To shake your lonely heart
To shake your lonely head
To shake your lonely heart
To shake your lonely
To shake your lonely heart
To shake your lonely
To shake your lonely heart
