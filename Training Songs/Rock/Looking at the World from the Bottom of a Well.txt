That Cuban girl
That brought me low
She had that skin so fine and red lips rose-like now
Her mouth was wide
And sweet as well
And now relentless hours of dreaming up her smell

And I feel as if I am looking at the world from the bottom of a well

Lonely
And the only way to beat it is to bat it down

Oh all the days
That I have run
I sought to lose that cloud that's blacking out the sun
My train will come
Some one day soon
And when it comes I'll ride it bound from night to noon

Aimless days, uncool ways of decathecting
Painless phase, blacked out thoughts you be rejecting
