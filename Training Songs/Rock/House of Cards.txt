Oh the rain is falling 
And the wild wind roars 
It'll shake your windows 
And rattle your doors 
Oh blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards

And they're washing the streets (blow blow down)
With the blood of your kind (blow blow down)
Ah just look over your shoulder (blow blow down)
They are right behind (blow blow down)
Oh blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards

And the birds are wheeling 
Up above your head 
And your days are numbered 
And you're as good as dead 
This is a very fine house 
Of great renown 
But it's cracked and it's shaking 
It goes tumbling, tumbling, tumbling down 

Blow blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards
Oh blow down this house of cards
