I can't see you in my arms anymore
And I can't see me without you

Is it day, is it night
Am I losing my sight
Is it over, are we really through
I can't see you in my arms anymore
And I can't see me without you

[Chorus]
I can't see me without you to lean on
And I can't see you leaving or gone
I could never see anything you wanted me to
And I can't see me without you.

I see the house, you once called your home
And I see the door you walked through
And I see the road you're leaving me on
But I can't see me without you

[Chorus]
