Used to be you and me, we had some understanding
Easily, we could see each other's point of view
But lately, I find we've shifted in time
Nothin' to say, just want no reins on me

No reins on me, just to satisfy you
Don't claim to be something different than you are
It's plain to see why you do the things you do
And now I want no reins on me

Suddenly, I can see how much you used to use me
Eagerly, I thought I was free, under your control
To break out and live, I need more than you can give
And now I want no reins on me

Everybody wants to put it on somebody else
To carry on enjoying themselves
(No reins, no reins on me)

We're caught in the pain, it's so insane
(I want to reins)
It's anyone's game, I need no reins

Sad to see, you and me, we have no resolution
One to one, it is said and done, way beyond control
Our lies are our truth
Possessive love and misspent youth
And now I want no reins on me

Just to satisfy you
Don't claim to be something different than you are
It's plain to see why you do the things you do
And now I want no reins on me
