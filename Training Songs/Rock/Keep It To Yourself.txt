I walk along the street and wonder what to do
I'd like to ease the pain in my troubled brain 
But as to how, I haven't a clue
Should I shout at the people who pass me by
Hey folks look at me, I'm no ordinary guy
I had a love and she swore she was mine
But she only loved me when the weather was fine.

My mind tells me what to do
Keep it to yourself, tell nobody else
Just how you loved her so, they don't want to know
Keep it to yourself.

On a subway train, I hide from the rain
And take a seat right next to the door
There's a man with a case and as I look at his face
I'm sure I've seen him someplace before
He looks up and I look down
And then we both look away
The train slows down and my head spins â€˜round
It's like scene from a one-act play.

My mind tells me what to do
Keep it to yourself, tell nobody else
Just how you loved her so, they don't want to know
Keep it to yourself.

I feel much better when the sun has lost its glow
When the light of day is fading away
And there are shadows wherever I go
Yes the light is fading and I'm masquerading
As a poet with something to say
The inspiration's gone and I can't turn it on
It's been the same since she went away.

My mind tells me what to do
Keep it to yourself, tell nobody else
Just how you loved her so, they don't want to know
Keep it to yourself.
