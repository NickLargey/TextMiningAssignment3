Starts with a burst, a little word
The sounds so loud and high, it can't be heard
And that's all you can be sure of
So don't say a word

Caught up underneath
Just before the flood
A fight you've had and lost
A hundred to one

But that's all you ever wanted
So we'll be good

The strangest things are happening to me
I've been away all the time
In the end it's plain enough to see
It'll carry away, carry away

It's not in the marrow but it's in the bone
You grind it down to nothing
Until it leaves you whole
But that's all you can be sure of

So don't let go
And when it gets in your head
You stay for weeks
Falling out of bed, talking in your sleep

But I can't feel a thing
I don't understand you when you speak

The strangest things are happening to me
I've been away all the time
In the end it's plain enough to see
It'll carry away, carry away
