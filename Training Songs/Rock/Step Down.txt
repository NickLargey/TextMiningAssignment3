You're so alarmed by every twist, the pain
Again how they let you down
Routinely scarred by the world
Its scenes obscene soberly push you around
Your decorated lace innocence is so profound
Just keep an eye out from behind it
So they'll notice you're still around
So you go to your friends and they love to
Look inside of you
You're as sweet as you can be 
Step Down, you're through 

You talk aloud behind the doors and backs
Of people whose help you've found
Parading, always trading privileged words
That help you to win the crowd
Easy to light up a silouette with quotes too loud
They'll realize when all complaints have dried
That you'd never sell them out
'Cause you know they're your friends and they love you
Look inside it's true
You're as sweet as you can be - Step Down, you're through 

With an extreme amount of candor
You'd be lost but very good
And in between responsibilities
You could rule the neighborhood
But your scheming isn't stood
Still you scream - but not at me 

Don't dry your eyes to proudly wear the proof
That suddenly I've let you down
(I don't want to go unless you let me)
Another reason for you not to live
Just stay home and kick around
(I don't want to know until you tell me)
Just one more slap to your innocence - it all compounds
So while you're struggling from beneath
Make sure they don't catch you looking down
(I don't want to know unless you let me)
Then you tell all your friends it's the last time
But they know more than you 
You're as sweet as you could be - Step Down
You're as sweet as you could be - Step Down

You're as sweet as you could be - Step Down
(Sweet as you can be)
You're as sweet as you could be - Step Down
(Sweet as you can be)
You're as sweet as you could be - Step Down
(Sweet as you can be)
You're as sweet as you could be - Step Down
You're as sweet as you can be
(Sweet as you can be)
