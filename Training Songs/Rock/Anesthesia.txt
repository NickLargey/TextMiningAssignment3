She wore a half smile
Always laughing in the wind
I know it sounds cliched but it's all true
I know it sounds cliched but I love you

She wore an old black trench coat
To cover up her skin
She weren't no fool, she didn't let nobody in
Pulled off the highway, they strip searched the van
All the cops are so bored in Ashland, Ohio

She took a picture of every town that she been through
An empty postcard store in her mind's eye
And tipped her hat to the passers by
I forgot and got the man, Malcom X and Billy Graham
They cried out, "I don't know you from Eve, Madam!"

And they believe you if you swear you're telling lies
And that's the ties by the violence
They are clapping their hands

Stripped to her senses
She wanted to go home
Sometimes he'd take her there
Sometimes he'd just kept on drinking
Sometimes to despair

And she wore a half smile
Always laughing in the wind
I know it sounds cliche by it's all true
I know it sounds cliched, but I love you

And they believe you if you swear you're telling lies
And that's the ties by the violence
They are clapping their hands
