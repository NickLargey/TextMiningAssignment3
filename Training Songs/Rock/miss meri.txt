I went down an empty lane, searching for a song
Came back an empty man
My whiskers they hung long
Lord, they hung long

I guess I am your native son
Despite my queer disguise
But I keep all I can call my own
In the bags beneath my eyes, underneath my eyes

Oh, Miss Meri, don't despair
We got ways to numb your pain
Same old story, blood sweat glory
Just hope all your trials weren't in vain

To all my so-called countrymen
Who bless this stolen ground
Is Jesus gonna pick you up
When your hunger weighs you down?
When it weighs you down

Mama, come and save me
Nothing?s sacred anymore
What good was living for?

And I been wondering just who misplaced my soul
There's pockets in my holes
And way out on the open plains, men pave beneath the sun
The great suburban dawn, if you build it they will come
Build it they will come, build it they will come

Oh, Miss Meri, don't despair
We got ways to numb your pain
Same old story, blood sweat glory
I just hope all your trials weren't in vain

I went down an empty lane, searching for a song
Came back an empty man
My whiskers they hung long
Lord, they hung long, Lord, they hung long
