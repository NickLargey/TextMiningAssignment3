I was young and, 
You were older. 
We had some fun times, 
Sooner or later. 

I could have told ya' you were the one and, 
I fell fast and, you fell faster. 

It wasn't true love, 
Just like that, 
It was a disaster. 
Now you're on the run! 

I remember, we were driving. 
It was a warm day, 
I can bet you can't remember 
The things I tried to say. 

Just last week I brushed your shoulder, 
On the busy street, 
It's no wonder you didn't even blink. 
Oh, what a dirty thing. 

Sometimes I wonder what I've become. 
Sometimes I wonder, and I think I'm gonna have no fun, 
Since I saw her. 

Sometimes I wonder what I've become. 
Sometimes I wonder, and I think about where you are, 
Since I saw her.
