My heart, my heart, my heart starts beating

Sometimes I feel I'm better off alone
I won't be kissing her, and I will be missing her
I'm lifeless on my own.

Someone told me listen to your heart
But now when I'm listening, I can't hear the beating
Now that we're apart.

I fell in love, for the first time.
I was left numb, dead inside.
It's something, that you can't see
It's something you do to me

[Chorus:]
My heart, my heart, my heart starts beating [Repeat: x3]
You bring me back to life

Losing someone leaves a vacancy
The pain that you can not kill, the whole that you can not fill
With a memory

They say that all good things must end.
Without those three words you said, I feel like the living dead
With you I can't pretend

The final signs, there is no doubt
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out
It's something that you can't see
It's something you do to me

[Chorus]

You bring me back to life

When I'm down, when I'm weak
You are strong, and complete
Then you shine like the sun, you are my only one
Do you feel like I do?
'Cause you know my aim is true.

And I must let you know

My heart, my heart, my heart starts beating [Repeat: x3]
You bring me back to life

[Chorus]

(Sometimes I feel I'm better off alone)
(You bring me back to life)

You bring me back to life

Oh
