Who's the man with the potion
Dressed in velvet and gloves
Causing grief and commotion
Talking 'bout love?

What on earth is he thinking?
Where on earth has he been?
Why do I feel like I'm sinking?
What does it mean?

Let's walk through the jungle
Put your arm in my arm
And should this ground start to crumble
We'll come to no harm

I once had a coat I was proud of
I wore that coat a long time
Just when the music got loudest
I left it behind

I could pretend that I'm dreaming
But one thing I just can't see
Who on earth am I meaning
When I say me?

Let's walk through the jungle
Put your arm in my arm
And should this ground start to crumble
We'll come to no harm

What's around the corner?
What's around the bend?
What's around the corner?
What's around the bend?

Questions upon question upon questions
Crowding 'round the side of my bed
Here are just a few of the best ones
Adrift in my head

Who's driving this airplane?
Did I live hard enough?
Is it gonna rain and how well have I loved?
How well have I loved?

Let's walk through the jungle
Put your arm in my arm
And should this ground start to crumble
We'll come to no harm

Lean on me if you stumble
'Neath the bright shining stars
And though the whole world may crumble
We know who we are, we know who we are
