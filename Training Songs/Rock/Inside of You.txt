As a child, you used to dream
There wasn't anything that you couldn't do.
Learn to fly on paper wings,
But somebody told you dreams don't come true.
Some settle for a lie, and fake it
And try to keep their hearts from breakin',
But you defy the odds and make it
Worth the going through.

Oh, inside of you
There's a heart full of dreams,
Like the gold in a stream to be uncovered.
Inside of you
Lies a soul made to shine.
Yes, a child meant to fly and discover
All the wonders God can do
Are inside of you.

Everyday, you face the fear
With a measure of faith that you need.
And even now, all heaven cheers
For the miracle you're destined to be.
True bravery is bought with sorrow.
Life is but a gift we borrow.
And all the promise of tomorrow
Waits to be revealed.

Oh, inside of you
There's a heart full of dreams,
Like the gold in a stream to be uncovered.
Inside of you
Lies a soul made to shine.
Yes, a child meant to fly and discover
All the wonders God can do
Are inside of you.

Where dreams can still come true.
All the wonders God can do
Inside of you.
