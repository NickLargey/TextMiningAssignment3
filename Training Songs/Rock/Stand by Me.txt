I don't care if you need more lovin'
More than I can give you everyday
I don't mind if you sleep all over town
If you only care for me,
Than I don't have to say

Stand by me, stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me

I don't mind if you need more money
Go out with friends and dance all night
And give your body when you're stoned and wasted
When you're with me, I want you on my side

Stand by me, stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me

I don't care if you drive my car
And go ridin' with some rock 'n roll star
You want to make love and you tell him you're free
But when we're together, please stand by me

Stand by me, stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me
