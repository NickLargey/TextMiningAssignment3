Hangin' like a broken star in the sky
No reason to shine
Thinkin' I could never be
Someone's wish on
The first star at night

And I believed there was nothing left
Left in my chest
Then I lost my grip
When you made a wish
I could never have guessed

I'm in a free fall
But I won't crash
Hit the ground
And I bounce right back
I'm not comin' down no more
Not comin' down no more

I've lost all gravity now
Like walking on the moon
Feels like I'm floating away
Without a parachute

I've lost my fear of flying
I'm falling hard for you
Not scared of anything
So I think I think I'll just

Jump jump jump jump
Without my parachute
Jump jump jump jump
Straight into you

I was torn I was left with a permanent scar
I'd been there before
But you saw through every flaw
Found what was lost
So I pulled the rip cord

I'm lettin' go
I'm gonna jump this time
Into the blue
Now I won't look back
No I won't look back
With someone like you

I'm in a free fall
But I won't crash
Hit the ground
And I bounce right back
I'm not comin' down no more
Not comin' down no more

I've lost all gravity now
Like walking on the moon
Feels like I'm floating away
Without a parachute

I've lost my fear of flying
I'm falling hard for you
Not scared of anything
So I think I think I'll just

Jump jump jump jump
Without my parachute
Jump jump jump jump
Without my parachute
Jump jump jump jump
Without my parachute
Jump jump jump jump
Straight into you
Straight into you

Straight into you

No I won't look back
No I won't look back

'Cause I've lost all gravity now
Like walking on the moon
Feels like I'm floating away
Without a parachute

I've lost my fear of flying
I'm falling hard for you
Not scared of anything
So I think I think I'll just

Jump jump jump jump
Without my parachute
Jump jump jump jump
Without my parachute
Jump jump jump jump
Without my parachute
Jump jump jump jump
Straight into you
