Currents that are stronger
Want to drag you under
I would never tire
Swimming next to you
We became united
Twisted and enlightened
Skating on fire
Yes you know it's true

She took off her t-shirt
Like a worm I'd eat dirt
Just to be beside her
Every single night
Golf ball hail and thunder
Rum and Stevie Wonder
Warmer than fire
Getting into you

These memories
Dear God I hope she's always next to me

Picking and then peaking,
With the Costa Ricans.
Lying on a surfboard
Four weeks of the year
She was in her cycle
Crashed her motorcycle
Broken toes in plaster
Stitches in her arm

These memories
Dear God I hope she's always next to me
When we're deceased
Dear God I hope she's always next to me

These memories
Dear God I hope she's always next to me?
When we're deceased
Dear God I hope she's buried next to me
Dear God I hope she's buried next to me
Dear God I hope she's buried next to me
