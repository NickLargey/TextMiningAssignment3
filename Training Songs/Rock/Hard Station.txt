Hey Mr. Businessman 
Please take me as I am 
I'm ready to go straight 
But it's not easy 
When you don't have no money 
And if you take a chance 
I know you won't be sorry 
Hard times all around 
Hard Station in the town 

She came to me this morning 
Came to my brother's place 
Cards laid out on the table 
Tears streaming down her face 

So Mr. Businessman 
Please take me as I am 
I'm ready to go straight 
But it's not easy 
When you don't have no money 
So listen to me please 
I know you won't be sorry 
Hard times all around 
Hard Station in the town 

Round here you get downhearted 
It's more than a man can take 
Friends making propositions 
That was my first mistake 

So Mr. Businessman 
Please take me as I am 
I'm ready to go straight 
But it's not easy 
When you don't have no money 
So listen to me please 
I know you won't be sorry 
Hard times all around 
Hard Station in the town
