I know you
You're the one I always turn to
When I'm down
You were made for me

A tender heartbeat away
When I feel this close
I don't know what to say

Me and my car broke down


So I'm going to take a
Red Cab to Manhattan
I'll be heading out my door
Got some friends who want to see me
Don't know what I'm living for
Gonna take a Red Cab to Manhattan

"Insincere," you say
Well I'm right here beside you
And I'm a million miles away

I'm listening to the O'Jays sing
Don't lose your heart
Don't lose your heart
'Til you're sure that she's the one

Me and my car broke down


So I'm gonna take a Red Cab to Manhattan
See "It's a Wonderful Life"
Take Jimmy Stewart out to dinner
Buy some postcards for his wife
gonna take a Red Cab to Manhattan

Oh, it's too late to make fun of it
Oh, she's given you the best of it
