In the shadows where the heads hang low
You hear voices as the wind blows, asking "Can't you see?"
Reminding you to breathe
It's only time before it catches up to you and all your broken luck
I found a better way to get even with my memory

In the darkness where the angels cry
Give us water, give us back our eyes
Our bed's this concrete floor, and it's all we have left to live for
A day we'll never face
We're only second-handed, we're sick, and lonely
Fighting back the tears and every urge to Van Gogh both our ears

That's it, we've had enough
Please turn that fucking radio off
Ain't nothing on the air waving the despair we feel

In the shadows where the heads hang low
You hear voices as the wind blows, asking "can't you see?"
Reminding you to breathe
It's only time before it catches up to you and all your broken luck
I found a better way to get even with my enemies

That's it, we've had enough
Please turn that fucking radio off
Ain't nothing on the air waving the despair we feel
That said, we've had enough
Put "Walk Among Us" on and turn it up
Ain't nothing on the air waving the hatred I feel

This is my biggest fear
The only tunes that we hear
Come via antenna through your car radio

That's it, we've had enough (we've had enough)
That's it, we've had enough (we've had enough)
