Last night when I was laying in my bed 
Had a dream of a flag in white & red 
Swiss cross turned into the japan dot 
A yellow girl appeared and made me hot

She took me to her place - a Geisha house 
There was tea rice-booze & ceremony 
I got undressed she had me washed 
I felt her body and I was lost

Tokyo nights hot burning lights 
Tokyo nights you took my mind away 
Made me obsessed by loving fights

Soon I remembered I stayed in a dream 
And I could make a try to change the scene 
The geisha girl was just too hot for me 
I tried to wake up unsuccessfully

And even as the big alarm-clock rang 
Outside my window the first blackbird sang 
My yellow girlfriend didn't leave my head 
Got to stay forever in her bed

Tokyo nights hot burning lights 
Tokyo nights you took my mind away 
I'm in the spell of your delights
