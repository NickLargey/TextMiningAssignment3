There'll be one small light all over the world tonight. 
The search will go on for the one. 
It was love with no name 
And we glowed in the sun. 
  
There was one small dream, 
Incredible highs and lows, 
What little we knew living ordinary lives (lives). 
Made a dream for you, living ordinary lives (lives). 
  
Ordinary people living ordinary lives. 
Ordinary people living ordinary lives. 
  
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives. 
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives. 
  
The clock on the wall keeps moving, 
Time stands still, 
No matter how the dice may fall, 
Someone else always gets to call the number. 
  
Say goodbye cruel world. 
No pity no pain tonight. 
Whatever the cost all is lost. 
If this is love with no name, 
Then it's all in the stars. 
  
Whether it's wrong (wrong) or right, 
There's no one to blame no (no) lies. 
What else could we do 
Living ordinary lives (lives)? 
Made a dream for you, 
Living ordinary lives (lives). 
  
Oh, oh. We were ordinary people living ordinary lives. 
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives. 
We were ordinary people. 
  
What else could we do, 
Living ordinary lives (lives)? 
Made a dream for you, 
Living ordinary lives (lives). 
  
Oh, oh. We were ordinary people living ordinary lives. 
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives. 
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives. 
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives.
