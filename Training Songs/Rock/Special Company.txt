My love life is in the city, my girl, oh, she's so damn pretty
I didn't know everywhere we go she's unbelievably sexy
Other guys fantasize about this girl of mine
But you know I let 'em know she's with me

My baby is something, something
My baby is something good to me
She be giving me special, special
She be giving me special company

Moon light loves the shape of her body
As shadows dance on the sheets below me
Flip off the radio, we can take it slow
And listen to the sounds of our heart beat, beat

My baby is something, something
My baby is something good to me
She be giving me special, special
She be giving me special company

She got style, she got grace
No need for make up on the face
Came as no surprise to me
She got a great personality

I try to be tough, can't afford to give up
Because all of my love just don't seem to be enough
It's a common formality, a contagious technicality
Damn, she's so good to me

I find it hard to break the pieces, please this
Ain't the way it seems if you could dance in my shoes
You know special company

My baby is something, something
My baby is something good to me
She be giving me special, special
She be giving me special company
