Insane am I the only motherfucker with a brain?
I'm hearing voices, but all they do is complain
How many time have you wanted to kill
Everything and everyone say you'll do it but never will

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

I am my father son
Cause hes a phantom, a mystery, and that leaves me nothing!
How many times have you wanted to die?
Its too late for me all you have to do is get rid of me

It's all in your head
It's all in my head
It's all in my head

I tried you lied to me for so long
Everywhere I go, there's a sense of it
Freak on my antics and give me a choice
Doesn't matter if I give a shit its the shit that you gave me

Do you wanna feel pain? 
Takin' my name in vain
Caring never felt so lame inside
Anybody else got pride? 
Do you wanna take my life?
Maybe I'll reverse my ride
Who the f*ck are you? F*ck you!
Better suck it up 'cause you bled through
Better get away from me
Stay the f*ck away from me

I feel safe seems you're saved

Look me in my brand new eye
