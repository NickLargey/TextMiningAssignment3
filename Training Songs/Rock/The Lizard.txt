When I tell you people to do the lizard, pull yourself together and take a listen.
Take my flask and sip the liquid. Forgive me now for what I might deliver.
Look around. All around.
Lick your friends until they start to quiver. I ask myself if to give is richer.
Look around. All around.
Save yourself from falling down. All around.
There's no chance you can be found underground.
There's a thing we say about the foolish wisher.
Just do the dance and become the lizard.
