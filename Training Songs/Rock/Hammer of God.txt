[Chorus]
Hammer of God, 
Crushing the gates of evil 
Reigning in Glory, 
Satan bows to The Word
Fire, burning, swords, blazing, 
Hate, dying, Glory, Raised. 

Heads held high, 
Reflecting God shining 
Now the Hammer has fallen 
Evil lies, on the anvil 
Sparks are flying, 
As the Hammer smashing blow. 

[Chorus]

See the sky, 
Streams of Light breaking forth 
Darkness cracked, 
As the candle shines 
Raised with force, 
The Hammer will prevail 
Christian ways victorious, 
Fill us with Your praise. 

[Chorus]

We are light, spreading Gospel Truth 
You just might listen to our ways 
Now be converted, feel the blessed heart 
Change forever, eternal life

[Chorus]
