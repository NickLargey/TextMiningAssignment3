Now have you got yourself a brand new baby
Don't tell me maybe, is it so? I got to know
What's it gonna be, him or me?
Him or me, him or me, him or me?

I can still recall when you told me I was all
Everything you looked for in a man
But I know that it's not true, I've seen the way he looks at you
And I think you're gonna hang me up again

Now have you got yourself a brand new baby
Don't tell me maybe, is it so? I got to know
What's it gonna be, him or me?
Him or me, him or me, him or me?

So, if you'd be so kind, would you please make up your mind?
I won't share your lovin' with another man
And if you see things my way, could you let me know today?
But if you decide, it's him, I'll change my mind

So have you got yourself a brand new baby
Don't tell me maybe, is it so? I got to know
What's it gonna be, him or me?
Him or me, him or me, him or me?

Him or me, him or me, him or me
What's it gonna be?

Him or me, him or me, him or me
What's it gonna be?

Him or me, him or me, him or me
What's it gonna be?

Him or me, him or me, him or me
What's it gonna be?

Him or me?
