(Hello)
 When eyes are red
We can't talk for a while
Without our sweet dumb things we say
you don't want me anyway
You don't want me anyway
so what
Why should i stay?

So goodbye to you and your life
Your new best friends
your confidence
And i'll be here when you get home

Sitting half way
Away from no where
praying for lips to touch
Holding myself
For a second
Just to catch you smile
On this side

So goodbye to you and your lies
(Two months, so many weeks)
Your new best friends
Your confidence
(turn my hours into days)
And i'll be here when you get home
(when you get home)

So goodbye to yuo and your lies
(two months so many weeks)
Your new best friends
Your confidence
(turn my hours into days)
And i'll be here when you get home
(When you get home)

(I can't feel the same without you any more)

It's just like you said
It would be
(separation)

I can't feel the same
I can't feel this way
I can't feel the same without you anymore

(separation) Without you anymore
(separation) Without you anymore
