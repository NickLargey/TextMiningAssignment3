They found him in the lane
With cocaine in his brain
They found him on his own Someone saw him lying there

[Chorus:]
I heard what was said
Another rebel dead

They say he killed himself
But it was someone else
His name was on their list
And now he don't exist
He didn't stand a chance
Upon his grave they dance
They were determined to blow him out
And so the papers read
That Johnny Smith was dead
A little girl asked why
And made her brother cry
Why did they make him go that way
