Spent the last year
Rocky mountain way
We couldn't get much higher
Out to pasture
I think it's safe to say
A time to open fire
CHORUS:
And we don't need the lady
Cryin' 'cause the story's sad
Rocky mountain way
Is better than the way we had
Yeah, yeah
Well, he's tellin' us this and he's tellin' us that
Changin' it everyday
And says it doesn't matter
The bases are loaded and Casey's at bat
Changin' it play by play
A time to change the batter
CHORUS
CHORUS
