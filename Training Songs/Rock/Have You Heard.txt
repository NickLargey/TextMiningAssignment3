Well, have you heard the broken English?
Have you heard the chorus line?
Have you heard they're taking aim now
And taking their own sweet time?
Have you heard the cards are on the green?
Have you heard what they have seen?
Have you heard?

And have you heard the towers are shaking?
Heard the Bible isn't true?
Have you heard that you're mistaken
To want something to cling to
Have you heard the record they've got playing?
Have you heard what they've been saying? 
Have you heard?

And have you heard they came for money?
Have you heard they picked the fight?
Heard we'd be marching into glory
If we could paint it black and white?
Have you heard the visions of the blind?
Have you heard what they will find?
Have you heard?
Have you heard?

Have you heard they loaded up the needle?
Have you heard they know the cure?
Heard both the beauty and the evil?
Have their feet nailed to the floor
Have you heard about the smoke?
Have you heard this little joke?
Well have you heard?
Have you heard?

And have you heard that you're a liar?
Have you heard the music died?
Have you heard that the Messiah
Went and joined the other side?
Have you heard what I'm about?
Have you heard I got found out?
Well, have you heard?
Well, have you heard?
Well, have you heard?

And have you heard the altars crumbling?
Have you heard they sold His blood?
Can you hear the ship is coming
From the creaking of the wood
Have you heard the 61 salutes?
Have you heard the simple truth?
Well, have you heard?

Have you heard the 61 salutes?
Can you hear the simple truth?
What a swell party this is
Have you heard?
Well, have you heard?
And have you heard?
