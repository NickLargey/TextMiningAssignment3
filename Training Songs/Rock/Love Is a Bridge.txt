How can I last another night without you ?
So far away and missin' all the things that you do,
if I could hold you in my arms for just one minute of tonight,
I know I'd say the words I find so hard to make it right,
each night away from you I see,
all the things you really mean to me ...

Love is the bridge that links our hearts,
keeping us close when we're apart,
I always knew, right from the start,
love is a bridge that runs from heart to heart.

I live again, each night I go to sleep and dream with you,
things are different then, we can do anything we want to do,
in dreams I know that I can face the things I never want to see,
and I can show that I can be the one you always saw in me,
each night away from you I see,
all the things you really mean to me ...

Love is the bridge that links our hearts,
keeping us close when we're apart,
I always knew, right from the start,
love is a bridge that runs from heart to heart.
