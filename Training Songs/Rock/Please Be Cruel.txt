Judas's friends have got so strong
It's through the way they made you carry someone else's wrong
I've seen the way he ties you down
To blind man's bluff in a bridal gown

So you beat him at his games
So he had to change the rules
Please be cruel

Every word that's spoken is ringing in your ears
This light we look upon has gone and passed a thousand years
He says you're mutton dressed as lamb
But he's a vegetarian

So you live to fight another day
But you get weaker every way
Please be cruel

'Cause you're a woman who needs persuading
Never needed anybody
To affect this change your life so badly needs

Judas's friends have got so strong
It's through the way they made you carry someone else's wrong
I've seen the way he ties you down
To blind man's bluff in a bridal gown

So you beat him at his games
So he had to change the rules
Oh, please be cruel

Oh, please be cruel
Oh, please be cruel
Don't know if I should

Please be cruel
Please be cruel
Please be cruel
