(ian hunter)

A mountain train's coming down the track
She ain't wasting time
She's carrying me cause I'm going back
Right to the delaware line
She knows well I ain't been anywhere
Because I crawl back every time to her
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain

Troubles and tears
I'll take it in years
I left so many behind
I may be a train rearranged
Who knows what I'll find
But everything's better in my life I know
I can face any grades that I'm on
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
(alright)
(hey hey hey)

(oh) I'm walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
When she talks to me I know she sees
Where I'm heading to
She sits winks takes it all in
Just admires the view
And if I had a choice in life
I'd take that mountain for my wife
I'm walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
Jumping jack flash it's a gas
Jumping jack flash it's a gas
Jumping jack flash it's a gas
Jumping jack flash it's a gas
Jumping jack flash it's a gas
Jumping jack flash it's a gas
