Insane
I feel ashamed when the morning comes
And I hate to breathe
Guilty
No doubt I am
Please tell me how to come clean again

Spaceship
Go f*ck the stars
When the night falls down they shine on me
Have you ever felt this way
Like you are the worst mankind on the planet earth

Don't even ask why I'm standing here
I found a piece of me
It is still left in you
It's very cheap but cute emotion
I wish you were here

[Chorus]
'Cause I found the way to live with that
I'm not going anywhere
I thought you'd only make me weak
That's wrong
I knew it all and you knew it all
That it's never gonna work
To wait for someone who could stop this rain
It just rains

Watching
The same old dream
A mailing car runs over me
Have you ever felt this way
Like you are the most useless on the planet earth

Don't even ask why I'm standing here
I found the shiners of my own
A fantasy Good memories
It's very cheap but cute emotion
I with you were here

[Chorus]

It just rains

Maybe there's no one who is perfect
But who wants to be anyway
Maybe there's no one who is all clean
But who wants to be anyway

[Chorus]
