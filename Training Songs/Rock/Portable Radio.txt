Take your pick of the modulation
Like a kid in a candy store
It's a hand-carry situation
Made for lying on the beach
Or dancin' in the streets
You got your pertinent information
Or you can tune in to hear the scores
There's a power in a million stations
You can't ignore
Radio
	crank up the power
Radio
	rock it for hours and hours
Radio 
	play it soft and low
Viva la Portable Radio
	turn up the power all night
Well I don't want to hear no static
And I don't want to hear no jaw
Put them platters on automatic
I cannot get enough
Got to give me more and more
Play some soul for the congregation
Rock n' roll for the kids next door
Charge up your batteries across the nation
	Viva la portable radio
It's x-static
