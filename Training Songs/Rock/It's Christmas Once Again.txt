Bum-bum-bum-bum

Merry voices raised in singing
Carols through the streets are ringing
All because it's Christmas once again

Lovers kiss in public shyly
Mistletoe was hung there slyly
All because it's Christmas once again

Little kiddies' noses flattened on the window pane
Peeking at the dollys and the shiney choo-choo trains
Santa's hitching up his reindeer, has his bag packed tight
Everything is ready for the sleigh ride through the night

Christmas trees with lights are twinkling
Glasses filled with snowflakes sprinkling
All because it's Christmas once again

So here's a wish we keep repeating
Please accept the season's greetings
All because it's Christmas once again
