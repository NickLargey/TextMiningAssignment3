I'd say for certain to watch over me 
Phone rings at half past three
I'd say for certain to watch over me When the phone rings at half past three 
My mind,
And it's coming back to back to me from my dreams 
Only knows that bad news never sleeps... 

Yeah, Rico carved his name in a tree 
Not with a knife but with his life
Or so it goes
Yeah, in dreams I see his face
I recognize the place right next to dashboard Jesus 

Cold snow, a small red river flowed 
In the stage of the lone headlight
Clothes shorn, it seems that they've been worn for the last time 
Tonight 

I knew then, these couldn't be my friends
They know enough to know that you don't make snow angels with your face down 
Angels with your face upon the ground 

Rico carved his name in a tree
Not with a knife but with his life
Or so I'm told
Yeah, in dreams I see his face
I recognize the place right next to dashboard Jesus 
Had to get me home in time
In time to tape The Simpsons
And it seems, I lost this time
It seems that last song that they heard
The last song that they heard, it plays on and on and on and on and on in my head
It seems the last song that they heard was "Sweet Emotion" 
It's cold, it's cold, it's cold, oh my friend Rico 
It's cold, it's cold, it's cold, oh my friend Rico 
(It gets colder as I touch his shoulder
It gets colder, and he'll get no older) 
Yeah, in dreams I see his face, I recognize the place right next to dashboard Jesus.
