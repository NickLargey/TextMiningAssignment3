I don't know why, feel quite like a natural guy.
But, ever since I was a baby, people calling me crazy.
You know I ain't crazy.
For, I oh I, I got my finger in the pie.
Until I took a step back, and looked where I was at.
I said I'm not really satisfied.
CHORUS
I want to' be wild like I'm supposed to be,
Strong and totally free.
I want to be wild [just like/because] I know I am,
Wild just like a natural man ...
Who was born to be wild.
Wild, born wild, wild the young American style.
Together we are strong, my brother said there ain't no heaven.
There ain't no orders above us.
Now, I don't know why, can get by on a natural high.
My high is the strength of my nature it's a good vibration, now, feeling sensation.
CHORUS
Who was born to be wild.
