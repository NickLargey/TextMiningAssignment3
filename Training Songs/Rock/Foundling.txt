At the feet of love
A foundling in the reeds
At the feet of love yeah
At the feet of love
A foundling in the reeds
At the feet of love, yeah

Take me to the limit of
Every minute
Dancin' in the senate
Of needing and wanting
Throw me in cold yeah
All that my heart can hold
Until finally confronting
Strictly on a need to know
Lettin' it go now
Baby, 'til the time is right

At the feet of love
A foundling in the reeds
At the feet of love yeah
At the feet of love
A foundling in the reeds
At the feet of love, yeah
Take me home
Take me home

Every apparition and
Every dream that
Threatened to but never was
Actually solid
Every high cause yeah
Every phony Santa Claus
Who wrote his name on it
Strictly on a need to know
Let it go now
Baby, 'til the time is right

At the feet of love
A foundling in the reeds
At the feet of love
A foundling in the reeds
At the feet of love
A foundling in the reeds
At the feet of love
A foundling in the reeds
Take me home
Take me home

The sugar and the bile
You try your best to reconcile
Your heart with it's shadow
There she blows
All bones and stones
And blooming pale as Death
In the meadow
We just got to let it go now
Baby 'til the time is right

At the feet of love yeah
Sweet transcendent love yeah
Exponential love yeah
Luminescent love yeah
Feast your heart on love sweet love
Sweet transcendent love oh yeah
Undefeated love sweet love
Sweet transcendent love yeah
Yeah
