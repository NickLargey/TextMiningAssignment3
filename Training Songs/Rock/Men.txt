Men will open their arms
Men assure security
Men will cry in their beer
If you don't treat them tenderly
So vulnerable, here are the men
Whatever in the world
Would the world become without them?

Men do deals and favours
Men think a woman can be owned
Men will always hustle
Men tell lies on the telephone

Men are all primed for action
Wallets full of credit cards the main attraction

Men consider themselves with pride
Men are macho, but so soft inside
Men need help, 'cause they can't decide
What makes a man a man
When is a a man a man?
What makes a man a man?

Men have rippling muscles
Men can carry heavy sacks
Men who've seen it all
Men who'll have many heart attacks

Men bash their heads on brick walls
Men who think that only men make any sense at all

Men consider themselves with pride
Men are macho, but so soft inside
Men need help, 'cause they can't decide
What makes a man a man
When is a a man a man?
What makes a man a man?

Men get drunk with style
Men go out to pick a fight
Men read morning papers
Men watch TV late at night
Men are building missiles
Men do each and every single damn thing right
When is a man a man?
What makes a man a man?

Men can never have babies
Men are going bald on top
Men just want to be human
But they're programmed to be men, they cannot stop
So vulnerable, here are the men
Whatever in the world
Would the world become without them?

Men wear glasses to cover their eyes
Men go off into corners to cry
Men need help, 'cause they can't decide
What makes a man a man
When is a man a man?
What makes a man a man?
When is a man a man?

Mama how can I be a man?
Hey Papa, hey Mama how can I be a man?
When is a man a man?
