Was it last year
Or was it the year before last?
It’s so hard to tell
Time it gets tangled in the past
(tell me what you need to know)
 
 
If you want it
If you want it
(Tell me what you need to know)
If you want it
If you want it
(I’ll come and set you free)
 
 
Set you free
You’re like an eagle
You’re like a vulture of love
Free
Into the sunset
Into the vortex of love
free
You’re like an eagle
You’re like a vulture of love
Free
Into the sunset
Into the vortex of love
 
 
You don’t have to sympathise
And I don’t expect
For you to understand
But i’m hoping that your heart don’t fail me yet
Hoping that your heart don’t fail me now
 
 
If you want it
If you want it
(Go ahead and spit it out)
If you want it
If you want it
(I’ll come and set you free)
 
 
Set you free
You’re like an eagle
You’re like a vulture of love
Free
Into the sunset
Into the vortex of love
free
You’re like an eagle
You’re like a vulture of love
Free
Into the sunset
Into the vortex of love
 
 
Its so hard to tell (tell me what you need to know)
For you to understand (go ahead and spit it out)
Hoping that your heart don’t fail me now
(Tell me what you need to know)
(Go ahead and spit it out)
Hoping that your heart…
 
 
Set you free
You’re like an eagle
You’re like a vulture of love
Free
Into the sunset
Into the vortex of love
free
You’re like an eagle
You’re like a vulture of love
Free
Into the sunset
Into the vortex of love
 
 
Into the vortex of love
You’re like an eagle
You’re like a vulture of love
