Whisper again and I'm on my way
It's been a long time it seems
Don't tell your friends till you see I've changed
I've still kept all of our dreams

Tell me again that you want me back
'Cause I'm lost without you
Sleepless nights when I've tossed and turned
It seems it's taught me how to love you

You lose and you gain
Just when I feel life is falling apart
Suddenly I turn
And its back in my heart again

You lose and you gain
Once again I'm holding you
This time I swear I'll make it last
The pain will go it's all over now

We realize it's just the past
You lose and you gain
Just when I feel life is falling apart
Suddenly I turn

And its back in my heart again
You lose and you gain
Being apart
Has kept me drained

And all this growth has come from pain
You lose and you gain
Just when I feel life is falling apart
Suddenly I turn

And its back in my heart again
You lose and you gain
You lose and you gain
You lose and you gain
