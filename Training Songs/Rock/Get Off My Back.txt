No one's gonna tell me that the weekend ever ends 
Can't ever tell me what I oughta be 
First you try to stop me with a bigger lie 
When there's a monster coming out of me 

Next you try to thrill me, never meant no harm 
But l'm the menace on a one-way track 
Then you try to kill me with a naive charm 
But there's a thing I gotta tell you

Hey, Hey You, Get Off My Back 
Hey, Hey You, Get Off My Back 
Hey, Hey You. Give me some slack 
Hey, Hey You, Get Off My... 

Back into the problem that nobody knew 
And I'm about to start screaming 
Leave me alone cause I don't listen to your crying 
When you wake up from your dreaming 

Held down, locked out - not my crime 
I never wanted to be king 
Touch me again and you'll lose another friend 
And that's the biggest crime of all 

Hey, Hey You, Get Off My Back 
Hey, Hey You, Get Off My Back 
Hey, Hey You. Give me some slack 
Hey, Hey You, Get Off My Back
