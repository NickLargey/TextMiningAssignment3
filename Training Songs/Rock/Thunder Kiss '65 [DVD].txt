Well, sweet little sista's high as hell, cheating on a halo
Grind in an odyssey, a holocaust, a heart kicking on tomorrow
And a breakdown agony, I said an extacy in overdrive
We're riding on the world, Thunder kissin' nineteen-sixty.....five, yeah, wow!

Five, yeah, wow!
The demon warp is 
Coming alive 
In nineteen-sixty...five, five, five!

Livin' fast and dying young a like an endless poetry.
My motorcycle nightmare freak out inside of me.
My soul salvation, liberation, on the drive.
The power of the blaster, move me faster....

Nineteen-sixty....five, yeah, wow!
Five, yeah, wow!
The demon warp is 
Coming alive 
In nineteen-sixty...five, five, five!

Ohh, shout!
Said
Said yeah! give it back, give it back, NOW!
NOW!
NOW!

Yeah... now!
Rollin' like a supersonic, another fool to get down on it.
Pig sweat a million miles, I've got a heart atomic style.
Make it look easy. That's what I said.
A blast of silence explodes in my head

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

Give it back, give it back, Now!
Give it back, give it back, Now!
Give it back, give it back, Now!
Give it back, give it back....

Step to the moonshine, feeds the hell, the resurrection.
What's new p****-cat? Can you dig the satisfaction?
Well you can't take it with you, but you can in overdrive.
Yeah, some like it hot. Yeah, twisted... nineteen-sixty.....five, yeah, wow!

Five, yeah, wow!
The demon warp is 
Coming alive 
In nineteen-sixty...five, five, five!
