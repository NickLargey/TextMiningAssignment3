When they ask for my autograph
I catch you in the corner of my eye
Yet I know that smile upon your face
Means we made it girl you and I

From the hard life
On the south side
To the spotlight here on the stage

Now watch we play
Mm hear me sing
La la la la la la la la
I play and sing for you
La la la la
Hear the applause

Without you no telling where I'd be
Singing me a different song
Mm breaking rocks for ten or twenty years
But you wouldn't let me go wrong

Standing by me
Cause you love me
Now darling this one's for you

Now watch me play
Wo hear me sing
La la la la la la la la
I play and sing for you
La la la la
Hear the applause

Watch me play
Wo you got to hear me sing
La la la la la la la la
I play and sing for you
La la la la
Hear the applause

Now watch me play
Wo hear me sing
La la la la la la la la
I play and sing for you
La la la la
Hear the applause
