Come on over the mountain
And I'll meet you at the other side
Come on over the mountain
And I'll meet you at the other side, yeah
If I saw you dancing
I would spin you around, spin you around
If I saw you dancing 
I would spin you around, spin you around 
Turn your world upside down

Oh

I'd spin you around, spin you around
Turn your world upside down
Spin you around, spin you around
Turn your world upside down

If you'll be my woman
I will take you to another high
If you'll be my lady
I will take you for another ride

If I saw you dancing
I would spin you around, spin you around
If I saw you dancing
I would spin you around, spin you around

Spin you around, spin you around
Turn your world upside down
Spin you around, spin you around
Turn your world upside down

I can turn you around

I'd spin you around, spin you around
Turn your world upside down
Spin you around, spin you around
Turn your world upside down

Oh

Maybe, baby
Upside down
I'm gonna spin you around
Maybe, lady
Upside down
