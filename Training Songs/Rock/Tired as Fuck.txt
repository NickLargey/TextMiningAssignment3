Tired as f*ck 
The Greedy Palace has been keeping me up 
See now then 
Can't and won't you will and can 

Tired as f*ck 
It's so hard to wonder why when you don't feel worthy of 
Being aloft, wherever wind may blow 
You don't let your balloon touch the ground 
Or get so high that you can't let go 

May and June this lake of gin 
I only had to tilt the paddle toward my chin 
May and June 
The Sweet Sea 
It's easy when you don't know what you're doing 

Tired as f*ck 
I want to stop so much I almost don't want to stop 
See now then 
Can't and won't 
Will and can 

Tired as f*ck 
The Greedy Palace has been keeping me up 
Up high and aloft, wherever winds may blow 
Don't let your balloon touch the ground 
Or get so high that you can't let go 

May and June by the lake of gin 
I only had to tilt the paddle toward my chin 
May and June by the Sweet Sea 
It's so easy when you don't know how easy 

May and June, May and June, 
May and June, May and June, May and June 

Tired as f*ck 
Tired as f*ck
