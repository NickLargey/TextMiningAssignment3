Bright as a star be the light
Strobing down on me
Suddenly I was free
Let me go on these

Show I can cough I can choke
On this kind of smoke
Off went the switch
Love is soft
Love's a fucking bitch

Do I really need
Another habit like you
I really need
Do you need me too
I believe it's gonna leave me blue

Bright as a star be the light
Strobing down on me
Suddenly I was free
Let me go on these

Show I can cough I can choke
On this kind of smoke
On goes the switch

Love is soft
Love's a fucking bitch

Do I really need
Another habit like you?
I really need
Do you need me too?
I believe
It's gonna feel like new
