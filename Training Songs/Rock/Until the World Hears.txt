Lord I want to feel with Your heart
And see the world through Your eyes
I want to be Your hands and feet
I want to live a life that leads

[Chorus]
Ready yourselves
Ready yourselves
Let us shine the light of Jesus
In the darkest night
Oh, ready yourselves
Oh, ready yourselves
May the powers of darkness tremble as our praises rise
Until the whole world hears 
Lord we are calling out
Lifting up Your name for all to hear the sound
Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out
As the day draws near
We'll sing until the whole world hears

Lord let Your sleeping giant arise
Catch the demons by surprise
Holy nation sanctified
Let this be our battle cry

[Chorus]

Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears
Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears

Want to be Your hands and feet
Want to be a life that leads
To see You set the captive free
Until the whole world hears
And I pray that they will see more of You and less of me
Lord I want my life to be the song You sing
Until the whole world hears Lord we are calling out
Lifting Your name up for all to hear the sound
Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out
As the day draws near
We'll sing until the whole world hears

Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears!

Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears!

Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears!

Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears!

Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears!
