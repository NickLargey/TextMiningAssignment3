Oh, well, I bought me a donkey, about four foot tall
To plough my cotton in the early fall
He's runnin' around, it was an awful sin
I had to build a fence to keep my donkey in

I rigged up a wire with a battery charge
To keep my donkey from a-running at large
Inside this bin I turned him loose
Thrilled by volts of electrified juice

Well, which way did my donkey go
If you see him let me know
I haven't seen my donkey since
He backed into that electrified fence

Now, the first time he backed up against it
He threw back his ears and he had a fit
He brayed real loud and he hit high gear
He jumped up into the stratosphere

I just got word from Albuquerque
A donkey up there was looking for work
He's my donkey and his name is Jack
Oh, how I wish he'd come on back

Well, which way did my donkey go
If you see him let me know
I haven't seen my donkey since
He backed into that electrified fence

Now, more word came from Palomar
A man up there was a-watching the star
While looking through his telescope
He nearly had himself a stroke

He saw something riding up the rainbow trail
With two long ears and a puckered up tail
The thing he saw when he 'firmed the states
Was a donkey heading for the pearly gates

Well, which way did my donkey go
If you see him let me know
I haven't seen my donkey since
He backed into that electrified fence
