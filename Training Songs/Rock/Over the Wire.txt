From where we're standing we can feel the heat
What I'm saying to you now you don't never repeat
Everybody on the rocks tonight
They do a thing without a name you know it just ain't right.

(I say)
The lights are going out now ten at a time
See you floating like a fish washed away in the tide
Gonna sizzle like fat burning up in the fire
You know the Devil Himself getting over the wire.

Well all God's children got their dubious side
And it's deep and dirty and it's real real wide
Well the Alligator Woman and her sister made three
I tell you Johnny Weissmuller is the man for me

(I say)
The lights are going out now ten at a time
See you floating like a fish washed away in the tide
Gonna sizzle like fat burning up in the fire
You know the Devil Himself getting over the wire.

Well all of them bitching as the coffin goes down
"He didn't do nothin' special did He, this time around?"
Then John Paul Getty in the form of a dove
Says you only ever answer to the Butcher of Love

(I say)
The lights are going out now ten at a time
See you floating like a fish washed away in the tide
Gonna sizzle like fat burning up in the fire
You know the Devil Himself getting over the wire.
