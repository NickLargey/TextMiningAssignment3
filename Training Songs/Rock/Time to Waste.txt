There's someone down below, blowing you a kiss
They watch from their windows
As all arms fall to their sides
And all eyes fix on the death of tomorrow
And you found everything you need
To make a life complete
Completely revolting and they have safety and relief
For sale down the street
I see you in line every day

You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill it's dead and buried
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy

These creatures are waking up in these dark trees
Waiting like vultures
Eyes roll back turn white in time to feed
They salivate with hunger
For you and everything they need
To make a death complete
Completely unnatural and salvation lies
Behind those dead eyes that watch you while you sleep every night and

You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill it's dead and buried
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy

You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill it's dead and buried
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy
