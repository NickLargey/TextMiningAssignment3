All I ever needed was to
Eat popcorn with you
Come on over
Watch the late show
Stay up talking until two

Today's the day you're leaving
And tomorrow you'll be gone
You're in my heart and on my mind
I will bring you along

Everything sucks when you're gone
Everything sucks when you're gone

A dream of our reunion
Makes me crazy just to think
How so very far away you are
My hope begins to sink

Today's the day you're leaving
And tomorrow you'll be gone
You're in my heart and on my mind
I will bring you along

Everything sucks when you're gone
Everything sucks when you're gone

Come on

It's not okay
I've baked dinner here for two
And it's not okay
I've got candles lit for you
And it's not okay
I've got you're favorite records out
And it's not okay
You should have let it be
And ran after me

Today's the day you're leaving
And tomorrow you'll be gone
You're in my heart and on my mind
I will bring you along

Everything sucks when you're gone
I want you, I need you
Everything sucks when you're gone
I want you, I need you

Everything sucks when you're gone
I want you, I need you
Everything sucks when you're gone
