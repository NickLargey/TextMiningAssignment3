Well I've got all these thoughts 
Turning in my head,
I have to write it all down, 
Trying to keep my head above the water, 

Stuck in a one horse town.
I know I've got something but I can't put my finger on it. 
But everytime I think about it, 
It disappears. 

Stop the world, cause this is where I get off. 
Well you can all carry on, 
But just stop the world. 
Well I can feel myself, 

Tumbling and fall,
But I can get back up on my feet, 
'Cause I got something I'd like to show you all.
I know I've got something but I can't put my finger on it. 

But everytime I think about it, 
It disappears. 
Stop the world, 
'Cause this is where I get off. 

Well you can all carry on, someone please stop the world. 
So c'mon stop the world, cause this is where I get off, 
Well you can all carry on, but just stop the world. 
Stop. 

Stop.
