You can hate me but what do I care
Everything from the tattoo on my wrist to the color
of my hair
You created like a seed in the ground
You water me down with anorexic superheroes and
prozac popping clowns

I've already slept with the captain of the football
team, it was lame
I've already kissed a girl on ecstasy;
it's all the same
And I already forgive you mom and dad,
how could you know anyway

I'm graduating, too late for saving
I'm celebrating the beauty of the naked truth
A life complicated, sometimes I hate it
You're not me and I'm not you
It's the beauty of, the beauty of the naked truth

Fail me, but I won't flunk out
Lecture me about true love and monogamy
First, maybe you should figure that out
I'm the daughter of a self-indulgent man
And a mother who mastered the art of apology
That psychology is all that I am

I've already prayed the rosary over my best
friend's suicide
I already know what it feels like to have a part of
me die
And I already forgive you mom and dad cause I'm
still alive

I'm graduating, too late for saving
I'm celebrating the beauty of the naked truth
A life complicated, sometimes I hate it
You're not me and I'm not you
It's the beauty of, the beauty of the naked truth

I wear my flaws like a badge of honor
If I use my claws then baby you're a goner
If you're uncomfortable with being exposed
Then join the others who will never know

I'm graduating, too late for saving
I'm celebrating the beauty of the naked truth
A life complicated, sometimes I hate it
You're not me and I'm not you
It's the beauty of; it's the beauty of the naked truth
It's the beauty of the naked truth, it's true
