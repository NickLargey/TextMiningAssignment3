She remembers the night they first were alone
When he took her home and he said,
"I need you, won't you stay?"
And all through the night his eyes had a light
That burned very bright and she hoped
His words weren't well read lines
A little ill at ease she whispered "Baby, please...

Treat me gently in the morning
Take my heart but stay with me
Treat me gently in the morning, please"

Her mamma said, "Silly girl you should marry him or leave
He'll only make you grieve when he decides it's over
Wake up child"
But the years fell away, they grew closer they found
Though they had their ups and downs just like lovers do
Still she'd say, "It's okay to fight, when were alone late at night
I'll always say...

Treat me gently in the morning
Take my heart but stay with me
Treat me gently in the morning, please"

It all went so fast one day he went away
He said St. Tropez but he died that winter in a plane
The last thing he sent was a postcard from Rome
It read, "I'm coming home, Lady, I love you"
And under his name was a P.S. that read
Very simply it said...

Treat me gently in the morning
I can't live another night
Treat me gently in the morning
I'll be on that plane tonight..
