Let's start a war said Maggie one day
With the unemployed masses we'll just do away
They won't suss us,they'll never know

Let's start a war said Maggie one day
Let's start a war said Maggie one day
Let's start a war said Maggie one day
You fight for your country
You die for their gain

Death and destruction all around
Shops and houses are razed to the ground
Bump out houses empty shells
Here on earth itÂ´s just a mortal hell

[Chorus]
How they died no-one will ever know

They said they would save us as deterrents they would be used
Except they brought destruction to an earth that grows no food
Now we are gone for ever no tombs can hold your names

[Chorus]
