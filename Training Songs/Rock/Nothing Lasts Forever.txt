He's waiting down at the corner under the streetlight
He's only following orders 'til midnight
And then he'll sneak back home to his wife,
And his everyday life.
He says he's been at the pub with the boys all night,
She acts as if she don't know says its alright.
But he knows she don't believe him.

On and on, on and on.

Cause nothing lasts forever,
And nothing lasts forever.
Everything dies eventually,
Cover your eyes if you don't want to see.

This isn't how she thought that her life should be.
When they first met back in '63,
And a future together was all she could see.
He said if you stick with me,
Then you know we'll be alright.
A family for the rest of our lives,
And I'll always be by your side.
And that's when she cried.

On and on, on and on.

Cause nothing lasts forever,
And nothing lasts forever.
Everything dies eventually,
Cover your eyes if you don't want to see.

So he takes off his tie and he tells another lie,
She only believed it for a minute.
And she doesn't ask why,
She doesn't want to pry.
She only believes it for a minute.
He's walking out the door and into a new life,
He's already got plans with his new wife,
And a house in a new neighborhood.
He says he's been at the pub with the boys all night,
She acts as if she don't know,
Says its alright.
But he knows she don't believe him,
But she's sick of arguing.

On and on, on and on.

Cause nothing lasts forever
And nothing lasts forever
Everything dies eventually
Cover your eyes if you don't want to see

She's been waking around,
With her heart dragging on the ground.
She don't need to frown.
