You keep me waiting, you keep me waiting
You are the love of my life, you are the sun that shines on me
And now that we've come so far, something is wrong, what could it be
You tell me you need some time alone, baby there's way too much at stake

I can't be still while you're gone, when will I know, how long will it take
Remember the good times weren't too hard to find, oh no
Now minutes turn to hours, hours turn to days
Isn't there anything you can say?

[Chorus]
You keep me waiting, still waiting for you, oh girl I don't know what to do
(I'm waiting) first you're here then you're done
I'm afraid you've been leading me on
(You keep me waiting)

Are we the pawns in this game, well if it's true, who's moving you
We lay it all on the line, how can we play if we don't know the rules
Those two little words you find so hard to say, oh yeah
Now hours turn to days, days turn to weeks
I said I'm sorry but still you won't speak

[Chorus]

Don't lead me on, no

Oh I don't understand, it seems to go hand in hand
Oh you made me believe, oh, oh, oh
I'm still waiting, still waiting for you, oh girl I don't know what to do
(I'm waiting) first you're here then you're done

I'm afraid you've been leading, leading me on
(You keep me waiting) oh girl I don't know what to do
(I'm waiting) first you want me then you don't
You say you love me but baby, baby you won't
(You keep me waiting)
