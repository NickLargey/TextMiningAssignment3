I once saw a man on fire
Staring out his window
Watching as the flames grew
higher and higher
I thought that I saw him cry
Or was he only laughing?
As his laugh went rushing out

And maybe we're just like him
Maybe we're all waiting
For a moment to begin

Who of us are open?
Who of us have freedom, really?
Who of us can tell me what these 
dark days will bring?
All of us are hurting 
All of us are crazy now
All of us are watching the world
as it spins

I once had a bird like you
A bird of prey
Still you're tearing at my insides
And yesterday when you flew
So far away
If you find the morning
save a piece for me

Who of us are open?
Who of us have freedom, really?
Who of us can tell me what these 
dark days will bring?
All of us are hurting 
All of us are crazy now
We're crazy now!

I smoke a cigarette
I'll eat the flesh instead
Another whiskey more or less
Or more or less yeah
I like the drugs that sail
I love you when we fail
When we fail

I once saw a man on fire
Staring out his window
Watching as the flames grew
higher and higher
I thought that I saw him cry
Or was he only laughing?
Laughing

Who of us are open?
Who of us have freedom, really?
Who of us can tell what these 
dark days can bring?
All of us are hurting 
All of us are crazy now
We're crazy now!

All of us are hating
All of us are dreaming
All of us are watching 
these times of our lives
We want it all
We want for nothing
For nothing now
