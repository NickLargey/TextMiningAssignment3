Inside out, I wear my Sunday best
Inside out, I bare my soul in jest
I'm not sick, I'm just all wet
The paint is thick, it's not dry yet

Inside out, my home is on the street
Inside out, I'm not so hard to meet
Some say "Hi" or smile as they pass
Some just look, some just laugh
Some give spare change
Somewhere, no doubt
Some turn their pockets inside out

Inside out, there is no black and white
Inside out, the queen becomes the knight
We're all cut from one design
Not the same, but equally fine
And equally crude, there's no doubt
When viewed from the inside out

Inside out, the hero is a coward
Inside out, a fortress is a flower
Inside out, upside down
Outside in, round and round

Whoever's gonna win
When change comes about
It must begin from the inside out

Inside out, I wear my Sunday best
Insdie out, I've nothing to protest
