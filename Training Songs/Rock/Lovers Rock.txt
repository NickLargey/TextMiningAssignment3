LOVER'S ROCK
WRITER DAVE BURGESS

Now there's a little place that I know about
I go there with my baby everytime I take her out
We park by the rock and watch the lights down below
And I tell her things that she ought to know
They call it Lover's rock, they call it Lover's rock
Well, everybody's rockin' and there's very little talkin'
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on
I just can't wait for Saturday night
We'll park by the rock in the pale moonlight
I'll grab my baby and steal a kiss and then
I know she'll be stealin' it right back again
They call it Lover's rock, they call it Lover's rock
Well, everybody's rockin' and there's very little talkin'
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on
Well, everybody's got a little place they call their own
Where they can always go when they wanna be alone
Lover's rock is the best around
It's a short way up but it's a long way down
They call it Lover's rock, they call it Lover's rock
Well, everybody's rockin' and there's very little talkin'
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on
Huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on
Huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on
