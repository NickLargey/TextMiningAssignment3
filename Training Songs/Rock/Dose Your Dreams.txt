I saw an angel up in the sky
Come down to find me adrift in time
I asked the angel, "Did David die?"
"Have you come to get me? Is this goodbye?‚Äù
The angel flickered, swung gracefully
And sang the most luminous poetry
She told me heaven lay in my soul
That she would take me if I want to go

Look for the light, Look for the light
Look for the light, Look for the light
Look for the light, Look for the light
Look for the light, Look for the light
Look for the light, Look for the light
Look for the light, Look for the light
Look for the light, Look for the light
Look for the light, Look for the light
Look for the light, Look for the light

I touched the angel, I felt her warmth
And then the air filled with her dust
She said, Breathe it baby, take it inside
You can learn to fly son, let's go for a ride
She found the things that hid from me
Inside my heart, and set them free
I asked the angel, "What could I be?"
She whispered "Baby, just dose your dreams
Dose your dreams, dose your dreams"

Then I took everything in my soul (Dose your dreams, dose your dreams)
Everything angry, everything cold
All of the fear that I could carry
I brought them with me across the threshold
'Cause in the light of tomorrow
They all look so, so beautiful
By now I'm dancing, tears start to stream
On down my face, and then I start to scream
Just dose your dreams, just dose your dreams
Just dose your dreams, just dose your dreams
Just dose your dreams!

Then she said, "David, I have to go
When the world gets, heavy just let me know
If you ever need me, just turn me on
And when you feel frightened
Look for the light, look for the light
Look for the light, look for the light"

For the light, dose your dreams
For the light, dose your dreams
For the light, dose your dreams
Dose your dreams, dose your dreams

Dreams are lost, they can't be found
We chase the echo, we hear no sound
Dreams are given, but one of them takes
We live alone, we know its fate

Dreams are lost, they can't be found
We chase the echo, for the sound
Dreams are broken, they can't be fixed
In the world, yeah the race

Dreams are broken
Dose your dreams, dose your dreams
Dose your dreams, dose your dreams
Dose your dreams, dose your dreams
Dose your dreams, dose your dreams
Dose your dreams, dose your dreams
Dose your dreams, dose your dreams

Dose your, dose your dreams
Dose your, dose your
Dose your, dose your dreams
Dose your, dose your
