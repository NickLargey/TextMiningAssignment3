Can we try to rewire
Get a screw I got the pliers
Hold her down
I'll move with ease
Take away her feel nothing disease
Rub it till she feels fire
I'll make her starve to feel desire
Tempt her vice
But only tease
Take away her feel nothing disease
Got a feeling she's feeling nothing
And I really think she might be a
Machine that breathes involuntary
Palpitations a heart that cannot
Bleed overwhelm her we could film 
Her everybody scream
Hey hey it's a sunny day
Happy took the rain away
There's more to it than what you got yesterday
Hey hey it's a sunny day
Hey hey it's a sunny day
Take it off and fly away
The skin is showing on the birds today
Hey hey it's a sunny day
Show her too many things
Overstimulation brings
Lots of wants and lots of needs
Take away her feel nothing disease
Got a feeling she's feeling nothing
And I really think she might be a
Machine that breathes involuntary
Palpitations a heart that cannot 
Bleed overwhelm her we could film
Her everybody scream
Hey hey it's a sunny day
Happy took the rain away
There's more to it than what you got yesterday
Hey hey it's a sunny day
Hey hey it's a sunny day (I touched the sky)
Take it off and fly away
The skin is showing on the birds today (and I came back)
hey hey it's a sunny day
