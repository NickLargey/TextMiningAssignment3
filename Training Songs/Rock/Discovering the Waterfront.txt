I will promise myself I won't care
distracting myself from your stare
and I've seen this mistake once before
with your games I will never fall for
I've hung up my guns....
I won't kill again!
[Chorus]
I won't forget you! (I won't forget you)
I'm not going to let you win!
but I'm tired of lying!
tired of fighting you!
and it's not going to change
you ask for my heart
you know I'm down
but not the way you lie to me, you tear it all apart and beg for me to say
I sail off to sea, I'm not coming back
[Chorus]
count me down
make that sound
when you know it makes no sense
count me down
until you mess around
when I know you can't ever change
why am I trying?
throw it overboard
when I'm ready to we'll progress
count me down
make that sound
break the silence!
pretend its not forever
I'll pull myself together
I'll save it, I'll forget her, I'll breathe....
and I'll say she never hurt me
and look at it as learning
and laugh about the good and the bad
because I will live forever
we don't belong together
I know I'll be the better.
one day I will make it through.
[Chorus 2 X's till fade]
