I got smokestack lightning
Runnin' through my veins
Trouble hangin' round my neck
It's like a ball & chain

Gotta be more than this to being alive
Everyday spittin' out nine to five
Every night runnin' all over this town
Comin' home feelin' no pain

I got a hunger and cold desire
Someday its gonna take me higher
Just another small flame
Just runnin' through the fire
Just another small flame
Just runnin' through the fire

Runnin' through the fire
Baby, its gonna get hot
Runnin' through the fire
Honey, if you're ready or not
Runnin' through the fire
Honey, any way you turn
Runnin' through the fire
Baby, you're gonna get burned

I'm rollin' down the alleyway
Headin' for the neon lights
I got a soul full of struggling
Need a little mercy tonight

This worlds asking just a little too much
Honey, I need a lovin' tender touch
Just move your body close to mine
Make everything alright

I got a hunger and cold desire
Someday its gonna take me higher
Just another small flame
Runnin' through the fire
Just another small flame
Runnin' through the fire

Runnin' through the fire
Baby, its gonna get hot
Runnin' through the fire
Honey, if you're ready or not
Runnin' through the fire
Baby, any way you turn
Runnin' through the fire
Baby, you're gonna get burned

Runnin' through the fire
Honey, its gonna get hot
Runnin' through the fire
Baby, if you're ready or not
Runnin' through the fire
Honey, any way you turn
Runnin' through the fire
Baby, you're gonna get burned

Runnin' through the fire
Honey, its gonna get hot
Runnin' through the fire
Baby, if you're ready or not
Runnin' through the fire
Honey, any way you turn
Runnin' through the fire
Baby, you're gonna get burned
