I've got your picture that you gave to me
And it's signed with love just like it used to be
The only thing different the only thing new
I've got your picture he's with you

I've got the records that we used to share
And they sound the same as when you were here
The only thing different the only thing new
I've got your records he's got you

I've got your memory or has it got me
I really don't know but I know it won't let me be
I've got your class ring oh that proved you'd care
And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear
The only thing different the only thing new
I've got these things and he's with you
