I am alone but adored
By a hundred thousand more
Then I sin when you were the last 
And I have known love
Like a whore
From at least ten thousand more
Then I swore when you were the last 
When you were the last high
Igh-igh-igh

You were awake
And I should've stayed
But wondered
I was only out for a day
Out for a day
It was Chicago for a moment and then
It was Paris and London for a few days
But I am alone but adored
By a hundred thousand more
Then I swore when you were the last-
When you were the last high
Igh-igh-igh

When you were the last high
Igh-igh-igh

I was the first to have spoken
And I said just about
All of the things you shouldn't say
So maybe you loved me but now
Maybe you don't
And maybe you'll call me
Maybe you won't

So I am alone but adored 
By a hundred thousand more
Then I sin when you were the last 
And I have known love 
Like a whore
From at least ten thousand more
Then I swore when you were the last 
When you were the last high
Igh-igh-igh
And you were the last high
Igh-igh-igh
