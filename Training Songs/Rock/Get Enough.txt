He calms me down when I'd rather be out of my mind
He calms me down when I'm not ready to unwind
He'll be my clown when I'd rather be black inside
He'll be my clown with that evil look in his eyes
Oh I know
He can be a thorn in my side
 But even so
 I just can't get enough
 Just can't get enough
He slows me down when I'm happy running out of time
 He slows me down, he's an enemy of mine
 He runs me down, and as far as I can see
He'll run me down 'til there's nothing left in me
Oh I know
He can be a thorn in my side
 But even so
 I just can't get enough
 Just can't get enough
I can be a monster if I want to be
 But he's got me beaten by a landslide
He's just crazy
He calms me down like a tumor inside my heart
 But he knows me well
 I just can't get enough
 Just can't get enough
