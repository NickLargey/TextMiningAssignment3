I walked out in the city night,
A burning in my eyes, 
Like it was broad daylight.
And it was hot, 
Down there in the crowd.
The stars went out 
Behind a thunder cloud.
Chatter in the air, 
Like a telegraph line.
Big drops hissing on the neon sign.
Thumping in my heart, 
And it's hurting me to see.
Smokestack blowing, now they're pouring 
Heavy water on me,
Pouring heavy water on me, 
Pouring heavy water on me, heavy water.

She was a southern girl. 
We stared man to man.
I move like a stranger
In this strange land.
She was a round hole, 
I was a square peg.
I watched the little black specks 
Running down her leg.
Didn't seem to mind 
That dirty rain coming down
Shirt hanging open. 
She was wet and brown.
Thumping in my heart, 
And it's hurting me to see.
Smokestack blowing, 
Now they're pouring 
Heavy water on me,
Pouring heavy water on me, 
Pouring heavy water, 
Pouring heavy water, heavy water.

What goes up has to fall back down.
It's no night to be out 
Dancing in a party town
When it runs hot and it runs so wide
Running in the street 
Like a thin black tide.
Chatter in the air, 
Like a telegraph line.
Big drops hissing on the neon sign.
Thumping in my heart, 
And it's hurting me to see.
Smokestack blowing, 
Now they're pouring 
Heavy water on me,
Pouring heavy water on me, oh, 
Pouring heavy water on me,
Pouring heavy water on me, oh, 
Pouring heavy water on me,
Oh, pouring heavy water on me.
