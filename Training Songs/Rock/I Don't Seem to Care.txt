I don't seem to care about
Going' to school
The golden rule
Reading a book
The president's a crook

moral values
A nightly news
Gettin' a job
That I'm a beer drinking slob

some people call me apathetic
(but at least I don't read dianetics)

I don't seem to care about
Hypocrites
Politics
Hippy chicks
Porno flicks
