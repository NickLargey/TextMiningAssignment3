Tomorrow you’ll be on your way
Could be Memphis or L.A.
No questions just get out and play

Wake up call to catch the plane
You know you’re on the road again
Someone’s bangin’ in your head
Why did you get so late to bed?

Runnin’ late and feelin’ bad
That breakfast was the worst you’ve had
Make the gate no time to spare
Before you know you’re in the air

747 flies us high
Much higher than we’re meant to be
You’re six miles high but feelin’ down
You wish you could be on the ground

Find your bags and walk for miles
The customs man is waitin’ there
Immigration cause delay
You wonder, if you’ll ever play

Limousine is standin’ by
We get inside and drive a while
F.M. station soundin’ good
And gettin’ better every mile

Hotel lobby looks the same
With all the same old girls in town

Press reception takes the day
With all the same old things to say
Need your picture, smile this way
And will you tell me what you play

So, you wanna be a rock 'n' roll star
Just listen now to what I say
Get yourself an electric guitar
And take some time and learn to play

Your roadies call to say okay
The sound check can get underway
Sound check over, had some fun
A waste of time for everyone
Time has come to start the show

It's boogie time for everyone
Check guitars before you go
They’re close enough for rock 'n' roll
The lights are low

The crowd is high, much higher than
They're meant to be
We take the stage and start to play
The lights come up for all to see

Here we are again, singin' the same old songs
Lookin for someone who will sing along
Here we are again playin' the same old scenes
Lookin' for someone who will share our dreams
Here we are again facing the same old sights
Lookin' for someone who will share our nights
