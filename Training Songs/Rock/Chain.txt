Chain
I feel the words falling a rhythm
I see the wind bearing it's decision to never give in
I'm amazed

I hear the words from some kind of silence
When the world falls into violence
We'll never give in
Chain

I see the world falling in a rhythm 
I feel the wind bearing it's decision to never give in
I'm afraid
I hear the words from some kind of silence 

When the world falls into violence
They'll never give in
Chained in silence
The rhythm of violence

Change all around us 
Change in everything you see
I'm amazed
I see the world in revolution

Within the darkness a solution
We'll never give in
Chained in silence
The rhythm of violence

Change all around us
Change in everything you see
