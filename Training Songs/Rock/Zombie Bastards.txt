Die, die, you zombie bastards
We know what you want

"And you know they're out there, don't you?"
 
Welcome to the jungle, to the jungle
Baby, it's you and me
Walk between the raindrops, 'tween the raindrops
Singing along to Queen
My heart pumps Kool-Aid
Everybody playin' it safe, la-dee-da
Dig a little deeper, a little bit deeper
Baby, it's you and me

That's right
Music saved my life
Wild eyes
We don't have much time

Die, die, you zombie bastards
We know what you want
Die, die, you zombie bastards
Keep on, blah, blah, blah
We can go up, we go down
We gon' run you out of town
We can go up, we go down
We'll be seein' you around
Yeah
Die, die, you zombie bastards

I don't know karate or kung fu
But I'm gonna make it in this world
Won't be pumping diesel
For mean people
I'ma fight back with words
Listen to reason
Or we'll get cast out of Egypt, la-dee-da
I'm just tryin' to live
And get my kicks
And you gotta be human first

That's right
Music saved my life
Wild eyes
We don't have much time

Die, die, you zombie bastards
We know what you want
Die, die, you zombie bastards
Keep on, blah, blah, blah
We can go up, we go down
We gon' run you out of town
We can go up, we go down
We'll be seein' you around
Yeah
Die, die, you zombie bastards

If I die, it means that I
Lived my life and that's much better than
Hidin' in a hole
Die, die, you zombie bastards

Die, die, you zombie bastards
We know what you want
Die, die, you zombie bastards
Keep on blah blah blah
We can go up, we go down
We gon' run you out of town
We can go up, we go down
We'll be seein' you around
Yeah
Die, die, you zombie bastards
