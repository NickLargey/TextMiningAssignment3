Something stinks in your playpen
The mule is dead and rotting
(You're gonna lose)
You're hanging out with your best friend
'Cause you're too afraid of pushin'
(You're gonna lose)
The baboon crawled in your mouth and ate your brain
You think maybe you wanna be famous
(You're gonna lose)

But I'm not talking to you 
I'm not talking to you
Not talking about you

Since back in the day when JFK
Pioneered the use of amphetamine
(You're gonna lose)
Since 1984 when the president's wife
Was a plain old Hollywood cocksucker
(You're gonna lose)
Isn't it time that you made up your mind
And leave behind those childish things?
(You're gonna lose)

But I'm not talking to you 
I'm not talking to you
Not talking about you
