If I stuck my ears to the ground
Down where the bugs are crawling around
Shoot me up to the aeroplanes
Like a jackinabox with springs in my wings
This is a nice mess, I don't feel so lonely

Deep inside the ether's air
I'm taking the lift and you're taking the stairs
Shoot me up to the aeroplanes
Like a jackinabox with springs in my wings
This is a nice mess, I don't feel so lonely

Oh no, my world is on fire
Someone get some water 'cause I think I'm gonna burn
Oh no, my world is on fire
Someone get some water 'cause I think I'm gonna burn
Hey Joe I'm tasting all your flavours
Ain't no piece of cake
But life ain't dishing nothing I can't take
