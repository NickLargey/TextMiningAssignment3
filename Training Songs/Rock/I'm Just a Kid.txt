I woke up it was 7
I waited 'til 11
To figure out that no one would call
I think I got a lot of friends
But I don't hear from them
What's another night all alone
When you're spending every day on your own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid
And life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid
I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares 'cause I'm alone
And the world is
Having more fun then me
Tonight

And maybe when the night is dead
I'll crawl into my bed
I'm staring at these four walls again
I'll try to think about the last time
I had a good time
Everyone's got somewhere to go
And they're gonna leave me here on my own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid
And life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid
I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares
'Cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me

What the hell is wrong with me
Don't fit in with anybody
How did this happen to me?
Wide awake I'm bored and
I can't fall asleep
And every night is the worst night ever

I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid (I'm just a kid)
Yeah, I'm just a kid (I'm just a kid)
I'm just a kid (I'm just a kid)

I'm just a kid
And life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid
I know that its not fair
Nobody cares
'Cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody wants to be alone in the world

I'm just a kid
And all life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid
I know that its not fair
Nobody cares 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
Nobody cares 'cause I'm alone
And the world is
Having more fun than me

Tonight
I'm all alone
Tonight
Nobody cares
Tonight
'Cause I'm just a kid tonight
