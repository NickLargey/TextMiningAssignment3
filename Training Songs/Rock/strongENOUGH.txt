I’m not the kind of girl you thought I was
People know of all your sins
Open time will make it fine
I’m walking over miles of pain
All that separates is the dream to be free
The way you mistreat me ceases to break my spirit in two

My heart is headed out the door
Don’t need your abuse no more
Won’t take your disrespect
I’m smart enough, grown enough
My heart is headed out the door
Don’t need your abuse no more
Strong enough to see no changes have been made for my home comin’
I’m strong enough, strong enough
Strong enough, I’m strong enough

Always been loving you
Yet there is only so much I can take
Real words have been unsaid
I kept it in because I felt too ashamed
You love your hurting more than life
I’m done giving you all of myself

My heart is headed out the door
Don’t need your abuse no more
Won’t take your disrespect
I’m smart enough, grown enough
My heart is headed out the door
Don’t need your abuse no more
Strong enough to see no changes have been made for my home comin’
I’m strong enough, strong enough
Strong enough, I’m strong enough

I’ve made up my mind, made up my mind
Won’t be wasting my time with you
I’ve made up my made, made up my mind
I ain’t afraid no more

My heart is headed out the door
Don’t need your abuse no more
Won’t take your disrespect
I’m smart enough, grown enough
My heart is headed out the door
Don’t need your abuse no more
Strong enough to see no changes have been made for my home comin’
My heart is headed out the door
Don’t need your abuse no more
Won’t take your disrespect
I’m smart enough, grown enough
My heart is headed out the door
Don’t need your abuse no more
Strong enough to see no changes have been made for my home comin’
I’m strong enough, strong enough
Strong enough, I’m strong enough

I’m strong enough
I’m strong enough
I’m strong enough
I’m strong enough
