When you reign it down
Lights come
When you reign it down
Lights come
When you reign it down
Lights come
When you reign it down
Lights come

You're packing up, packing up
I won't see you again
But you have made, you have made it up,
You're packing up, packing up
I won't see you again
But you have made, you have made it up,

When you reign it down
Lights come
When you reign it down
Lights come
When you reign it down
Lights come

When you reign it down
Lights come
When you reign it down
Lights come
When you reign it down
Lights come
When you reign it down
Lights come, when you reign it down, lights come

Keep going round and round and round
