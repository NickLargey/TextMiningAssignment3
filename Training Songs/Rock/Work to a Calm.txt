GEMMA HAYES LYRICS

I Worked Myself Into A Calm

A slow walk
Will do you good 
Try and take it all in 

You said 
You'll hold me down 
Show me how to turn this mess around 

You can cry 
No one is looking at you 
You can cry, cry 

Can't stay 
Out of luck 
Have trouble trying to wake myself 

That's alright 
I caught myself 
Dragged me up to better health 

You can cry 
No-one is looking at you 
You can cry, cry 

You can cry 
No one is looking at you 
You can cry, cry 

All good things must change 
And i'd fight it 
If i could 
All good things must change 

I worked myself into a calm 
I worked myself 

You can cry 
No-one is looking at you 
You can cry, cry 

You can cry 
No one is looking at you 
You can cry, cry 

All good things must change 
And i'd fight it, if I could 

All good things must change
