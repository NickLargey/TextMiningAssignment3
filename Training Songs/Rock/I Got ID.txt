My lips are shakin' my nails are bit off
Been a month since I've even heard myself talk
Only advantage this life's got on me
Picture empty cup in the middle of the sea

And I fought back in my mind
Never lets me be right, I got memories, I got shit
So don't you go and show it

Oh, I walked the line, when you held me in at night
Oh, I walked the line, when you held my hand at night

On empty shells seem so easy to crack
Got all these questions 
Don't know who I could even ask
So I'll just lie, and wait for the dream
Where I'm not ugly as you're lookin' at me

And I sent you to bed 
Oh, in a little while I'll see now
If just once I found true love
Oh, I'd say it like I mean it

But I walked the line
When you held me in at night
Oh, I walked the line
When you held my hand at night
Oh, I walked the line
When you held me close at night
I paid the price
Never held you in real life

My lips are shakin'.
