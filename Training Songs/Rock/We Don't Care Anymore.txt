Underneath the gone
In front of waiting eyes
Our time has just begun
No second chance to die

So we walk the longest days
To live inside the shortest nights
We compromise our hearts
To keep them satisfied

The shadows of our past
Are doing more
But judgment means nothing
That's not what we're fighting for

We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore

Underneath the gone
In front of doubting eyes
We walk this path as one
Take on the world tonight

And we'll carve our name
Into their forms
We'll never sell ourselves
That's not what we're fighting for

We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore

I, won't, let this one
I, won't, let this one die
I, won't let it die

There is only one thing
(There is only one thing)
That matters this time
(That matters, that matters this time...)

And the hands of judgement
I won't let it die
No sad goodbyes
Regrets left behind

I won't let it die!
This time. Yeah!
This time, I won't let it die
That's not what we're fighting for

We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore

No, we don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore

I, won't, let this one
I, won't, let this one die!
