He looks so good, my honey to me
Everything I want everything I need
We got a good thing going,
Feeling in my heart should only keep on growing
Too good to be true 

Checkered love got me thinking of
All the mess I made, just a ton of trouble
Always left bad blood
When I was a kid in America
Pulling it apart 

Can I keep it under control?
I could never keep my eyes on the road for long enough to know, oh
Ain't it true, always looking out for something better than you choose
Pulling it apart 

A siren for you baby
Taking over now I feel you
Taking over now I want you
Lying on a bed of roses
In a sea of broken arrows (you can do it you can make it happen)
I can feel my honey, oh yeah!
Don't fall under my wheels
Run over, just like a juggernaut
Oh yeah! send his body back to me 

Jump-start heart, now don't fall apart
I gotta get it right, so tell me
Killer what you got?
Don't wanna blow it 'cause I know just what
I hold in my hands 

Parted lips never tell me to go
I wanna do you right, never be another like you I know, oh
Ain't it true, always looking out for something better yeah you are 
Pulling it apart 

A siren for you baby
Taking over now I feel you
Taking over now I want you
Lying on a bed of roses
In a sea of broken arrows (you can do it you can make it happen)
I can feel my honey, oh yeah!
Don't fall under my wheels
Run over, just like a juggernaut
Oh yeah, send his body back to me 

Pick him up and sew him up and send him to me
Fix him up and shake him up and send him to me 

Pick him up and sew him up and send him to me (pulling it apart)
Fix him up and shake him up and send him to me (pulling it apart)
Taking over honey I can feel it in me (send him back to me)
Fix him up and send him to me, yeah! 

Ain't it true, always looking out for something better yeah you are
Pulling it apart 

Baby, taking over now I feel you
Taking over now I want you
Lying on a bed of roses
In a sea of broken arrows (you can do it you can make it happen)
I can feel my honey, oh yeah!
Don't fall under my wheels
Run over, just like a juggernaut
Oh yeah, send his body back to me, me, me
Oh baby, taking over now I feel you, oh yeah!
Don't fall under my wheels
Run over, just like a juggernaut
Oh yeah! Send his body back to me
