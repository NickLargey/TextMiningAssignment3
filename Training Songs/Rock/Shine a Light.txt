Don’t talk to me about simple things
There is no such thing 
All a man can build is his vision
and I love my man for trying

A crime of passion
A cardiac arrest
I hope a little rest 
Comes to you

You shine a light
A light on me
It gets me through

Sister don’t reduce yourself
You gotta find something to love Pidgeon girls got no religion 
You are a diamond in the rough

Half done, half done
Here comes a gentleman
He'll put you to the test
I hope a little rest 
Comes to you, comes to you

Cause you shine a light
A light on me, a light on me
It gets me through
Cause you shine a light 
A light on me, a light on me
It gets me through

Baby’s got the fever
Mama’s washing the white sheets
A man is sleeping naked 
With a fire under his feet
