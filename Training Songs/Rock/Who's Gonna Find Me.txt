It's six in the morning
And there's no one else around
The mist, it is fallin'
As I look out on the town

It's playing on my mind
Wasting all my time away

It's too close for tears
And it's too hard to forget
It's too close for tears
I think I thought I said

It's playing on my mind
Wasting all my time away
Who's gonna find me?
Tell me where I can go?
Who's gonna find me, searching alone?

The face in the mirror
It's a face I've never met
Until I forgive her
I'll remember to forget

It's playing on my mind
Wasting all my time away
Who's gonna find me?
Tell me where I can go?
Who's gonna find me, searching alone?

And the hours, they fill
Now I'm underneath the spell once again

It's 6 in the evening
And I'm sweeping up the day
The people repeat them
But I am here to stay

It's playing on my mind
Wasting all my time, away
Who's gonna find me?
Tell me where I can go?
Who's gonna find me, searching alone?

It's playing on my mind
Wasting all my time away
