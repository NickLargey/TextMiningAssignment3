Crawl through the things that eat your flesh
Drown in my waters that know you best
Step inside I've been waiting here for you

Underneath where you shall crawl
Fly so high you'll never fall
Step inside we've been waiting here for you

Bow down you chose your maker
He never gives he's always the taker
The electric burns that fuel the fire
It's just your suicide messiah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Bow down you chose your maker
He never gives he's always the taker
The electric burns that fuel the fire
It's just your suicide messiah

Walk through the streets that know your name
All that's pure is now insane
Step inside I've been waiting here for you

Another trip another lie
Life's hand of doom you're feeling fine
Step inside we've been waiting here for you

Bow down you chose your maker
He never gives he's always the taker
The electric burns that fuel the fire
It's just your suicide messiah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Bow down you chose your maker
He never gives he's always the taker
The electric burns that fuel the fire
It's just your suicide messiah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Bow down you chose your maker
He never gives he's always the taker
Bow down you chose your maker
He never gives he's always the taker

The electric burns that fuel the fire
