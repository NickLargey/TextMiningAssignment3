Oh, yeah I feel alright tonight. 
Oh, man the stars are bright tonight. 
Like we could reach right out 
and help yourself to them. 

'Cause we want and what we need 
will one day bring us to our knees. 
Well, I am over it. 
You know that I have accepted it. 

[Chorus] 
Let's go for a ride. 
Let's go for a ride. 
Let's go for a ride. 
Go for a ride. 

[Chorus]

So, drive real fast through the underpass 
And if we die or if we crash. 
Well I'd be flattered to 
be buried right next to you. 

Cause what's yours is yours 
and what's mine is mine 
in the summertime under 
the blackened sky 
the world belongs to us 
baby lets use it up. 

[Chorus]
