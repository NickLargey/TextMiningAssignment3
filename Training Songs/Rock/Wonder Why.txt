You know for certain that you are a liar
You told me yourself you know it's true
But you won't put two and two together
You know the sum will expose you

And you wonder why you feel this way
And you wonder how long it will take to heal
And you wonder what you did to get here
And you wonder who will save you from you

You've tried everything that has been in your reach
But none of it seems to satisfy
So like a man lost at sea your thrist leads you to drink the water
The more you drink the more your throat runs dry and you wonder why

And you wonder why you feel this way
And you wonder how long it will take to heal
And you wonder what you did to get here
And you wonder who will save you from you
And you wonder why
And you wonder why

And you wonder why you feel this way
And you wonder how long it will take to heal
And you wonder what you did to get here
And you wonder who will save you from you
And you wonder why
And you wonder why
And you wonder why
And you wonder why
