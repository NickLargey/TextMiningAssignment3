Like a fly to doo doo 
You need me like a bird needs wings 
Or little bunny fufu who needs to bop the field mice 
So all the kids can sing 

They call me El Jefe 
El primo de los matadors 
The master of the metaphor, 
A chaw chewin' troubadour 
The one you've come to love and adore, 
And I've come to take you away 

Take you away 
Take you away 
Take you away 

Take you away 
Take you away 
Take you away 

I'll make you go goo goo 
Like a baby that sees candy right before its eyes 
I'll kiss your little boo boo 
Make it better than it's ever felt before 

They call me El Jefe 
El primo de los matadors 
The master of the metaphor, 
A chaw chewin' troubadour 
The one you've come to love and adore, 
And I've come to take you away 

I'll take you away now 
I'll take you away now 

Can you do the two step flesh-tone slide? 
Well I'll teach you 
Can you do the achy breaky eyeball dance? 
Well I'll teach you 

Can you do the two step flesh-tone slide? 
Well I'll teach you 
Can you do the achy breaky eyeball dance? 
Well I'll teach you 

They call me El Jefe 
The boss and the point man 
And I've come to take you away 
They call me El Jefe 
The boss and the hit man 
And I've come to take you away
