Ohs, yeahs, and ai ya yas 
[Verse 1:] 
Oh girl, yeah, yeah, yeah 
He says you almost need a bodyguard 
Just to go walking down the boulevard 
Little girl with their club feet 
You try to be so neat but they're messy when you eat 
When they gobble up the street 
Those picture-perfect images 
Pop another flash bulb and give a kiss 
But it's a clear absurdity, what's a person supposed to say 
Sorry about yesterday, guess that things are just that way 
 
[CHORUS:]  
Whoa, Madonna Road 
Boys with broken bones out in the night 
With secret messages to frightening to decode 
Whoa, Madonna Road 
 
[Verse 2:] 
Pump a little gas into the cylinder 
All these movie lights they must be killin' her 
She's been livin' on the take 
Waitin for a bigger break 
And I've seen you on the make 
What d' you think about the earthquake? 
Well I don't want to shake it up 
But move that camera quick before I break it up 
You've been standin' in that pose 
Now there's a wound that just been closed 
From an apartment of the host 
Anybody got a No-Doz 
 
REPEAT [CHORUS:]  TWICE 
REPEAT [VERSE 2] 
REPEAT [CHORUS:]  
I said whoa, Madonna Road 
I said whoa, Madonna Road 
I said whoa, Madonna Road 
Ai yi yi yis
