I was on my way to be with you today
And you know it's true because I wouldn't lie to you
First my car broke down so I had to hitch a ride
I was almost there when the motor died

[Chorus]
Don't hate me forever
I'm better late than never
I failed you I'm sorry
That's simply my life story

I know it's much too late to take you on a date
I know it is no use but this is my excuse
I was on a plane that was falling from the sky
I knew I had to survive so I could say goodbye

[Chorus]

You change your mind like you change the time
That I was gonna call you or say I was about to
You change your mind like you change the time
I said that I would be there but then I didn't have a thing to wear

[Chorus]

My life story
