Said I'm scared, Lord, I'm scared, I'm terrified
Never been much on religion
But I sure never like to hear the call
I'm scared Lordy, Lord, I'm shakin' I'm petrified
Never been much on religion but I sure enough
Just fell down on my knees

Heard the choir singing something about goodwill toward men
And even then sleeping in heavenly peace
Stopped by to see St.Thomas
On a cold and dreary New York afternoon
Something in the air was oh, so rare
I don't know what it was but I know that it's still right there

And I'm scared Lordy
Lord I'm shaken I'm terrified
Never been much on religion but I sure enough
Just fell down on my knees

Livin' in confusion, searchin' for truth that I'd never found
I needed, somethin' to really believe
Turned toward the heavens on a dark and stormy winter afternoon
Something in the air was oh, so rare
I'm not really sure what it was
But I know for sure that it's still right there

I'm scared, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey I'm terrified
Never been much in religion
But I sure enough fell down on my knees
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm scared you know
I'm shakin', I'm layin' awake thinking about her now I'm terrified
Never been much on religion
But I sure enough would like to hear the call

Common now, give me a sign your listening to me
You hear me talkin', you hear my cryin'
It's confusin' to me Lord, I'm terrified
Never been much on religion but I sure enough
Just fell down on my knees
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
