My home, anywhere expect no comforts save for air
Take it anyway I could leave or I could stay
Wouldn't matter much to me, much to me
My home, it's so cold, air-conditioned to the bone
Take me anywhere, I could see a light out there
I could see a light up these, a light up these
A light up these, a light up these

It's all the same, it's all the same, it's all the same

My friend's dad got bored, changed his sex and had no more

No more wife, no more kids, nothing left
To live with to exist, so, so, so, so
You should take your handicaps, channel them and feed them back
Till they become your strengths, hollowed out it's all the same

It's all the same, it's all the same, it's all the same
It's all the same, it's all the same, it's all the same
