Young Boy Blues
Every time I kiss somebody new
I make believe I'm kissing you
But I can't kid my aching heart
'Cause my heart knows we're still apart
And each night is like a thousand years
Since I got these young boy blues

I want to cry when I hear your name
If I cry I feel ashamed
So I let my pride be my guide
I keep those tears inside
And each night is like a thousand years
I can't lose these young boy blues

Don't know where to go
Don't know what to do
I'm so lost and lonely since I lost you

Every time I kiss somebody new
I make believe I'm kissing you
But I can't kid my aching heart
'Cause my heart knows we're still apart
And each night is like a thousand years
Since I got these young boy blues

Don't know where to go
Don't know what to do
I'm so lost and lonely since I lost you

Every time I kiss somebody new
I make believe I'm kissing you
But I can't kid my aching heart
'Cause my heart knows we're still apart
And each night is like a thousand years
I can't lose these young boy blues
Each night is like a thousand years
Since I got these young boy blues
Each night is like a thousand years
I can't lose these young boy blues
