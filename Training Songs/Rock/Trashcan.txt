Brothers hold the line till we got something
This world is way too small to feel like nothing
I was found at the train tracks looking so homeless at you
You came like a copper, you said, "Son, it's time to move"

My love is coming, I can barely hardly wait around

When my mother left the bat was the only one here
He is just a reason why I'm still here
My mother's well spoken though I didn't get that gene
But yes I had lost it, yes my eyes they are green

My love is coming, I can barely hardly wait around

Well, if you hide your questions there's no answer
I finally found the cure for my own cancer, yeah, yeah

My love is coming, I can barely hardly wait
My heart is thumping I can feel it more with every beat
My love is coming, I can barely hardly wait around
