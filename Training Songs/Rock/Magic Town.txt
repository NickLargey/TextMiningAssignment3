They told me the streets were all paved with gold 
but these dirty sidewalls are grey and concrete cold.
They said neon lights were a beautiful sight
But how 'bout the one blinkin' in my room all night
 
 
Hey, where's the magic in this Magic Town? 
Where's the good life they said could be found?
where's the magic to make all my big dreams come true? 
I gotta find it girl before I send for you.
 
They said in this town you get rich in no time 
but here I am and I'm down to my last dime.
I just don't know why I bother to try 
when nobody here gives a hang if I live or die.

I'm gonna find it girl,
if it can be found before I bring you
