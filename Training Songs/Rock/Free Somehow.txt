Want to be free right now
Voices inside my head
Know I'll be free somehow
The quietest voices said

Staying awake a while
Old movies in black and bliss
Lost and still found somehow
In a place like this
A place just like this

Little windows of fantasy
Her eyes tell what she sees
Step back from this world for now
Think that I'll be coming 'round
Think I should be coming 'round

I want to be free somehow
See the forest for the grass
Wonder through it all
Through the looking glass

Smile appears on the tree branch there
Take the Hatter's words in jest
Don't wake her up,  she could be dreaming you
Just taking a little rest
A couple of moments rest

Kids remembering just to be
Make it up as they go
Stepping back from the mirrors and smoke
Think that I'll be coming round
Think I might be coming round
I guess that I'll be coming round

I want to be free somehow
Voice inside my head
Gonna be free right now
The quietest voices said

Settling in for a while
Something we'll never miss
Lost and still found somehow
What're you doing in a place like this
Nice girl in a place like this

Like she's watching a comedy
Laughing in her sleep
Drifting out of my body now
Don't think I'll be coming down
Don't think I'll be coming down
Don't think I'll be coming down
