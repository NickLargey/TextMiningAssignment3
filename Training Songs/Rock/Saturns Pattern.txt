Got up in a mind to get up 
Fixed on the day 
Shook any fears I had 
Washed them away

And what better way to wake
Than hearing their voice
Get up in a mind to get up
Daddy there’s more

You gotta clear the decks
It's Saturn's peak
The pattern’s dense
The world’s oblique
Change it all
It's Saturn's turn
Cut it clean
The pattern’s good

(Get up in a mind to get up)
(Daddy there's more)
(Get up in a mind to get up)
(The time is all yours)

What better way to start
Than hearing the call
Get up in a mind to get up
It’s ours to explore

You gotta clear the decks
It's Saturn's peak
The pattern’s dense
The world’s obscene
Change it all
The planet’s old
Cut it right
The cloth is bold

(Change that call)

(Get up in a mind to get up)
Clear the decks, let Saturn peak
(Get up in a mind to get up)
Cut it right, the world's obscene
(Get up in a mind to get up)
Change it all, it Saturn's turn
(Get up in a mind to get up)
