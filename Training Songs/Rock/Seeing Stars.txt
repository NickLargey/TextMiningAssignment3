The sand, the wind
My stars, I thought you'd never ask
The tide is in
A heart can only beat so fast

Could you do better now?
Les mers de moi, de vous
Could you do better now?
Les mers de moi, de vous

The moon, the sun
My stars, how did the night slip past?
This time you've won
A heart can only beat so fast

Could you do better now?
Les mers de moi, de vous
Could you do better now?
Les mers de moi, de vous

Could you do better now?
Les mers de moi, de vous
Could you do better now?
Les mers de moi, de vous

I guess I'm seeing stars again
I guess I'm seeing stars again
I guess I'm seeing stars again
I guess I'm seeing stars again
