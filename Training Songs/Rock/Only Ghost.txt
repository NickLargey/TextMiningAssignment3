I lost my way
I lost my way home
Stray to far and wound up
at your door
I lost my way
I lost my way home
Stray to far and wound up
at the coast

I love the wind
And I love the rain
I love the coast
But I've lost my only ghost
You're, You're my only ghost

I love the wind
And I love the rain
I love the coast
But I've lost my only ghost
You're, You're my only ghost

You call my name
You call my name out
Took the words
I had right out my mouth
You call my name
You call my name out
Took my hand and showed me
The way south

You're, You're my only ghost

I love the wind
And I love the rain
I love the coast
But I've lost my only ghost
You're, You're my only ghost
