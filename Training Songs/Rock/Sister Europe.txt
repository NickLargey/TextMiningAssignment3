stupid on the steinway
so sick upon a steinway
the sailors drown
see them talk and see them drown
and see them drink and fall around
upon the floor
sister of mine, home again
sister of mine, home again
lonely in a crowded room
the radio plays out of tune
so silently
the radio upon the floor
is stupid it plays aznavour
so out of key
sister of mine
home again
sister of mine
home again
broken on a ship of fools
even dreams must fall to rules
so stupidly
words are all just useless sound
just like cards they fall around
and we will be
sister of mine
home again
sister of mine
home again
buy a car and watch it rust
sister see them fall to dust
they fall around
in another crowded room
paint me like the shirt i'm in
honestly
sister of mine
home again
sister of mine
home again
sister of mine
sister of mine
sister of mine
sister of mine
sister
