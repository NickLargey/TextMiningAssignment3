I'd never call this an unpleasant situation
I'd never teach you how to lie
But sometimes I have been walking numb
And I must catch myself before I cry
Before I cry
I never call anything ugly
I never call anything strange and alone
I never want to, take things lightly
Like they have never been my own

Oh, don't - now I haven't heard it yet
Oh, don't - I haven't heard
But I know them - and they are inclined to see
Just who is
And isn't
A lover in the city

I always thought I would be star bright
I always thought you'd feel it too
But sometimes I have been making conversation
And I must catch myself
Before I'm down
I'm down on you
I never think they would be scaring me
scared couples in the cold
They look so fine in their eagerness
I wonder to myself just how they know

Oh, don't - now I haven't heard it yet
Oh, don't - I haven't heard
But I know them - and they are inclined to see
Just who is
And isn't
A lover in the city

I swear
I'm staking out the whole world
I swear
I'm staking out the whole world
I'm staking out the whole world

I could never entertain you
I'd be far too scared to try
But sometimes I have been talking dumb
And I forget myself
And I forget myself
And don't ask, why?

Oh, don't - now I haven't heard it yet
Oh, don't - I havn't heard
But I know them - and they are inclined to see
Just who is
And isn't
A lover in the city
