I been way down
Holding on to nothing
I been so high
And let go of it all

I been so lost
That it soon became my home
I been right where I wanna be
And had no place to go

Feel me, feel me
Feel me, feel me
Feel me, don't you

Feel me, feel me
Feel me, feel me
Don't you fucking touch me
Don't you fucking touch me

I saw an angel
Shooting junk in Reno
Blinded by the devil
Playing checkers in the park

They're all out to get me
But I can't find no one today
Won't somebody help me
Just you don't get in my way

Feel me, feel me
Feel me, feel me
Feel me, don't you

Feel me, feel me
Feel me, feel me
Don't you fucking touch me
Don't you fucking touch me

Feel me, feel me
Feel me, feel me
Feel me, don't you

Feel me, feel me
Feel me, feel me
Feel me, don't you
Feel me, feel me
Feel me, feel me

Don't you fucking touch me
Don't you fucking touch me
Don't you fucking touch me
(Hey yeah)
Don't you fucking touch me
(Yeah)
