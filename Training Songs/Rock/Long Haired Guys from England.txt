All the girls in the music biz
Have credit cards they subscribe to Ms.
But they only want to f*ck
Long haired guys from England
From England

There's this girl at my record company
I dig her but she doesn't like me
I met her boyfriend the other night
He had a pony tail and he didn't talk right

He was a long haired guy from England
Long haired guy from United Kingdom
He was a long haired guy from England
Long haired guy from United Kingdom

All the girls in this here bar
Will treat you like you're a star
Don't get excited it's just luck
They'll ignore you if the guy from The Cult shows up

'Cause he's a long haired guy from England
Long haired guy from United Kingdom
Long haired guy from England
Long haired guy from United Kingdom

I'm getting on an aeroplane
Going someplace where the girls are sane
I bet in London I could get a date
'Cause I'm a short haired guy from the United States

I'm not a long haired guy from England
Long haired guy from United Kingdom
Long haired guy from England
Long haired guy from United Kingdom

That's the end of this here song
It's about as short as my hair is long
So I'm getting on my motorbike
Going someplace where the girls don't like

Long haired guys from England
Long haired guy from United Kingdom
Long haired guys from England
Long haired guy from United Kingdom
