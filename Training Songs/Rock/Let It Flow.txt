We have come to bring our praise to the one who changes hearts
We are moved by your love as you give yourself to us
And we pledge to give ourselves that the world will know your grace
This grace that captures me

(Chorus:)
I wanna see your spirit movin' through the streets
Touching everyone to bring us to our knees
So won't you pour out from the rivers of my soul
And let it flow, let it flow, let it flow

We have come to bring our praise to the one who changes hearts
We are moved by your love as you give yourself to us
And we pledge to give ourselves that the world will know your grace
This grace that covers me

(Chorus)

We need you
We yearn for you
We cry to you
We need you
(Repeat)
