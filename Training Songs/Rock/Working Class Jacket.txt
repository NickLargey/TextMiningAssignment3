Milk spills and mothers run away. Black shoes shine, flannel sheets are warm. 
She knows the price of Cheerios. 
He says, "It's just you and me now kid." 
He hopes the new job will make things better. 

She knows it won't matter. 
Alone at school she sits and dreams of John and Bobby Kennedy. 
But tonight she'll wear his working class jacket over her prom dress and dance as the pop sings, 
"It's a crazy world, and you're a messed up kid," 

And that's why you're my favorite, and I believe in you. 
Rich kids hate the skinheads, and the skinheads hate the rich kids. 
She gets thrown in with the deal. 
She knows just how it feels when God hates you and mothers run away. 

She says, "I'm gonna kill someone." Alone at school she sits and dreams of Johnny Marr and Morrissey. But tonight she'll wear his working class jacket over her prom dress and dance as the pop sings, 
"It's a crazy world, and you're a messed up kid," 
And that's why you're my favorite, and I believe in you.
