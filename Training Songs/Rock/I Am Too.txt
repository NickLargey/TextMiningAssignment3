You know
You've kept me down way too long now
I gotta find me a way to get over you somehow
I wanna sing for a woman that I've never seen honey
My love is bigger than a limousine

If you've got a heart with guts like mine honey
I can make that pale moon shine
I don't need some phony disco queen honey
My love is truer than a magazine

If you've been lookin' for me
I've been lookin' for you
And if you're lookin' for some trouble babe
I am too

Tell me somethin' that I don't know
Take me to someplace I can't go
You know I've seen all there is to see honey
You can't play those tricks on me

If you've been lookin' for me
I've been lookin' for you
And if you're lookin' for some trouble babe
I am too

Honey my love is like kerosene
I know you know what I mean
Come on honey
Let's twist and shout
I wanna hit this town til it's teeth come out

If you've been lookin' for me
I've been lookin' for you
And if you're lookin' for trouble
I am too
