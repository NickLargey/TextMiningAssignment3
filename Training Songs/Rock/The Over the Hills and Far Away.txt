Want you to hear me when I say 
That the blues is back, 
And it`s here to stay. 
 
I want to tell you a story, 
A story all about the blues. 
I want you to listen to me baby, 
While I sing it to you. 
Want you to hear me when I say 
That the blues is back, 
And it`s here to stay. 
 
I used to have me somebody, 
She mean`t the whole world to me. 
But she left me for someone else, 
Left my heart in misery. 

Yes, she did! 
But I knew the day she left me 
That the blues was gonna be a part of me. 
Yes, it was. 
 
Since you left me with the blues, 
It was the last thing I thought I could use. 
But I`m glad that you left me, 
Left me with the blues. 
If you hadn`t given me the blues, 
I wouldn`t find myself someone sweet as you. 
 
And I`m gonna tell you. 
I said hey, hey, the blues is alright. 
Hey, hey, the blues is alright.
