You imagine when you see her
That she's nothing less that perfect
That she has no aspirations
Beyond driving in her car
The car she looks so good in
Will she ever look that good again
You'll never have to know
Because she's gone

She passes in the left lane
And you're turned on by the chase
Her hair flies in the wind
As your mind begins to race
The grass is always greener
But I wish you could have seen her
Drunk and lying with the gutter in her face

Take me as I am
Take me as I am
For the woman that I am
Take me as I am

You think she knows the bible
And can swin the English Channel
Writes novels in her spare time
In a cabin in her woods
You wish I'd gone to college
And you wish I'd let my hair grow
You wish I didn't have so many moods

Take me as I am
Take me as I am
For the woman that I am
Take me as I am
Take me as I am

Once you said you were in love with me
And maybe you still are
But the passion you once showed me
Now is lost among the stars
And you fancy some new fancy girl
Will come and change your life around
But she just turned the corner in her car

While for some other dreamin' driver
I am that romantic stranger
Lookin' better than I am
More mysterious by far
Speeding through his dreams
While I'm drivin' in my car

Take me as I am
Take me as I am
For the woman that I am
Take me as I am
Take me as I am
