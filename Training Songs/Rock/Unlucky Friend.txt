Well I tried to disappear
But I'm still fucking here
Well I'll go ahead, say goodbye
'Cause I'll give it another try

Is it so hard to be who I am?
Isn't there anything to make it any easier?

Well I'm so tired of all your stupid lies
Well I'm so tired of all your tears

This is who I am
The unlucky friend
Will I have to hold your hand through darkness till the
End?

Well I tried to disappear
But I'm still here
