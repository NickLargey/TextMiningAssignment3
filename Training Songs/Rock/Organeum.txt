It's always strange the way I feel
When I'm looking back on things
We've been lucky maybe who knows
Or have we just made some good choices

Now joking in a landscape field
Just sleeping quietly below trees
Are we close to the end of dreams
We were blinded by the scene

I was quiet fine
Lost and wasting my time
Asleep just by your side
And I'm so lighter
My mind was close to get high 
So far away

The sun was disappearing fast
I was cold, laid on the grass
Awake by night, sad was my mind
My dreams are short when they are fine

I was quiet fine
Lost and wasting my time
Asleep just by your side
And I'm so lighter
My mind was close to get high 
So far away

Don't go away from me
Don't go away from here
I had not enough
And something is easy
When you looked to the sea
And that stupid stuff
Don't go away from me
Don't go away from here
I had not enough
I know we're not ready
Our things are not easy
Oh not easy
