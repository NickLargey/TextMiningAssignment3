Bag of bones and blood red cheeks
Guilty from the words I speak
Say the truth will set you free
But it won't for me
Cause I'm uneasy in my skin
Hangin' on by a thread
Life it hasn't left me yet
But I won't forget
Oh, the devil's been talkin'
(Oh oh oh)
The devil's been talkin'
(Oh oh oh)

The ship is setting off to sea
But it's sailing without me
I can't help but feel I'm on
An island born to sink
Oh, the devil's been talkin'

We can't change 
It's who we are
We are all alone
The devil's been talkin'
We can't change
It's who we are
We are all alone

I'm running out
Of this hole alone
These fingers bled
Down to the bone
And I can't move
This hell is cold
The chorus sings
This is home

Whoa
The devil's been talkin'
The devil's been talkin'
(Oh oh oh) Whoa
The devil's been talkin'
(Oh oh oh)
The devil is talkin'

I'm running out
Of this hole alone
These fingers bled
The devil is talkin'
I can't move
This hell is cold
The chorus sings

Bag of bones and blood red cheeks
Guilty from the words I speak
Say the truth will set you free
But it won't for me
Oh, the devil's been talkin'
