You're a no good heart breaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
And I don't know why
I let you do these things to me
My friends keep telling me
That you ain't no good
Baby they don't know
That I'd leave you if I could

I guess I'm uptight
And I'm stuck like glue
'Cause I ain't never
I ain't never, I ain't never, no, no
Loved a man, the way that I, I love you

Some time ago I thought
You run out of fools
But I was so wrong
You got one you'll never lose
The way you treat me is a shame
How could you hurt me so bad
Baby, don't you know that I'm the best thing
That you ever had

Kiss me once again
Don'cha never, never say that we're through
'Cause I ain't never
I aint never, I ain't never, no, no
Loved a man, the way that I, I love you

I can't sleep at night
I can't eat a bite
'Cause I'll never be free
Since you got, your hooks, in me

Whoa, oh, oh
Yeah! Yeah! 
I ain't never loved a man
I ain't never loved a man
Ain't never had a man that hurt me so bad

Never, never
