Here it comes 
The joy of being alone 
I'm such a child on my own 
Just a child on my own. 
'Cause I know it's true 
And I see it's right 
I know it's true 
And I see it's right 

Here it goes on Happiness is home 
Here it goes on 
Happiness is home 
Happiness is home 

And I know it's not a dream 
I don't want this to be sweet 
I just know it's not a dream 
I don't wanna get sick of it 
'Cause I know it's true 
And I see it's right 
I just know it's true 
And I see it's right 

Here it goes on, happiness is home 
Here it goes on, happiness is home 
Here it goes on, happiness is home 

Don't you say it 
I would say Don't you say it 
You talked too soon 
And don't you say it
and it's already late to go back, to get back 

Here it goes, on happiness is home 
Happiness is home 
Happiness is home
