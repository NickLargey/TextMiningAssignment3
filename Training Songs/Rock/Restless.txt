You talk to much
Oh, you never shut up
Come hell or high water
You're still, you're still a chatterbox
You talk too much 
Chatterbox

And I bet all the men who have been through your bed
Well, somehow now, baby
I think they just messed up your head
Your little head
Messed up your head

When the tide comes in, yeah
It all starts to spin 'round
Don't get excited
'Cause it just might bring those feelings down
You make me restless
You make me restless

Your nose is frosty from blow
Up six days in a row
Was eight guys or ten guys you slept with?
Well, only heaven knows
High above

Welcome to Silicone City
It's all tits and ass to me
Where Tropicana mudwrestlers marry rock stars
Must be some local disease
L.A. sleaze

When the tide comes in, yeah
It all starts ro spin 'round
Don't get excited
'Cause it just might bring those feelings down
Fatal attraction
When you're in action 
Just can't slow down
In the powder room, yeah
When you hit the ground 
We'll be around
To kick you down
And leave you breathless
You make me restless
So restless

When the tide comes in, yeah
It all starts to spin 'round
Don't get excited
'Cause it just might bring those feelings down
You make me restless
You make me restless
You make me restless
So restless
You make me restless
You make me restless
So restless
Shut up!
