Some words will cut you
Like the sharpest blade
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
Nothing is different
But something has changed
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
As I speak these words
I cant believe what I'm saying
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I keep my thoughts in little boxes
Labelled A-Z

Some words can break the skin
And let the daylight in
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
Your once charming foibles
Now drive me up the wall
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I keep my thoughts in little boxes
Boxes underneath the bed
Under the bed with your photograph
And the image is fading

Time has flown
You're all alone
You've always known
Its never going nowhere
Act your age
Turn the page
Leave the stage
It's time to move on
And me and you 
How high we fly
We always knew
Its never going nowhere

I keep my thoughts in little boxes
Boxes underneath the bed
Under the bed with your photograph
And the image is fading

Time has flown
You're all alone
You've always known
Its never going nowhere
Act your age
Turn the page
Leave the stage
It's time to move on
And me and you 
How high we fly
We always knew
Its never going nowhere
