I'm a man 
I'm real proud of my manhood 
I like to smoke 
Ten thousand cigarillos 
Eight ball 
I could climb any fountain 
I never cry 
I only bawl when I'm losing 
And I've never been wrong 
Never been wrong 
I'm looking so good 
Looking so good 
Got a big gold gun 
Got a big gold bullet 
And I guess you could say 
I'm real full of it 
I'm real full of it 
I'm real straight 
You want to see my peccadilloes 
Hot dog 7:30 every morning 
And I'm big into war 
Big into war 
Big into war 
I am a whore 
I am a whore 
Got a big gold gun 
I shave with Gillette 
Shave with Gillette 
And I'm patting my back 
Patting my back 
Got a big gold bullet
