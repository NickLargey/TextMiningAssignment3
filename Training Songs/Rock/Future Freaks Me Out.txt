I'm on fire and now I think I'm ready to bust a move
Check it out I'm rocking steady
Go!

Betty won't stop listening to modern rock
How she hates to be alone
I try to compensate her lack of love with coffee cake
Ice cream and a bottle of ten dollar wine she says hey
I rock the Haro sport
I rock the cow girl blues
I rock too fast for love I'm footloose in my Velcro shoes
What's up with Will & Grace?
I don't get drum and bass
The future freaks me out

I'm on fire and now I think ready to bust a move
Check it out I'm rocking steady
To the beat in my head
It goes oh, oh, oh, oh
I know she's the only one
I'd rather waste our time together
Yea, ?cause we can get down

Betty can't quit carving question marks in my wrist
How come we're so alone
We waste away the days with nicotine and television samples
From an era we hate to admit we embrace
We fail to represent
We fail to be content
We fail at everything we ever even try to attempt
And so the story goes
As only Betty knows
It's time to take control

I'm on fire and now I think ready to bust a move
Check it out I'm rocking steady
To the beat in my head
It goes oh, oh, oh, oh
I know she's the only one
I'd rather waste my time with her

(Betty, I need you
I miss you
I'm so alone without you
To call up on the weekends with my cellular phone)

Betty it's so hard to relate
To the whole human race
I don't know where to begin
I don't know where to begin
If we can both find a way
To do the things that we say
We might not sit in our rooms
And drink our daydreams away
Betty, I'm a dreamer
No i'm not a vicious schemer
Oh betty won't you.. ah f*ck it

I'm on fire and now I think ready to bust a move
Check it out I'm rocking steady
To the beat in my head
It goes oh, oh, oh, oh
I know she's the only one
I'd rather waste our time together
Yeah, cause we can get down.
