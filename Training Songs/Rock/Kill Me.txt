I've seen more places then you've seen
Kept my fingers clean
Where have you been lately
Now you have come to clame the throne
But in a world unknown, you don't move safely

Try me try me, you feed me feed me
With all your hate

Kill me, go ahead then 
Kill me, what if I don't care?
Have you got what it takes to defeat me?
If you got what it takes come and meet me
Kill me, go ahead then
Kill me, what if I dont care?
Have you got what it takes to defeat me?
If you got what it takes come and meet me

You think you're beautiful like me
But obviously
You're not that lucky
What is the weapon of your choice?
I use my voice
Do you think i'm scary?

Try me try me, you feed me feed me
With all your hate

Kill me, go ahead then 
Kill me, what if I don't care?
Have you got what it takes to defeat me?
If you got what it takes come and meet me
Kill me, go ahead then
Kill me, what if I dont care?
Have you got what it takes to defeat me?
If you got what it takes come and meet me

Try me try me, you feed me feed me
with all your hate

Kill me, go ahead then 
Kill me, what if I don't care?
Have you got what it takes to defeat me?
If you got what it takes come and meet me
Kill me, go ahead then
Kill me, what if I dont care?
Have you got what it takes to defeat me?
If you got what it takes come and meet me
