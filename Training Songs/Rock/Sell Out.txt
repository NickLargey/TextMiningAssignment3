Well I know you can't work in fast food all your life 
But don't sign that paper tonight 
She said but it's too late.

I don't remember what I read
Don't remember what they said
Guess it doesn't matter
Guess it doesn't matter anymore

You're gonna go to the record store 
You're gonna give'em all your money 
Radio plays what they want you to hear 
They tell me it's cool but I just don't believe it

Sell out, with me oh yea, sell out, with me tonight 
Record company's gonna give me lots of money and 
Everything's gonna be all right 

No more flippin' burgers puttin' on my silly hat you know 
I don't want that no more
And I didn't ask when we'd get paid
I quit my day job anyway
Guess it doesn't matter, guess it doesn't matter anymore 

Coz you're gonna go to the record store
You're gonna give'em all your money 
Radio plays what they want you to hear
Tell me it's cool, I just don't believe it 

Sell out, with me oh yea 
Sell out with me tonight
The record company's gonna give me lots of money 
and everything's gonna be

And I don't think it'll be so bad 
And I know it won't be so bad 
Cause the man said "that's the way it is" 
and the man said "it don't get better than this" no no no 

So I signed on to the record company 
they say they're gonna give me lot's of money
if i play what they want you to hear 
they tell me it's cool, and i sure believe it

Sell out, with me oh yea 
Sell out with me tonight
The record company's gonna give me lots of money 
and everything's gonna be all right

Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
The record company's gonna make everything all right
