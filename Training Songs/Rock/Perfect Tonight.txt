In my hood
There a boy
Making girls breathless
Serving Tea down on 39th street

And today
Even though
It may seem hopeless
I'll go down on my stumbling feet
And ask him out, oh yeah

And if Tonight
Turns in to this, Perfect tonight
Then have a little mercy on my soul
And if the moon
Just lights up his devilish smile
It gonna take a lot of manners to stop me from this:
steal his precious first date-kiss

I so ashamed
I am weak
What a big failure
I couldn't speak, couldn't feel my own tongue

I such a fool
What can I say
But today, trust me!
I will do a little better this time
And ask him out, oh yeah
