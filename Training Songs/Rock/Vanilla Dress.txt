There you go looking so cute 
In our first and only rendezvous 
In that black dress you’ve passed all my tests 
But you don’t drop hints
You make a brother guess 

You and I share more than chemistry 
Even after tonight it won’t spoil the mystery 
This is where I thought I’d never be 
Now I’m ready to show another side of me 

I’m gonna make such a mess 
All over your vanilla dress 
You’re gonna be so impressed 
With everything that comes next

There you go playing it so cool 
Making up your own set of rules 
I must confess you’re so different from the rest 
You made my love bend
Now I can’t get you out of my head 

You and I share more than chemistry 
Even after tonight it won’t spoil the mystery 
This is where I thought I’d never be 
Now I’m ready to show another side of me 

I’m gonna make such a mess 
All over your vanilla dress 
You’re gonna be so impressed 
With everything that comes next 

I’m gonna make such a mess 
All over your vanilla dress 
You’re gonna be so impressed 
With everything that comes next 

I’ve got some explaining to do 
How did I end up here with you? 
It wasn’t planned but there’s still some residue 
Now all I’ve got are memories of you

You and I share more than chemistry 
Even after tonight it won’t spoil the mystery 
This is where I thought I’d never be 
Now I’m ready to show another side of me

I’m gonna make such a mess 
All over your vanilla dress 
You’re gonna be so impressed 
With everything that comes next

I’m gonna make such a mess 
All over your vanilla dress 
You’re gonna be so impressed 
With everything that comes next
