Had to go, had to know all
There was out there.
Now I'm back, I know that, girl
It's all right here.

Girl I took
The long way home, it's true,
The long way home to you, yeah
And I just want to say,
I'm home to stay.

Ran a lot
Don't know what I
Thought I would find.
Town to town, all I found
Was you on my mind

Girl I took
The long way home, it's true,
The long way home to you, yeah
And I just want to say,
I'm home to stay.

Girl I took

Stay,
I'm home to stay
Been a long way, long way home
Long way home, long way home
