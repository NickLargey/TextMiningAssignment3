I want to step on your hands and cut the rope 
And the twine tangled up on your mind, love 
On the outside on the hillside 
We can play with the paste all night

Photos of myself 
Only of myself [Repeat: x 2]
Oh, and it helps 'cause I know what I want and it helps 'cause I know I want
Come with me and we can jump up there love

Well, I'll be jumping on the flower beds 
On the outside on the hillside we can play with the paste all night 
Photos of myself only of myself
And it helps 'cause I know what I want 

Well we talked about you and we've heard about you in the hearts of the magazines 
All the soft frank glances of the waiting world they're gonna dream about me
Oh, and it helps 'cause I know what I want and it helps 'cause I know I want
Well, it helps me love and it can help you too 

Oh we're gonna help you decorate your room
And it helps with photos of myself
