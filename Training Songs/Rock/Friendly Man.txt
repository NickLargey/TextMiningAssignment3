Friendly man, friendly man
Friendly man na na na na
A Friendly man, friendly man
Friendly person

A friendly man is hard to find
A lot of life is so unkind
Life makes too many people cold
It makes them sad when they grow old.

Friendly man, friendly man
Friendly man, na na na na

Earth is sweet, sun is warm
How did man's society get deformed?
Was it the money we got and spent?
It hasn't seemed hard to love prevent.
