Man, we used to be brothers
Superheroes and warriors
Cowboys and Indians, train drivers
Everything rolling through the endless summers

But everything changes
You got married had children
And I don't have your number
The one I can remember is that place you used to live with your parents

But in the stillness of the moment it takes for a Polaroid picture
To capture our faces forever and
The world has turned a touch on its axis
And the only thing certain is
That everything changes

And they closed the Astoria
At the end of last summer
The place we earned our pedigrees
Scene of our victories
Sanctuary in the centre of London

Now they're building a railway
To track the vanquished to Versailles
And singalongs on on
But they're singing different songs
In rooms that we don't know on the other side of the city

But in the stillness of the moment it takes for a Polaroid picture
To capture our faces forever and
The world has turned a touch on its axis
And the only thing certain is
That everything changes

So honey I just need a little time
To take a little time today
To save all the triumphs and tragedies
Before they slip away
Before they slip away

Let go of the little distractions
Hold close to the ones that you love
Because we won't all be here this time next year
So while you can take a picture of us

Let go of the little distractions
Hold close to the ones that you love
Because we won't all be here this time next year
So while you can take a picture of us

Take a Polaroid picture
(Let go of the little distractions)
(Hold close to the ones that you love)

Take a picture of us to show
We all want you to see where time goes

So in the stillness of the moment
Make sure you take a Polaroid picture
And keep it with you forever to
Remind yourself that everything changes
But there was this one time
Man there was this one time
When things were okay
