Bringing down the giant.

Oh. I hit the wall I got back up and dusted off.
I’m past the pain and I’m taking back all that I lost,
I’m going to kick you off the throne hang your crown up on the wall,
Yeah your glory days are gone gone gone.
Yeah I’m bringing down the giant
I won’t sit here undecided.

When your world comes crashing down I’ll remind you
I’m the one who’s laughing loud in your face
Yeah yeah your karma’s coming back here to find you this is going to get a little violent
Yeah I’m bringing down bringing down the giant.

Too many lies built up inside you're bound to fall, standing face to face you're not so big after
All take your bow you had your shot looking down while you're on top now your glory days are gone gone gone
Yeah I’m bringing down the giant I won’t sit here undecided

When your world comes crashing down I’ll remind you
I’m the one who’s laughing loud in your face
Yeah yeah your karma’s coming back here to find you this is going to get a little violent
Yeah I’m bringing down bringing down the giant. [x2]

I’m the one who’s laughing loud in your face,
Yeah your karma’s coming back here to find you this is going to get a little violent
Yeah I’m bringing down bringing down the giant.
