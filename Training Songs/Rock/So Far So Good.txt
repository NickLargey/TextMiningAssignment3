I feel a little bit left of center
but then again we've all been there before
Every time I see a lost cause coming
it's nothing less, nothing more
Every time I get lost in paradise
I find a way to screw it up somehow
It's not the way it's supposed to be
but it'll do for now

When you're right, you're right
Everything else in my life just might be wrong
You're wrong all the time

So far so good 'cause no one knows I'm faking
I wish I could show you the toll it's taking
Sometimes I live as if there's no tomorrow
So far so good

I better find a way to cross my fingers
half the luck'll get me twice as far
I'm sick and tired of coming up for air
it shouldn't be this hard
Every little bit'll help I wonder
if it's enough or did I cross the line
The kitchen counter is a bad reminder of a better time

When you're right, you're right
Everything else in my life just might be wrong
You're wrong all the time

So far so good 'cause no one knows I'm faking
I wish I could show you the toll it's taking
Sometimes I live as if there's no tomorrow
So far so good

When you're right
Everything else you messed up just might be wrong
You're wrong all the time

So far so good 'cause no one knows I'm faking
I wish I could show you the toll it's taking
Sometimes I live as if there's no tomorrow
So far so good
