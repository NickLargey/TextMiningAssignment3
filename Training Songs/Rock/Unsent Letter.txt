I try to talk to you
Can't get past the weather
The friend I thought I knew
Has found somethin', somewhere better
So I'm hanging on your line
Thought we could speak together
Tell me what it is with you, you seem gone forever

I'm spendin' all my time driven round fakin' clever
With a girl who seems all right and another one who's better
I don't know if I lied when I said we're not together
But I try to talk to you, somehow you seem gone

I know I could have been tryin' not to think about it
Found it hard to live with this, and longer to live with out it
My dreams have caught me out I find my self surrounded
By the odds of our own end enough said about it

I'm spendin' all my time driven round fakin' clever
With a girl who seems all right and another one who's better
I don't know if I lied when I said we're not together
But I try to talk to you, some how you seem gone

I'm given up some thing, I guess that doesn't matter
Started other things, I guess that doesn't matter
I finally wrote your song, another unsent letter
In a pile addressed to you, care of somethin', somewhere better

I'm spendin' all my time driven round fakin' clever
With a girl who seems all right and another one who's better
I don't know if I lied when I said we're not together
But I try to talk to you, some how you seem gone

I'm spendin' all my time driven round fakin' clever
With a girl who seems all right and another one who's better
I don't know if I lied when I said that I'm together
But I try to talk to you, some how you seem gone forever
Yeah, but I try to talk to you, some how you seem gone forever
Yeah, but I try to talk to you, some how you seem gone forever
Yeah, but I try to talk to you, some how you seem gone
