I just want to run around
I just want to party down
I just want to run around
I just want to party down

Drug rugs and beer [unverified], it's all I know
I don't wanna grow up and have to let go
I feel the pressure to change my ways
All I see are more dark days

[Unverified] teenage ways is on my brain
Get away, a feeling I can't explain
I don't want this thing to ever stop
Just shut up, and hand over that pop

Just 19 when I lost all my dignity
Today's my birthday, and now I'm 20
Don't wanna have responsibility
Don't wanna be a part of society

I wanna be where the boys are, too
I wanna do the things I wanna do
I won't do what you tell me to
I don't wanna have to listen to you

[Unverified] teenage ways is on my brain
Get away, a feeling I can't explain
I don't want this thing to ever stop
Just shut up, and hand over that pop

What's the point of doing something?
Every night gotta feel the pain
Some people say that I'm disgusting
I don't care, I just think they're lame
Kill the rainbow, feel the rocks

Just 19 when I lost all my dignity
Today's my birthday, and now I'm 20
Don't wanna have responsibility
Don't wanna be a part of society

I just want to run around
I just want to party down
I just want to run around
Party down, whoo

Next year I'll be 21
Look out, world, 'cause I wanna have fun
Next year I'll be 21
Look out, world, 'cause I wanna have fun
