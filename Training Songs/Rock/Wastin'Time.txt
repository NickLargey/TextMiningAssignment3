I'm always meeting you
falling on the way down
down into the deepest sea
I saw you trying to hide
bury deep your darkness
but you you can't hide your fear from me

may be there's a time to cry
may be there's a time to say
may be we foolishly
wasted our time away

I saw your open arms
reaching all the way down
I saw you turn from red to blue
you know the hounds wont wait for no one
but I, I waited my life for you

may be there's a time to cry
may be there's a time to say
may be we fall asleep
wasted our time away

may be we foolishly
wasted our time away

wasted our time away
wasted our time away

may be there's a time to cry
may be there's a time to say
may be we foolishly
wasted our lives away
