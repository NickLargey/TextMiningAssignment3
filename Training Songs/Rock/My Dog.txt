My dog says
That she will do anything
My dog says
That she will love anyone
My dog says
That she will try anything
My dog, he's the one
That I listen to
I listen to
My dog says
That she will do anything
My dog says
That she will try anyone
My dog says
That she will love anything
My dog, he's the one
That I listen to
When I suck back the glass
And look through the cubes
Sun shines through
Burns my eyes
My dog, he's the one
That I listen to
My dog, he's the one
That I listen

To
I listen
My dog says
That she will do anything
My dog says
That she will try anyone
My dog says
That she will love anything
My dog, he's the one
That I listen to
When I suck back the glass
And look through the cubes
Sun shines through
Burns my eyes
My dog, he's the one
That I listen to
My dog, he's the one
That I listen
To
I listen to
I listen to
I listen to
My dog
My dog
My dog
My dog
Yeah!
