No more will I play along
And no more will tell myself how it's gonna be from now on
'Cause I've been stalling in between
And I've been dragging my feet
Making bets that this isn't happening

And I sleepwalk around two feet off the ground
While the real world is trying to reach me
And when the rain comes down I see it all now

Standing on the great divide
Of some collission between ordinary and imaginary life
And this could be your lucky day
'cause if tomorrow ever comes
You'll be looking, looking the other way

And you sleepwalk around two feet off the ground
While the real world is trying to reach you
With stories that you already knew

It pulls you and pushes you

And you sleepwalk around two feet off the ground
While the real world is trying to reach you
When the rain comes down you'll find yourself now
Nowhere
