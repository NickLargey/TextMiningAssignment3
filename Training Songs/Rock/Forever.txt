Forever
Good friends are forever
They never fade even when they're weathered by the years

Whenever
I'm lonely whenever
I think I'm the only one who cries
You feel my tears

Oh, I need to share
All of my joys and all of my cares with you
'Cause you are my friend

Oh, together
Good friends stay together
Whether we're far or near
You always seem to hear when I call

What I'm trying to say
Is though we're apart
You're in my heart to stay
You are my friend
