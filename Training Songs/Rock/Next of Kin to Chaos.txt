Stuck in the learning hole,
There is no teaching
That I can subscribe to -
Just the hatred of being afraid.

Trapped in a nightmare,
Nothing can alter this.
Just another daydream,
Calendar sadness.

Lucid, inducing swarm
Becoming closer but getting colder.
The caustic grip insane.

Lucid induced
Pre-shaping destiny - hiding inside of me.
Primate illusions of
How all this should be.

Next of kin to chaos.
