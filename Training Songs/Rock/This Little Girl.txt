People, don't you worry, I know what I'm doin'
I know what love's all about
Ah, this little girl won't make a fool out of me
'Cause I'm gonna straighten her out

(Ba-ba-ba-oh-oh-oh-oh-sha-la-la-la)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-sha-la-la-la) oh, yeah
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-sha-la-la-la-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo)

Ah, this little girl is just about as mean as they come, she is now
She don't even act nice once in a while like some, oh yeah
Whoa, trouble is her middle name
But I'm glad that's the way she came
I can be the one to tame this little girl, oh yeah
Ah, this little girl won't like me much at first, she won't now
And after a while she's gonna think that I'm the worst, oh yeah
Well, I won't treat her with kid gloves
And I won't shower her with lots of love
But I'll make an angel of this little girl

Oh, this little girl tries to make every guy slave, oh yeah (make every guy her slave)
But this little man is gonna take her by the hand
And I'm gonna show her the way to behave
Ah, this little girl is kinda used to gettin' her way, but no more now
There'll be some changes made, startin' today
Whoa, I said now everyone will be surprised
When I cut her down to size
And no one's gonna recognize my little girl
Tell you again now, this little girl
I'm a man now, this little girl
I'll tell you again now, my little girl
