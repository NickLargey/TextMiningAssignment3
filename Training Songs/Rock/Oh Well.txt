I know that I could always trust you if I want to
But I'm your only fan
I find it hard to be a very caring person
I know you'd understand

I try my best to make this into something
But glove don't fit the hand
Glove don't fit the hand.
Oh well, Oh well. Oh well, Oh well.

I see you struggle for a brilliant conversation
So whatcha' gonna' say?
And if you really really think you want to
I guess I wouldn't mind

I know it's hard to say the things you must be thinking
But I can hold your hand
Yeah I can hold your hand
Oh well, Oh well. Oh well, Oh well

I find it hard to be a very caring person
I know you'd understand
I know it's hard to say the things you must be thinking
But I could hold your hand

Yes I can hold your hand
Oh Well, Oh well Oh well, Oh well.
Oh Well (Oh well)
