It's true, we're all a little, insane
But it's so clear now that I'm, unchained

Fear is only in our minds
Taking over all the time
Fear is only in our minds
But it's, taking over all the time

You poor, sweet, innocent thing; dry your eyes and testify
You know you live to break me, don't deny sweet sacrifice

One day I'm gonna forget your name
And one sweet day you're gonna drown in my, lost pain

Fear is only in our minds
Taking over all the time
Fear is only in our minds
But it's taking over all the time

You poor, sweet, innocent thing; dry your eyes and testify
You know you love to hate me; don't you, honey? I'm your sacrifice

(I dream in darkness I sleep to die, erase the silence, erase my life)

Do you wonder why you hate?
Are you still too weak to survive your mistakes?

You poor, sweet, innocent thing, dry your eyes and testify
You know you live to break me, don't deny, sweet sacrifice
