Clarity just confuses me
The lines drawn on a map
A strange assembly

When there's northerners in southerners
And westenders in eastenders
And sunny days in January
Left spaces in my diary

But the demons never need to know
What the demons never got to see
As we fall in and out of line
Stay in touch now for a while
Coz the demons never need to know
What the demons never got to see
As we fall in and out of line
Stay in touch now for a while

Coz I know that
Apathy only ruined me
Hanging around waiting for calamity

And by the year four million
Our skins will be vermilion
I own a dartboard memory
So I'll forget any felony

But the demons never need to know
What the demons never got to see
As we fall in and out of line
Stay in touch now for a while
For the demons never need to know
What the demons never got to see
As we fall in and out of line
Stay in touch now for a while

'Cause I know that you know that we know they don't know what's going on

And the demons never need to know
What the demons never got to see
As we fall in and out of line
Stay in touch now for a while
For the demons never need to know
What the demons never got to see
As we fall in and out of line
Stay in touch now for a while

For the demons never need to read
What they never got around to write
A flirt with mediocrity
Comes with a heavy penalty
But the demons never need to read
What they never got around to write
A flirt with mediocrity
Comes with a heavy penalty
