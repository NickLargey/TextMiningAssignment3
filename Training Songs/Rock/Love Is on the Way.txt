Lonely sidewalks, silent night
Bring the evening, deep inside
Hold me darlin, touch me now
Let the feeling, free tonight

Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight, baby,
Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes,
Let's give it one more try tonight

Time of season, wipes the tears
No rhyme or reason, no more fears
All the dreaming, far behind
You are here now, everything's alright

Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight, baby,
Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes,
Let's give it one more try tonight

And in the morning I'll be gone away
All the things I left behind
If you need me I'll come night or day
Lets stop the hands of time

Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight, baby,
Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes,
Let's give it one more try tonight

Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight, baby,
Love is on the way
I can see it in your eyes,
Let's give it one more try tonight
