I've been around the world and I wrote a million songs
It's all a bore to me
I've slept in the gutter and I've lied to the dogs
It never bothered me
The sheriff he came to with his little boys in blue
They been lookin' for me
But with my crystal sheen guitar I'm another ego star
So give it to me

Get me to the stage, it brings me home again
This is shangrila
I'm trippin' on it now, it brings me home again
This is shangrila

I look bad in shorts but most of us do
Don't let that bother me
I'm the football who is who, I don't believe in smack
So don't you die on me

Cause love is all good people need
Music sets the sick ones free
Without love no one ever grows nothing ever sings
This is shangrila

You have gathered for the feast
The bread is my body, the wine is blood
Get me to the stage, it brings me home again
This is shangrila
I'm trippin' on it now, it brings me home again
