Lived and learned live learned play with fire get burned
Lived and learned live and learned miss your chance miss your turn
Tried to see try to see why people always lie
Tried to see try to see what really makes you cry

That’s how, that’s how life goes
Got to roll with the blows
Having fun with my bros
With no soul that is close

Rise and fall, rise and fall, and soon you’re standing tall
Rise and fall, rise and fall, with never having crawled
Say your part, say your part with fire in your heart
Say your part, say your part with your words like a dart

That’s how, that’s how life goes
Got to roll with the blows
Having fun with my bros
With no soul that is close

Do or die, do or die have to give it a try
Do or die, do or die with never having lied
Make or break make or break so never hesitate
Make or break make or break before it is too late

That’s how, that’s how life goes
Got to roll with the blows
Having fun with my bros
With no soul that is close
