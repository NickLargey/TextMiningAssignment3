Two-week vacation Costa Rica see amorica
Young ladies oh, eureka! So many there to score-ica
Cruise the ocean bars with some similar type fellows
Little Latin lovelies drinking gin and Mello Yellos

Please get me a towel
Mr. Tangerine Speedo
You're all over town
Tangerine la la la la la la la la
(Intro x3)

Nowhere to go, nothing to do
I'll be as gentle on you as tearless baby shampoo
Back to my bungalow with flesh tone kimonos
Ah, come a little closer feel the "Sting" of my "Bono", no no, no no

The talk of the town
Mr. Tangerine Speedo
How you get around
In your tangerine la la la la la la la la

Little Latin lovelies will love to drink gin 
And Mello Yello in my bungalow
Lovin' me
Tangerine la la la la la la la la
All the French girls go "Zut alour, no no no no, zut alour, no no" 
Coming at the target, you're as straight as Magellan
If you've got a secret weapon, well you're as sure as hell ain't telling
Cause your mouth made an offer that the bodies cannot veto
No woman can resist a man who looks good in a speedo

Fuckin' get me a towel
Mr. Tangerine Speedo
You're all over town
Tangerine la la la la la la la la

Talk of the town
Mr. Tangerine Speedo
How you get around
In your tangerine la la la la la la la la

Little Latin lovelies will love to drink gin 
And Mello Yello in my bungalow
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Zut alour, no, zut alour, no no, zut alour, no no no no no...
