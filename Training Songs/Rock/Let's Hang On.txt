There ain't no good in our goodbyein'
True love takes a lot of tryin'
Ohh, I'm cryin'

Let's hang on
To what we've got
Don't let go girl
We got a lot
Got a lotta love between us
Hang on
Hang on
Hang on
To what we've got

You say you're gonNa go call it quits
Gonna chuck it all and break
our love to bits
Break it up
(I wish you'd never said it
Break it up
Oh, no we'll both regret it)

That little chip of diamond on your hand
Ain't a fortune baby byt you know it stands
For the love
(A love to tie and bind ya)
Such a love
(We just can't leave behind us)
Baby
Don't you know
Baby
Don't you go
Think it over and stay

Let's hang on
To what we've got
Don't let go girl
We got a lot
Got a lotta love between us
Hang on
Hang on
Hang on
To what we've got

There isn't anything I wouldn't do
I'd pay any price to get in good with you
Patch it up
(Give me a second turnin')
Patch it up
(Don't cool off while I'm burnin')

You've got me cryin' dyin' at your door
Don't shut me out,
ooh let me in once more
Open up
(Your arms I need to hold you)
Open up
(Your heart, oh girl I love you)
Baby
Don't you know
Baby
Don't you go
Think it over and stay

Let's hang on, girl
To what we've got
Don't let go girl
We got a lot
Got a lotta love between us
Hang on
Hang on
Hang on
To what we've got
