I haven't got a car
You haven't got an opinion
I don't have no regrets, baby
All the words that you'll say someday
There were no whores in my bed, maybe

[Chorus]
But now the leaves are convalescing
The sun is warming the baby seed
Through my mind I am quietly regressing
I've got everything that I need

I haven't got no friends
Shit is a better companion
For your losses I grieve, baby
Still you better believe someday
There is no hope to retrieve, maybe

[Chorus]
