And if you listen now
You might hear
A new sound coming in
As an old one disappears
See the world in just one grain of sand
You better take a closer look
Don't let it slip right through your hand
Won't you please hear the call
The world says

Put the message in the box
Put the box into the car
Drive the car around the world
Until you get heard

Now is the moment
Please understand
The road is wide open
To the heart of every man
A few simple words
So a mule could understand
He don't want tomorrow
If it's just crumbling into sand
Won't please hear the call
She says

Put the message in the box
Put the box into the car
Drive the car around the world
Until you get heard
Until you get heard

The World says
Give a little bit
Give a little bit of your love to me
'cause I'm waiting right here with my open arms
She says give a little bit
Give a little bit of your soul to me
'cause I'm waiting to behold your many charms
Is that love in the air
She says

Put the message in the box
Put the box into the car
Drive the car around the world
Until you get heard

Until you get heard
Until you get heard
Until you get heard
Until you get heard
