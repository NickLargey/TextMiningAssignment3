I’m the type of kid to push away
girls like you who get too close to me
This ain't your front porch on Division Street
where you crashed your car
and then you blamed it on a sneeze
Well god bless you, darling, I mean it
You’re the type of girl who said she don’t believe in god
but you believed in me
We never missed our opportunity here
we just grew up until we found some room to breathe
Well god bless us, darling, we need it

We need a revolution
Why else are we standing here? Yeah
Take off our gloves, put down our guns
'til everyone sings, yeah

We’re the type of kids who burned
the whole damn forest down, we looked like criminals
How we got out alive, it’s biblical
and I, felt something strange behind my knees
Well... nothing exists 'til you see it
We can turn back now, or we can burn a whole 'nother town
everybody gets out
it’s just that night we don’t talk about
I’m sick of life decisions, this cut dry life we live in
if I did you wrong, I’m sorry,
you’re just so god damn pretty. Yeah!

We need a revolution
Why else are we standing here? Yeah
Take off our gloves, look towards the sun
'til everyone sings, yeah

Whoa whoa-oh
Whoa (Yeah!) whoa-oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh

If I sang you to sleep, would you listen?
I’d tell you all the things that I’ve been missing
When words flow like river bends
I’ve burned too many cigarettes at home
Where did you go?
I hated you for leaving
got sick of writing letters on the weekend
My thoughts were clear like cellophane
I had to see you face to face at home
So where do we go?
Now that we’re both standing here, yeah

We’ll take off our gloves, put down our guns
'til everyone- sings, sings, sings!

We need a revolution.
Why else are we standing here? Yeah
Take off our gloves, look towards the sun,
'til everyone sings

Whoa whoa-oh
(Yeah!)
Whoa whoa-oh
(We need a revolution)
Whoa whoa-oh
(We need a revolution)
Yeah!
