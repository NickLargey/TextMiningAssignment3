Marlene
Marlene, you're the prettiest girl I've ever seen
Do you care for me at all
Marlene, I care for you
And I just don't care who knows it
 
And I guess that means that I love you
Marlene
Marlene, who'd believe that you're only seventeen
I'm in trouble if your folks get mean
And if they do
Then I don't care if they bust me
 
And I guess that means that I love you
I don't need no fantasies
Just one thing I need
I you could make it here, Marlene
Dear Marlene, Marlene
Marlene, when I think that it all is just a dream
I remember that your eyes are green
And mine are blue
They will always see each other
 
And I guess that means that I love you
I don't need realities
Just one thing I need
If you could make it here Marlene
Dear Marlene, Marlene
Marlene, I'm depending on you now
Marlene
