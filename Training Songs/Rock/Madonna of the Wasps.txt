Is this love?
Is this love?
Is this love?

Lost Madonna of the Wasps
I wonder where we crossed
I wonder why she lost me

Lost Madonna of the Wasps
She's dying in the frost
I wonder what she cost me

Is this love?

Gone Madonna of the swans
She waves a magic wand
And then she settles on me

Wise Madonna of the flies
I look into her eyes
And then she recognize me

Is this love?
Is this love?

Lost Madonna of the Wasps
I wonder where we crossed
I wonder where she lost me

Lost Madonna of the Wasps
She's lying in the frost
I wonder what she cost me

Is this love?
Is this love?
