(C'mon get loud)
Looking for the one tonight
But I can't see you
'Cause I'm blinded by all the lights, oh
And I can never get it right
I need a breakthrough
Why are you so hard to find? oh

I've been searching every city, never giving up
Until I find my angel, diamond in the rough
Looking for a signal, baby turn it up tonight

Come on get loud loud let it out
Shout it out from the rooftops
Come one get loud 'til they shut us down
Come on get loud loud let it out
Show me everything that you've got
Come one get loud loud I need you now

Baby let me hear it loud
Nana-na nana ah
Nana-na nana ah
Nana-na nana ah

Looking for the light to shine
To start a fire
Girl I'll be the first in line oh
And baby when our stars align
We can't get no higher
You just give me sign

Come on get loud loud, let it out
Shout it out from the rooftops
Come on get loud 'til they shut us down
Come on get loud loud, let it out
Show me everything that you've got
Come on get loud loud I need you now

Baby let me hear you loud
Nana-na nana ah
Nana-na nana ah
Nana-na nana ah

Nana-na nana ah
Nana-na nana ah
Nana-na nana ah
(I've been looking for the one tonight)

Nana-na nana ah
Nana-na nana ah
(I've been looking for the one tonight)

Come on get loud loud let it out
Shout it out from the rooftops
Come on get loud 'til they shut us down

Come on get loud loud, let it out
Show me everything that you've got
Come on get loud loud, I need you now

Baby let me hear you loud
Nana-na nana ah
Nana-na nana ah
Nana-na nana ah

Baby let me hear you loud
Nana-na nana ah
Nana-na nana ah
Nana-na nana ah

Baby let me hear you loud
Nana-na nana ah
Nana-na nana ah
I've been looking for the one tonight
