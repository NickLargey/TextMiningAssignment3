I wonder what would happen if my dog could talk
Would he look me in the eye and say take me for a walk
When I gave him his dinner would he shake his head
And say take it away I want caviar instead?

Thank you mother nature
For the way you got things planned
Don't ever change a thing, I'm happy as I am
Imagine living in a place where the sea was red
And your legs were in the position now occupied by your head
Imagine living in a place where black was white
And white was black, even the night.

I wonder what would happen if my fish could fly
Would it leap from its tank and hit the cat in the eye
Out through the window and into the sky
I'm so glad that sharks can't fly.

Thank you mother nature
For the way you got things planned
Don't ever change a thing, I'm happy as I am
Imagine living in a place where the sea was red
And your legs were in the position now occupied by your head
Imagine living in a place where black was white
And white was black, even the night.

I wonder what would happen if the moon fell down
Would it leave a white circle,
Where they painted around
I wonder what would happen if the sun went out.
