{CHORUS}
7 days a week 1000 words I shouldn´t speak
I got a big, big mouth
A big, big mouth
Nothing that you say really matters anyway
I got a big, big mouth
A big, big mouth

{VERSE}
This conversation´s going down the drain
And here I go again
I spill my sarcasm all over you
When respect is due 
I really don´t mean to offend
But I do it every day
My twisted mind gets out of hand
And I scare you all away 

{CHORUS}
7 days a week 1000 words I shouldn´t speak
I got a big, big mouth
A big, big mouth
Nothing that you say really matters anyway
I got a big, big mouth
A big, big mouth
So please don´t take it personally
So please don´t take it personally 

{VERSE}
So I keep on talking until I smash it up
You know, I just can´t stop
I drive the dagger right into your heart
And tear it all apart
I really don´t mean to offend
But I do it every day
My twisted mind gets out of hand
And I wish myself away 

{CHORUS}
7 days a week 1000 words I shouldn´t speak
I got a big, big mouth
A big, big mouth
Nothing that you say really matters anyway
I got a big, big mouth
A big, big mouth
So please don´t take it personally
So please don´t take it personally
