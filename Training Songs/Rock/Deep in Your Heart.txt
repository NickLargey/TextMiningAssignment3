The lovers' hour is here, the night is creeping down 
This is the moment you've been dreading 
Another bar-room in another lonely town 
You wish you knew where you were heading 
In everyone that you see 
You see her 
In every dream that could be 
You see her, need her tonight 

Chorus 

You're feeling the hurt again 
It's always the way 
When the arrow goes straight to the mark 
But try not to heed the pain 
It's only a gentle reminder 
That while you're apart...she's still 

Deep in your heart, and it's hurting 
Deep in your heart, still hurting 

You feel it coming, it's impossible to bear 
The thought of one more night without her 
You start imagining her perfume in the air 
From every woman round about you 
You try to find relief in someone else's arms 
She senses you're in need of healing 
But it would take more than just any woman's charms 
To wash away this empty feeling 

In everyone that you see 
You see her 
In every dream that could be 
You see her, need her tonight
