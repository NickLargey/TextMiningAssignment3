Oh Lord I wish I had never been stoned
'Cause when I get high I can't leave the women alone
Omaha sheriff and his broad gettin' ready for slaughter
Their lookin' for the man that turned on the mayor's daughter

Omaha honey had a hold on a hell of a thing
Down in a hollo', every evening you can hear her sing
She said, monkey but showed me the Tulsa Turnaround
Stepped on my toes, turned me on and turned me down
Fit me like a hand in a glove, taught me how to love - why'a-all

Five miles of road between me and my house 
A rosy-throat sheriff and his deputy trackin' me down
Well I wish I was back at Bacon, takin' it easy
But if a man's gonna eat fried chicken he's got to be greasy

Omaha honey had a hold on a hell of a thi-ing
Down in a hollo' every evening you can hear her si-ing
She said that monkey but showed me the Tulsa Turnaround
Stepped on my toes, turned me on and turned me down
Fit me like a hand in a glove, taught me how to love - why'a-all
