Inside my TV I
Never stop to wonder why I'm
Way down now
I'm way down now
Some faceless get on the screen
The most honest man I've ever seen
I'm way down now
I'm way down now

Won't you show me something true today
C'mon and show me anything but this

She took us by the hand
Hell was the promised land I'm
Way down now
I'm way down now
I'm lying by the road
Because she cut off all my clothes
I'm way down now
Way down now

Won't you show me something true today
C'mon and show me anything but this

Inside my future I
What I see just makes me cry
I'm way down now
I'm way down now
The clocks will all run backwards
All the sheep will have two heads
And Thursday night and Friday
Will be on Tuesday night instead
And all the times will keep on changing
And the movement will increase
There's something about the living, babe
That sends me off my feet
There's breeding in the sewers
And the rats are on their way
They're clouding up the images of my perfect day
And I know I'm not alone
And I know I'm not alone
And I know I'm not alone

Anything but this
Do you hear me I said

Inside my TV I
Never stop to wonder why
I'm way down now
I'm way down now
Then some faceless get comes on my screen
The most honest man I've ever seen
I'm way down now
I'm way down now

Something new
Something true
Something new
Something true
