Kind words and a real good heart 
Doesn't mean you get respect 
Kind words and a real good heart 
Doesn't mean you get the best 
It doesn't mean they won't get brutal 
It doesn't mean they won't assault you 
With a kind heart 
With a kind heart

Bad guys sometimes hard to find 
'cause they don't all dress in black 
Good guys sometime make mistake 
I say don't look 
Don't look back 
Be mindful how you get used up 
You can't always 
Trust an honest man 
Be mindful how you get used up 
You can't always 
Trust an honest man

You gotta make your own beginning 
Mark it down 
Growing pains 
With a kind heart 
With a kind heart

Kind words and a real good heart 
Doesn't mean you get respect 
Kind words and a real good heart 
Doesn't mean you get the best 
It doesn't mean the whole world loves you 
It doesn't mean more than it means 
A kind heart 
A kind heart

Kind words and a real good heart 
Doesn't mean you get respect 
Kind words and a real good heart 
Doesn't mean you get the best
