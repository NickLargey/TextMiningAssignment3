Katie was a kid, 
I guess she hid her thoughts from everyone
Went to school at eight, she was never late
That girl didn't know the meaning of fun

Every night Katie prayed to God above
Daddy gave her everything but love
She woke up one day, said, I'm on my way
Her mummy read the letter, and it did say
I'm on my way, I'm on my way

Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
She's having fun, fun, fun
She's having fun, fun, fun

They rode around 
And every boy in town tried to win her back
But it was no go,
'Cause she rode with Joe, he was the leader of the pack

People ran for cover when they rolled to town
Stand in the way, and baby, you were run down
Every night after light
You could always bet they'd be in a fight
There's gonna be a fight

Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
She's having fun, fun, fun
She's having fun, fun, fun

The night was black, rain on the ground
People on the street, they could hear the sound
Out on the road, engines so loud
There must have been a hundred in the crowd

Katie and Joe, they were riding too fast
She knew that ride would be her last
Engine screamed, you could hear her shout
Look out, look out, look out

Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
She's having fun, fun, fun
She's having fun, fun, fun

Riding with the angels
