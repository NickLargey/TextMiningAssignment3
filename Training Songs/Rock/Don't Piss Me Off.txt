You know I'd never lie to ya, baby don't get me wrong
And though I wasn't true to ya, baby don't get me wrong
'Cause satisfyin' you is the thing that gets me off

I do a lot of thinkin', some I shouldn't think about
Just a little somethin', you know I can't live without
Gotta fever that's burnin', you just can't slow me down

Don't piss me off, don't cool me down
I've been lied to, from town to town
You got somethin' that just blows my top
Hey now baby well you drivin' me crazy
When it comes to your love now I ain't a bit lazy

Baby don't you worry, you ain't gotta play no fool
Just a little lovin' is all I need from you
Never met nobody 'makes me feel the way you do

Don't piss me off, don't cool me down
I've been lied to, from town to town
You got somethin' that just blows my top
Hey now baby well you drivin' me crazy
When it comes to your love now I ain't a bit lazy

Talkin' dirty, dressin' clean, dancin' nasty by the record machine
Do the walk, love to ball, just one look I believe that's all
Little girl loves to boogie woogie, looks so fine like some sweet suger
Destination is on the floor, give it up just a little bit more
Hey baby can I be excused, I can't take no more

Don't piss me off, don't cool me down
I've been lied to, from town to town
You got somethin' that just blows my top
Hey now baby well you drivin' me crazy
When it comes to your love now I ain't a bit lazy

Don't piss me off, don't cool me down
I've been lied to, from town to town

I can't take no more
You're not that kind of girl
I can't take no more
