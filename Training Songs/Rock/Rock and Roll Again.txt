You know she make me rock and roll again,
Put the swagger in my soul again,
Push me back across the line again,
And put the writin on the wall

Lit a fire under my behind,
Got me high didnt cost a dime,
One thing for certain I can tell you my friend,
My baby make me rock and roll again

She know me well, an never fail
She know just how to put the wind back in my sail.
She got the key, to set me free,
It's just so easy to see

The way she make me rock and roll again,
Put the dirty in my mind again,
Aint nothin to it boy she pull me back in,
My baby make me rock and roll again

She has a thrill, up on the hill,
She keeps me movin when I get to second steal.
If I get slow, she let me know,
I got to get up and go

Because she make me rock and roll again,
Put the rhythm in my stride again,
Calling to me like a long lost friend,
She put the writin on the wall

Lit a fire under my behind,
Got me high didnt cost a dime,
One thing for certain I can tell you my friend,
My baby make me rock and roll again
