Define the marks, prepare to laugh
So sorry you never had your reasons
Loose the lips and sink the ships
A cycle broken and abused

Rules and games, playful moments
That won't last no matter how we feel
Ropes that strain to catch the picture frames
No never, what is real

Avenues we all confuse
These maps will make them disappear
Mountains sides, your feelings lie
For better sense without your fear

Rules and games, playful moments
That won't last no matter how we feel
Ropes that strain to catch the picture frames
No never, what is real

Stay with me now, now you can hide away
Stay with me now, driving the lights away
Stay with me now, now we can find away

Rules and games, playful moments
That won't last no matter how we feel
Ropes that strain to catch the picture frames
No never, what is real
