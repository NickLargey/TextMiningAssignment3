It's the perfect way
To end a perfect day
It's the perfect way
To end a perfect day

Ride with me, glide with me
Stay by my side with me through the night
Ride on the wings of the angels of love
Who are on our side

It's the perfect way
To end a perfect day
It's the perfect way
To say "I love you"
