Now this is not the time or the place
For a broken-hearted
'Cause this is the end of the rainbow
Where no one can be too sad

No, I don't wanna leave
But I must keep moving ahead
'Cause my life belongs to the other side
Behind the great ocean's waves

Bye bye, Hollywood Hills
I'm gonna miss you, where ever I go
I'm gonna come back to walk these streets again
Bye bye, Hollywood Hills forever

Thank you for the morning walks on the sweet sunset
And for the hot night moments
For the fantasy in my bed

I take part of you with me now
And you won't get it back
And a part of me will stay here
You can keep it forever, dear
Ooh-oohoo

Bye bye, Hollywood Hills
I'm gonna miss you, where ever I go
I'm gonna come back to walk these streets again
Remember that we had fun together

Bye bye, Rodeo Girls
I'm gonna love you, where ever I go
I'm gonna come back so we can play together
Bye bye, Hollywood Hills forever

Long distance love doesn't work
All the miles in between getting naughty
No, I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go

Bye bye, Hollywood Hills
I'm gonna miss you, where ever I go
I'm gonna come back to walk these streets again
Bye bye

Bye bye, Hollywood Hills
I'm gonna miss you, where ever I go
I'm gonna come back to walk these streets again
Remember that we had fun together

Bye bye, Rodeo Girls
I'm gonna love you, where ever I go
I'm gonna come back so we can play together
Bye bye, Hollywood Hills forever

Hollywood Hills forever, yeah
Hollywood Hills forever
