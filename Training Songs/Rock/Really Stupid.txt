i see no feeling in your eyes
no love no meaning in your eyes
when i with you i don't know why
cant think straight i don't know why
and if its all the same to you i think ill take a walk
cuz your too loud and your really stupid
cant stand another second of your talk
cuz your too loud and your really stupid
stop your saying 
its really stupid

i'm sitting here listening to your voice
i'm losing myself in your voice
when i'm with you i've got no choice
found me loving with your voice
and if its all the same to you i think i'll stay outside

cuz your too loud and your really stupid
take a look around for a place to hid
cuz your too loud and your really stupid
stop your saying 
its really stupid

i see no feeling in your eyes
no luv no meaning in your eyes
i see no feeling in your eyes
cuz everything you say is lies
and if its all the same to you i think i'll take a walk

cuz your too loud and your really stupid
cant stand another second of your talk
cuz your too loud and your really stupid
stop your saying 
its really stupid
