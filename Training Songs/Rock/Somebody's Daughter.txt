Ooh somebody's daughter

Give me room to breath
There are times when I feel I could drown without water
Give me time to see
Just one dream that is mine

I feel the wind and the water
I see the sun and the rain
Forgive the sins of your daughter
And she will pray for you

I'm breaking the frame 
Each day's the same
You should be somebody's daughter
Day after day
Of feeling this way
You should be somebody's daughter

Please say I can leave
Try to ease this pain that I feel may be killing me
Free me from a life
That is cold, that is mine

I am the dutiful lover
I am the perfect mother
Forgive the sins of others
But please don't pray for me

I'm breaking the frame 
Each day's the same
You should be somebody's daughter
Day after day
Of feeling this way
You should be somebody's daughter

I'm breaking the frame
Each day's the same
You should be somebody's daughter
Day after day
Of feeling this way
You should be somebody's daughter
If you opened your eyes and tried
You could read between the lines

I'm wasting away
With nothing to say
I am somebody's daughter
