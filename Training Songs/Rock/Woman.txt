Hand to, hand to
Mouth to, mouth to
Mind to, mind to
Mouth to middle 

Oh, woman
Why aren't you moving with me yet?
Do you forget what you try to remember?
Do you remember what you try to forget?

Hand to, hand to
Mouth to, mouth to
Mind to, mind to
Mouth to middle 

Oh, woman
It's an omen, this is it
But I forget what I try to remember
I remember all I try to forget
