I play the game of a rich boy, 
I buy everything I can. 
My bankroll is a foot thick, 
I'm a wealthy man. 
A million dollar reserve note is right there in my hand 
And I can't stand to think it's all that I've got. 
Take away all my silver 
Take away all my gold 
And hand me a stack of paper 
Paper money don't hold.  Paper money don't hold. 
Well, you act as though you don't remember 
The way it all used to be. 
Now one man, he locks up the money 
Another man holds the key. 
My car cost me fifteen grand, 
Some say I got a deal. 
Melt it down, I've got a thousand pounds of junk 
And ten dollars worth of steel.
