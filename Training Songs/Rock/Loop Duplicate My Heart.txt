And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before
And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before

I've found a reason for staying home tonight
Just by myself tonight 
All by myself
I'm gonna loop duplicate my heart into a million songs

I've found no reason for going out tonight
I'm making out tonight
With my computer
I'm putting guitars on hold and my multi-track on surround

And is it really so?
So many interesting effects I wanna try
I wanna try them all on you

And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before

Can't get no sleep tonight
Feels so good tonight
Damn, it feels so sweet tonight 
All by myself
The neighbors can't complain 'cause I got my head phones on

Can't get no sleep tonight 
Damn, it feels so good tonight
Everything is alright now 
(My computer)
I'm gonna sing a million songs for you
So I hope you enjoy it

And is it really so? 
So many interesting effects I wanna try
I wanna try them more on you

And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before
And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before
And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before
