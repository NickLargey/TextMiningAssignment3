You say that you're my little girl
You say that you're my little girl

What to do, I don't know
If you tell the truth or no
I remeber once before
When I came, you closed the door

You say that you're my little girl
You say that you're my little girl

If I go you say you'll pine
If I stay you're mine, mine, 
Though you say you care for me
Time must pass for me to see

You say that you're my little girl
You say that you're my little girl

There may be a chance for us
If in you I place my trust
It will take some little time
But I'll know you're mine, mine

You must stay and I must go
When we meet then you'll know
In your mind if we can be
Time will tell and we will see
