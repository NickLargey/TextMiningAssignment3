Once there was a young man
No one could understand
Wastin' time every day
He got nothin' to say

All he ever playin' is
That rock n' roll music
Rock n' roll music yeah
All he ever wanted was a reason to do it
Reason to do it yeah

Well he know every line (He's a rocker)
For the rhythm n' rhyme (He's a rocker)
Move his head to the beat (He's a rocker)
As he walk down the street (He's a rocker)

All he ever playin' is
That rock n' roll music
Rock n' roll music yeah
All he ever wanted was a reason to do it
Reason to do it yeah

C'mon let's trip again
Just like how we used to
I wanna trip again
We ain't got nothin' to lose

All he ever playin' is
That rock n' roll music
Rock n' roll music yeah
All he ever wanted was a reason to do it
Reason to do it yeah
