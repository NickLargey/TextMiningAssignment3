If you go down to that basement
Where the rhythm creeps
You may see a girl
Bopping to the beat
Swings her hips
And swings her hair
Sparkle in her eye
Somewhere in the darkness
She gets high
She's a rocker
And she likes to rock-n-roll
Tenderly she holds you
In her soft embrace
All she wants
All she says
Is dig that dig that bass
If you go down to that basement
Where the lights are low
You know she'll be there
Stealing the show
Like a fire burning
She's hot she's hot
Don't you hold back, baby
Give it what you got
