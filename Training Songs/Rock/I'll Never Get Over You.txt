I would have thought time would erase
I'll never get over you
The feeling's lost in your embrace
I'll never get over you

But still I try
And still I cry
Still I'm wondering why

[Chorus]
I'll never get over you
I'll never get over you
I'll never get over you

I tell myself my heart will find
A way to get over you
When I've already lost my mind
Trying to get over you

The voice goes on
The feeling's long
But still sweet sleep never comes

[Chorus]

So now I've met the enemy
Trying to get over you
A shroud of rain, a memory
Trying to get over you

I recognize
Those crazy eyes
And still they're telling me lies

[Chorus]
