I went to the airport, but I missed my flight
I had to get out of this town tonight
Then a lady in black caught my attention
I couldn't figure out what was her intention

She told me about a flight that was leaving tonight
She could get me a seat and the price was right
She tugged on my pants so I jumped at the chance
I had no idea what was in store for me

I'll never fly S&M airlines again

She welcomed me aboard then she strapped me to my seat
She tied my hands and legs down and made me kiss her feet
She whipped me and she slapped me, and gagged me when I begged
One things for sure I'll never fly S&M airlines again

The stewardess in leather came walking down the isle
She put nipple clamps on me with a sadistic smile
The pain was so bad I had tears in my eyes
Then I looked up and there were two gartered thighs

I'll never fly S&M airlines again

Her ass was inches from me when she told me to lick
Before I could do anything she slapped my dick
So I followed her commands, my aim was to please
I spent the rest of the flight on my knees

The plane finally landed by the end of the night
I had to get off of this torture flight
I asked her to release me, then she bit my lip
She said the ticket that you bought, it was round trip.

I'll never fly S&M airlines again
I'll never fly S&M airlines again
I'll never fly S&M airlines again
I'll never fly S&M airlines again
