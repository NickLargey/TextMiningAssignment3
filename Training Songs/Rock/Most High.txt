Who guards the truth
Oh lord most high
A frightened dove in a starless sky, oh-oh, oh oh oh
So high, most high, so high

Who hides the east from the blind man's eye
In the land of peace
Where the righteous cry, oh-oh, oh oh oh
So high, most high, so high

[Chorus:]
Where are the words of the king
Who moves the stars and then the sun
To the light where my spirit was born
Bring this wanderer home

While mercy sleeps in the hearts of liars
And the olive tree is consumed by fire, oh-oh, oh oh oh
So high, most high, so high

[Chorus]
Where are the words of the king
Who moves the stars and then the sun
To the light where my spirit was born
Bring this wanderer home, come on, come on, come on

When David's seed talks
Through his paper crown
And he spits hot steel
See all the kids fall down
Ohhh yeah, mmm
So high, most high, so high, Oh oh yeah

Oh oh
Come on, come on, come on [Repeat: x3]

Better hurry, hurry [Repeat: x2]

Most high, most high high high
Most high, so high, so high
So high
