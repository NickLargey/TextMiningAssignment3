Sitting in the stand of the sports arena
Waiting for the show to begin
Red lights, green lights, strawberry wine
A good friend of mine, follow the stars
Venus and Mars
Are alright tonight

What's that man holding in his hands?
He looks a lot like a guy I knew way back when
Its silly willy with the Philly band
Could be...... Oo-ee.........

If there's a Rock Show 
At the Concertgebow
They've got long hair 
At the Madison Square
You've got Rock and Roll
At the Hollywood Bowl
We'll be there.......... Oh yeah.........

The lighst go down - they're back in town O.K.
Behind the stacks you glimpse an axe
The tension mounts you score an ounce Ole!
Temperatures rise as you see the white of their eyes

If there's a Rock Show.........

In my green metal suit I'm preparing to shoot up the City
And the ring at the end of my nose makes me look rather pretty
Its a pity there's nobody here to witness the end
Save for my dear old friend and confidante - Madamoiselle Kitty

what's that man movin' to and fro?
That decibel meter doesn't seem to be reading low
But they was louder at the Rainbow
Could be.......... Oo-ee..........

If there's a Rock Show 
At the Concertgebow
They've got long hair 
At the Madison Square
You've got Rock and Roll
At the Hollywood Bowl
We'll be there.......... Oh yeah.........

If there's a Rock Show...... 

If there's a Rock Show...... 

If there's a Rock Show......
