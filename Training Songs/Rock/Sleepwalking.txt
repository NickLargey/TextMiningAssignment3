Maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like I'm right
The days are to long and I have to sleep tonight
Where all the words that batter me are turning into lies
And all the hands that hold me fade into the sky 

[Chorus]
I want to dream, I want to see
I'm sleepwalking away with you tonight 
I'm sleepwalking because it's better than real life
I don't want to stop it and I don't know what it means
But its me and its you can't you see

The crowds have all gone and the night is sinking low
There's a place in your heart you still won't let me go
If all the world is spinning and you're almost gone
Could you stop it for a minute, just to let me on

[Chorus]

And if its the world I see tonight, Crowded only by daylight
Tomorrow's the day'll make it right

I'm sleepwalking away with you tonight 
I'm sleepwalking because it's better than real life
I don't want to stop it and I don't know what it means
But its me and its you can't you see
I'm sleepwalking sleepwalking
