I can see you're bleeding from your laugh
You tried to stop it with an axe
You fill the holes with styrofoam
You drive your hammer with a nail
Plastic made of sheets
Your claustrophobic dreams
Your dyin to make it, feel so real

Arm and arm you fall into your day
There's always something missing from your lips
You break the silence with a scream
He's never even seen you move your mouth

Watched you grind your teeth
Feeling so complete
You're dyin to make it
Feel so real, you laugh
You're dyin to make it, feel so real
