Falling on a
Following a new nation
The days are growing up
Made for, our life are moments
Cover all the sky with lights
The wind is painful, raging
True love confusion
Senses are blowing up miles high
Get mixed up, get danger
Let’s ? the sky with lights

On the vertical streets
We go up up (up up)
With our eyes set to leap
Glowing love love (up up)
In the spiral cities
Let’s get lost lost
We count stars

Follow a procession
Walking on a new nation
The days are growing up
Made for, our life are moments
Everything’s painful, danger
Our eyes are open

On the vertical streets
We go up up (up up)
With our eyes set to leap
Glowing love love (up up)
In the spiral cities
Let’s get lost lost
We count stars

Senses are blowing up miles high
Get mixed up get danger
Let’s ? the sky with lights

On the vertical streets
We go up up (up up)
With our eyes set to leap
Glowing love love
In the spiral cities
Let’s get lost lost
The counting starts
In the spiral cities
We go up up (up up)
