I know there'll be another time.
There's going to be another moment.
There'll never be another you.
There's going to be another story.
There's so much left for you to do, love.

There'll never be another you.
There's going to be another spring,
And it won't always be winter.
And it'll always be spring.
There's going to be another kingdom.
There's so much left for you to know, love.

There'll never be another you.
Will be there when you need me.
Darling, you'll just have to say.
But you know I'll be there anyway.
You've got to have faith in me, darling;
Got to have faith in yourself.
Faith in your wealth.

I know there'll be another spring,
And it won't always be winter.
And it'll always be spring.
There's going to be another story.
There's so much left for you to know, love.
There'll never be another you.
There'll never be another you.
There'll never be another you, love.
