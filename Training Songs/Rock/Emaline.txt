I wish it was last September
When we could lose ourselves in crowds every day
Cause Emaline don't walk in time
She's not the same, that's all you can say

[Chorus]
When I've heard enough,
I tell myself
That we've learned our lesson but I
Don't want to walk away from Emaline

They're talking now
Does she know what they're saying?
She's got the air
To float above and
I'm sinking into
Someone should pay

She's dear to me and so expensive
I'm not talking 'bout money
When money talks I hate to listen
But lately it's been screaming in my ear

[Chorus]

It only took me one look
To understand Emaline
Sometimes I don't know what she's saying
Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't
Know what she's saying
But I know I know
I know what she wants to believe

I wish it was last September
Don't let me walk away from Emaline
For stupid reasons
Now I'm talking 'bout money
When money talks I hate to listen
But lately it's been screaming in my ear
Oh what advice,
Girls need attention
Well are you different than all mine?
For what it's worth,
She's got attention
From people like you
Who see black and white

Now I've heard enough
I'll tell you what
Really shouldn't sit here and whine
I'll take you down to see my Emaline
I wish it was
