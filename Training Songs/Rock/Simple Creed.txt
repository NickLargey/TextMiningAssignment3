Born with your back to the god
That spit you out on the riverbed
Angry at who? Me?
You better back up fool
I'll bet you took a gun to school too
But now, nobody's takin' your candy
You just keep on livin' this tragedy

La la la la la la la
To each his own

But, I wait for you to take my hand
'Cause we need each other
We gotta love each other

Yeah

Born with your back to the god
Who picked you up by your puppy scruff
Angry at who? Me?
You better back up fool
And be grateful that the real me's always hiding from you
But now, nobody's takin' your bicycle,
Maybe somebody should take your microphone

La la la la la la la
To each his own
But I wait for you to understand
That we need each other
We gotta love each other
(I wait for you to understand)
That we need each other
(I wait for you to understand)
That we need each other

Someone should take your microphone
Someone leave their life at home
Someone will take your bubblegum
Someone will take your life along
You're always, walking hallways
You're always, walking hallways
Try again, lie again
(Improvised lyrics)

I wait for you to take my
I wait for you to take my hand
'Cause we need each other
You know, We gotta love each other
'Cause we need each other
Yeah, We gotta gotta love each other
We need each other

We've gotta love, gotta love each other
