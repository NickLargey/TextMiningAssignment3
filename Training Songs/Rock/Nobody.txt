I'm trying to find a reason to mend my ways
But this hesitation, well it slows me down
And it feels like I have lost you along the way, yeah
No ventilation, well it chokes me out

(Confront it)
If you keep talking that way (?)
Nobody's gonna find it hard
If you keep passing the blame, yeah (? intervention)
You die with a lonely heart

I am filled with reservation and you with shame
A compulsive nature and a hurtful mouth
Now I make this observation to clear my name, yeah
You're a black constellation with the stars burnt out

(Confront it)
If you keep talking that way (?)
Nobody's gonna find it hard
If you keep passing the blame, yeah (? intervention)
You die with a lonely heart

You can't make me stay, yeah
(Tell me can you take it?)
Can't make me stay, yeah
(Tell me can you take it?)
Can't make me stay, yeah
(Well tell me can you take it?)
Can't make me stay

(Confront it)
If you keep talking that way (?)
Nobody's gonna find it hard
If you keep passing the blame, yeah (? intervention)
You die with a lonely heart

You can't make me stay, yeah
(Tell me can you take it?)
Can't make me stay, yeah
(Tell me can you take it?)
Can't make me stay, yeah
(Well tell me can you take it?)
Can't make me stay
