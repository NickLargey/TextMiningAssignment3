Let's start a war for the kids 
A purpose for which to unite 
Make them some words they can mince 
What they don't know, They won't mind 

Find them a foe for the fight 
And stories to tell as they age 
Then maybe time will decide 
Which ones keep and which ones fade 

[Chorus]
There's the deepest sleep in my life, 
From which I am slowly coming to 
And every morning I wait for the news 
Oh this is, this is post war blues  

Make me a means to an end 
Oh make me an ending in sight 
Make me insightful again 
What I can't see, I can't fight 

Make me a fire to burn 
Burn all the letters I wrote 
Write me a list of concerns 
If we are at peace 
If we are at ease 
I want to know 

[Chorus]

Oh this is, this is post war blues
