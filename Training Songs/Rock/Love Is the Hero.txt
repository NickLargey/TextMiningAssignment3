There is a course in life, so all the teachers say
It calls you day and night, it takes your thoughts away
Under a frozen light you face a long crusade
Where there's a cause you fight, where there's a cost you pay

Find an empty heart, you feel the passion play
It's when reactions start that you can't look away
There is no wrong or right, there's just your point of view
But when you face the light then it will come to you

Love is the hero, soldier forever
Life below zero, never say never

There is no sacrifice, there is no dead-end street
There is no sound advice, only the watch you keep
With every step you take through every room of fear
With every move you make the song will pull you near

Turn you world around and it will come your way
Through your cold-chill nights and in your hard-earned days
When you face the light it may be hard to do
But when it's all too right then it will come to you

Love is the hero, soldier forever
Love is the hero, you live to remember

No path is too steep, no distance too wide
No question too deep, no force can divide
You fortune you seek, the road will unwind
You're comin' to me, to search is to find

And when you start to fall into that frozen space
And when you reach the wall and there's no sunny place
And when it all comes down you make it anyhow, anyway

Love is the hero
