If I could choose
I'd calm this dawn
But the storm is me insensible and free
Now that you know I've come here to go
You're suddenly sad you've been mine

Oh how the lust for love is blind
Now that you see the man that is me
You're suddenly glad I'll be gone
Oh how the quest for self is strong
