I lost another day
I never meant to be sad
But I lost it again
They're changing the chords
They're making it worse
I'm losing it all

Don't you seek for a friend?
They never wait 'til the end
They leave anyway
They're changing the chords
They're making it worse
We're losing it all

I woke up with the rooster
Played loud and drove 'em insane
I can't let go
They hurt me
Come back
And save me again!

If you're gonna go
Then please let it show
I won't trade my mind
For some other life
I rather be dead than being so lame
'Cause it's better to burn than to fade away
