If your life's not right, doesn't satisfy you
You don't get the breaks like some of us do
Better work it out, find where you've gone wrong
Better do it soon as you don't have long

Get out of sour milk sea 
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be 
Find out what's going on there

If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all makes you more aware
A very simple process takes you there
Get out of sour milk sea you don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there

Looking for release from limitation?
There's nothing much without illumination
Can fool around with every different cult
There's only one way really brings results
Get out of sour milk sea you don't belong there
Get back to where you should be 
Find out what's going on there

Get back to where you should be 
Find out what's going on there

Get back, get back, get back
Why don't you get back now
You don't belong here
Get out of here, babe
