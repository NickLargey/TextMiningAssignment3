The dwarf plays pool to prove his height
People play games when they lose at life
There's no sport, lad, just acid tension stomach flared.
A madness in my area
I have seen the good and bad
I have seen declining tracks, [climbing tracks?]
I have seen the madness in my area
Honor served time till I'm asked about it
Years cross-checked, days become a take
Can't remember who I sacked, just stupid faces looking bad
The madness in my area
I have seen the good and bad
I have seen declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area
Former friends suck on the Fall
Genuine white crap, I recall.
Their future cries
Of broken pain are idiot victims'.
Just adds to the madness in my area
I have seen the good and bad
I have seen declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area
You've got comics in full bloom
McCarthy reincarnates soon
See the bones on the two-way faces
The me generation
See the traces of
The madness in my area
I have seen the good and bad
I have seen the declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area
I have seen the burrowmen
Frozen pain that is so bad
I have seen the madness in my area
Madness in my empire
In the writer
In the Berlin fighter
In the mirror
A doppelganger
The used satire
