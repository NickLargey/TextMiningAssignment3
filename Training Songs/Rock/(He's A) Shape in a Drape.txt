There's a guy goin' round the town
You got to check what he is puttin' down
Just one look you know the story is great
He's the guy the chicks love and the cats can't hate

He's a shape in a drape
A shape in a drape
He's a shape in a drape
And you can dig that he is stookin'

Now some say he's a clipster and a tailor's toad
And he could hype a miserman for all his gold
Some say he's a hipster and some say nix
But everyone's solid when he gets his kicks

He's a shape in a drape
A shape in a drape
He's a shape in a drape
And he is sure alive and kickin'
