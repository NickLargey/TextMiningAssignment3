Over seasons, like so many times before
You drop drop drop it 'til you break down the walls
Over seasons, when you come disobey
Just keep on droppin' 'til the break of the day
Over seasons, like so many times before
You drop drop drop it till you break down the walls
Over seasons, when you come not obey
Just keep drop drop drop dropâ€¦
Back in 1994 there was no reason that we had wanted to play
But a vision of expression
An ability to reason with the worries in our lives
An ability we'd recognized
How many times, would composition turn into confession?
Building a foundation for our youth to grow into progression
Making our days, free-will reside, we say!
Now you know things ain't right
And the pressure that you're granted from this life
And forever you had wondered what's in store
'Til you stand up and not take it anymore!
Doubted about the things you do
And de?ant of your scattered mental institute
No second guessing when it's already past
Denying that it wouldn't last
Here's to the days, here's to the nights
Throughout the years, how many nights? Here's to the daze that paved the way! We say!
Now you know things ain't right
And the pressure that you're granted from this life
And forever you had wondered what's in store
That's when you stand up and not take it anymore!
Like we'd done before!
The seize of day, turned on into night!
And open wide!
