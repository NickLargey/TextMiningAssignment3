I look around me and what do I see?
Sadness surrounds me, alone as can be
With too much time and too much distance

These chains that bind me, they won't set me free
I look behind me and coming for me, yeah
My best friend, she's my resistance

So if you find yourself alone and so unkind
And if you've asked yourself, over and over
And even if your heartbeats hurt like goodbyes
Try, try, try, open your mind
Spend some time with the gentle kind

I was torn between the darkness and the light
Lost to all belief that it could turn out right
But my quiet friend turned me 'round
Made me see again

She took my hand, said nothing much
No lesson learned, just a gentle touch
And I was coming 'round
I am, I am coming 'round again

So if you find yourself alone and so unkind
And if you've asked yourself, over and over
And even if your heartbeats hurt like goodbyes
Try, try, try, open your mind
Spend some time with the gentle kind

'cause in a hard world, with fastness and an eye on the money
I heard a soft voice, saying "Never worry, hold on honey"
When my world was gone, a whisper kind of eased my mind
And I am holdin' on to the gentle kind

She took my hand, said nothing much
No lesson learned, just a soft touch

So if you find yourself alone and so unkind
And if you've asked yourself, over and over
And even if your heartbeats hurt like goodbyes
Try, try, try, open your mind
Spend some time with the gentle kind

Open your mind
Spend some time with the gentle kind
Open your mind
Spend some time with the gentle kind
