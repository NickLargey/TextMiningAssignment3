Dreamed a long day
Just wandering free
Though I'm far gone
You sleep nearer to me

If I could find peace
If this night bleeds
But I can't help myself

So I walk out
These wandering dreams
Of the north road
Dressed gold and green

If I could lie still
As that grey hill
But I can't help myself

But it's calm and it's clear
Collapsed here on the stone
Delivered to this place
A vision dark and cloaked

And those figures through the leaves
And that light through the smoke
And those countless empty days
Made me dizzy when I woke
And I live to see your face
And I hate to see you go
But I know no other way
Than straight on out the door

And I can't help myself
And I can't help myself
And I can't help myself
