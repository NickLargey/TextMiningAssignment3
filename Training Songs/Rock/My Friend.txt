Whenever I'm down
I call on you my friend
A helping hand you lend
In my time of need

Whenever I'm down
I call on you my friend
(I call on you my friend)
(I call on you my friend)

Listen, listen, listen

Whenever I'm down
And all that's going on
Is really going on
Just one of those days (and ju-h)

You say the right things
To keep me moving on
To keep me going strong
(Going strong)
