I'll tell you what I'd like to do
Rock and roll you all through the night time
Just you and I and the blues
Baby, let me rock you 'til the sun shines

And you wait a lifetime
And you wait a lifetime
(Oh yes, you will)
And you wait a lifetime
And you wait a lifetime

I'll tell you what I'd like to see
See my baby rushing like a river
And if I was in the deep
I'd cry for love, I know my baby delivers
Deliver, oh, baby

And I wait a lifetime
And I wait a lifetime
(You know I would)
And I wait a lifetime
And I wait a lifetime

Aw yeah

I'll tell you what I'd like to do
Rock and roll you all through the night time
Just you and I and the blues
Baby let me rock you 'til the sun shines
Sun shines, oh baby

And you wait a lifetime
And you wait a lifetime
(Oh yes, you will)
And you wait a lifetime
And you wait a lifetime
(Oh yes, you will)
And you wait a lifetime
And you wait a lifetime
(Oh yes, you will)
And you wait a lifetime
And you wait a lifetime

Oh
Oh
