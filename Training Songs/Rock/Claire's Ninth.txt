So she stands and waits and waits at the school gate
They're late, they come, so dumb
In two cars when they agreed one
And it's gone wrong on her birthday
So they go to Joe's for pizza and ice cream
They sit and stare and Claire just wants to be 9 and a half
Next year she'll tell them she only wants world peace

But Claire, Claire baby
I wish you knew how this all got twisted
I wish you could see right inside us
'Cause all of this stuff, the best of us that we can't get out

What's the point of this
What's wrong with two birthdays
It's cool at school 
Her friends, they all have two birthdays
Oh geez, he just asked the waitress out on a date on her birthday

But Claire, Claire baby
I wish you knew how this all got twisted
I wish you could see right inside us
'Cause all of this stuff, the best of us that we can't get to

Here's the check
They pay with two cards like they've never met 
Goodbyes outside; it's cold in LA

Claire, Claire baby
I wish you knew how this all got twisted
I wish you could see right inside us
The best of us for most of us
Or what we were, you're all that's left
It used to be our birthday too
