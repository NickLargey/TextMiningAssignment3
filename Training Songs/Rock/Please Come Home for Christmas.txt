Bells will be ringing the sad, sad news
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby is gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again.

Choirs will be singing Silent Night
Oh, Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not by Christmas then by New Year's night.

Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
Oh, but it's Christmas, yeah Christmas my dear
This time of year to be with the one that you love

So won't you tell me, you'll never more roam
This Christmas and New Year will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief or pain
I'll be happy, happy once again.
