Down, down, down, always make the same mistakes, again
Down, down, always down, always make the same mistake
Talk is cheap, but you're talking fast
Never take the time to think of where it will end
Walk and talk and don't look back
I don't know which way it's gonna lead me baby
I try so hard but I can't understand, lead me baby
Just help me get my feet on the ground

Down, down, down, wanderin' through the places that we both used to go
Round, round always round, chase me and sedate me now but don't let me go
Restless sleep, locked in my lonely room
Empty arms are waiting for the morning to come
In the deep, where my dreams come true
Take care now, I'll keep you now, but lead me baby
I try so hard but I can't understand, lead me baby
Help me get my feet on the ground, help me baby

I can't stay down for too long now baby
I can't stay down for too long now my baby
If I'm crying, well it's 'cause I'm lonely
You know I'm only ever lonely without you
If I cry, well it's 'cause I'm lonely
'Cause I can be so lonely, I can be, I can be, I can be
