There you are on my street 
Standing where we used to meet 
I look like I just woke up 
You look beautiful as ever 

Oh why did you have to come back now 
I was just about to feel OK 
Ask me how I'm doing 
What's the perfect thing to say 

Oh take me to the next one 
Fast Forward me to someone new 
Take me to the next one 
It's the best thing I can do 
To get me over you 

Spring is here in New York 
Everybody's outside 
And I would rather run into any other 
body in this town 

Leaving it the way we did 
Seems so open ended 
I can tell you that I'm happy 
If we're just pretending 

Oh take me to the next one 
Fast Forward me to someone new 
Take me to the next one 
It's the best thing I can do 
To get me over you 

How's it done, the great undo 
All we did, now I do 

Oh take me to the next one 
Fast Forward me to someone new 
Take me to the next one 
It's the best thing I can do 
To get me over you 

Oh take me to the next one 
Fast Forward me to someone new 
Take me to the next one 
It's the best thing I can do 
To get me over you
