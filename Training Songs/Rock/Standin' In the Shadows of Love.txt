Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm just waitin' for the heartaches to come

I want to run but there's no place to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me

'Cause you've taking away
All my reason for living
When you pushed aside
All the love I been giving

Didn't I treat you right now, baby, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best for you now, didn't I?
Don't you leave me

Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come

All alone I'm destined to be
With misery my only company
Might come today, might come tomorrow
But it's for sure I ain't got nothing but sorrow

Now don't your conscience
Kind of bother you
How can you watch me cry
After all I done for you, now hold on a minute

Didn't I treat you right now, honey, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best for you now, didn't I?
So don't you leave me

Standing in the shadows of love
Getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come

I want to run but there's no place to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love the love that I need
It's the beginning of the end for me

Now don't your conscience
Kinda, kinda bother you
How can you watch me cry
After all the things I done for you

Didn't I treat you right now, baby, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best for you, couldn't I?
Didn't I do right by you, didn't I?
Didn't I screw you right now?

Kept you in luxury, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best for you, didn't I?
Didn't I treat you right now, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best for you now, didn't I?

I'm trying hard not to cry
You know my crying ain't gonna help me now
Without your love, the love that I need
It's the beginning of the end for me
So don't you leave me

Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come

Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing, standing, standing, standing
Standing, standing, standing, standing

Standing, standing, standing, standing
