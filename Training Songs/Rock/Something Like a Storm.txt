Fall asleep your head on my chest
Dream of something effortless
My heart beats out a message born
Of something like a storm

Live at night where the nights are long
From town to town and song to song
Feel the faces of strangers worn
Of something like a storm
Something like a storm
Something like a storm

Hold on as if a chain
That we made against the waves
As if a light where the nights are long
From town to town and home to home
See the walls of neighbors form
Something like a storm
Something like a storm
Something like a storm
