All our worlds are changing
In every changing places
My followers said to me
Will you least show their faces?
You lied
You lied
All I ask is you treat me right ?
All I ask is you need me while you cry
And ? around me
Know nothing and not see me
? less to me

You lied
You lied
All I ask is you treat me right Ã¢?Â¦
All I ask is you need me while you cry
You lied
You lied
All I ask is you treat me
All I ask is you hear me
Only you can complete me
