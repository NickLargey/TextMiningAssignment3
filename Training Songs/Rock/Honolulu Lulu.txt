Queen of the surfer girls
She's got stars in her eyes and knots on her knees
Now her crazy grass shift really sways in the breeze now
Ridin' down a heavy or lyin' in the sand
She's the hippest surfer girl in the land

And she's my Honolulu Lulu
She's my Honolulu Lulu
Queen of the surfer girls
 
Well, she handles all the big ones every year of Macaha
And all the surfers know her form Rincon to Baja
When the beach is quiet and you know we're outta luck
We pray for surf while makin' out in our truck

Just me and Honolulu Lulu
Me and Honolulu Lulu
Queen of the surfer girls

And she's my Honolulu Lulu 
Yeah my Honolulu Lulu
Queen of the surfer girls

I tell you once upon a time, you know
She got a little bold when she tried a hula spinner
But her wax wouldn't hold (Whoops!) 
Over the falls 'stead of hangin' ten
But then she'd paddle out and try it again

'Cause she's my Honolulu Lulu
She's my Honolulu Lulu
Queen of the surfer girls

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
