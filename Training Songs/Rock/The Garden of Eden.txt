When you walk in the garden
In the garden of Eden
With a beautiful woman
And you know how you care
And the voice in the garden
In the Garden of Eden
Tells you she is forbidden
Can you leave her there
When you're yearning for loving
And she touches your hand
And your heart starts a-pounding
And you're feeling so grand
Can you leave her to heaven
And obey the command
Can you walk from the garden
Does your heart understand
When you walk in the garden
In the garden of Eden
With a beautiful woman
And you know how you care
And the voice in the garden
In the Garden of Eden
Tells you she is forbidden
Can you leave her there
When you're yearning for loving
And she touches your hand
And your heart starts a-pounding
And you're feeling so grand
Can you leave her to heaven
And obey the command
Can you walk from the garden
Does your heart understand
When you walk in the garden
In the garden of Eden
With a beautiful woman
And you know how you care
And the voice in the garden
In the Garden of Eden
Tells you she is forbidden
Can you leave her there
Can you leave her there
Can you leave her there
Can you leave her there
