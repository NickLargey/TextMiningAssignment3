The night was black and velvet The stars were all around A stranger landed lightly on the frosty ground His eyes were wide with wonder Filled with stars and space He'd searched the heavens over Till he found this place A sweet and snowy carol echoed in his ears A song so faint and distant, so strong it drew him here Here is Christmas come inside Here is Christmas far and wide A thousand candles burning bright Here is Christmas shining in our eyes He wandered through the city Lost in the shopping crowds People rushing people pushing He watched without a sound Cash machines were singing about the biggest year But above this strange confusion The carol still rang clear Then he saw a raggedy man with an ancient mandolin And he knew he'd found the answer when the song began again Here is Christmas come inside Here is Christmas far and wide A million candles burning bright Here is Christmas shining in our eyes
