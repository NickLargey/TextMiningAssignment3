We made amends but nothing's mended
As what I gave can not be lended
I led you on but leading's wrong

I made a meal of it and stumbled
We both knew that my cookie crumbled
I led you on but leading's wrong

A kiss is just a kiss
I think that's what fools say
But that is what this is

Have I been a fool? Just say, say, say
Have I been a fool? Just say
Have I been a fool? Just say
Have I been a fool? Just say

You made a mountain of a molehill
Well, that's what I will tell myself still
I led you on and leading's wrong

I made a meal of it and stumbled
We both knew that my cookie crumbled
I led you on but leading's wrong

A kiss is just a kiss
I think that's what fools say
But that is what this is

Have I been a fool? Just say, say, say
Have I been a fool? Just say
Have I been a fool? Just say, say, say
Have I been a fool? Just say

I've been told I'm cruel
Due to what I do
I've been told I'm cruel to you, ohh

Have I been a fool? Just say
Have I been a fool? Just say, say, say
Have I been a fool? Just say
Have I been a fool? Just say
