Daddy's got the picture
Daddy's got the key
Daddy's got the "mag'
Naked lady by the tree

The school girls call me pervert
A weirdo and a freak
But I like Daddy's girl
She never teases me

Opposite Octave Reaction
Opposite Octave Reaction
Waiting on the lady
Waiting at the tree

Who sexually kills me
But Daddy's got the mag
Still underneath the bed
And sometimes I still get her

But only in my head
She always gets me to go again
to go again
She always gets me

Daddy's got the picture

Waiting on the lady
Waiting at the tree
Waiting for my wife
Who sexually kills me

But Daddy's got the mag
Still underneath the bed
And sometimes I still get her
But only in my head

Opposite Octave Reaction
Opposite Octave Reaction
And I hear it sometimes
But only in my head
