I hold it, I fold it 
I throw it on the floor 
I wrote it, but maybe I'm afraid 
That you'll be bored 
It's very real and true and sad 
And hopeful just like me 
It's one of those things I'll never tell 
I'll carve it in a tree 
I follow you, I watch you 
I thank God you're in my class 
I picture us in the school bus 
And we're holding each others' hand 
I need a plan for you to fall 
In love with me and then 
I'll make you marry me, I'll wait 
I never wear my glasses when 
I know that you can see me 
You act as if I'm not around 
But deep down you must need me 
I draw you, every single 
Feature in my head 
I try to do my homework 
But I dream of you instead 
I need a plan for you to fall 
In love with me and then 
I'll make you marry me, I'll wait 
I'll make you marry me 
I'll make you marry me 
I'll make you marry, marry me
I'll wait
