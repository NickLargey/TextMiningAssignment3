Hearts run dry, something happens when two hearts run dry
That you can't explain, no you don't know why, oh no oh no
Love grows cold, meanwhile life goes on and the young grow old
And you've seen too many dreams unfold, oh yeah when hearts run dry.
The setting sun, fades away just like a love that's gone
You remember when two hearts were one, oh yeah, oh yeah
And in the night, you still want someone to hold you tight
But your medicine just won't come right, oh no, when hearts run dry.
I can't love you the way that I used to do, but don't tell me I'm using you, losing you

Through empty days and lonely nights, it's memorys that keep me here with you
There's no getting near to you, and I still don't know what to do, leaving you, loving you.
Each day's the same, you decide to play the waiting game
So you live a lie, but you feel no shame, oh no, oh no.
I can't love you the way that I used to do, but don't tell me I'm using you, losing you

Through empty days and lonely nights, it's memorys that keep me here with you
There's no getting near to you, but I still don't know what to do, leaving you, loving you.
Hearts run dry, something happens when two hearts run dry
That you can't explain, no you don't know why, oh no oh no
Love grows cold, meanwhile life goes on and the young grow old

And you've seen too many dreams unfold, oh yeah when hearts run dry.
whoa-oh, when hearts run dry
whoa-oh, when hearts run dry
