Hollowed eggs are hatching on brother's head
Blushing cheeks showered with floating shells
The hand that I catch is a brighter red
The hand that I raise, how it turns me pale

Swollen tears swallowed by a pavement sea
Authority figures look for me
The mess that I made, how it makes me dwell
The hand that I caught wasn't all that well

My first and hopefully last
Skin collision past
Falling to the occasion
A means to my evasion

Occasion to fall
Authority figures call
Swallowed by a pavement sea

Is a brighter red
