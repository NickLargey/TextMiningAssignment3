When you're out with the boys
Ever contemplate not telling her
Exactly where we'll be, exactly where we'll be?
And when you're out with the boys
Would you ever contemplate not ditching us
As soon as she turns up, as soon as she turns up?

You, you've got priorities
But they're really not sitting that comfortably with me

Mate, do you know how much you've changed?
Where's my buddy I was hanging out with yesterday?
My friend, my friend, my friend, it's best you mend your ways
Or you'll end up having no friends left that you can bail on

When you're out with your girl
Do you realise that no one wants to talk to you?
That's 'cause you're such a bore, such a bore

You, you've got priorities
But they're really not sitting that comfortably with me

Mate, do you know how much you've changed?
Where's my buddy I was hanging out with yesterday?
My friend, my friend, my friend, it's best you mend your ways
Or you'll end up having no friends left that you can bail on

Miss you pumpkin, I miss you babe
Wish you could hear what you're saying
Miss you princess, I miss you babe
Makes me sick hearing you say it

Miss you pumpkin, I miss you babe
I miss you princess, I miss you babe
I miss you honey, my little angel
Come every hour of every day
Puppies, sunsets and pretty rainbows
That's the price you pay

Mate, do you know how much you've changed?
Where's my buddy I was hanging out with yesterday?
My friend, my friend, my friend, it's best you mend your ways
Or you'll end up having no friends left to hear complain

Mate, do you know how much you've changed?
Where's my buddy I was hanging out with yesterday?
My friend, my friend, my friend, it's best you mend your ways
Or you'll end up having no friends left that you can bail on

Guess that's just the price you pay
