If I can't crawl inside of you
I'm laughing with a broken face
I stumble across my self esteem
But to picture the pleasure is making me want my space

Understand
That God wrapped you like a bow
But in my head
There's some shelves that need cleaning
From basement to ceiling, control

If what you're seeing is an open book
That's great 'cause I'm an open book
But I'm real shy

There's a part of me seeking and desperately needing to open up
That's strange 'cause I'm an open book, a confused boy

I'm an automatic steeple for depressed and lonely people
My heart while in its cage
Give and not receive a thing
But the only funny thing is that I don't know how to give myself advice

I've got this post dramatic thing
I've got this tattoo of a ring that lies
Around my wedding finger and that's where I want to state this claim
That I've got to learn to live and dream
Before I go and get myself in love

In love
Before, before, before I go and get myself in love

There's Zoloft, Welbutrin, there's Paxil that's proven, no side effects
But the rest left unnamed 'cause they worked like a charm on me

But when your saving is drying
You can't stop from crying
You've got to suck it up
You're not her buttercup
You're not her favorite book

And I am an automatic steeple for depressed and lonely people
My heart while in its cage
Give and not receive a thing
But the only funny thing is that I don't know how to give myself advice

I've got this post dramatic thing
I've got this tattoo of a ring that lies
Around my wedding finger and that's where I want to state this claim
That I've got to learn to live and dream
Before I go and get myself in love

In love
Before, before, before I go and get myself in love
