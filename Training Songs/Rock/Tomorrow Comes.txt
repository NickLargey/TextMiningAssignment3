Sleepy eyes
It's time to rise
It must be well past afternoon
I know you
Got a wonderful view
I am familiar with the ceiling

But when tomorrow comes
You'll be stepping out that door 
But when tomorrow comes
You'll be stepping out that door 

Don't feel bad
The love that you had
Just goes to prove that you are able
I know you
Got a terrible view
I am familiar with the feeling

But when tomorrow comes
You'll be stepping out that door
But when tomorrow comes
You'll be stepping out that door 

Not too far
From where you are
Red leaves are floating in from Sebastian
Everyday
They fall away
Bright green is coming back in fashion

And when tomorrow comes
You'll be stepping out that door
But when tomorrow comes
You'll be stepping out that door
