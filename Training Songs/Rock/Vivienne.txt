Wild eyes
Skinny jeans
Disengaged at just nineteen
You and I stuck in the in-between

Come on baby lets feel alive
We could change the world
If we stopped getting high
But you know I'd give it all up
Just to spend it with you

If you said I need you
To fall in deeper
I'd fall, fall
Just to stay here with you
You know I'd give you
It all, all
Vivienne

I never knew
Didn't see
That fate could be so tongue in cheek
A loving kindness that's both brutal and bleak

Come on baby let's feel alive
We could change the world
If we stopped getting high
But goddamn I'd give it all up
Just to spend it with you

If you said I need you
To fall in deeper
I'd fall, fall
Just to stay here with you
You know I'd give you
It all, all
Vivienne
Vivienne

And I feel that we're close
To the fear, heaven knows
We pray, we hope, and away we go

Time after time, as the day turns to night
Like a child I cry, kiss it all goodbye
Though I've grown I'm a mess, we don't crawl in the west
Live and hope for the best, f*ck it all and the rest

If you said I need you
To fall in deeper
I'd fall, fall
Just to stay here with you
You know I'd give you
