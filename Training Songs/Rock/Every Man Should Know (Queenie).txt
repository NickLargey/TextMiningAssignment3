Oh yes

Well, don?t mess with my Queenie,
Or I?ll mess with your nose
Yes, you can stand there dreamin?
But don?t you dare step on my toes

Cause, every man should know
Can?t take what you owe. 
To own a body you got to own a soul
So every man should knowww oh ohh

Yes

Yes, you might take my money
But I won?t take second place
Ooh, you mess with my honey
I?ll mess with your face

Cause, every man should know
Can?t take what you owe-oo-woa-oh. 
To own a body you got to own a soul
So every man should knowww oh ohhh

Ah yes

Woah, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha 

Yes, don?t mess with my Queenie
Or I?ll mess with your nose
Ooh you can stand there dreamin?
But don?t you dare step on my toes

Cause, every man should know
You can?t take what you owe-oo-woa-oh.
To own a body you got to own a soul
So every man should knowww oh ohhh

Every man should knowww oh oh
