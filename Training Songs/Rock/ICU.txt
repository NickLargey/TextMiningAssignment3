I wake up some mornings
Thank God not as often as I used to
Slow and heavy from dreams with you
You've found a way back in
Once again my long lost friend
Funny to see that after all these years*I miss you the same

So I drag myself to the corner caf√©
And for a second I see you there
Like in the good old days
And I wonder what you're doing ?
What are you up to these days ?
I sometimes wish you would call me
But then I wouldn't know what to say

And I see you, in every cab that goes by, in the strangers at every cross road, in every bar (bis)

It takes a glass or two
For it to settle down
For your shadows to stop following me
Around
I find myself walking back
To all the places we knew
Dreaming and wishing
To somehow run into you

And of course I wonder
Does it happen to you ?
Does my ghost ever come looking for you ?

And I see you
