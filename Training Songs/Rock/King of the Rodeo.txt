He's so purity, a shaven and a mourning,
And standing on a pigeon toe, in his disarray

Straight in the picture pose,
He's coming around to meet you

And screaming like a battle cry, its more if I stay

Me and your cold, driving in the snow,
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl king of the rodeo, let the good times roll,
Let the good times roll

How dare you some to me like with nail for a favor,
Hold on not my fairy tale you're trying to start

Take off your overcoat, you're staying for the weekend,
And swaying like a smokey grey, a drink in the park

Me and your cold, driving in the snow,
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl king of the rodeo, let the good times roll,
Let the good times roll

Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
