We've got our rope and summit
Got our rope and summit
But we need to wake up
Baby wake up

Unmasking your fears
One by one see them disappear
Into the fog down below
Slipping is fine
As long as you don't fall

Still in the quiet morning breeze
Swaying gently in unsuspecting dreams
Clues of a gathering storm
It's time to wake up
Time to move on
