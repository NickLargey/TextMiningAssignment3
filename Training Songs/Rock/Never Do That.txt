Let me stay
One more day
It would mean so much to me
I won't make a sound
I'll just hang around
I'll sit where the last one sat
But oh no
I'd never do that

Take my mouth as far as you can see
It stretches father than I care to think
Put me out of my misery
If I could keep it shut
I wouldn't be in this rut
With less chance than a laboratory rat
Oh no
I'd never do that

You're a master of illusion
You say you do - but you don't
You think I will - I know I won't

When I see you sitting there
It sends a shock right through me
I never thought an ordinary chair
Could have such poetry
I don't deserve your time
I haven't got the tact
I live above my means in fact
Oh no
I'd never do that

I'd never do that
I'd never do that
I'd never do that
