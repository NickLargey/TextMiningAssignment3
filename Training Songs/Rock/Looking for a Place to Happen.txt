I've got a job, I explore, I follow every little whiff
And I want my life to smell like this
To find a place, an ancient race
The kind you'd like to gamble with
Where they'd stamp on burning bags of shit
Looking for a place to happen
Making stops along the way, hey

Wayward ho! Away we go,
It's a shame to leave this masterpiece
With it's gallery gods and it's garbage-bag trees
So I'll paint a scene, from memory,
So I'd know who murdered me
It's a vain pursuit, but it helps me to sleep
Looking for a place to happen
Making stops along the way, hey
Looking for a place to happen
Making stops along the way, hey

Looking for a place to happen
Making stops along the way, hey

Jacques Cartier, right this way,
I'll put your coat up on the bed
Hey man you've got the real bum's eye for clothes
And come on in, sit right down,
No you're not the first to show
We've all been here since, God, who knows?
Looking for a place to happen
Making stops along the way, hey
Looking for a place to happen
Making stops along the way, hey
Jacques Cartier, right this way
I'll put your coat up on the bed
You've got the real bum's eye for clothes
Come on in, sit right down,
We've all been here since, God, who knows?
