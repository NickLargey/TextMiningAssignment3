I wheeled into a truck stop in Texas
A little place called Hamburger Dan
I heard that old jukebox a playin'
Song about a truck drivin' man

That waitress done brought me my coffee
I thanked her and I called her back again
I said, "You know that song, it sure did fit me
I'm just a truck drivin' man"

[Chorus]
So pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
And drop another quarter in the jukebox
Play a song about a truck drivin' man

I climbed up aboard my old semi
Then like a flash, I was gone
Got old them big wheels a rollin'
I'm on my way to San Antone

[Chorus]

I said, pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
And drop another quarter in the jukebox
Play a song about a truck drivin' man
Yeah, I'm just a truck drivin' man
