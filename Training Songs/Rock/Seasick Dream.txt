When I woke, I was not awake
Light from the sun felt so far away
I went up, with all of my strength
Straight for the sun, from the depths I sprang
And I drank from the sea
But it opened up and swallowed me
So I sank down deep
No I'm drunken like a seasick dream
In this dream, I am awake

I am awake

Well when did all of the waves
Roll right in and make me their slave
So I went so far away
I didn't look back, I'll come back someday
Mamma wept, and she weeped
She said horizon don't you take him from me
Black sails on the sea
Just carry me until I can be
Awake, in this dream, I am awake
