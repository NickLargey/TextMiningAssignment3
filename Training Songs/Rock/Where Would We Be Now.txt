I smile, you laugh, I look away
I sigh, you ask me why, I say,
It's ok and I am just feeling down
Your hand on mine I hear the words
If only love had found us first, our lives they would be different

But that was not the plan, oh

Where would we be now baby, if we found each other first
Where would you do now darlin', if I said these simple words
I'll wait
I'll wait, as long as you want

And now I must confess
That I am a sinking ship
I'm anchored by the weight of my heart cause it's filled with these feelings
I keep my true thoughts locked beside my hearts black box
And it wont be found, it wont survive through the smoke or the wreckage
So I guess I'll crash and burn

Where would we be now baby, if we found each other first
What would you do now darlin', if I said these simple words
I'll wait, I'll wait, as long as you want.

Where would we be now baby

I'll wait
I'll wait

Where would we be now baby, if we found each other first
What would you do now darling, if I said these simple words
I'll wait, I'll wait, as long as you want.

Where would we be now baby
I'll wait
I'll wait
I'll wait
I'll wait
