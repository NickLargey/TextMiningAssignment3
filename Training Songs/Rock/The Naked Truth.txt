From the Album:
* The naked truth

Used to be a young gun
Out on the hard streets
Getting high on crystal
Drinking scotch and smoking weed
Daddy's wish used to be nothing less than my command
Took a switch to my back nailed me to a cross both hands
Mama couldn't give me
The thing a young boy needs
Instead of mama suffering
She was smart enough to leave
Spend my life fighting trying to stay free
From trials and tribulations and the state penitentiary
Hustled pool really looking cool
Just making both ends meet
Until that day I saw you walking
Down Blue Angel street
The sweetest lies are lily white coming from your lips
You brush away all my pain with a lazy finger tip hm
It moves my heart just watching
The way you walk so smooth
You save me from an evil fate
You steal away my blues
Lyin' here in your arms
I don't need more proof
Lyin' here safe and warm
It's just the naked truth
This man loves you
This man loves you
This man loves you
This man loves you
That's the naked truth
It's the naked truth
Going down that graveyard spiral
There was nothing I could do
Life treatin' me much harder
Than a mean old corkscrew
Lyin' here in your arms
I don't need more proof
Lyin' here safe and warm
It's just the naked truth
This man loves you
This man loves you
This man loves you
This man loves you
It's the
It's the naked truth
It's the naked truth
