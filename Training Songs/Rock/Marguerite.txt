(In memory of Marguerite Heurtin)

Woo, yeah!

I hold your hand as your smile slips away
As you leave, there's nothing left to say
With no regrets, my love for you a crime
But let me say this one more time

Marguerite, even though you're gone, I can feel you in my heart
Marguerite, though you're free from harm
I still miss you, Marguerite

I call you up, excuses you could make
For why I can't attend a second of your wake
Without a tear, I cast a spade of dirt
I must admit that it still hurts

Marguerite, even though you're gone, I can feel you in my heart
Marguerite, though you're free from harm
I still miss you, Marguerite

Woo, yeah

I hear a voice, is it really you 2 help me with the million things I do
You gave me love, and left me to my will
In tem or twenty years I'll miss you still

Marguerite, even though you're gone, I can feel you in my heart
Marguerite, though you're free from harm
I still miss you, Marguerite
Marguerite, even though you're gone, I can feel you in my heart
Marguerite, though you're free from harm
I still miss you, Marguerite...
Marguerite, even though you're gone
Ah...Marguerite...I still miss you, Marguerite
Yeah...Even though you're gone...Ooh, Marguerite Heurtin...
