Don't let me cry
Hold me up, hold me up
Look in my eyes
Hey, don't let it die
Hold me up, hold me up
Stay by my side

Fast days, fresh phase
Keep up or you're gonna feel lazy
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
I spy your eye
Too late, we're caught in our disguises
Won't leave you alone, won't leave you alone

Backdate my fate
I wanna know are we gonna capsize it?
Can we keep it afloat? Gotta keep it afloat
I hear, my fear
Talking so fast it'll make you feel crazy
Can we keep it afloat? Gotta keep it afloat

Don't let me cry
Hold me up, hold me up
Look in my eyes
Hey, don't let it die
Hold me up, hold me up
Stay by my side, hey

Fast days, fresh phase
Keep up or you're gonna feel lazy
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
I spy your eye
Too late, we're caught in our disguises

Don't let me cry
Hold me up, hold me up
Look in my eyes
Hey, don't let it die
Hold me up, hold me up
Stay by my side, hey
