We were a match made with burning desire
Who could have known we were playing with fire
Now it's lights out baby you know why
You couldn't play it straight even if you tried

Anyone who ever knew you
Couldn't help but see right through you
Go ahead look me in the eyes
I'm so tired of your alibies

Oh I wonder
Which way are you gonna go
Just because you say it like you mean it
Don't make it so

Tell me the truth baby tell me true
This kind of love just won't do
Tell me the truth baby tell me nice
Better take my advice

One day you're gone baby then you're back
Just like a train you jump the track
Why don't you slow down you're gonna crash
Ain't gonna get no second chance

Do you think that I believe you
When you do the things that you do
Go ahead look me in the eyes
I'm so tired of your alibies

Oh I wonder
Which way are you gonna go
Just because you say it like you mean it
Don't make it so

Tell me the truth baby tell me true
This kind of love just won't do
Tell me the truth baby tell me nice
Better take my advice
