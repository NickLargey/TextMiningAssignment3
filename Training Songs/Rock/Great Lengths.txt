Here I am one again pleading to the sky
Kneeling to the sands shedding my regrets
Knowing You'll forgive everything

Why didn't I got to such great lengths to
Try to please You instead I tried to please myself
In the end when Your heart is broken
I see the folly of trying to please myself

I have not yet arrived seeing anything
Quiet my desires till they die
Or align with Your Will

Why didn't I got to such great lengths to
Try to please You instead I tried to please myself
In the end when Your heart is broken
I see the folly of trying to please myself

Why didn't I got to such great lengths to
Try to please You instead I tried to please myself
In the end when Your heart is broken
I see the folly of trying to please myself

Why didn't I got to such great lengths to
Try to please You instead I tried to please myself
In the end when Your heart is broken
I see the folly of trying to please myself
