From the earth to the sky
Let it rise, let it rise
From the dark into light
Now alive, now alive

We are here to lift You up
Here to sing a song of love
Here to give You, God
What You are worthy of

A holy roar
Reaching for Heaven
Our praise poured out
With a reckless abandon
Our worship, God
Is wholly Yours
(Oh)

Here we stand, here we wait
Have Your way, have Your way
Every hand in this place
God, we raise, God, we raise

We are here to lift You up
Here to sing a song of love
Here to give You, God
What You are worthy of

A holy roar
Reaching for Heaven
Our praise poured out
With a reckless abandon
Our worship, God
Is wholly Yours
We are wholly Yours

Forever worthy, forever worthy
Forever worthy is the Lamb who was slain, oh
Forever worthy, forever worthy
Forever worthy is the Lamb who was slain

Hear this holy roar
Reaching for Heaven
Our praise poured out
With a reckless abandon
Our worship, God
Is wholly Yours
To hear our holy roar
Reaching for Heaven
Our praise poured out
With a reckless abandon
Our worship, God
Is wholly Yours
We are wholly Yours

(Oh)
All the earth, a holy roar
We're lifting up a holy roar
All the earth, a holy roar
We're lifting up a holy roar
All the earth, a holy roar
We're lifting up a holy roar
All the earth, a holy roar
We're lifting up a holy roar
