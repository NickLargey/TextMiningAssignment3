We are the dirt they wont step in
Burned to the ground and left for dead
Only the darkness knows our names
Covered in black we walk thru flames

The bite from the dog that won’t back down
The sound of the voice you can’t drown out
And even in chains we still resist
It’s time to raise your fists

You got the right to rise
(Living like you’re ready living like you're ready)
From ashes we survive
(Living like you're ready living like you're ready to die)
C'mon look in my eyes are you ready to die
(Living like you're ready, living like you're ready tonight)
Are you feeling alive 'cause i’m ready to die

You got the right to rise
You got the right to rise
You got the right to rise
You got the right to rise

Cut from a cloth that's torn and stained
Gasoline pumping thru our veins

The bite from the dog that won’t back down
The sound of the voice you can’t drown out
Let em deny that we exist
Come on and raise your fists

You got the right to rise
(Living like you’re ready living like you're ready)
From ashes we survive
(Living like you're ready living like you're ready to die)
C'mon look in my eyes are you ready to die
(Living like you're ready, living like you're ready tonight)
Are you feeling alive'cause i’m ready to die

You got the right to rise
You got the right to rise
You got the right to rise
You got the right to rise

I’m ready to die
Oh yeah
Oh my god, yeah
Oh my god, yeah

You got the right to rise
(Living like you’re ready living like you're ready)
From ashes we survive
(Living like you're ready living like you're ready to die)
C'mon look in my eyes are you ready to die
(Living like you're ready, living like you're ready tonight)
Are you feeling alive 'cause i’m ready to die

You got the right to rise
You got the right to rise
You got the right to rise
You got the right to rise
Rise
