You might have seen me hangin' 'round
I never miss one night I could be on the town
I used to be another one like you
Always running home to that special one or two
And when I think of all the years of finding out
What I already knew
Now I spread myself around
And you can have three minutes too
'Cause I'm a hit single
Lookin' out for number one
I got a line or two that never fail
And every time you look around I'll be there on your tail
I'm nothing special but I don't give in
Before you know it I'll be there right underneath your skin
And if you think that being serious and smart
Gets you where you should be
You must be not only joking
But way too heavy for me
'Cause I'm a hit single
Goin' straight to number one
And when I die and go to pure pop heaven
The angels will gather around
And ask me for my whole life story
And ask for that fabulous sound
But I know they're gonna stop me
As I start going through every line
And say please not the whole damn album
Nobody has that much time
Please... Just the hit single
You gotta love that number one
