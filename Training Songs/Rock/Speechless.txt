Words fall like drops of rain
My lips are like clouds
I say so many things
Trying to figure You out
But as mercy opens my eyes
My words are stolen away
With this breathtaking view of Your grace

And I am speechless
I'm astonished and amazed
I am silenced by Your wondrous grace
You have saved me
You have raised me from the grave
And I am speechless in Your presence now
I'm astounded as I consider how
You have shown us
A love that leaves us speechless

So what kind of love could this be
That would trade heaven's throne for a cross
And to think You still celebrate
Over finding just one who was lost
And to know You rejoice over us
The God of this whole universe
It's a story that's too great for words

And we are speechless
We're astonished and amazed
We are silenced by Your wondrous grace
You have saved us
You have raised us from the grave
And we are speechless in Your presence now
We're astounded as we consider how
You have shown us
A love that leaves us speechless
We are speechless

Oh, how great is the love
The Father has lavished upon us
That we should be called
The sons and the daughters of God

And we are speechless
We are speechless
We're astonished and amazed
We are silenced by Your wondrous grace
You have saved us
You have raised us from the grave
And we are speechless in Your presence now
We're astounded as we consider how
You have shown us
A love that leaves us 
Shown us a love that leaves us
Astonished and amazed by the wonder of Your grace
We are speechless

Your love leaves us speechless
