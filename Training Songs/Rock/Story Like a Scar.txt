You tell me I've got better things to do but I'm all spent
Tally up the time that I've been waiting here for you
Haven't seen you in so long
I blink and then you're gone

Had a conversation with a friend, you're a big part
He's in that place with you that
I used to be in story like a scar
A novel?s worth so far that you'll write

Shouted the thing, I'm drowning in the drink
And I get lost in the memories
And so it seems all too common themes
You got lost, you got a way out

I had a dream the other night, we were good then
And you told me all about the better place you're in
I know you just too well
It?s hard for me to tell if you're lying

Shouted the thing, drowning in the drink
And I get lost in the memories
And so it seems all too common themes
You got lost, you got a way out

Shouted the thing, I'm drowning in the drink
You got lost, you got a way out
Shouted the thing, drowning in the drink
You got lost, you got a way out
