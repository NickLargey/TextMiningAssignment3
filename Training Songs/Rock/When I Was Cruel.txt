Did you talk your way out of this?
Did someone flip your switch?
Now there is only right or wrong,
Can you tell which is which?
But it was so much easier,
When I was cruel.

Why did you leave
Your happy home? 
Why did you travel far abroad,
So you could sleep with strangers?
You must have heard, 
Just how absurd
The words poured out of you,
You fraud.
I guess you don't know what pain is

So don't pretend you're innocent,
Do I look like your fool?
I guess you have forgotten, 
When I was cruel.

Oh, when I was cruel, and I could make you so unhappy.
Lonely cowards followed me like ghouls
And you liked me too
When I was cruel

oh you know you did

But if you should feel anything, 
A signal from within
Go back in your laboratory, 
And try to dial it in.
And if you should feel anything,
A signal from without
Abandon your dreams of vengeance,
So don't pretest your innocence, 
The truth is hard to judge
Perhaps you have forgetten when,
I had a grudge

Oh but I was cruel and I would make you very sorry
Lonely cowards followed me like ghouls
And you liked me too
When I was cruel

oh you know you did
