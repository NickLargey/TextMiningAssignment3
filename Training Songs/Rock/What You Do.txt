You cannot begin to imagine the state I was in
The first time you spoke to me, I felt my life starting again
And I haven't felt this way since I don't know when
I know you love her, I only wish that it were you
I'd do anything in the world to have you believe
That I only want you girl, I don't want sympathy

Oh, you don't even know what you do
(All I can think of is you)
Oh, all I can think of is you
(All I want is you)
All that I want in the world is to know that you're near
The sound of your voice is the only thing I want to hear
Oh baby, losing you should my only fear
Oh, you don't even know what you do
Oh, I've fallen in love with you

Only by holding you close could I hope to feel whole
And only your love girl, could help heal the hurt in my soul
There's nobody else who will do, there's no one at all

Oh, you don't even know what you do
(All I can think of is you)
Oh, I've fallen in love with you
(All I want is you)
Oh, it's easy to say when it's true
Oh, I've fallen in love with you
