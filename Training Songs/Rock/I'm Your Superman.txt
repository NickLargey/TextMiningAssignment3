Na, na, na, na, na
I'm your superman
Oh, yes I am

I may not be as fast as a shot from a gun
And stoppin' locomotives ain't my idea of fun
And I don't have the magic to fly through the air

I can feel it when you are there
And when you're near me, I'm like someone new
I even feel real bulletproof too

Na, na, na, na, na
I'm your superman
Oh, yes I am

I am not super strong, I have no super sight
I'm not afraid of being in kryptonite
And I don't have the magic to fly through the air

I can feel it when you are there
And when you're near me, I'm like someone new
I even feel real bulletproof too

Na, na, na, na, na
I'm your superman
Oh, yes I am
