If you believed, if you tried
It could be enough to know you were alive
If you knew the truth it couldn’t be denied
It would change the world enough that you might find

That the world goes round and around and around
And everybody walks on common ground
We gotta pull together if we’re gonna pull through
There’s a little bit of me in a little bit of you
The world goes round and around and round
Everybody feels a little upside down
No need to be afraid of anybody you see
There’s a little bit of you in a little bit of me
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah in a little bit of me
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah..... Nah nah

Is it on the skin is it in the love
The things about each other that we’re so scared of
You can shake your head you can change your mind
Either way you wake up inside yourself to find

That the world goes round and around and around
And everybody walks on common ground
We gotta pull together if we’re gonna pull through
There’s a little bit of me in a little bit of you
The world goes round and around and round
Everybody feels a little upside down
No need to be afraid of anybody you see
There’s a little bit of you in a little bit of me
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah in a little bit of me
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah..... Nah nah

Oh.... lean to your left or lean to your right
The corner of the room and every soul here tonight
Have a little bit of faith everyone will see
That all the good books in the world agree
There’s a little bit of you in a little bit of me

And the world goes round and around and around
And everybody walks on common ground
No need to be afraid of anybody you see
There’s a little bit of you oh in a little bit of me
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
In a little bit of me
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
In just a little bit of me
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Oh there’s a little bit of you in a little bit of me, in a little bit of me
Come on we’re gonna walk on common ground
Just a little bit of me
