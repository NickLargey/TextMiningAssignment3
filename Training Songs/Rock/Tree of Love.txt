Every night when the sun goes down and cool air with calm surrounds
The silent garden in which can be found the tree of love
Every night you can find me there with sweating palms and matted hair
And drops of blood dot the sand everywhere under the tree of love

And you can hear them whispering under the tree of love
And you can see them - under the tree of love can be found every saint and every sinner
As they paw the desert ground for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love

Some nights there are many there and murmurs fill the desert air
Odd and evens trying to make a pair under the tree of love
On and on as the darkness falls the wistful sound of the searchers calls
Are heard within and without the walls around the tree of love

And you can hear them talking under the tree of love
And you can see them - under the tree of love can be found every heel and every hero
As they scour the desert sands for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love

Last night, before the end, I found myself under the tree again
The branches break as the bones they bend under the tree of love

And you can hear them shouting under the tree of love
And you can see them - under the tree of love can be found every saint and every sinner
As they search the desert ground for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love
They paw the desert ground for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love
They scour the ground for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love

Under the tree of love you will find me waiting
