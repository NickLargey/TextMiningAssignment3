We're the punx

We're the fucking punx
We're few, but we are real

The way we fucking feel
This noise is for real
You know who we are
We're here til the end.

Spikey hair with soap
You don't like us at all

Up the fucking beers
The punx are fucking here
You know who we are
We're here til the end

Die hards
Die hards

Gime me street punk
Sound for hardcore punx
Oi! is our voice
Punk is the noise
You know who we are
We're here til the end

Hardcore punx for life
Unwanted by the media
Posers come and go
But we're still here
You know who we are
We're here til the end

Die hards
Die hards

We're the fucking punx
We're few, but we are real

The way we fucking feel
This noise is for real
You know who we are
We're here til the end.

Spikey hair with soap
You don't like us at all

Up the fucking beers
The punx are fucking here
You know who we are
We're here til the end

Die hards
Die hards

Hardcore punx for life
Unwanted by the media
Posers come and go
But we're still here
You know who we are
We're here til the end

Die hards
Die hards

We're the punx!
