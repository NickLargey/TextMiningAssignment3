Far off in the distance I can hear the bells
Inside the church, there stands a girl I knew so well
As I get closer I can feel the chill
She's changing her name from Laura to Sister Isabelle

Isabelle, can you hear the words I say?
Isabelle, can you hear me while a-frame?

I can still remember the night she said goodbye
She said we'll meet again someday in a place under the new sky
But why have I stopped singing? I no longer hear the bells
She's changed her name from Laura to Sister Isabelle

Isabelle, am I really, really gonna lose you?
Isabelle, does he need you more than I do?

Isabelle, am I really gonna lose you?
Isabelle, does he need you more than I do?

Isabelle, no, no, Isabelle
Isabelle, no, no, Isabelle
Isabelle, am I really gonna lose you?
