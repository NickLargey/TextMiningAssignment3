Walk on
Down the street
With your nose turned up at the people that you meet
With a smile
On your face
Just like you own the whole goddamn place

[Chorus]
You've got a thousand alibis
A thousand reasons why
But every single one is as transparent as the sky
You've got a thousand alibis
A thousand reasons why
But every single one comes back to burn you like the sun
Walk on

Baby from dixieland
Set the streets on fire
I ain't your babe I ain't your man
I'm a fire

Walk on
Down through the depths of hell
Little capricious lover
Lonely kiss & tell
Take that smile, every trace
I'm laying down my queen
I'm laying down my ace

[Chorus]

People come and people go before you even know
People come people go people go
