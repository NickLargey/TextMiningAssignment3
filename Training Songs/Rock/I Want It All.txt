Lord knows that I want it so bad
I let nobody stand in my way
Losing all the good that I've had
It seems like that's the price I must pay

I'm only finding out what it's all about
I want it all
I want it all

I know I'm not asking for much
Just happiness, love, money, and health
You think I'm asking too much
So I'll just take it all for myself

I'm only finding out what it's all about
I want it all
I want it all

I'm only finding out what it's all about
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
