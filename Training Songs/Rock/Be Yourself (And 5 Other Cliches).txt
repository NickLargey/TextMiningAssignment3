Be yourself and not somebody else
It might take some, a little effort and maybe just a little help
But you can figure it out
If not just do what everybody else does, oh

Keep it on the level
(If that's what I'm supposed to do)
Oh, I keep on the level
(If that's the thing they told to)
I keep on getting in trouble
If I try to take this side of the road

So here's your hey, hey, hey, here's you ho, ho, ho
I don't know where else to go
There's a really fine line between what's yours and what's mine
It's a line that I don't want to toe
I'm sick of being haunted by every cliche that I know

Keep it real whatever that means
Even if your so young you've never seen a limousine
Your gonna one day just remember never get in

And don't give up 'cause you know people are gonna care
If you just stop trying and accept every dare
And if you can't seem to make it
Maybe, maybe you just try failure

Oh, keep it on the level
(If that's what I'm supposed to do)
Oh, I keep on the level
(If that's the thing they told to)
Oh, I keep on getting in trouble
If I try to take this side of the road

So here's your hey, hey, hey, here's you ho, ho, ho
I don't know where else to go
There's a really fine line between what's yours and what's mine
It's a line that I don't want to toe, you know
I'm sick of being haunted by every cliche that I know

Here's your hey, hey, hey, here's you ho, ho, ho
I don't know where else to go
There's a really fine line between what's yours and what's mine
It's a line that I don't want to toe, you know

So here's your hey ,hey, hey, here's you ho, ho, ho
I don't know where else to go
There's a really fine line between what's yours and what's mine
It's a line that I don't want to toe, you know
I'm sick of being haunted by every cliche that I know, oh
