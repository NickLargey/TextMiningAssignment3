Tell me
What is a life?
A life without colors
Can you see them?
Have the years made us blind?
As a child
Living life´s imagination
You´d close your eyes
And all the colors went wild
Now the outlines been drawn
On an empty page
And I´ve opened my eyes

And you you you
You color me in
Turn me round when I´m wrong
You make me strong
You color me in

Have you ever stopped and listen to your heartbeat?
Did the tears make the colors start to fade?
If all the wrongs we ever did were not forgiven
Time would stop
And the world would turn to grey
You know I carry you with me
Night and day
Yeah you´ve opened my eyes

And you you you
You color me in
Turn me round when I´m wrong
You make me strong
You color me in
Yeah you you you
You color me in
You´re the blue skies above
You´re so easy to love
You color me in

Pictures of angels
Floating above
We all need
To be painted with love

And you you you
You color me in
Turn me round when I´m wrong
You make me strong
You color me in
And you you you
You color me in
You´re the blue skies above
Yeah you´re so easy to love
You color me in

All right

Give me blue skies
Give me the bright light
I need some color in my life (2x)

Give me blue skies
Give me the bright light
I want some color in my life
In my life
