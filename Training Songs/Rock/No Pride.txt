Slave labor working man
No pride in some one else's dreams
Maintain on a poor man's salary
Now there's got to be a better way
For you for me

[Chorus]
Don't call me the working class man
Said don't call me the working class

give your soul to your company
You ignore what's easy to see
You're disposable, they're inexposable
Where's the pride in that?

start with intentions to leave this life one day
Have a wife and a couple of kids in the blink of an eye you're old and gray
That way of life will never be for me
I'd rather live on the street and keep my dignity

[Chorus]
