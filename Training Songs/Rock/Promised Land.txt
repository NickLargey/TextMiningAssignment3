Where where is the promised land 
Where where is the promised land 
It can`t be found in Viet Nam 
It can`t be where the eagle has landed 
If we want peace for every man 
We`ve gotta make the world demand it 

Now I see the flag is flying 
We`ve got to help them stop the dying 
We must bring back the soldier boys 
We mustn`t let them die for nothing 
War`s a better game when played with toys 
Let`s change the game and let`s start loving 

Soldiers never fight alone 
There`s just as much fighting going on at home 
Protests, violence, marches 
It`s all going on at home 
Bring them all back home (repeat)
