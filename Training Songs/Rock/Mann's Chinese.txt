Gilded ghetto
Hollywood stained below
'Bout every street I know
About some girls from Tokyo
Can't believe they even care
So crowd around and put your hands down there
He's been dead almost thirty years
No I don't belong here
No I don't belong here

Never gonna bend and I'm never gonna break
Everybody fronts, everybody fakes
Never gonna stop, and I'm never gonna stay
Here at the Mann's Chinese
Oh, Mann's Chinese

Used to live right near
They built a bar called the New Frontier
With chartreuse drinks and atmosphere
They closed it up in the very same year
Then Batman II premiered
You could feel the riots in the air
All the natives sitting and sipping beer
And they're thinking
No we don't belong here
No we don't belong here

Never gonna bend and I'm never gonna break
Everybody fronts, everybody fakes
Never gonna stop, and I'm never gonna stay
Here at the Mann's Chinese
Oh, Mann's Chinese
Everynody watch, everybody wave
Boulevard of dreams, everything it seems
Shine and you believe
I've gotta get away, no I'm never gonna stay
Here at the Mann's Chinese
Oh, Mann's Chinese

Fredrick's burned down
There were mourners all around
Fear swept through the theater crowd
They're thinking
No, we don't belong here
No, we don't belong here

Never gonna bend and I'm never gonna break
Everybody fronts, everybody fakes
Never gonna stop, and I'm never gonna stay
Here at the Mann's Chinese
Oh, Mann's Chinese
Everybody watch, everybody wave
Boulevard of dreams, everything it seems
Shine and you believe
I've gotta get away, no I'm never gonna stay
Here at the Mann's Chinese
The Mann's Chinese
