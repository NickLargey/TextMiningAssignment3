Oh, I think I know the story
I've been hiding it for so long
Are you running away?
'cause I'm in love with you
There's nothing you can do
I'm in love with you

Why when we get halfway there
Why when we get halfway started
Why when we get halfway there
Do I feel it's so half-hearted?

(Make up your mind) making up your mind
(Better decide) you better decide this time
How can you call this loving?
You know it's all or nothing

I'm not afraid to tell the truth
I've been hiding it for so long
Oh, I think you already know
That I'm in love with you, with you

Why when we get halfway there
Why when we get halfway started
Why when we get halfway there
Do I feel it's so half-hearted?

(Make up your mind) making up your mind
(Better decide) you better decide this time
How can you call this loving?
You know it's all or nothing

Why when we get halfway there
Why when we get halfway started
Why when we get halfway there
Do I feel it's so half-hearted?

(Give me a sign) why don't you give me?
(Give me a line) why don't you believe me?
How can you call this loving?
You know it's all or nothing
Why when we get halfway there
Why when we get halfway there

(Make up your mind) making up your mind
(Better decide) you better decide this time
How can you call this loving?
You know it's all or nothing

(Make up your mind) why did you do it?
(Better decide) why can't you believe it?
How can you call this loving?
You know it's all or nothing
