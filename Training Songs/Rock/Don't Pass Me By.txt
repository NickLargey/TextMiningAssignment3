Well, I listen for your footsteps 
coming up the drive. 
Well, I listen for your footsteps 
but they don't arrive. 
Just a waiting for your knock, dear 
on my old front door. 
Well, I don't hear it, 
does it mean you don't love me anymore? 

Well, I hear the clock a'ticking, 
on the mantel shelf. 
Well, See the hands a'moving, 
but I'm by myself. 
Well, I wonder where you are tonight, 
and why I'm by myself. 
I don't see you, 
does it mean you don't love me anymore? 

Don't pass me by,
Don't make me cry,
Don't make me blue. 
'Cause you know darling, I love only you. 
You'll never know it hurt me so, 
How I hate to see you go. 
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry. 

I'm so sorry that I doubted you, 
I was so unfair. 
You were in a car crash, 
and you lost your hair. 
Well, You said that you would be late 
about an hour or two. 
Well "That's alright, Baby that's alright, 
I'm waiting to hear from you". 

Don't pass me by,
Don't make me cry,
Don't make me blue. 
'Cause you know darling, I love only you. 
You'll never know it hurt me so, 
How I hate to see you go. 
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry. 

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue. 
'Cause you know darling, I love only you. 
Now You know it hurt me so, 
How I hate to see you go. 
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry.
