There was a time a long long time ago
Chevy's and Levi's played on the radio
No cell phones just twenty thousand lights
Swayin' on a Saturday night alright

Can you imagine that slice of time
Rock 'n roll was young, people stood in line
To hear music that played into their lives
That you could carry 'til the day you died

Hey man sing me a song
When we were everyone
We were more than just a slice
Of American Pie

Have you read my blog today
Three hundred million little USA's
Your doorstep is just a click away
We'll get together one of these days

How can you be as nice as me
You're not from the same slice as me
Where do we go from here my friend
Is this the way our story ends

Hey man sing me a song
When we were everyone
We were more than just a slice
Of American Pie

Can't stop singin' along
Can you join in, come on
Are we more than just a slice
Of American pie

We're top down lovers, it's Saturday night
The band's roarin' and it feels so right
The moon's dancin' and the stars are free
I caught your heart on a summer's breeze

Whatever was or what's meant to be
Our melodies are memories

There was a time a long long time ago
Chevy's and Levi's played on the radio
No cell phones just twenty thousand lights
Swayin' on a Saturday night alright

Hey man sing me a song
When we were everyone
We were more than just a slice
Of American Pie

I can't stop singin' along
Can you join in, come on
Are we more than just a slice
Of American pie
(American pie)

We're more than a slice
We're more than a slice
We're more than just a slice
Of American pie
