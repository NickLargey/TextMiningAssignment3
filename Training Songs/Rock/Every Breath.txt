It sounds like this is nothing new
And that it hasn't been for a while
You wake up on the other side
And you strain to force a smile
The fairy tale inside your head
Has become your new best friend
But I can show you that I'll be there
Before the story ends

'Cause when I needed a place to hang my heart
You were there to wear it from the start
And with every breath of me
You'll be the only light I see

I'm racing to the finish line
Of a lifetime that's barely started
The peace of mind I left behind
I pray you'll keep in your perfect garden
You're waiting on a minute hand
And a countdown that lasts for days
But I'm here tell you
It won't be long before I'm here to stay

'Cause when I needed a place to hang my heart
You were there to wear it from the start
And with every breath of me
You'll be the only light I see

The weightlessness and a lack of rest
Away from you I'm in over my head

Even when it's dark before the dawn
I'll feel your grace and carry on
And with every breath of me
You'll be the only light I see

When I needed a place to hang my heart
You were there to wear it from the start
And with every breath of me
You'll be the only light I see

Even when it's dark before the dawn
I will feel your grace and carry on
And with every breath of me
You'll be the only light I see
The be the only light I see
