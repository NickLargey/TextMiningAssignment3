I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' round 
Hangin' up my highway shoes 
Lately when I walk they make a hollow sound 
And they carry me away from you 
Every night I lay my body down 
My empty arms just leave me blue 
So I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' 'round 
And find my way back home to you 

I have always been the travelin' kind 
A million miles behind me now 
I kept on followin' that thin white line 
But now I want to turn around 
I only lived to hear that highway sound 
High and lonesome - low and blue 
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' 'round 
And find my way back home to you 

So say goodbye to all my ramblin' pals 
Ol' Highway Dave and Southside Sue 
I don't believe they'll miss me anyhow 
What's one less wayward soul or two 
Down the road they'll pass the jug around 
And they'll sing them lonesome highway blues 
But me I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' 'round 
And find my way back home to you
