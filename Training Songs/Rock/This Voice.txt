This voice
Is it calling
Is it calling
It's your choice
She said
Take or let go
Is it calling
When you're all alone
In your own sweet home
Is it calling
This voice
Is it calling

I have to say
I choose get out of my way
Leave my ghost alone
Let me walk on by
Let me walk on by
Let me walk on by
Let me walk on by

This voice
It is calling
It is calling for me
If you still haven't heard it
You shouldn't ask for it
You should just leave it be
'Cause you're deaf until
The day for you it will
Be calling
This voice
It is calling
