If you ever think too much
Is not enough to get you off
If you ever get too close
To the edge then don't look off
'cause you never know when
You might fall down

Get in line
'Cause you may be up this time
So keep on waiting
Get in line
'Cause you're not the only one
So keep on waiting for your time to come

If it ever gets too rough
Don't give up just be tough
If you ever think you must
Join with them or get with us
Just be careful before
You give your trust

Get in line
'Cause you maybe be up this time
So keep on waiting
Get in line
'Cause you're not the only one
So keep on waiting for that day to come
