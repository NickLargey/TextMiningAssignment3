Can you still remember
How it seemed that we could live forever in a lovers dream?
And falling was the best part but now you know 
the things you cling to
Your heart can start to grow.

You, you're walking away.
I've been there now I know what to say I'm the king of
yesterday.

A silly little love song for myself.
It's all I ever do you know I shine the shell.
A pretty little picture, the face of you.
You were my setting sun and now you're every view.

You, you're walking away
I've been there now I know what to say
I'm the king of yesterday.

Why don't, why don't, why don't you stay?
Why don't you stay? why don't you stay? why don't you stay?

Take a little time, throw it on the line.
Let me believe that you believe in me.
Baby turn around, look at what I found.
You are the one that I want.

Take a little time, throw it on the line.
Let me believe that you believe in me.
Baby turn around, look at what I found.
You were the one that I wanted.

And someday I'll be over on my own.
Believing all the legends of the loves I've known

And seeing you in summer the way we were when you were seventeen
You know I much preferred you walking away.

I've been here, now I know what to say
I'm the king of yesterday.

Why don't, why don't, why don't you stay?
Why don't you stay? why don't you stay with me? stay.

Take a little time, throw it on the line.
Let me believe that you believe in me.
Baby turn around, look at what I found.
You are the one that I want.

Take a little time, throw it on the line.
Let me believe that you believe in me.
Baby turn around, look at what I found.
You were the one that I wanted.

You were the one that I wanted.

King of yesterday.
King of yesterday.
