Save me
I can't run this time
am I under a spell?
fighting for my life?
so far gone
can't turn it round
I feel buried alive
I am screaming out

Terror in your eyes, your heart is racing
for the innocence we lost will not return
we know we can't go on
but we're still holding on
don't let me be the one to drag you down

In the silence
in the lonely night
when you're frozen with fear
when you're paralyzed
too delicate
your fragile mind
it's so hard to stay
in love with life

Terror in your eyes, your heart is racing
for the innocence we lost will not return
we know we can't go on
but we're still holding on
don't let me be the one to drag you down

I was fighting at your side
a knowing partner in this crime
a beating heart, a distant star
we lost all we were fighting for
all the hurt I kept within
I blamed myself for everything
for all the regret that remains
for all the pain

Terror in your eyes, your heart is breaking
for the innocence we lost will not return
we know we can't go on
but we're still holding on
don't let me be the one to drag you down
to drag you down...
