Well, I'll wait till you listen 
I won't say a word 
To follow your instincts 
Just never worked for me 
Your silent but strong, (yeah, I'm playing that card) 
And your noticing nothing again 

Now I'm lying on the table 
With everything you said 
Keeping mind the way that it felt 
When the most I could do was to just blame myself 

(yeah, I'm playing that card) 
When the most I could do was to just blame myself 
And I know you know, everything 
I know you didn't mean it 
I know you didn't mean it 

I know you know, everything (drop everything) 
I know you didn't mean it (start it all over) 
I know you didn't mean it (remember more then you'd like to forget) 

So, we're talking forever 
And you almost feel better 
But, betters no excuse for tonight 
You see, it's never been enough 
Just to leave all you gave up 
But, its never good enough to feel right 

Now I'm lying on the table 
With everything you said 
It will all catch up eventually 
Well, it caught up and honestly 
The weight of my decisions 
Were impossible to hold 

They were never yours
They were never yours
Well I, know you know, everything 
I know you didn't mean it 
I know you didn't mean it 

I know you know, everything (drop everything) 
I know you didn't mean it (start it all over) 
I know you didn't meant it (remember more then you'd like to forget) 

Drop everything, start it all over 
Remember more then you'd like to forget [Repeat: x2]

Would you like to forget 
Would you like to forget 
Drop everything, start it all over 
Well, drop everything start it all over (would you like to forget) 
Drop everything start it all over 
Start it all

Well I, know you know, everything 
I know you didn't mean it 
I know you didn't mean it 

I know you know, everything (drop everything) 
I know you didn't mean it (start it all over) 
I know you didn't meant it (remember more then you'd like to forget) 

I know you know 
I know you know, you know, you know, you know
