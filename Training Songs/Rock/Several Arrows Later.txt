Orange streetlight picks up when the summer sun goes
On tops of buildings red remains
It's the differences in light that gets our minds, that gets our minds
Give waking up for never fading

And I walked up to you
Holding on to the rail I was not fine
My intentions proved
I thought I would go further
Several arrows later will be fine

I am listening
I'm hearing every single word
I see breath and sighs and changing minds
I told myself not to remind me of the things I could've been
I told myself not to remind me

And I walked up to you
Holding on to the rail I was not fine
My intentions proved
I thought I would go further
Several arrows later will be fine

You should not want to sound they like do
You should want to sound like you
You should not want to sound they like do

And I am listening
I'm hearing every single word
I see breath and sighs and changing minds
I told myself not to remind me of the things I could've been
I told myself not to remind me
