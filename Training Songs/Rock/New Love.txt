New love is calling me 
Old love has set me free 
Old love is just some tears I cried 
New love is walking by my side 
And it's so right, and it's so fine 
It's new love and it's mine, all mine 
I've been walking down the same old street 
Going nowhere, shuffling my feet 
The lonely nights never seemed to end 
There was just no reason to start again 
But now, new love is calling me 
Old love has set me free 
Old love is just some tears I cried 
New love is walking by my side 
And all I want, yes indeed 
It's new love and it's all I need 
She said "You need me, and I need you" 
And she knows how it feels, 'cause she's been there too 
She took my hand and the pain was gone 
She gave me hope and a brand new song 
New love is calling me 
Old love has set me free 
Old love is just some tears I cried 
New love is walking by my side 
New love is calling me 
Old love has set me free 
Old love is just a memory 
New love is calling me 
It's calling me 
It's calling me 
Calling me
