You better run 
from the devil's gun

the race is on, 
so you better run
from the devil's gun. 

Strange things happen 
If you stay 
The devil will 
Catch you anyway 
He'll seek you here
He'll seek you there
The devil will 
Seek you everywhere.

When he finds you, 
Soon find out 
the devil's fire 
Just won't go out 
He burns you up
from head to toe.
The devil's grip 
Just won't let go.
