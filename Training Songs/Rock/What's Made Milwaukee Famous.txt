It's late and she's waiting and I know I should go home 
But every time I start to leave they play another song 
Then someone buys another round and wherever drinks are free 
What's made Milwaukee famous has made a fool out of me 

Baby's begged me not to go so many times before 
She says love and happiness can't live behind those swinging doors 
Now's she's gone and I'm to blame to late I finally see 
What's made Milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me
