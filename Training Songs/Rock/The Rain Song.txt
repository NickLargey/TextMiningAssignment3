Well, I don't think about us much anymore
And frankly the topic has become a bore
And you don't come up much in my conversations
And I don't think about you on vacation.

Oh, but when it rains
When it rains
When it rains
That's when I remember
That's when I remember
I remember you
I remember you.

Well, I don't think about you when I'm sleeping
It doesn't even cross my dreamlike mind
And I don't think I see your face through the curtain
Hell, I don't even miss you half the time (half the time).

But when it rains
When it rains
When it rains
That's when I remember
That's when I remember
I remember you
Well, I remember you.

Rain, rain, go away
I'm doin' fine as long as you stay
Locked up inside your cloud of grey
Rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain (rain)
Rain, rain
Rain.

'cause when it rains
Well, when it rains
When it rains
Well, that's when I remember
Now that's when I remember
And I remember you
Yeah, I remember you.

That's when I remember (now I remember)
The only time I remember (now I remember)
Well, I remember you (now I remember).
