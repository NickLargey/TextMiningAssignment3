See them rolling around
Pledging their love to the ground
Here on the range I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds

See them rolling along
Pledging their love with a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds

I know when day is done
That a new world awaits at dawn
See them rolling along
Pledging their love with a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds

I know when day is done
That a new world awaits at dawn
See them rolling along
Pledging their love with a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
