Rolls Royce, a golden voice 
Money so you make the choice
Of buying things for all the boys
Is this what you want?
Does it make you happy?
Does it make you feel good?

Mohair suits and cowboy boots
And plastic troops with suns that shoot
A lady with whom you know you can't take brutes
Is this what you want?
And does it make you happy?
Does it make you feel good?

Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?
Apple pie and ice cream
Do you treat your momma mean?

Does it make you happy?
Does it make you happy?
Does it make you happy?

Cigarettes and nickel bets
And knowledge that your head forgets
Like how old or high is Everest
Is this what you want?
And does it make you happy?
And does it make you feel good?

Hippy clothes and painted toes
And talking to the guy who knows
Who sticks a flower up your nose
And he tells you that you reap just what you sow

Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?
Does it make you feel good?
