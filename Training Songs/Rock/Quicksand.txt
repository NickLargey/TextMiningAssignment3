Your sweet love is like a quicksand,
A pullin' me under, and I wonder,
How deep does it go,
You know the sky is closin' up above me,
Everytime you touch me woman,
I'm like a tiger prowlin' in the moonlight
Quicksand, quicksand a pullin' me under;
Sometimes a love takes a funny turn around
Can make a paradise out of flat champagne,
A but once the party's started,
Tell me who can complain;
Quicksand, pulling me under
For love will find you,
Find you walkin' on the shore,
Inside the wind it calls out to you,
A longing melody pledges my soul to love,
To live in love for love,
To stay in love for love, alone
