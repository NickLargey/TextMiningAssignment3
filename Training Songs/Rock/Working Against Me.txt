I took my time
And whatever else I could find
I didn't care at the time
I've got it all planned
I'm gonna mark out my land
I've drawn some lines in the sand
I thought time would change things
I thought that things would change
I thought you thought I think you thought
But everything is the same
I try to stay between your world and mine
But that's a crooked line
And I don't wanna look at you
And I don't wanna have to think
I'll blame the captain and the crew
'cause they said it wouldn't sink
They said it wouldn't sink
My legs won't hold me up
Your heart is pounding in my head
My mouth seems to be working against me
I don't wanna look at you
And I don't wanna have to think
I'll blame the captain and the crew
'cause they said it wouldn't sink
They said it wouldn't sink
My legs won't hold me up
Your heart is pounding in my head
My mouth seems to be
My legs won't hold me up
Your heart is pounding in my head
My mouth seems to be working against me
