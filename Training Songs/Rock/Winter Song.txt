When the summer fled past my window
And autumn's chill was in the air
There's a special kind of lonesome
'Round that ending time of year

When the leaves fell
And they drifted 'neath the trees
That soon were bare
I felt that wind blow ever colder
And suddenly you were there

We laughed and scuffled
While the snow fell
And the cold gave your cheeks a glow
And in your arms come evening
A kind of peace I know

Often I'd wake at midnight
Mid some icy winter storm
But then I would find you beside me
And you made the night seem so warm

Now I go my way, you go your way
Now that the winter's come and gone
But somehow with the springtime
Your golden warmth still lingers on
