You called me up last night in tears
And said you missed me after all these years
But I've been waiting here so long
I've gotten over it since you've been gone

You called me late last night again
And said you're finished with your new boyfriend
Asked if you could come back home
So sorry that you left me all alone

Well, say you love me, you love me again
But if you love me, where have you been?
You say you need me more than anyone else
Well, go to hell, where have you been?

You showed up at my door today
And said my friend why do you push me away
Yeah, life with him was just so dull
But what we had was something wonderful

Well, say you love me, you love me again
But if you love me, where have you been?
You say you need me more than anyone else
Well, go to hell, where have you been?

No way, you wish, I don't need this
What makes you think I?d ever want you again?
Yeah right, as if, I don't need this
What makes you think I?d ever want you again, again?

You called me late last night again
You said you've finished with your new boyfriend
Asked if you could come back home
So sorry that you left me all alone

Well, you say you love me, love me again
But if you love me, where have you been?
You say you need me more than anyone else
Well, go to hell, where have you been?

You say you love me, you love me again
But if you love me, where have you been?
And if you love me, where have you been?
And if you love me, where have you been?
And if you love me, where have you been?
