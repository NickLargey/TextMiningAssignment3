I guess I'm traveling, my last mile
Don't feel like, I've got a place to go
Just been here thinkin', if I got somethin' in this life to show

Chorus-
But I go through life the best way
And when people ask me how I know
I just tell them my Jesus, told me so
I just tell them my Jesus, told me so

You hear a lot of stories
About the life you're supposed to live
All the sins you've done
The good Lord will forgive

Chorus

Maybe I'm wrong
Nobody knows for sure
But I live my life the old gospel way

Well I guess, I'll soon be dying
Just like a river, somewhere it stops to flow
But I know I'm right about life
And when people ask me how I know
I just tell them my Jesus, told me so
I just tell them my Jesus, told me so

I just tell them my Jesus, told me so
He's the only one who really knows
I just tell them my Jesus, told me so
He's the only one who really knows
I just tell them my Jesus, told me so
I'm gonna look 'em in the eye
And tell 'em Lord my Jesus told me so
