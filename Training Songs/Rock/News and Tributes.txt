Cut down in their prime
In silence, on that day
February 58, they got what they need
From Belgrade and back home to sleep

More than a name, to millions
What could have been changed
By all the boys leaving Munich on that day
The snow came and sent them to sleep

[Chorus:]
(This, fall, was, greater than them all)
News and tributes come leaking (in)
As all eyes turn to Rome
I forgotten the sadness (feel)
Voices turn us towards

Cut down in their prime
In silence, on that day
February 58, they got what they need
From Belgrade and back home to sleep

[Chorus]

(This, fall, was, greater than them all)
News and tributes come leaking (in)
As all eyes turn to Rome,
I forgotten the sadness (feel),
Voices turn us towards.
They're still singing despite the (years)
Sending them back into Rome,
There's a ringing in the (ears),
That lasts them here to war.

News and tributes,
(Lick it in
Lick it in,
Lick it in)
