I won't bother asking what you've done
But the rumors all point to something going on
See the past is the past and I'm not gonna dwell
But I better not catch you with someone else

So I'll put it to you once but never again (Swear)
If you want to be a lover if you want to be a friend (Swear)
Then take five fingers and put it to your heart (Swear)

S.W.E.A.R.

Hand over heart and swear that you love me
Swear that you need me

Gotta get a judge and jury Bible in your hand
Gotta tell the whole truth
Nothing less than that boy

(Swear) That you love me
(Swear) That you need me
(Swear) That you want me
(Swear) Tell the truth
Hand over heart and
Swear that you love me
Swear that you need me

Swear

(Swear) That you love me
(Swear) That you need me
(Swear) That you want me
(Swear) Tell the truth
Hand over heart and
Swear that you love me
Swear that you want me

I won't bother asking what you've done
But the rumors all point to something going on
See the past is the past and I'm not gonna dwell
But I better never catch you with someone else

For I'll put it to you once but never again
If you want to be a lover if you want to be a friend
Then take five fingers and put it to your heart

S.W.E.A.R. (Don't lie)

(Swear) Do I need a judge and jury
(Swear) With a Bible in your hand
(Swear) To make you tell the whole truth
(Swear) Nothing less than that

(Swear) Should I strap a lie detector
(Swear) To your heart to your heart to your heart
(Swear) Can I make you tell the whole truth
(Swear) Cross your heart cross your heart cross your heart
(Swear) That you want me
(Swear) That you need me
(Swear) That you love me
(Swear) Tell the truth tell the truth tell the truth don't lie
