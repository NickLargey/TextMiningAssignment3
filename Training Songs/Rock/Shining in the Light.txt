Big boat stealing through the darkness
Will you bring me to my love
Will you bring me to my only love
In the night the light of oneness
And the one light guides you home
And the keeper turns his cards alone

From this shore my memory wanders
And I dance upon the sea
Can I dance with you upon the sea
Oh, I love your brown-eyed madness
And your beauty was exposed
Now your memory's clinging to my clothes

Shining in the light
Shining in the light

Shining in the light
Shining in the light

Shining in the light
Shining in the light

Shining in the light
Shining in the light

Ho ho
Ho ho
Oh ho

Shining in the light
Shining in the light

Oh ho
Shine, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh ho
Oh oh ho ho
