It's not the pain I'm used to it
I'ts feeling like I'm already dead
I see from the ceiling a misty spirit
Rising from a place in my head

And I never even get to go down
Down in flames

I said friend you have a life to see
Why do you scare me so?
All the suffering's a mystery to me
I can't even pretend to know

So you'll never even get to go down
Down in flames

We had plans to explore the stars
Be rejected by stage door guards
Mining for gold as the time unreels
Not stifling behind suburban wheels
Not stifling behind suburban wheels

The plan was too burn up when the air was clear
We'd all wear our visors down
An arcwelder spark in the atmosphere
Not this man-sized hole in the ground

Now your father's face is frozen between anger and tears
Your mother's hair's amazingly gray
And I'm seeing these friends for the first time in years
It's icicle reunion day

And you never even got to go down
Down in flames
You never even got to go down
Down in flames.
