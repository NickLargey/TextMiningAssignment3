Going by the riot
Call the rest a stone
Leading to the isle
I don't wanna go

Nothing really matters
Even life or death
Meeting with the man
To feel the dragons breath

Where is the future?
There is no past
Only the present
And will it last?

Greed is the product
Of the fruitful days
Brother have no worries
Captain Adler's case

Lucifer beside me
We are holding hands
I don't need to travel
[Unverified] across the land

Oh Lucifer, please take my hand
Oh Lucifer gonna take my hand
(Yup)
