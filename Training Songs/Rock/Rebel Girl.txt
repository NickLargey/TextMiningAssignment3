Out on the edge of night 
In any city you can name 
There rides the rebel girl 
The wild one no-one dared to tame 
And the light in her eyes is a fire 
Have you seen her 
The rebel girl in action in the city 
At night you hear her call 
Oooh rebel girl 
Don't try to take her in 
She says she runs her life alone 
She wants you to believe 
A rebel's heart is made of stone 
And the light in her eyes is desire 
Have you seen her 
The rebel girl in action in the city 
At night you hear her call 
Oooh rebel girl so lonely and so pretty 
Bringing out the rebel in us all 
Oooh girl 
It's a lonely world, for a rebel girl 
So far from home, she's all alone 
In her rebel world 
Oh, have you seen her 
The rebel girl in action in the city 
At night you hear her call 
Oooh the rebel girl so lonely and so pretty 
Bringing out the rebel in us all 
Oooh girl 
She's just a rebel girl (have you seen her) 
She's just a rebel girl (have you seen her) 
She's just a rebel girl (have you seen her) 
She's just a rebel girl (have you seen her) 
She's just a rebel girl (have you seen her)
