I'm trying to find a way 
So I can keep on searchin' for my own space 
Hoping to see the signs I see you there, you there standin' 
Holding an open door 
Wish I could walk on past it, I want more 
Hoping to see the right way 
Saying something so I know where the end is
With or without this, feels like it's all just a game 
You're standing where I see a solution, you are the problem 
Should I go or stay? 
Trying to find a way 
So I can move my heart 
And walk past open doors 
Saying something so I know where the end is
With or without the effect of a casualty 
You're standing where I see a solution, am I the problem? 
Should I go or stay? 
Yes I'm trying to find a way 
So I can keep on searching for my own space 
Hoping to see the signs 
I see you there, you there standin' 
Holding an open door 
Wish I could walk on past it, I want more 
Hoping to see the signs 
Hoping to feel the right way 
This time I swear, I'm gonna speak my mind 
I would hold it, I could just pretend 
This time I swear, I'm gonna speak my mind 
I would hold it, I could just pretend 
This time I swear, I'm gonna speak my mind 
I just wanna speak my mind 
I just wanna speak my, mind 
Trying to find a way 
So I can keep on searching for my own space 
Hoping to see the signs 
I see you there standin', was it worth standing? 

I see too many open doors 
Wish I could walk on past it, but I want more 
Hoping to see the right way Wanting to find the way 
'Cause I'm trying to find my way
