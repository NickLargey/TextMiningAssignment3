Wake up in the morning, glad to be alive
My heart's on fire and I'm shaking
All I want is a little peace and quiet
Stop me from going crazy yeah
Stumble to the kitchen
Flashin' back on last night
Gotta get to work, I'll never make it
I was hungry for action
I saw her standing there
Looking like a bomb in a basement, yeah
She said: Hey there stranger, want to walk into my life?
Treat a woman right, get in on tonight
Do you want to?
And I want and I want you to give it
Give it all you got, give it all it takes
Give it all you got and don't fake it
Anything you want, I never get enough
Give it all you got
And Joe you better stop all you're thinkin'
Stop thinking 'bout tomorrow tonight
Joe, you better stop all your dyingÂ 
Stop dying to get home alive
Faster than a bullet, hotter than a gun
Like a shootin' star, I've been chasin'
I was ripping off her jacket, magic in my hands
She told me to relax and embrace her, Yeah
She said: Cool it little sinner
Got a big appetite, treat a woman right
Never get enough of your never ending love
