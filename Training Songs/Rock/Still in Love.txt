Perfectly alone 
For the lady in waiting
And it's just another day 
In the game of separating
It's a quarter after midnight
And I'm half-past-out-of reason
So here I go again, here I go again 
Coming around for more

[Chorus]
You know that I'm Still In Love with you
And I'm coming around for more
You know that I'm Still In Love with you
And I'm coming around for more
You know that I'm Still In Love with you
Just like the way it used to be

Picture us alone
And it don't take much to please me
If you promise not to tell
We could take it nice and easy
It's a quarter after midnight
And I'm half-past-out-of reason
So here I go again... here I go again 
Coming around for more

[Chorus]

It's been so long
We'll have a rendezvous,
I'll be alone with you until the feeling starts to rise
Still in love
And when the lights are low,
We're gonna rodeo and take it oh so slow
