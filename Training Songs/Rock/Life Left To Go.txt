Oh yeah, oh yeah

Sometimes the edge serves
As more than a friend
Than you thought it would be
And the pages you write
In your journal each night
Are your only release

And the mask you put on
It?s like words in a song
But there's more to be seen
And the failures you see
Don't seem failures to me here at all

Oh, I'm begging you, no
There's more life left to go
Oh, I'm begging you, please
?Cause I don't want you to leave

Alone as you walk
Through a crowd and it?s awkward
Like nobody sees
And you can't help but wonder
Would anyone come after you
If you'd leave

So a pain grows inside
And a fear comes alive
Like you'll never be free
But there's no pain you feel
That I know love can't heal here at all

Oh, I'm begging you, no
There's more life left to go
Oh, I'm begging you, please
?Cause I, I don't want you to leave me

To leave me here on my own
There's nothing to run from
Oh, there's nothing but fear inside you
Oh, I just hope I can find you
And tell you that I know you'll smile again

Oh, I'm begging you, no
More life left to go
Oh, I'm begging you, please
?Cause I don't want you to leave
