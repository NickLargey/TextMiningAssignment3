Bad habits
Cheating at exams
Bad habits
Never washing hands
Bad habits
Smacking in their bugs
Bad habits
I won't do it again, uh oh
Uh oh

Bad habits
Buying dirty mags
Bad habits
Dodging in to flicks
Bad habits
Groping in the dark
Bad habits
I won't do it again, uh oh
Uh oh

All these things
They lower my resistance
Don't think I can
Stay the distance
All these things they say are bad
They feel so good to me, you know
I just don't think I can
Resist 'em

Bad habits
Staying out all night

Bad habits
Shouting at the kids
Bad habits
Beating up their wives
Bad habits
I won't do it again, uh oh
Uh oh

I won't do it again
I won't do it again
I won't do it again
I won't do it again

Bad habits
Thieving from the poor
Bad habits
Robbing from the banks
Bad habits
Shooting at the law.
Bad habits
I won't do it again, uh oh
Uh oh

I won't do it again, uh oh.
Uh oh
Bad habits
I won't do it again, uh oh
Uh oh
Bad habits
Never again
