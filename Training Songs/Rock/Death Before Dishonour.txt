With the rising of the morning sun
We will remember them
At the going down of the evening sun
We shall remember them
Death before dishonour
Death before dishonour
Through ignorance and fear
Once a year we will bow our heads
A two minute silence for the military dead
Bugles blow and wreaths are lain
Marching columns with banners stained
Death before dishonour
Death before dishonour
Through ignorance and fear
