Fast as light our jets were burnin'
On the road a distant siren song
Hands upon my engines growin'
Vincent's deep throat breathin' out so strong
I can hold her, can you roll her

Ride her like there's no tomorrow
Siren's song sure is growin' stronger
Shadow reached a high note
And in the distance [electric lights]++++ no longer

I can hold her, can you roll her
I can hold her, can you roll her
I can hold her, can you roll her

Fast as light our jets were burnin'
On the road a distant siren song
Hands upon my engines growin'
Vincent's deep throat breathin' out so strong
I can hold her, can you roll her

I can hold her, can you roll her
I can hold her, can you roll her
I can hold her, can you roll her
I can hold her, can you roll her
