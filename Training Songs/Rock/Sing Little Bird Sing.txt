Sing, little bird sing
Carry the song, like it was your own
Smile, little bird, grin
No one along will be alone

I'll sing you a song
That's traveled through time for ten thousand years
And if I'm not wrong
It's your song and mine, may I dry your tears?

I hasten to please
Tell me I may sing me one time
I fall to my knees
Singing your song and offering mine

I'll stay to your side
And travel by night to far away sands
I'll cast off my pride
With one song inside, a heart in my hands

Sing, little bird sing
Light up the sky the way that you do
I won't say a word
Plead through my eyes, I'm pleading with you

I'll sing you a song
That's traveled through time for ten thousand years
And if I'm that wrong
It's your song and mine and I'll dry your tears
