Yeah

I've made my mistakes
I've seen my heart cave in
I got my scars
I've been to hell and back again

Born for the blue skies
We'll survive the rain
Born for the sunrise
We'll survive the pain

[Chorus]
We're singing
Hey, you can't count us out
We've been running up against the crowd
Yeah, we are the dark horses
We're singingâ€¦
Wait! It's not over now
We've been down but we've never been out
Yeah, we are the dark horses

We found the way out
The city takes everything it can
But outside the crowds
I can feel my lungs again

Born for the blue skies
We'll survive the rain
Born for the sunrise
We'll survive the pain

[Chorus]

We're singing
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la.

Yeah!

Born for the blue skies
Born for the blue skies
Born for the sunrise
We'll survive the pain

[Chorus]
We're singing
Hey, you can't count us out
We've been running up against the crowd
Yeah, we are the dark horses
We're singing
Wait, don't care what they say
We know we'll find a way
Yeah! We are the Dark Horses

Yeah!

Laa la-la-la-la-laa
Laa la-la-la-la-laa

Keep running for the dark horses
Hope makes the blood change courses
Keep running for dark horses
Stand up for the dark horses
Keep running for the dark horses
Hope makes the blood change courses
