Doctor feelgood
Sleepin' on a concrete bench
Can I get a witness?
Miss South Carolina nineteen seventy-five,
Somebody stole your crown
You were sleeping in your happy home,
When you woke up baby,
Your life had come and gone
Now you're mystified,
Standing with the rest of us
Who used to rule the world

Brother Lovejoy
Rappin' up a blue streak
Can I get a witness?
Miss Hurricane can't keep your hands still
Long enough to count your change
You were wrapped up in your daily grind,
The cost of living
It didn't even cross your mind
Now you're mystified,
Standing with the rest of us
Who used to rule the world

Mister Blueprint
Used to have it figured out
Now you can't find your car
Miss Cocktail-Dress
Standing at the bathroom sink
Looking for a back way out
You can't believe your very eyes
Everything that you were counting on
Was nothing but a pack of lies
Now you're mystified,
Standing with the rest of us
Who used to rule the world

Now you're mystified,
Standing with the rest of us
Who used to rule, used to rule,
Used to rule the world
