This is the tale I'm afraids unfolding
Mini earthquakes and a gun unloading
Volleys of thoughts into the back of my brain
Taking me over like rock cocaine
I don't do junk but I'm familiar with the feeling
The ghosts are so close I can hear them breathing
Spitting their bile down the back of my throat
Ain't you ever wondered why they call it dope?
I used to run around with a head like soup can
Like a train, popping pills like Pac-Man
But beneath my skin and along my spine
I could feel a fleet of cockroaches prying
Waiting for me to take my first hit
I knew right then that I didn't need that shit
Like a window reflecting time
Livin' on a planet of my own design

Yeah, whoah,
I can feel the sugarcane flow,
Every time I change my mind.
Hear all the people say
Yeah, whoah,
I can feel the sugarcane flow,
Every time I change my mind.
Hear all the people say

It's like the man said, you gotta move on up
You don't try to get high. You're gonna come unstuck
Like knocked down skittles on a pinball game
You gotta spread your mind. You know what I'm saying
Beneath the shadow of a moth you hide
When the troubles that you face become magnified
You can take your life or you can take religion
But who wants to be one of God's carrier pigeons
Speading the message like Grandmaster flash?
Or some devil on a trolley dash
Collecting souls and picking up receipts
You never taste the poison when the sugar's so sweet
And you're praying the game remains the same
Every time you dip a spoon into your eggcup brain
When the clock dtrikes one, put out the streamers
It's gonna be a good day for the dreamers

Yeah, whoah,
I can feel the sugarcane flow,
Every time I change my mind.
Hear all the people say
Yeah, whoah,
I can feel the sugarcane flow,
Every time I change my mind.
Hear all the people say

Sweet sugar cane,
In on my brain
I don't want to, I don't want to
Go insane
Sweet sugar cane,
In on my brain
I don't want to, I don't want to
Go insane
Sweet sugar cane,
In on my brain
I don't want to, I don't want to
Go insane
Sweet sugar cane,
In on my brain
I don't want to, I don't want to
Go insane, No

Third verse same as the first
Only this time the sugar hits you in reverse
Spins you around, puts you in a dream
Turns your mind into an elephant balloon machine
There's a trap set but you shot right through it
Quicker than the human eye like hong kong phooey
You forget about the funk that you've been dragged into
Surfin' a high you suck the last glass splinter
Out of your heart and it's a brand new summer
No longer are you just another young blade runner
You're a player in a game that requires no pieces
Rules are just restrictions that the state releases
As the world spins off it's hinge
We're all too busy analyzing things
But like I said before I know How I'm defined
I'm livin' on a planet of my own design

Yeah, whoah,
I can feel the sugarcane flow,
Every time I change my mind.
Hear all the people say
Yeah, whoah,
I can feel the sugarcane flow,
Every time I change my mind.
Hear all the people say
