Do you believe
The lies
You feel inside
Do you embrace
Your hate
Your love
Your fate
Or do you watch them
Disappear from view?
Or collide
With you
Can you hear
My voice
Do you know what I mean?

I'm bound by my insecurities

Swallow the lies
I'm the one to blame
Having no voice left to choose
Am I so blind, feeling justified
When I'm alone and confused
I start to believe
The more that I see
I know that it's true
This is the modern way of living with the truth

I gotta move on
To find
What's left
Behind
Where is my god 
Who cares
I'm beyond
You're repair
I can't stop this
Do you know what I mean?

Bound by my insecurities

Swallow the lies
I'm the one to blame
Having no voice left to choose
Am I so blind, feeling justified
When I'm alone and confused
I start to believe
The more that I see
I know that it's true
This is the modern way of living with the truth

Open your eyes and
Throw your arms around me
I need the right not to fight
To breathe
Open your eyes and
Throw your arms around me
But don't wait, don't wait
Don't wait, don't throw it away

Swallow the lies
I'm the one to blame
Having no voice left to choose
Am I so blind, feeling justified
When I'm alone and confused

Swallow the lies
I'm the one to blame
Having no voice left to choose
I start to believe
The more that I see
I know that it's true
This is the modern way of living with the truth
