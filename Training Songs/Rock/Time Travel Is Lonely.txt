Hold on keep it together
Hold on
No one, no one has ever
Made it so far in time
No one x5
Not no one
Knows what happens next

Because time travel is lonely
Lonely

Listen, wear your headphones
And I'll whisper you the code
Of a helper application
That you can download
It's called Remember
Casue no one
No one x4
Knows what happens next

Because time travel is lonely
Lonely
