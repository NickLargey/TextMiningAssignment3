Let me tell you 'bout a dream
Dream
You know I saw her in a dream

Oh, St. Charles sings, sings about love
St. Charles, tell me tonight
Won't you tell me 'bout love?
You know I saw her in a dream

There was China in her eyes
In a silk and velvet disguise
She was movin' like a lady
Lookin' like a dragon princess

She was walkin', walkin' by the river
Rollin' in a rhythm of love
I never felt like this before
I'll never stop, I just want more

Oh, St. Charles sings, sings about love
St. Charles, tell me tonight
Won't you tell me 'bout love?
You know I saw her in a dream

I was Shanghaied by her way
Hypnotized by the things she would say
In the moonlight on the water
We were like lovers in another lifetime

Is it only a vision?
It feels like a prison
Just the spell of a demon
And I can't get away

Oh, St. Charles sings, sings about love
St. Charles, tell me tonight
Won't you tell me 'bout love
Please tell me 'bout love
Saw her in a dream

Please tell me 'bout love
I know I saw her in a dream
Dream

Let me take you to another place
Another time, another world of people dancin' in rhyme
Dance in the air, six-fingered webbed, fair as the air

She is the storm bringer, yeah
Storm changer, yeah

Tie yourself down to the main mast
Tie yourself down to the main mast
Like Ulysses in the water storm
Winds comin' down the main line

Tie yourself down to the main mast
Tie it down with love
Tie it down with love

Don't you feel it comin' stormin'?
I feel it coming stormin'
I can feel it now, stormin'
Don't you feel it comin' stormin'?

Stormin'
Stormin'
Stormin'
Stormin'

Stormin'
Stormin'
Stormin'
Stormin'

Stormin'
Stormin'
Stormin'
