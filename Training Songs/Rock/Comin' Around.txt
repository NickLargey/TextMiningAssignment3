You told a lie. You make up stories. You say wake up, I'm stuck. I'm comin' around. I'm on fire. 
You're so alive. You got the good juice. I feel alright, up-tight. I'm comin' around. I'm in my mode. I'm comin around. 
I'm goin' 'round and 'round and I'm comin' around. You're goin' 'round and 'round and you're comin' around. I gotta feel you right now; comin' around. I'm on fire. I'm comin' around. I'm on fire. 
I got nothin' to lose. There's so much at stake, why can't I make you feel used? I see your two eyes. I need a torchlight. They say I'm on, I'm off. I got the game the ladies all want. You're comin' around. 
You're goin' 'round and 'round and you're comin' around. I'm goin' 'round and 'round and I'm comin' around. I gotta feel you right now; comin' around. I'm on fire. I'm comin' around. 
It's somethin' within. I can tell you I like good nite; a kiss and a simple goodbye. 
{Spoken}: How many of you have ever been all alone and you're waitin' for that call? I just get so hot, you know? You're so alive. You got the good juice. 
I feel alright. I'm all up-tight. I'm comin' around. I'm in my mode. 
I FEEL YOU BABY WHEN YOU'RE SO ALIVE. Comin' around. Comin' around. I gotta feel you right now. I'm on fire. I'm comin' around. I feel alright. I'm all up-tight. I'm waitin'. I-I want you, I need you, I gotta have you. You're so alive. You're so alive. You're so alive. 
A-A-round, A-A-round. A-A-round, A-A-round. I feel you baby. I'm comin' around. I feel you. I'm comin' around. I'm on fire
