Mosey on down to the movies and bars
Beating alone ain’t no streetfightning star
Kissin’ alone in the back of my car
Imagination the heat in your arms

Drinking alone in the dancehall at night
Dancing alone with your shadow so tight
Some say we we are the dirtiest couple in town but
I feel so lonely with you all around
Yes we’re back in this town but
I feel so empty with you by my side

When I’m with you I’m all alone
When I’m with you I’m all alone
When I’m with you I’m all alone
Alone again on my own

Crying my tears out I wanna go home
Don’t wanna be with you I don’t wanna be alone
Don’t wanna hit the streets
I don’t wanna play no game
Don’t wanna have your number
I don’t wanna have your name
Trying to speed up the verge of surprise
Searchin’ for greed in the look of your eyes
They say we we are the dirtiest couple in town but
I feel so lonely with you all around
Yes we’re back in this town but
I feel so empty with you by my side

When I’m with you I’m all alone
When I’m with you I’m all alone
When I’m with you I’m all alone
Alone again on my own

Alone together together alone
Alone forever forever alone
Alone together together alone
Alone again on my own when I’m with you I’m all alone
