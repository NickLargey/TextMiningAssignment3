If you knew
What I know
Would you try?
Before your time
Has run on you
And worn you down

Would you know
What you desire
In your heart?

If you knew
What I know
Would you try?

Is there time?
Is there time?
To follow just one desire?

Is there time?
Is there time
To follow your heart?

Dress your wounds
Test your strength
Face the night

Crave the touch
Feel the pain
Know the signs

Is there truth
In your pain?
You decide

If you knew
What I know
Would you try?

Is there time?
Is there time?
To follow just one desire?

Is there time?
Is there time
To follow your heart?

As we lie
In the shade
Of poison trees

Are we as safe
As we let
Ourselves believe?
