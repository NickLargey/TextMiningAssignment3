I guess you could say I'm a little afraid 
What if you go away? I've seen it before  
I've been here before. 
If I have to love myself  tell me how to love myself. 
What's there to love about myself?
I just wasn't to see that as a person you want me. 
But I'm feeling the pain of all these bags in the way  
And I'm thinking you're just gonna run away  
And I can't catch you. 

I guess I would say that I want you to stay 
'Cause you have this strange knack, 
Adds a glow to my black as you chase it all away. 
And I hope that you can see I will someday leave these things. 
I am waiting to be free. 
But I'm feeling the pain of all these bags in the way, 
And I'm thinking you're just gonna run away, 
And I can't catch you. 
Oh, I want to catch you.
