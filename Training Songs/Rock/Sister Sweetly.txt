Ain't no getting up again,
She gonna bring you down.
Love gone up and jump again,
Turn it all around.
I'm goin' to the liquor store, 
To get some peace of mind.
Something I ain't done before, 
I can't seem to find.

Hold me please, Sister Sweetly,
Give to me, a place in paradise.
Hold me please, Sister Sweetly,
And never never leave me.
Sister I am suffering, a single desire.
Hell is the shadow cast from a soul on fire.

Hold me please, Sister Sweetly,
Give to me, a place in paradise.
Hold me please, Sister Sweetly,
And never never leave me.
