I'll bite the hand that feeds the pain
I'll lay my life down for love
I lost the truth, I lost my way
But I am looking for it
Oh I am looking for it now
I am looking for it
Oh I am looking for myself
A savior sent to save the world
An angel has no armor
Now torn and bent, no wings unfurl
We are looking for it
We need to find but one thing good
And under every star (I'm finding Heaven)
In every breath of air (I'm finding Heaven)

In everything I have (I'm finding Heaven)
In everything I am... oh
The world is big, the world is bad
But I will find the beauty
I see a vision in my head
I am looking for it
Oh I am looking for it
Oh I am looking for myself
I am looking for it
I'm looking for it now
I am looking for it
Oh I am looking for it now
Oh I am looking for myself
