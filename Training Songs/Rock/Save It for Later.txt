"So you're thinkin' about tomorrow
and all those simple things you think you might like
but you've been sipping in the daylight, you see
well I've been trying to keep things light

So you're looking for approval
to do those stupid things your father might like
well you might kill youself to get it, you see
but it might never make things right
it just might leave you more uptight...

And all the things within the world
and all the boys and all the girls
who never seem to get enough
they save it for later, you see
All the saints and all the freaks and all the strange philosophies
the novelties and memories
they save it for later you see,
they save it for later you see...

So now you're looking for some revelation
but you're still lying there, still in your bed
well I've been spilling with emotions
but have you heard a word I've said...

So you're thinking about tomorrow
by reliving every minute of your past
well I'm just living for the moment, you see
'cause I'm just trying to make it last
'cause I've just seen it go too fast

And all the things within the world
and all the boys and all the girls
who never seem to get enough
they save it for later, you see
All the saints and all the freaks and all the strange philosophies
the novelties and memories
they save it for later you see,
save it for later you see...

And the best part of my life
is the worst part of your day
And the best part of my song
is the last part you ever play...

And all the things within the world
and all the boys and all the girls
who never seem to get enough
they save it for later, you see
All the saints and all the freaks and all the strange philosophies
and everyone who never speaks
they save it for later you see,

Then all the things within the world
and every boy and every girl
who never seems to get enough
they save it for later, you see
Every time you build it up and put it in your paper cup
it never seems to be enough
you save it for later you see,
you save it for later you see,
don't save it for later, you see
your life would be greater you see..."
