There's a fire
And all the lines are down
There's a panic in the town
And all the wires are crossed
Now they're calling in the dogs

With teeth that shine like pearls
In a witchy underworld
And they all feed the flames
When they're moving in

And everyone knows your name
In the dark it's all the same
When you're done down in the black
You want to take it back
Yeah, you want to take it back

There's a fire
And all the lights are out
There's a strange noise about
Now it's happened all around
Buildings burned to the ground
Now the flames have reached the heart
People are spilling out in cars
And they all feed the flames
When they're moving in

And everyone knows your name
In the dark it's all the same
When you're done down in the black
You want to take it back
Yeah, you want to take it back

And everyone knows your name
In the dark it's all the same
When you're done down in the black
You want to take it back
Yeah, you want to take it back

There's a fire
And all the lines are down
There's a panic in the town
But the worst is almost passed
Now the dogs are gone at last
With teeth that shine like pearls
In a witchy underworld
And when they want to point the blame
You can hear them saying,

"Everyone knows your name
In the end it's all the same
When you're dancing in the light
Or crawling on all fours"

Well in the end it's all the same
When there's no one left to blame
And you're done down in the black
You want to take it back
Yeah, you want to take it back

There's a fire
