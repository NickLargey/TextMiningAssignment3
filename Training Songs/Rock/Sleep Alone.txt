Do you remember when I spoke to you?
I was easy then, and I'm easy now.
I still sit at home twitching my fingers,
playing the songs of my favorite singers,
easy then, I'm easy now.
And when the days turn into nights,
and the nights turn into days,
she would say. (Oh I wish she'd stay).
"This house is not my home"
I choose to sleep alone,
I'm not waiting for the telephone.
No, I'm not waiting for the telephone,
oh no.
