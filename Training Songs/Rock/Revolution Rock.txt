Revolution rock, it is a brand new rock
A bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock

Careful how you move, Mac, you dig me in me back
An' I'm so pilled up that I rattle
I have got the sharpest knife, so I cut the biggest slice
I got no time to do battle, hey

Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this
Brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your ma, tell your pa everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Gonna be alright

Revolution rock, I am in a state of shock
So bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock

Careful how you slide, Clyde, all you did was glide
You poured your beer in me hat
Keep my good eye on the beat, living on fixation street
I ain't got no time for that, hey

Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this
Brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your mama, tell your pa everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Gonna be alright

Revolution rock
Get that cheese-grater going, against the grain
Wearing me down
Pressure increaase

(Everybody!) Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this
Brand new beat
This here music mash up nations
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your mama, forgive your papa, everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Gonna be alright

Revolution rock

To the cruelest mobsters in Kingstown
With the hardest eyes and the cruelest tongue
Is your heart so made of rock
That the blood must run 'round the block?
Are you listening mobsters? Hey!
All people grow old, gotta die
While those kinda fools go rolling by
It's food for thought, mobsters
Young people shoot their days away
I've seen talent thrown away
All you loan sharks!

The organ plays
And they're dancing to the brand new beat
This here music mash up nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your ma-ma-ma-ma, tell your pa-pa-pa-pa everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Everything's gonna be alright
I say, revolution rocks

There's that old cheese grater
Rubbing me down
This must be the way out

Here's the cheap bit
Ooh la ooh la ooh la
