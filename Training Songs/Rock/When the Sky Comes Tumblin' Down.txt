I used to search for the ideal girl
The perfect little prettiness
I used to search for the ideal world
But frankly think it don't exist
So many times i get so afraid
So many ways i felt so betrayed
We get together on a saturday night
And watch the whole world cave in

Little girl i want to know
What you look for in a man
Is he tall, tough and handsome
With a continental taint

I just want to be around
When the big world hits the ground
I don't want to make a sound
When the sky comes tumblin'
Sky comes tumblin' down

I used to worry about the job that i had
I barely made enough to survive
Oh man i'm worried about the life that i live
Sometimes i barely made it home alive
But now i don't need to worry
There's no need to rush there's no need to hurry
You don't need a new job you don't need a new wife
You don't need to go far in your life

Little girl i want to know
What you look for in a man
Does he have a lot of money
Even more than you can spend

I just want to be around
When the big world hits the ground
I don't want to make a sound
When the sky comes tumblin'
Sky comes tumblin' down

I used to play in a dead end band
I always ended up on my own
But now i play in a skeleton band
Nothing but skin and bones

Oh no i don't need sedation
I got my daily dose of radiation
We get together on a saturday night
And watch each other's hair fall out

Little girl i want to know
What you look for in a man
Does he sell a lot of records
With his californian band

I just want to be around
When the big world hits the ground
I don't want to make a sound
When the sky comes tumblin'
Sky comes tumblin' down
