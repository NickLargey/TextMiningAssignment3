And I wanted to know
Just how far she would go and I could tell by the look in her eye
She was just a little bit shy
And I kissed her lips
I felt her fingertips
She told me what she wanted to do
And I told her "I'm in love with you"
(Love with you)

I want to hold you tight throughout the night little girl
Just happy to be with you, who's on my mind
To make you scribe little girl
Just happy to be with you, happy to be with you

And I felt her touch
It was a touch to much
Smelled her hair and touched her skin
She told me to throw it in
And I said to the girl
"That's a natural world", she told me that's a pretty old sin
I told her to get the pizza and beer
(Pizza and beer)

I want to hold you tight throughout the night little girl
Just happy to be with you, who's on my mind
To make you scribe little girl
Just happy to be with you, happy to be with you,
just happy to be with you, happy to be with you

And I wanted to know
Just how far she would go and I could tell by the look in her eye
She was just a little bit shy
And I kissed her lips
I felt her fingertips
She told me what she wanted to do
And I told her "I'm in love with you"
(Love with you)

I want to hold you tight throughout the night little girl
Just happy to be with you, who's on my mind
To make you scribe little girl
Just happy to be with you, happy to be with you,
I want to hold you tight throughout the night little girl
Just happy to be with you, who's on my mind
To make you scribe little girl
Just happy to be with you [x4]
Happy to be with you, just happy to be with you,
happy to be with you, just happy to be with you
