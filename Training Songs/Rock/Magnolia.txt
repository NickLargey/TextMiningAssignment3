walk Decatur in the evening light
And taste the spit of Mississippi rain
Squint down on Bienville in the flashing moonlight
And you can almost hear the clink of chains
Some boys are shouting out the Avenida
Magnolia they can even spell your name right
I'm gonna meet you at Napoleon House
I'm gonna take my absinthe straight tonight

Magnolia I just want to see you flower
I long to smell your scent again
Sweet southern flower I long to make you slide for me

Why is your love so hard to bear?
Why'd you act as if you didn't care?
Why is your hurt so slow to heal?
Y'all shot me dead before the second reel

I'm back on Bienville on the stroke of midnight
The second line becomes the masquerade
You could be back in post war Fort de France
And you can almost hear the call to prayer
Some boys are shouting out the Avenida
6,7,9's the number I must call you
I've got the Hi-John Conq, the dragon's blood
I'm fixing to put a little voodoo on you

Magnolia I just want to see you flower
I want to smell your scent again
Sweet southern flower I want to see you shine for me
6,7,9 you know the Quarter's are hot
I cut my fingers dialling
Sweet southern flower I'm gonna make you slide
Let's take that ride

Why is your love so hard to bear?
Why'd you act as if you didn't care?
Why is your hurt so slow to heal?
You got me down again I can't believe it's real
Why's your love so slow to mend
