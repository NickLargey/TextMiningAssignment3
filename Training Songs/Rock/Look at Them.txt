All the trees that we do not climb
Bridges we cross in our minds
Who are we fooling when we cry?

When she says everything is fine
Over her head clouds that look like mines
Oh why can’t she wish for brighter skies

All the speeches you make in your head
All the worries that you never said
Rotten fireworks, kept inside, waiting for a light

All the roads that you never take
All you know but never suspect
Rotten fire works kept inside

Look at them tell me what you see
Over there dancing in the sea
Free from all worries, laughing at

Me, if you say “it’s a mystery”
Well I will say “easy but I agree”
No I don’t wanna know everything

All the speeches you make in your head
All the worries that you never said
Rotten fireworks kept inside, waiting for a light

All the roads that you never take
All you know but never suspect
Rotten fire works kept inside, waiting for a light

All the trees that we do not climb
Bridges we cross in our minds
Who are we fooling when we cry?

When she says everything is fine
Over her head clouds that look like mines
Oh why can’t she wish for brighter skies
