You think you're on top of the world
But you know it's really over
Runnin' round with diamond rings
And coke spoons that are overflowin'

Rock an Roll is dead
But all the money in the world
Can't buy you from the place you're going to

Rock an Roll is dead
Rock an Roll is dead
Rock an Roll is dead

You can't even sing or play an instrument
So you just scream instead
You're living for an image
So you got five hundred women in your bed

Rock an Roll is dead
But it's real hard to be yourself
When you're living with those demons
In your head

Rock an Roll is dead
Rock an Roll is dead
Rock an Roll is dead

Rock an Roll is dead
Rock an Roll is dead
Rock an Roll is dead

Rock an Roll is dead
Rock an Roll is dead
