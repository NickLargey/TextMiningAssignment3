My time is wasting, feel I'm moving too slow
Can't get my pedal to the metal but I'm ready to go
Life in the fast lane, there's trouble ahead
I better move over, you're a long time dead

I'm chasing rainbows in the cold light of day
It feels like I'm wasting my lifetime away
Breaking the limits, bending the rules
Can't stand standing still, but speed is for fools

But I move better in the night
I won't stop until the day light
It makes me feel right
I move better in the night

Out on the freeway, everybody pays
I throw in my money or I'm waiting for days
I'm overheatin', I'm ready to burn
Got dirt on my wheels but they're ready to turn

Fender to fender, nose to tail
Mind over matter, I just can't fail
Lights going down, give me some more
Come on, I'm ready to roar

But I move better in the night
I won't stop until the day light
Makes me feel right
I move better in the night

Fender to fender, nose to tail
Mind over matter, well, I just can't fail
Lights going down, give me some more
Come on, I'm ready to roar

I move better in the night
I won't stop until the day light
Makes me feel right
I move better in the night

Don't stop until the day light
Makes me feel right
I move better in the night

I'm movin' better
Now, I'm movin', keep on movin'
I move better in the night, night
Movin' in the night
