I keep on laughing and you're keeping track and tonight I'll go back to the place I first knew that I'd wait for you always on streets and in doorways where engines they die near the northeastern line and you mentioned a record that reminded me of a week that you couldn't get things out of your head I'm truly sorry I missed that night it could have been the best time but it's just timing she showed up unexpected and I the train into town I put my collar down and pushed through the door but if it's smiles you want talk to the kid with the boy eyes and wake up dreaming next to him
