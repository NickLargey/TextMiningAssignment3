Hit the North
My Cat says eeeee-ack
Hit the North
95% of hayseeds are corn-pones, guaranteed
Computers infest the hotels
Cops can't catch criminals
But what the heck, they're not too bad, they talk to God 
Religious

Hit the North
Manacled to the city, manacled to the city
All estate agents alive yell down nights in hysterical breath
Those Northern lights, so pretty
Those big big big wide streets
Those useless MPs
Savages
Hit the North (Manacled to the system)

From the back third eye psyche, the reflected mirror of delirium
Eastender and Victoria's lager, the induced call, mysterious
Comes
Forth
Hit the North

(Savages)
Hit the North
