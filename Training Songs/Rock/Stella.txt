God was there, always had the best of drugs
Knew where to get them
Brought a lady friend, and I believe her name was Stella, and he said 

Stella, Stella, I wanna give you the world, if just stay with me tonight
Stella, Stella, I wanna give you the world, if you just hold me tight

And I wonder how it will go
When God hands over the whole wide world to
A forty three year old hooker from downtown
Maybe it's about time the old man hands over the crown

Stella, Stella, I wanna give you the world if you just stay with me tonight
Stella, Stella, I wanna give you the world if you just hold me tight,
Hold me tight, hold me tight, hold me tight

And it made me realize, how much you wanna give away just to feel loved
And the Lord blinked to me and asked:
What is real love to you? What is fake and what is true?

[Repeat x4]
Oh, Stella, Stella, I wanna give you the world if you just stay with me tonight
Stella, Stella, I wanna give you the world if you just hold me tight
