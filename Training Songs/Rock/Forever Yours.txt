I like to go some place where we can be alone
To hold you in my arms and told you my own
I know there's love above we'll always indoor
And I'll forever stand forever yours
I'll die thousand times just to plug your mind
And just to let you know I care

My life is in your hands leave that understand
And I'll sure I'll always be forever yours
I'll die thousand times just to plug your mind
And just to let you know I care
My life is in your hands please darling understand
That I'll sure I'll always be forever yours
