While you were looking at me
The world passed you by
You held your prejudice sacred
And left your dreams behind   

While you were looking at me
The homeless stayed in the streets
You learned to drink poisoned water
But never learned how to read

Well it's easy to put the blame on someone else
But it's hard to see yourself
Did you ever take a good look at yourself?

While you were looking at me
Airport security died
And the smugglers and the terrorists
Just walked right by

'Cause they don't dress like me
They dress like you
They wear suits and ties
Like all you hypocrites do

Well it's easy to point your finger at someone else
But it's hard to see yourself
Ain't it hard to take a good look at yourself?  

While you were looking at me
Businessmen bled you dry
You lost control of your government
It's getting scary outside!

While you were looking at me
Your children took the fall
Trying to be Mommy and Daddy
With dope and alcohol

You censor people like me
But it won't do you no good
The truth's gonna get through
No matter what you do

While you were looking at me
