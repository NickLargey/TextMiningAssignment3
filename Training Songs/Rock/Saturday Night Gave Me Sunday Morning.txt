I was living my life
Like a long lost weekend
Never felt nothing, jumping right into the deep end
I wasn't missing nothing
That was ever worth getting
Never hung around enough to regret it

You came walking in late but just in time
You ended my excuses 
With a ten-cent rhyme
Shoes and attitude were stacked way up high
I knew right then you were
The story of my life

Oh Saturday night gave me Sunday morning
Opened my eyes, now it's a new day dawning
I think I might have pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringing
I never learned the song this heart was singing
No regrets, I took that step, yeah, I'm still falling
Saturday nights gave me Sunday morning, yeah

When you’re driving down a street that’s only going one way
Every day starts feeling like a month of Mondays
You should know I still got something left to prove
I know what it takes to get back to you

Oh Saturday night gave me Sunday morning
Opened my eyes, now it's a new day dawning
I think I might have pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringing
I never learned the song was hard for singing
No regrets, I took the step and I'm still falling
Saturday nights gave me Sunday morning, yeah

Remember those nights staring out at the lights
Making time with our feet in the sand
Making up words to our favourite songs
Laughing loud with those drinks in our hands
And as that boy put his head on her shoulder
She pulled him tight to get a bit closer
And as the world just disappeared
You whispered in my ear

Oh those Saturday night gave me Sunday morning
Opened my eyes, now it's a new day dawning
I think I might have pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringing
I never learned the song was hard for singing
No regrets, I took the step and I'm still falling
Saturday nights gave me Sunday morning, yeah

Sunday morning
