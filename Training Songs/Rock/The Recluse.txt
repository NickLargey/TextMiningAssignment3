I sleep too late and move too slow, I ask too much every time
I aim too high and dig too deep, I burn too bright not to shine
I lie too well and I cum too quick, and I sing too pure to join the line

But I can't complain, I can choose, stay the same or refuse,
So I'll remain a recluse

I drink too fast and talk too loud, I try far too hard I've understood
I lose like shit and I win even worse, well I act too precious for my own good

But I can't complain, I can choose, stay the same of refuse,
So I'll remain a recluse
