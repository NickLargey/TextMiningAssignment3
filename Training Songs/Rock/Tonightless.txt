We'll be tonightless

We can't wait another moment
Our time will come before we know it
With your heart you've got to open up this time
I don't want to be alone tonight

Am I gonna be tonightless again?
All of the loneliness has got to end
I know the years have been so bittersweet
But you don't have to go so please don't leave

Our souls are lost without each other
We've gotta find time to recover
And If you hold me close this heartache will subside
I don't want to be alone tonight

Am I gonna be tonightless again?
All of the loneliness has got to end
I know the years have been so bittersweet
But you don't have to go so please don't leave

We'll be tonightless, we'll be tonight
We'll be tonightless, we'll be tonight
We'll be tonightless, we'll be tonight
We'll be tonightless, we'll be tonight

We'll be tonightless, we'll be tonight
We'll be tonightless, we'll be tonight
We'll be tonightless, we'll be tonight
We'll be tonightless, we'll be tonight

We'll be tonightless, we'll be tonight
We'll be tonightless, we'll be tonight
We'll be tonightless, we'll be tonight
We'll be tonightless, we'll be tonight
We'll be tonightless, we'll be tonight
