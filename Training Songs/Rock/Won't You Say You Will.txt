When my time is only 
Passing me from day to day 
And I'm feeling lonely 
About the best thing I can say... 

You will understand me 
Never mind what they try to hand me 
Won't you say you will 
Won't you say you will 
Take me to your heart, dear 
Won't you say you will 

Once I lost a good thing, 
I just let it slip away 
Now I'm lost and looking, 
Trying to find that thing today 

Will you ever hear me... 
Say I need you near me 
Won't you say you will? 
Won't you say you will? 
Take me to your heart, dear 
Won't you say you will? 

Find a way, to help me see me 
Find the higher plane 
Don't you know, only you can free me 

Find a way to help me see me, 
Find the better plane 
Don't you know, only you can free me 
From this crazy chain 

Yeah... 
Won't you say you will 
(Will...) 
Won't you say you will 
Take me to your heart...dear 
Won't you say you will 
Won't you say you will...
