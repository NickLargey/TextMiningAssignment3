Show me the way
Give away
The truth
I'm looking for 
I need a new way
Out of here
The door
Is opening 

[Chorus:]
Freedom take me deeper
Freedom take me deeper 

All the blue days
Gone astray
The clouds
Are giving in 

[Chorus]

Losing my fear
Suddenly
The way
Has come to me 

[Chorus]
