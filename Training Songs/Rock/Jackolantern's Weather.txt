Well I beat a bad rap when I skip a soul trap 
Just trippin' and laughin' at the crap
Dap is what I get the best skins that I hit
You know we rock the fuckin' joint and we split
Singin' an rhymin's what I'm better for
When I describe I'm a scribe with a metaphor
I use a simile lightly 'cause that shit's played
The common way most rhymes are made, ya know
I rock like this I flow like that
But all those comparisons are just that
Kickin' different styles I'll be right here
Today, tomorrow, next week and next year
I always say what I feel and that is a promise
Nothing in life is above being honest
Sauna is cool compared to being on stage
But that's how it's gotta go in the stone age

The fame in my game I name rapture
Like a polished rock I'll make it shine for sure
Word is that I've traveled become unraveled
I been around the world baby gimme an apple
I'll be your boogie man rather than son-of-sam
What I am is what I am
Though we don't have too long to love a day a night
We only love those who love us right back, right

The kid is smart the kid is clever
Stompin' in jack-o-lantern's weather
Backpack strapped 'cause the world is cold
Headphones pumpin' don't ya know
The kid is smart the kid is clever
Stompin' in jack-o-latern's weather
Rocks his hood and plays it mellow
While maple leaves change into yellow

And oh shit damn homey at it again
Tryin' to beat my high score since the age of ten
See my high score flashes on the back glass
I was malcontented Doug in gifted class
Now here's the deal we came to heal we gonna rock it in Rio
Oh no it's not a joke it's how we feel
Put to test like a Sugar Ray scientist, come on
I'm always dancin' in my Sunday best
I'm betting on my bliss and my path is lit' see
The microphone is live and I'm rockin' my body
Smooth like Reggie Miller in an airborne freeze frame
Funky like the kung-fu that can put you to shame

The kid is smart the kid is clever
Stompin' in jack-o-lantern's weather
Backpack strapped 'cause the world is cold
Headphones pumpin' don't ya know
The kid is smart the kid is clever
Stompin' in jack-o-latern's weather
Rocks his hood and plays it mellow
While maple leaves change into yellow

I'm like hey (hey), wait a minute
Give a check one two then I'm ready to begin it
With a boom boom bap coming outta your trunkies
Give a fat shout out to the Phunk Junkeez
Stricken like a cancer taken chances
But I love to see the girl windin' like the belly dancer
Standin' up front with a tight stomach showin
Me on stage singin, flowin
We just kickin' it live we just kickin' it live
'Cause if you can't kick it live you gonna die
'Fraid so punk, so quit talkin' junk
You need a live show like a ball player needs a dunk
