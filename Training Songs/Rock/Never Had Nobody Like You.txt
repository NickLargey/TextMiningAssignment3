Well, since time I had a mind, I been lazy
And times before that I was cruel
And times before that I was lean, I was mad
Honey, I ain't never had nobody like you

And the times before that, well, I was crazy
I saw the dark side of the moon
And the stars in the sky, they never caught my eye
'Cause I ain't never had nobody like you
I ain't never had nobody like you

Now it's just like ABC
Life's just like 123
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Ah oh

I watched my own habits die and its painful
sometimes its painful in the light of the truth
but you can be faster than light
I'd like to thank you tonight
Honey, I ain't never had nobody like you
I ain't never had nobody like you

And it's just like ABC
Life's just like 123
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Ah oh

I trusted liars and thieves in my madness
Honey I was wasting away in the room
But now that I been through that hell I got a story to tell
Honey, I ain't never had nobody like you
I ain't I never had nobody like you
I ain't never had nobody like you
