I defied the odds
Dead end cul-de-sacs gridded streets that felt like jail
A maze of palm trees, led to nowhere
Built my own boat so I could sail
They said "you won’t make it
You’re just wasting all your time"
But I’ve got no patience
And hate to stand in lines

Oh, oh, I’m ready and I’m willing to take you on
Oh, I’m ready and I’m willing to lose it all
I’m ready, I’m ready
I’m ready, I’m ready

I search the channels to find stations
I used to watch when I was young
Only to find a reality that’s fine
Settling for dumb
There’s no more heroes
No one showing us the way
So I sift through my old 45”s
To remind myself

Oh, oh, I’m ready and I’m willing to take you on
Oh, I’m ready and I’m willing to lose it all
Oh, I’m ready and I’m willing to take you on
Oh, I’m ready and I’m willing to lose it all

When my back goes out, I’ll know I did it all
And have stories to tell
When my eyes go bad, I’ll know I’ve seen it all
They’ll be light when my vision fails
My legs will go bad
But I walked 5 continents
So I won’t need to stand
I hope this life I lived will wake you up
So you could do it again

Oh, are you ready are willing to take you on
Oh, are you ready are you willing to lose it all
Oh, are you ready are willing to take it on
Oh, are you ready are you willing to lose it all

I’m ready, I'm ready to take you on
I'm willing, I'm willing to lose it all
