Why did she come tonight?
I was beginning to mend all
Slipped down, fell aside
You give me reason to do nothing but wrong

It starts with the sinner tonight
It feels so right
You leave me happy just to feed it a lie
While I just panick at the break of down

Why did you call tonight?
(I want to know if I can trick a lie)
I was beginning to build up
Dreams of a another night
(I want to know if I can trick a lie)
You send a shiver to a body that's cold

She says she will be here a while
I'm paralyzed
Feels like I'm loosing this fight
You just have it when it hits me 

A race for luck when it stops
Plays on my hands
I've tasted lie
Dare me to believe
Our time is up
I don't believe
I don't believe
I don't believe

Why did you call tonight?
(I want to love you like a trick of the light)

You follow the sinner tonight
It feels so right
You leave me happy just to feed it a lie
While I just panic at the break of down

Erase your life, f*ck it up
Blood is on my hands
I've tasted lie
A race for luck when it stops
Dare me to believe
Our time is up
I don't believe
I don't believe
I don't believe
I don't

If this is real then I know I should wake you up
There's no mistake I loose the feeling when the music stops
I wanna hit you but you're never gonna mean that much to me

(You will, but you don't)

Tonight I'll let you, I'm gonna find you within every touch
Whatever happens, let's forget about the venom in us
I wanna love you but you're never gonna mean that much to me

I don't believe
I don't believe
I don't
I don't believe in us

Why did you call tonight?
(I want to love you like a trick of the light)
Why did you call tonight?
