Tired eyes, maybe you've seen too much
Tired heart, every end has a start
If you find yourself in trouble, falling off the track
Would you come back?
Would you come back?
Would you come back?

Time will save you
You don't need to save yourself
Sorry eyes of those left behind
When we were kids do these thing we oblige
If you find yourself alone, with no need to call home

Will you come back?
Will you come back?
Will you come back?

Time will save you
You don’t need to save yourself
Time will save you
You don't need to save yourself

And if you need me now
You know I am here
For the deepest scars disappear

Time will save you
You don’t need to save yourself
Time will save you
You don’t need to save yourself
Time will save you
You don’t need to save yourself
Time will save you
You don’t need to save yourself
