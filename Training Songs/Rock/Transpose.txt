Sleepless nights aren't new to me
All these thoughts are killing me
Someone come and put me to ease
All of my anxiety, there's no cause that I can see
What's this scratching out my brain!

And I can't stop even if I wanted to
Up top, maybe I'm simply deluded
That's right, maybe I've been wasting my time
All my time
And it's hard to justify what you can do
I'm so sick and tired of falling through
And it's true, maybe I've been wasting my time
All this time, yeh

Come creeping, no one can hear you now
Listen so you can show me how
Something that I'm missing here
Softly, stab my evil dreams
Faster, help me fall asleep
No one knows, that's how it goes
All the thoughts that we transpose

And I can't stop even if I wanted to
Up top, maybe I'm simply deluded
That's right, maybe I've been wasting my time
All my time
And it's hard to justify what you can do
I'm so sick and tired of falling through
And it's true, maybe I've been wasting my time
All this time, yeh

And I can't stop even if I wanted to
Up top, maybe I'm simply deluded
That's right, maybe I've been wasting my time
All my time
And it's hard to justify what you can do
I'm so sick and tired of falling through
And it's true, maybe I've been wasting my time
All this time

From time to time, we fall in line
But now it seems that we are blind
No one knows, that's how it goes
All the thoughts that we transpose
