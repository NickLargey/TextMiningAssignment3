It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
But when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry, 
I want to die

It's not unusual to go out at anytime, 
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone, 
It's not unusual
It happens everyday, no matter what you say, 
You'll find it happens all the time
Love will never do what you want it to, 
Why can't this crazy love be mine? 
It's not unusual to be mad with anyone
It's not unusual to be sad with anyone,
But if I ever find that you've changed at anytime
It's not unusual to find 
That I'm in love with you.
