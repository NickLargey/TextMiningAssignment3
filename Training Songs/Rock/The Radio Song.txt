I like to listen to music 
I like the way that it sounds 
On the radio 

I like to sit in a silent place 
When no one's around 
And listen inside it 

Inside the silence is a melody 
Voices singing harmony 
I close my eyes and listen carefully 
The silence starts to get loud 

It's like your favorite station 
Playing your favorite song 
Just like they do on the radio 
Like they do on the radio 

Inside the silence is a symphony 
Every note there is in every key 
The music tells me how it wants to be 
I help it write itself down 
I hear the way that would sound 

It's like your favorite station 
Playing your favorite song 
Just like they do on the radio 
Like they do on the radio 
But the radio isn't on
On the radio
