Well it's a struggle, baby
It's a struggle, yeah yeah

If it's a struggle between love and hate
Baby's gonna have to wait

Yeah yeah huh yeah ooh yeah struggle

I'm in the middle

You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

It's a struggle
It's a struggle
Baby baby baby yeah

Well it's a struggle to make ends meet honey
Under pressure to express yourself
Then admit it
Don't deny yourself yeah yeah

Hard to fight
Struggle, struggle
You and me should never feel neglected, overlooked,
One worked, overhooked

Doing as you're told
Hell on hold
Through the night
Without a fight
You gotta face the day

If you struffle baby
It only tightens up
