Gotta give it up
Gotta let it go
'Cause hangin' on like this
Only breaks the flow

Gotta act as if
It's all for the best
'Cause maybe it is and if it is
It's worth the test 

You gotta pick your battles
You gotta let 'em roll
You gotta dig down deep
And let it touch your soul

[Chorus: ]
This is your life
This is your day
Ain't no dress rehearsal
So get on your way
Smell the roses
Dig the ride
You can't take it with you, when you say goodbye

'Cause this is your life
This is your life

Get outta your head
Get into your heart
Forgive, forget, baby
Whatever you take too hard
'Cause time is flyin'
And time won't wait
I've seen it all
Make no mistake

[Chorus: ]

You can sit there in the clouds
You can open up your eyes
Right now
You'll see
I'll be the first
You can trust in me
