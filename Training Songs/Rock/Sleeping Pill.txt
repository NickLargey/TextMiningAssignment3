I've been transformed in my sleep
Thrown into next week
I've got something I can't keep
Woke up with a shorter reach

Walking through a concussion
And the dosage that's left of you
Throw away it's a toss up
Dropped outta the contest to throw up

Heard you dropped my name 
Heard you dropped it all the time

Time 
Time 
Time

You smile goes around your head
Like you can see from behind
You're always hanging one step behind
It's numbing the things you don't say
Throw away it's a toss up
Dropped outta the contest to throw up

Heard you dropped my name
Heard you drop them all the time
Your smile goes around your head 
So you don't have to move to show off your good side

That wasn't so hard to swallow
Went down easy as a capsule
Went down easy as a candle
As soon as you got a new angle

This town just gets smaller
And all my friends have new names
Like Tylenol
Demerol
Anacin
Excedrin
