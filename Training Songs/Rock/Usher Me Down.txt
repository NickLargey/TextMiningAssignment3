Alone  alone is where I'll be 
Waiting  waiting so patiently 
Escape this little war raging 
One Still Small Voice 
Come rescue me 

Why wait  why wait 
Why wait for You to Usher Me Down 
Many o  many o  Lord  my God 
The wonders that I have found 
When You usher me down 

Sacrifice and offering 
You do not desire of me 
I say here I am  You come 
As if I ever had to call 

Why wait  why wait 
Why wait for You to Usher Me Down 
Many o, many o, Lord, my God 
The wonders that I have found 
When You usher me down 

Who could replace You? 
None I know of 
The Throne is Yours alone 
Left to stand unshaken 
Can't be taken back 
Can't be taken back 

Why wait, why wait 
Why wait for You to Usher Me Down 
Many o, many o, Lord, my God 
The wonders that I have found 
When You usher me down
