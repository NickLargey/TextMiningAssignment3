And all the way
Never take the lie
For granted
What to do
And where to go
When I'll be gone
Dream along
To be free and I
I will be born again

And all the way
Never take the lie
For granted
What to do
And where to go
When I'll be gone
Dream along
To be free and I
I will be born again
