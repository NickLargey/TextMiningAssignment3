Don't look to the left, don't look to the right
 just follow that strait old line...
 This could be heaven, or this could be hell
 Life could be falling down a bottomless well
 I stumble to the left, I stumble to the right
 I fumble for the switch, of a disconnected light
 Stay with it, don't let temptation be your load
 Stay with it, but there are bandits on the road

 [Chorus:]
 Don't look to the left, don't look to the right
 Just follow that strait old line
 Don't look to the left, don't look to the right
 Just follow that strait old line

 The road of ambition, it's a casualty trail
 Press gangs wait to ambush
 The weak and weary 
(stay with it)
 I had to explore the light and dark
 to see the sharp and flat
 There's a hundred or more good reasons
 not to ever turn your back

 [Chorus:]

 [Neil:] Take it Eddie!

 [Chorus:]
