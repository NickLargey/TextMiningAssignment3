Tell all my friends I’m going out to the desert this weekend 
When they find out I’ll be gone for a life time or two 
I may start out looking over my shoulder I told you 
I might end up being someone you don’t wanna see
That someone is who I’ll be 

I’m on the high road after midnight 
And I don’t think I'll ever go home 
I’m on the right road got the freedom 
It'll never, no never get old 

Yeah, yeah, yeah 

See the sun come up, it’s a beautiful day to be dreaming 
Well you don’t need us 
What you need is a mind of your own 
I got mine you're the one all alone

I’m on the high road after midnight 
And I don’t think I'll ever go home 
I’m on the right road got the freedom 
And I'll never, no never give up 

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Life can play you like a game
And if you let it you’ll regret it til the end of your days
