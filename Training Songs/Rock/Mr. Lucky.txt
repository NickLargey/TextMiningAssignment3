YOU'VE GOT CLASS  AND STYLE
IN THE WAY YOU WALK
BUT THERE'S SOMEONE OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR
SHE SAYS THAT SHE ONLY REALLY WANTS TO TALK
BUT YOUR GONNA GET A LITTLE BIT MORE
YOU'VE GOTTEN SO GOOD AT STEPPIN' AROUND
ANY PROBLEMS IN YOUR WAY
BUT THIS ONE TIME YOUR YESTERDAY
IS NOT JUST GONNA GO AWAY

YOU WERE SO HIGH ON ANTICIPATION
OF TAKIN' THIS TOWN BY STORM
THAT YOU MADE ONE SLIGHT MIS-CALCULATION
SHE WAS MORE THAN YOU BARGAINED FOR
THEN CAME THE BIG SURPRISE
COULD IT BE YOUR TIME
THIS TIME
TABLES ARE TURNIN'
MR. LUCKY

ALL YOUR LIFE YOU'VE BEEN LOOKIN' FOR
THE EASY WAY TO MAKE THE SCORE
THE ONE BIG DEAL YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
IS FINALLY RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR
BUT WHAT MAKES A MAN
TAKE A DIFFERENT STAND
WHEN HE'S PUSHED UP AGAINST A WALL
AND TO GIVE IT ALL AWAY
WHEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO EASY TO TAKE IT ALL

YOU WERE SO HIGH ON ANTICIPATION
OF TAKIN' THIS TOWN BY STORM
THAT YOU MADE ONE SLIGHT MIS-CALCULATION
SHE WAS MORE THAN YOU BARGAINED FOR
THEN CAME THE BIG SURPRISE
COULD IT BE THE RIGHT TIME
YOUR TIME
TABLES ARE TURNIN'
FOR MR. LUCKY

++SOLO++

THE LIFE YOU LEAD TOOK A TURN TODAY
YOU STOPPED THEIR PLAY STONE COLD
AND LADY LUCK SHOWED HER WINNING HAND
NOW YOUR CLAIM IS AS GOOD AS GOLD
THEN CAME THE BIG SURPRISE
COULD IT BE THE NIGHT-TIME
IS THE RIGHT TIME
TABLES ARE TURNIN' FOR
MR. LUCKY
