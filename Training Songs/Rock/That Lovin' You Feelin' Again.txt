When I saw you standing there on the street
I found myself by your side
I started wanting you again
There's just no way to hide

From that old lovin' you feelin' again
It's really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop to start all over again with you

I remember how you always get that certain look in your eye
You're not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
'Cause that old lovin' you feeling again (lovin' you feelin)
It's really got me reeling again
Only seems to stop to start all over again with you
Lovin' you feelin', lovin' you feelin' with you

We were so close
We were too far apart
I gave you my love
I wanted your heart

Without yesterday haunting the way
Maybe we'd still be together
Sharing that lovin' you feelin' again
It's really got me reeling again (lovin' you)
Will it ever stop and not start over again 
That lovin' you feelin' again

No matter how much I've tried
This lovin' you feelin' inside
It's taken such a long, long, time
To say goodbye

And getting over you
Is so hard to do
With this feelin'
Lovin' you

That lovin' you feelin' again
Lovin' you feelin' again
That lovin' you feelin' again
Lovin' you feelin' again
That lovin' you feelin' again
Lovin' you feelin' again
That lovin' you feelin' again
Lovin' you feelin' again
That lovin' you feelin' again
