You've left me alone with memories
I tried to endure you in this cheating
I loved you with my heart's every beating
Now my hopes are gone like wind through the trees
'Cause you've left me alone with memories

I know that it may seem to you that I don't really care
But someday when you're all alone and memories are there
You'll know, you've left me alone with memories

I tried forgetting what you meant to me
For now I realize that I'm alone
In my mind I really know that you are gone
But my foolish heart refuses to see
Why you've left me alone with memories

I know that it may seem to you that I don't really care
But someday when you're all alone and memories are there
You'll know, you've left me alone with memories
