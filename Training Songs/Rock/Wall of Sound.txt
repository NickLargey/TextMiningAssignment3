We have to find a way
And the only way is out
Out of the mess 
That this is all about
We have to find a way
And the only way is up
Leave 'em all behind
So we can make a new start
Straight from the heart
Or we will fall apart

we have to find a way
And the only way is hard
But that's alright as long
As we're together so strong
We have to find the way
And the only way is back
Back to ourselves
So we can make a new start
Straight from the heart
Or we will fall apart

breaking through a wall of sound
Reaching for a higher ground
All the reasons lost and found
Time to leave and turnaround
Turnaround and around
Turnaround

we have to find some place
Some place that we are safe
Some place where we can rest
And we can call home
We have to find someone
Someone who'll support
Someone to lean on
And someone who will see
We only wanna break free
And f*ck the old record company

breaking through a wall of sound
Reaching for a higher ground
All the reasons lost and found
Time to leave and turnaround
Turnaround and around
Turnaround
