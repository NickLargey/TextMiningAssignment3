Hold fast, motor off
Come strong, let it roll
Ice cold desert stone
She build a quick train
Seems to keep her motor clean
Saw the visions and a wet machine
She's always quick to fight
We're breaking through tonight

I could feel it when you push straight down
I could feel it when they stood their ground

Roll over, right
Keep it through the night, right, right
Keep it through the night
Right in my sight, keep it through the night
I'll smash right through your spotlight

She ran away to Texas
To keep away the excess
Old ex in Vegas don't back Texas
She burned her inheritance
Danced across America
At the all-night sex show so far from home

I could feel it when you push straight down
I could feel it when they stood their ground

Roll over, right
Keep it through the night, right, right
Keep it through the night
Right in my sight, keep it through the night
I'll smash right through your spotlight

What you give is what you take
What you bleed is what you break
I bleed for you
I'd steal for for you
I'd take, I'd take, I'd take, I'd take, I'd take, I'd take, I'd take, I'd take

I could feel it when you push straight down
I could feel it when they stood their ground

Roll over, right
Keep it through the night, right, right
Keep it through the night
Right in my sight, keep it through the night
I'll smash right through your spotlight
