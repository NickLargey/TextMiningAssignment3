Yo, what's up?

This is G-Love coming at you live out here from California, 
Even though I'm Philly born and bred

And I got my man Jack Johnson in the studio today, we just got out of the surf
My man, Jack, tell 'em what time it is

(uh, com 'on)

Sweepin' the floors
Open up the doors yeah
Turn on the lights
Gettin' ready for the night
Nobody's romancin'
Cause it's too early for dancin'
But here comes the music

Bright lights flashin'
To cover of your liquor
So many people, so many powers,
So many reasons to buy another round 
Drink it down
Just another night on the town

With the big man, money man 
Better than the other man
He got the plan with the million dollars
Give a damn but
When nobody understands
He'll become a smaller man
The bright lights keep flashing
Man the women keep on dancin'
With the clowns yeah, yeah, yeah
Pick me up when I'm down yeah, yeah
Rodeo Clowns yeah, yeah, yeah
Pick me up when I'm down, yeah, yeah

The disco ball spinning
All the music and the women
And the shots of tequila
Man they'll say that they need ya
But what they really need
Is just a little room to breathe

Teeny bopping disco queen
She barely understands her dreams
Of belly button rings
And other kinds of things
Symbolic of change
But the thing that is strange
Is that changes occurred
And now she's just a part of the herd yeah, yeah, yeah
Man I thought that you heard yeah, yeah
The changes occur yeah, yeah, yeah
She's just a part of the herd yeah, yea

Lights out shut down
Late night wet ground
You walk by, look at him but he can't look at you yeah
You might feel pity but he only feels the ground because
You understand moods
But he only knows let down 
By the corner there's another one
Reaching out a hand
Coming from a broken man
Well you try to live
But he's done trying
He's not dead but definitely dying

With the rest of the clowns yeah, yeah, yeah

With the rest of the clowns yeah, yeah, yeah

The Rodeo clowns yeah, yeah
Pick me up when I'm down

The Rodeo clowns yeah, yeah
Pick me up when I'm down

Sweeping the floors
Open up the doors yeah
Turn on the lights
Getting ready for the night
Nobody's romancing 
Cause it's too early for dancin'
But here comes the music
