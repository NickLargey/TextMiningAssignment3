Something's at the edge of your mind, you don't know what it is
Somethin' you were hopin' to find but your not sure what it is
Then you hear the music and it all comes crystal clear
The music does the talkin' says the things you want to hear

I'm young, I'm wild and I'm free
Got the magic power of the music in me
I'm young, I'm wild and I'm free
Got the magic power of the music in me

She climbs into bed, she pulls the covers overhead and she turns her little radio on
She's had a rotten day so she hopes the DJ's gonna play her favorite song
It makes her feel much better, brings her closer to her dreams
A little magic power makes it better that it seems

She's young now, she's wild now, she wants to be free
She gets the magic power of the music from me
She's young now, she's wild now, she wants to be free
She gets the magic power of the music from me

If you're thinkin' it over but you just can't sort it out
Do you want someone to tell you what they think it's all about
Are you the one and only who's sad and lonely, reachin' for the top
Well the music keeps you goin' and it's never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
Never gonna, never gonna, never gonna stop

The world is full of compromise, and infinite red tape
But the music's got the magic, it's your one chance for escape
So turn me on turn me up it's your turn to dream
A little magic power makes it better than it seems

I'm young now, I'm wild now I want to be free
I got the magic power of the music in me
I'm young now, I'm wild and I'm free
Got the magic power of the music in me
