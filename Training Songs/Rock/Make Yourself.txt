If I hadn't made me
I would have been made somehow

If I hadn't assembled myself
I'd have fallen apart by now

If I hadn't made me
I'd be more inclined to bow

Powers that would be have swallowed me up
But that's more than I can allow

If you let them make you
They'll make you papier-mâché
At a distance you're strong
Until the wind comes
Then you crumble and blow away

If you let them f*ck you
There will be no foreplay
But rest-assured
They'll screw you complete
?Til your ass is blue and gray

You should only make amends with you
If only for better health
But if you really want to live
Why not try and make yourself?

If I hadn't made me
I'd have fallen apart by now

I won't let ?em make me
It's more than I can allow

So when I make me
I won't be papier-mâché
And if I f*ck me
I'll f*ck me in my own way

You should only make amends with you
If only for better health
But if you really want to live
Why not try and make yourself?
