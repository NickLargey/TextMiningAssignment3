There is cause and effect
There's a reason I'm so erect
There's last night and there's today
There's a reason you feel this way

Is it my name?
Don't miss the boat Barry, don't miss the plane
I don't think I can make this scene again
Why don't you love me?

Is it my name?
All the lies, all the truth,
All the things that I offer you
All the sights, all the sounds
All the times that you turn me down

Is it my name?
My voice goes so high you would think I was gay
But I play my guitar in such a man-cock way
Why don't you love me?

It is my name?
You only love me for my machine
