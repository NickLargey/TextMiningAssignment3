To play to get rich and die baroque is wrong
If you write a song for God, will he sing along?
While rows of robot symphonies read on
Is that the way that you want it played?

(Manuscripted memories)
I can breathe
(Sound with no electricity)
I can see concentration lines on the face of serious music

(Manuscripted memories)
I can breathe
(Sound with no electricity)
You know I can see concentration lines
On the face of serious music

You brought a bit of jazz to the concert hall
You won't hear violins at the Darkie's ball
Your rhapsody in blue will outlive us all
I wish I was there the night you played it

(Manuscripted memories, sound with no electricity)
Oh, can't you see concentration lines
On the face of serious music

(Manuscripted memories)
Notes on page
(Sound but no electricity)
Oh, can't you see concentration lines
On the face of serious music

(Oh, I can't see, I can't hear)
Manuscripted memories, sound but no electricity
Concentration lines on the face of serious music

(I can't see, I can't hear)
Manuscripted memories, sound but no electricity
Concentration lines on the face of serious music
