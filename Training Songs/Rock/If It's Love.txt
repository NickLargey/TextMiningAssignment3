If it's love that would really explain it
How I feel like I'm covered in wool
If it's love then it's really exciting
My diary's become very full
If it's love does it matter, if I'm thin or I'm fatter
If it's love then it feels like I've won the pools

If it's love then it needs some devotion
And I feel like I'm walking on air
If it's love then I feel like I'm floating
Through my world without knowing who's there
If it's love someone slap me, is this me that's so happy
If it's love then I'm laughing like I don't care

If it's love then my teeth are clean for a change
Oh if it's love then that's why I'm feeling so strange

If it's love then I need it forever
Like the beats that keep time in my heart
If it's love then I fall like a feather
I'm an egg in the teeth of a shark
If it's love I'm inspired, I'm up late, Im not tired
If it's love then my world is about to spark

If it's love then my teeth are clean for a change
Oh if it's love then that's why I'm feeling so strange

Is it love, love, love, love, love, love?
Is it love, love, love, love, love, love?
Is it love, love, love, love, love, love?

Is it love, is it love, is it love, is it love, is it love?
Is it love, is it love, is it love, is it love, is it love?
Is it love, is it love, is it love, is it love, is it love?
Is it love, is it love, is it love, is it love, is it love?
Is it love?
