I like to get drunk and do things that I shouldn't 
I like to kiss pretty girls in dark corners of bars 
I like to stay up â€˜til dawn on nights I shouldn't even be out 
I like to spend my days in parks strumming my guitar 

Sometimes the party has to end 
When I can't see the night because I blacked out again 
She's angry 
Maybe she's just through with me 
I'm sure I'd understand but I don't remember a thing 

Sober only knows what the whiskey couldn't kill 
I don't know why I always have to drink my fill 
I don't know why I always have to drink my fill 

I like to drink white wine and play Bob Dylan records 
I like to listen to women tell me all about their lives 
I like to go to North Brooklyn bars getting fucked up on weekday nights 
I like to sing my songs alone under the stars 

Sometimes the party has to end 
When I can't see the night because I blacked out again 
She's angry 
Maybe she's just through with me 
I'm sure I'd understand but I don't remember a goddamn thing 

Sober only knows what the whiskey couldn't kill 
I don't know why I always have to drink my fill 
Sober only knows what the whiskey couldn't kill 
I don't know why I always have to drink my fill 
I don't know why I always have to drink my fill
