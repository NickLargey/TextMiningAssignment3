It was a stone cold night
And when the snow flakes fell
We had to hold on tight
Before our last farewell
Then the darkness took you from me
As you walked into the night
You said you'd never change
You'd never change your mind
And then I looked away
And I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you
I could see you
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you
I could see you
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me

It was a lonely night
When I was watching the TV
Lo and behold on tight
There you were singing about me
It was a lonely summer freedom
How you had to fly away
You said you'd never change
You'd never change your mind
But then I closed my eyes
And I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you
I could see you
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you
I could see you
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me

Now as the years go by
I still dream the same dream
But I still wonder why
Things are not what they seem
I still hear you saying baby
You will never stay the night
I guess you never change
You never change your mind
But then I closed my eyes
And I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
Kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you
I could see you
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you
I could see you
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
I could see you
I could see you
I could see you kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me, kissing me
