I lost my heart
I didn't know what to do
I was so caught in misunderstanding, I
Took it all out on you
'Cause I didn't like the world
(I didn't like the world)
I didn't like the world

I lost my heart
I sat on my window and looked out and
Watched the rain wash down the street
Oh, will the sun rise?
Like the birds that fly over
Rising up through the trees

Will you be there for me?
(Will you be there for me?)
Will you belong to me?
(Will you belong to me?)

Am I forgiven?
Am I forgiven?
Am I forgiven?
Am I forgiven?

'Cause I didn't like the world
(I didn't like the world)
I didn't like the world

If I should let you go
There would be nothing
And silently
Love would be sown
And I could begin again
Can we begin again?

Am I forgiven?
Am I forgiven?
Am I forgiven?
Am I forgiven?

Am I forgiven?
('Cause I didn't like the world)
(Oo, would you help me...)
Am I forgiven?
(Find my way back...)
Am I forgiven?
(To this heart when I'm tired...)
Am I forgiven?
(And life's heavy on me?)

Am I forgiven?
('Cause I didn't like the world)
(Oo, would you help me...)
Am I forgiven?
(Find my way back...)
Am I forgiven?
(To this heart when I'm tired...)
Am I forgiven?
(And life's heavy on me?)

Am I forgiven?
(Oo, would you help me...)
Am I forgiven?
(Find my way...)
Am I forgiven?
(Back to this heart when I'm tired...)
Am I forgiven?
