I feel the burning closing in around me
In the middle of a world falling to my feet
Just when I thought things were falling in place
The ground beneath me 
Has begun to start to fade away

I never know so say it slow
Tell me why do we always end up here
Alone is when we let fear
Control the things that aren't clear

We fall down
There's no escape in hiding
What's left seems to be dying
Cause I'm so bored of trying
It's bad timing

Now what do I do, I don't do anything
I sit around and let it all sink in
Its not so bad when I don't interact
(and we never come in contact)
Vultures around me they are circling
They've found my tracks

I never know so say it slow
Tell my why do we always end up here
Alone is when we let fear
Control the things that aren't clear

We fall down
There's no escape in hiding
What's left seems to be dying
Cause I'm so bored of trying
The timing is so bad

I can't keep track, I won't turn back
Can't face the facts, I fade to black
Walls are so thin, still boxed in
Doors are closing, I can't breathe
No windows no light
The flames start to bite
Burning feels right
This is my fight
