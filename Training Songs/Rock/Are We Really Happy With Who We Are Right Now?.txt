You said you Needed
What you don't know is I know
That you can't get it

You said you know me
You know nothing at all
You said you hate me
Well believe me I hate you to

Stop stand down wait, 
I don't want to go. 
Send me somewhere warm. 
Stop stand down wait, 
I don't want to go. 

We want it all. 
They try to stop you from dreaming. 
They're there to make your life hell. 
Just try to stop me from dreaming believing. 

Stop, stand down wait
I don't want to go.
Send me somewhere warm

And are we really happy? 
Ask yourself, ask yourself this time.
