This is a scapegoat revolution
This is a scapegoat revolution

Sixteen, I hated to be
Sixteen, low self-esteem and
Sixteen, I wanted to be
Eighteen, things went better
Eighteen, I will remember all my life

Sixteen, always picked on
Sixteen, insecure and
Sixteen, but tiny man turned
Eighteen, I learned to enjoy
Eighteen, I will remember all my life

This is a scapegoat revolution
This is a scapegoat revolution

Sixty, I hope I will turn
Sixty, gray not deaf but
Sixty, slowly walk to
Eighty, in good condition
Eighty, smiling back at my passed life

Sixty, one day I'll be
Sixty, bald and fat and
Sixty, easy going
Eighty, satisfied and
Eighty, smiling back at my passed life
