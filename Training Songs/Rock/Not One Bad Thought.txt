It was pretty this morning
Put some flowers in the ground
Sun was shining this morning
Planted flowers all around

Got my business out of the way
And all I want to do is not one bad thought
One bad thought

Oh, yeah

I got a mockingbird
It sings the song out on the breathe
Sometime they sit up on my chimney
Then they take it up to the trees

Lord, he must have been hearing my old guitar
I believe he does it better than me
Don't have not one bad thought
Not one bad thought, no

My mama was a Cherokee
Spread her little laugh on a river fall
She had seven kids and let us know
There was plenty of room in her arms

She would start the day with a smile on her face
And not one bad thought, not one bad thought
Not one bad thought, not one bad thought

Not one bad thought
Not one bad thought
Just wondering
Not one bad thought
Not one bad thought
