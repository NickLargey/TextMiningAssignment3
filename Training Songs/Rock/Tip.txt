I gave it all I gave it up then
I took it in and got enough but
I try to cancel out
Whatever I can't laugh about

So what does that say
There can't be anyway
I've done my worst and no one knows

One more day to fool them all
One more day to drop the ball
One more day to fade away

Fill a head with sand just to make it better
I had the chance to beat it in but I never
I should have taken it right then

One more day to fool them all
One more day to drop the ball
One more day to fade away

Now you've been taken
You won't stop shaking
Embrace every minute
You're all that's left in it
It's not happening 
Some other day you'll fool them all
One more day to drop the ball
One more day to fade away
