You were hungry for the lights,
You spent your nights with socialites
You're a million-dollar baby with the million dollar blues
And the only gave your time to people you could use

Million dollar face with million dollar grace
You got off to a real bad start
Million dollar face in million dollar lace
You wound with a two cent heart

You were mine for just a little while
But true to style and with a smile you said,
"I have to leave you, baby, hold me one more time
'Cause I know where I should be and it's a long hard climb"

Million dollar face with million dollar grace
You got off to a real bad start
Million dollar face in million dollar lace
You wound with a two cent heart
Million dollar face with million dollar grace
You got off to a real bad start
Million dollar face in million dollar lace
You wound with a two cent heart
