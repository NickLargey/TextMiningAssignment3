Hey Little Woman please make up your mind
You've got to come into my world
Leave your world behind
Come on now
Na, na, na, na
You got to
Come down from that cloud girl and
Leave your world behind

When your with me 
I feel sunshine
Even when I'm standing in the rain
Something happens that I can't explain
When I hear your name
But you can't help it that
You're always chasing rainbows in your mind
There's so much I want to say to you
But there's so little time

Hey Little Woman please make up your mind
You've got to come into my world
Leave your world behind
Na, na, na, na
You got to
Come down from that cloud girl and
Leave your world behind

What do you see when your walking down 
A busy street and I'm not there
Is my picture hanging in your mind
Walking with you there
That's how it is in my world girl
You're not there all the time
Why don't you come into my world and
Leave your world behind

Hey Little Woman please make up your mind
You've got to come into my world
Leave your world behind
Na, na, na, na
You got to
Come down from that cloud girl and
Leave your world behind
