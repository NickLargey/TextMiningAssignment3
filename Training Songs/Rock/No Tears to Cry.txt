f you don't want to see me fall
Turn your face to the wall
There's no face left to hide
There's no tears to cry
'Cause my eyes have dried

If you can see my wall, dear, from afar
Can't you see how distant we are?
There's no way I can lie
There's no tears to cry
'Cause my eyes have dried

Time before [Incomprehensible]
You stole the precious mind
Wrapped it up in sin
And sold it to the night

If you don't want to watch, watch me slide
Turn around here inside
Find a place we can hide
There's no tears to cry

There's no face left inside
There's no tears to cry
'Cause my eyes have dried
There's no tears to cry
