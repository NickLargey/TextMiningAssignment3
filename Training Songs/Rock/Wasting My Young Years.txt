You cross this line
Do you find it hard to say it with me tonight?
I’ve walked these miles but I’ve walked in straight line
You’ll never know what was there to be
Fine

I’m wasting my young years
It doesn’t matter here
I’m chasing more ideas
It doesn’t matter here

Baby
We are
We are
Maybe I’m wasting my young years
Baby
We are
We are
Baby, I’m wasting my young years

Don’t you know that it’s all I feel?
I wouldn’t worry, you have all your love
I’ve heard it takes some time to get it behind

I’m wasting my young years
It doesn’t matter here
I’m chasing more ideas
It doesn’t matter here

Baby
We are
We are
Maybe I’m wasting my young years
Baby
We are
We are
Baby, I’m wasting my young years

I don’t know what you want
Don’t leave me hanging on
Don’t know what you want
Don’t leave me hanging on
