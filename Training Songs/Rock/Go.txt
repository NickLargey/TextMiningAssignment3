Want to go with you but I think I'll stay
Want to go with you but I think I'll stay
Want to go with you but I think I'll stay
Want to go with you but I think I'll stay
It's been 10 years since I left my house and
Wandered off without you
Has it been that long?
It's really been that long
And in the back of my mind, I still hear you
Calling to me, shouting to me, grabbing my attention

Want to go with you but I think I'll stay
Want to go with you but I think I'll stay
Want to go with you but I think I'll stay
Want to go with you but I think I'll stay

You say you feel trapped and do not see
An answer to the problem
I say you gotta get out
Just get up and get out
What are you afraid of
Living, loving, hurting, crying 
It's one and all, defend your fate, your destiny can be
What you make it 

Want to go with you but I think I'll stay
Want to go with you but I think I'll stay
Want to go with you but I think I'll stay
Want to go with you but I think I'll stay

And you come to me with propositions
Like you really mean them
Well I've heard them before
So many times before
What are you afraid of
Living, loving, hurting, crying 
It's one and all, defend your fate, your destiny can be
What you make it
