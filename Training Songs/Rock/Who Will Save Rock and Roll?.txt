I fall to my knees
And look to the sky
Who will save rock and roll?

Murray the k is not here today
So who will save rock and roll?

Every protest singer
Every guitar slinger
Every punk rock sinner sells his soul

My generation is not the salvation
So who will save rock and roll

I saw the stooges, covered with bruises
Who will save rock and roll?

Every mercenary
Three chord revolutionaries
Choose your side and choose it well

June 1st, 67 something died and went to heaven
I wish Sgt Pepper
Never taught the band to play

My generation
Is not the salvation
So who will save,
Who will save
Tell me who will save
Rock and...... roll
