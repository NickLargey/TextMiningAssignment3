Standin' outside,
lookin' over a place called home,
I couldn't stay,
leaves have fallen,
wind keeps blowin' colder,
winter's on its way,
my bags are packed,
the car is waitin',
my greatest fear,
you left alone,
once again my life sweet darling,
I've made my bed,
it's time to roam
Long live freedom where I come from,
place that I call home
Standin' outside,
sayin' goodbye,
it tears me up to go

Thousand miles oceans between us,
I think about her everyday,
this plane rides long,
these wheels keep rollin',
I call to see if she's OK,
it's dark and lonely all by herself,
it tears me up to walk away,
this time my sweet Nagyi darling I pray I'll see you once again

Long live freedom where I come from,
place that I call home
Standin' outside,
saying goodbye,
it tears me up to go

Kossuth Lajos azt üzente,
Elfogyott a regimentje
De ha mégegyszer azt üzeni,
Mindnyájunknak el kell menni,
Éljen a magyar szabadság!
Éljen a haza!
Esik es? karikára,
Kossuth Lajos kalapjára
Éljen a magyarság!
A magyar szabadság!
Éljen a haza!

Long live freedom where I come from,
place that I call home
Standin' outside,
sayin' goodbye,
it tears me up to go
Because I feel so scared when you're all alone
This plane rides long and I miss my home
I feel so scared when you're all alone
These wheels keep rollin' on and on, ohoh
