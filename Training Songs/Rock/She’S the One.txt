Yeah yeah, she's the one
Yeah yeah, she's the one

When I see her on the street
You know she makes my life complete
And you know I told you so
She's the one, she's the one

Yeah yeah, she's my girl
Yeah yeah, she's my girl

You know I'll never find a girl like you
But, in my heart
I'll always love you

Yeah yeah she's the one
Yeah yeah she's the one
