Let's hop a train 
And stow away 
Down into Mexico 

And on the way 
As music plays 
We'll let our beards grow tall 

She don't like me singing songs 
She don't want to sing along 

It's still the same 
She only likes me when I'm gone 

I spilled my drink 
Across the bar 
Said, "Baby what's your name?" 

Her boyfriend stood 
And smashed a bottle 
Over my head. 

She don't like me singing songs 
She don't want to sing along 

It's still the same 
She only likes me when I'm gone
