Remember how they always seemed to know
We had the forest in our eyes
But the earth was in our clothes
And they thought we'd fall
Not at all
So look back on the treasured days
We were young in a world that was so tired
Though it's not what we wanted before
Even the saints had to crawl from the floor 
Summers when the money was gone 
You'd sing all you're little songs 
That meant every thing to me

And I'll remember you
And the things that we used to do
And the things that we used to say
I'll remember you
That way

Remember how they tried to hold you down
And we climbed those towers 
And looked down upon our town
And everything you hoped would last
Just always becomes your past (it hurts)
Summers when the money was gone 
You'd sing all your little songs 
That meant everything to me 

And I'll remember you
And the things that we used to do
And the things that we used to say
I'll remember you
That way

But then this world 
Slipped through my fingers
And even the sun seemed tired
I still cared
As I lowered you down
My heart just jaded
In that moment the earth made no sound
But you were there
You helped me lift my pain into the air

And I'll remember you
And the things that we used to do
And the things that we used to say
I'll remember you
That way

If it don't hurt you
It won't hurt me
It don't hurt me
Then it won't hurt you
If it don't hurt you
It won't hurt me I know
