(For two days) she is an angel (the next day) heaven only knows
(She'd find out) and I'm happy until away she goes
(But she's changin') like the weather (first she's warm) then she's cold
(And will time make up to do friends) heaven only knows
(She's got a) sweet personality (I know it all) just how she is with me
(She's the one) it's very plain to see because it shows
(I love her so) from now to eternity (I want her) she's still in love with me
(Now and then) she's still the mystery heaven only knows
