Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Thinkin' about you
Thinkin' about you

Now I want to say
It's not the same since you went away
And it's not right
You're not here with me tonite

And it's a crime
Just a lying here wasting my precious time
I'm so lonely and I'm so blue
Thinkin' 'bout the things I could do to you

Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Thinkin' about you
Thinkin' about you

And I want to know
Don't you see how you hurt me so
Goin' outa my head
Yeh I'm feelin' it since you left

And it's a crime
Just a lying here wasting my precious time
I'm so lonely and I'm so blue
Thinkin' 'bout the things I could do to you

Everynight I rock
Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Thinkin' about you thinkin' about you
Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Everynight I rock myself to sleep

Thinkin' about you
Thinkin' about you

Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Thinkin' about you thinkin' about you
Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Everynight I rock myself to sleep
Everynight I rock myself to sleep
