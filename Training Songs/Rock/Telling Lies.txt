Step on the tracks
Feel you're alive
It's not any worse
Closer in time
It's like a perfect picture of
Ordinary life
You hit the bottom
To see if you're alive

You'll be here some time
(tears are in your eyes) 
Bending backwards to look behind
Pushing forward, killing in time
You thought it would change in time
You thought it would change your mind
You thought you'd be first in line
You thought it would change your life
It's like a perfect picture of
Ordinary life
You hit the bottom
To see if you're alive

You'll be here some time
(tears are in your eyes) 
You'll be better off not wasting your time
A sentimental heart is always last
In line
A sentimental heart is always last
In line
It's like a perfect picture of
Ordinary life
You hit the bottom
To see if you're alive

It's like a perfect picture of
Ordinary life
You hit the bottom
To see if you're alive
To see if you're alive
