I put my forehead to the door
And I heard the famous sound of infidelity
Looks like I loved and lost once more,
Oh, but all's fair in love and war supposedly
I couldn't even burst in on you
See scrabbling sheets hear your excuse
Give you the evil eye or verbal abuse

Why do you do what you do
When the things that you do hurt the person you are
Why do you do what you do
When the things that you do hurt the person you are

I slam my glass down on the bar
And my problems they hit the floor so gracefully
I don't know where I parked the car
But that's okay, tonight I'm on the town without me
Tonight it's just me and my evil twin
The one who slips one more drink in
The one who slips away, when I start sinking

Why do you do what you do
When the things that you do hurt the person you are
Why do you do what you do
When the things that you do hurt the person you are
The person you are

I got a job to pay the rent
Put people out of work by repositioning
Now no-one's sitting on the fence
Whose garden will we end up sitting in? 
It's getting much too hot to heal the sky
And it hurts too much to open up our eyes
To fundamental truths that we hold as lies

Why do we do what we do
When the things that we do hurt the people we are? 
Why do you do what you do
When the things that you do hurt the person you are? 
The person you are
The person you are
The person.
