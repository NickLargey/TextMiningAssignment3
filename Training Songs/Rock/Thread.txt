Find a thread to pull
and we can watch it unravel
'Cause we've been waiting with
A ghost of somewhere from 2 years ago

A hint of light in the dark
Only enough to keep from giving up
If I could go back to the start
To break the pattern forming between us

A needle dragging thread
To form the chapters only we could know
But they would override and cast a shadow on what little is left

A hint of light in the dark
Only enough to keep from giving up
If I could go back to the start
To break the pattern forming between us

Find a thread to pull
and we can watch it unravel
But this is just the start
Well find out who we are

A hint of light in the dark
Only enough to keep from giving up
If I could go back to the start
To break the pattern forming between us
