Let me tell you 'bout the Manfreds
The music that they're puttin' down
They started to play one rainy day
And the people came from miles around

They didn't come for the rhythm
They didn't come for the beat
The people of the town came just to stand around
And see the singer lookin' sweet

Mike Hugg plays the drums, yeah
Tom McGuiness lays it down on the bass
But the one in the middle sings "hey, diddle, diddle"
God, he's just a pretty face

They didn't come for the rhythm
They didn't come for the beat
The people of the town came just to stand around
And see the singer lookin' sweet

They couldn't have

Manfred Mann plays the organ
Mike Vickers plays guitar
And there's a geezer called Paul who's so thin and so tall
And sure wants to be a star

They didn't come for the rhythm
They did not come for the beat, oh no
The people of the town came just to stand around
And see the singer lookin' sweet

See the singer lookin'
See the singer lookin'
Well, see the singer lookin'
Watch me now, see the singer lookin', oh
Oh yeah, see the singer lookin'
Mmm-hmm, yeah, see the singer lookin'
Sweet
