We're the king and queen of hearts
Hold me when the music starts
All my dreams come true
When I dance with you
Promise me you're mine tonight
I won't wait in line tonight
While the lights are low
I'll never let you go

Did I dream that we danced forever
In a wish that we made together
On a night that I prayed would never end?
No it's not my imagination
Or a part of the orchestration
Love was here at the coronation
I'm the King and
You're the Queen of Hearts

Time will pass and tears will fall
But someday we'll both recall
Moments made of these
Golden memories

Did I dream that we danced forever
In a wish that we made together
On a night that I prayed would never end?
No it's not my imagination
Or a part of the orchestration
Love was here at the coronation
I'm the King and
You're the Queen
In a once and future dream
Where the dancers never seem to stop

Did I dream that we danced forever
In a wish that we made together
On a night that I prayed would never end?
No it's not my imagination
Or a part of the orchestration
Love was here at the coronation
I'm the King and
You're the Queen of Hearts
