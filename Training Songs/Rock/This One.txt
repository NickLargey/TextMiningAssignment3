Every day's the same got to play the game 
got to smile if you don't want to boring walks to walk boring talks to talk and you wish it would not be true If you're devastated put it all in this one if your world is jaded put it all in this one every night in vain every friend's the same just a lie and a wasted tear scared of coming home cause you're all alone will I make my way out of here if you're world is getting small without all the things you thought it's all about If the pressure of a brand new day with the sunlight starts to fade away
