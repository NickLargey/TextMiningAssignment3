Scratch card glory, waist low pleasure?
Black eyes nose bleeds, don't look back now
My white abode, do you remember? My white abode
But it's such a thrill you'll soon find out
Sorry you're not a winner with the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got to lose but false intentions and a life so pretentious?

Scratch card glory, waist low pleasure?
Black eyes nose bleeds, don't look back now
My white abode, do you remember? My white abode
But it's such a thrill just to find out
Sorry you're not a winner with the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got to lose but false intentions and a life so pretentious?

Scratch card glory, waist low pleasure?
Black eyes nose bleeds, don't look back now
My white abode, do you remember? I sweat, I ache.
Sorry you're not a winner with the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got to lose but false intentions and a life so pretentious?

What? What? What?

Goodbye, Go home.
