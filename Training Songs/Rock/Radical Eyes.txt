If speed is what you need in this security mess
Your homeland history you want to disposses
If you need anything else to make me bleed
That you wanna blame me for what I read
Well I’m home down a way from ducking your drones
F*ck alone curses roams on this microphone
Saying I can run, say it I can hide
See the spies around the corner cause I'm rage-i-fied

They didn’t hear my cry, he said f*ck my crises

The say I'm radicalized
(See my radical eyes)
The say we're radicalized
(See your radical eyes)
The say I'm radicalized
(See my radical eyes)
The say we're radicalized
(See my radical eyes)

They say we’re saying with this
They say we’re saying with that
They say we’re saying with this
They say we’re saying with that
They say we’re saying with this
They say we’re saying with that
They say we’re saying with this
They say we’re saying with that

Let’s get inside your head
Why don’t you take these meds
What I’m conveying mind or mayhem more blood gets shed
You witness on the daily we ignore it instead
You can post it in the morning for the views in the spreads
Put that like on line
Easy flow it's brutal
Can’t resist don’t even try
All attempts are futile
Now your part of the twist
You’ve distracted again
Your fell asleep when you woke forty five full of wind

They didn’t hear my cry, he said f*ck my crises

The say I'm radicalized
(See my radical eyes)
The say we're radicalized
(See your radical eyes)
The say I'm radicalized
(See my radical eyes)
The say we're radicalized
(See my radical eyes)

They say we’re saying with this
They say we’re saying with that
They say we’re saying with this
They say we’re saying with that
They say we’re saying with this
They say we’re saying with that
They say we’re saying with this
They say we’re saying with that

The say I'm radicalized
(See my radical eyes)
The say we're radicalized
(See your radical eyes)
The say I'm radicalized
(See my radical eyes)
The say we're radicalized
(See your radical eyes)

See my radical, radical, radical (eyes)
