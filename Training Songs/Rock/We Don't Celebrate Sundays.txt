Come, smash up your seats tonight
Sippin'on wine
I'm fine
The music keeps me up all night
Cause I'm full of lust
Come with us
Run for your lives

I'm only lonely when the music's over
Lonely when you're going home

[Chorus:]
We don't celebrate Sundays anymore
(we don't celebrate Sundays)
My good church is not open on Sundays
(we don't celebrate Sundays)

Touched, touched by that amazing sound
My blood begins to boil
A celebration to the night
Cause I'm full of lust
Come with us
Let's spend the night

There's no, no religion in my house
No thick people in my house

[Chorus:]
We don't celebrate... 

We don't celebrate Sundays anymore

[Churos:]
We don't celebrate...

Come, smash up your seats tonight
(we don't celebrate Sundays)
I said come, celebration to the night
(we don't celebrate Sundays)
I said come, smash up your seats tonight
(we don't celebrate Sundays)
I said come, celebration to the night
(we don't celebrate Sundays)

(we don't celebrate Sundays)
