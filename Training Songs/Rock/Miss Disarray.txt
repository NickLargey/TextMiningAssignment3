Your such a mystery, its never clear to me
Your always leaving me second guessin'
And all I want to know, is baby where you go
Where you've been when you come up missin'

Miss Disarray, (Miss Disarray)

[Chorus]
You swim in the pourin' rain, and I'm holding on in vain
The more I try, the more that I just feel so far away
Miss Disarray, Miss Disarray

We started carelessly, leading you to me
Kisses sweet, but complicated
A happy ending girl, I knew you'd never be
Burn so bright, but sadly faded

Miss Disarray, (Miss Disarray)

[Chorus]

You swim in the pourin' rain, and I'm holding on in vain

The more I try, the more that I just feel so far away
Miss Disarray, Miss Disarray

There's no pretending, that happy endings will ever see me through
So the story goes and I'm not over you

Kisses sweet, but complicated
Burnin' bright, but sadly faded

[Chorus]

Miss Disarray
We swim in the pourin' rain
The more I try, the more that I just feel so far away
Miss Disarray, we swim in the pourin' rain
The more I try, the more that I just feel so far away
Miss Disarray, Miss Disarray, Miss Disarray, Miss Disarray.
