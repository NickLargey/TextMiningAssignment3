Surrounded by a faceless crowd
An operational decline, system closure
Abandoned aerials all around
Scrambling pictures crackling sounds, failing senses
Communication cutting out
The airwaves must be breaking down
Intercepted. call disrupted

Dissection starts with just a cut
Another specimen prepared
For incision
The surgeon brandished the knife
He whispers 'this won't hurt a bit'
Maybe a little, it's just procedure

First step through the door
And I've been here once before
Back then in control
Held tight in my hands
And I threw it all away
To glimpse the other side
Eyes sunk in my head
Hesitation will be death
Push back kick it out

Bring down the satellite
