Well I came out to see the sunrise
I find myself just laying down in your eyes
Trying hard to reach inside to your mind
Stay with me and I'll change things in your life
But you look like you don't care
You stammer and you swear

Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
With you

Oh I don't need to see you social
I say I do but that's a lie I taught you
Oh lying by your side
Tongue tied mesmerized I try

Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
With you

Weather is in disarray
Like all the things I've seen today
Come on take me away
Oh is it the clothes you wear
The color of your hair
Or your eyes they shine and shine and shine

Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
With you

Ah which way should I jump
Ah which way should I jump
Ah which way should I jump
Ah which way should I jump
