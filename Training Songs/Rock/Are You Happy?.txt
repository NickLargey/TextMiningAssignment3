You say you got a big house out in the country
With a ruddy great swimming pool
You say you got a lot of things I never had, that's true
But are you happy
Are you happy
Are you happy
When you get right down to the nitty gritty
Are you happy you
You say you got boyfriends calling you up
Every other day of the week
And that you got more now then you could ever need
But are you happy
Are you happy
Are you happy
When you get right down to the nitty gritty
Are you happy
You can find happiness
In a hole in your sock
You can be fully dressed
In a coat that's a frock
You can stand in the rain when it's raining
And not think it's not sunny
You say you got a car parked out in the drive
That you've not even driven yet
And that you got another one that you can use instead
But are you happy
Are you happy
Are you happy
When you get right down to the nitty gritty
Are you happy
Are you happy
Are you happy you
What about love
Money couldn't buy it and that's the crazy thing
When you've had enough of trying to deny it
Look what love can bring
But are you happy
Are you happy
Are you happy
When you get right down to the nitty gritty
Are you happy
You can be who you are
Without having to prove
In a sense who you are
With attempts that are crude
Buying acres of land that you won't even use
Is not the answer
You say you got an aunt
Whose cousin is married to a relative of the queen
And that you get invited to every social scene
But are you happy
Are you happy
Are you happy
Are you happy
Are you happy
Are you happy
Are you happy
When you get right down to the nitty gritty
Are you happy
Are you happy
Are you happy you
