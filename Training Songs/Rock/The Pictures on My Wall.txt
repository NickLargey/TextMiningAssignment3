Can you hear it?
The sound of
Something burning
Something changing
On the merry-go-round
Tonight

The pictures on my wall
Are about to swing and fall
Love it all
Love it all

Ooh, we should have
Should have got it right
Ooh, we should have
Should have got it right
Tonight

People come
I count everyone
Faces burning
Hearts beating
Nowhere left for us
To run

The pictures on my wall
Are about to swing and fall
Love it all
Love it all

Ooh, we should have
Should have got it right
Ooh, we should have
Should have got it right
Tonight

Can you hear it?
The sound of
Someone thinking
Someone thinking
On the merry-go-round
Tonight

The pictures on my wall
Are about to swing and fall
Love it all
Don't you just love it
All
