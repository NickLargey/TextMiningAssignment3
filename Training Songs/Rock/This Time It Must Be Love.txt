When I was a little boy
Sat up on my Daddy's knee
Said Dad there's something buggin' me
There's a word I looked it up
The definition ain't enough
What is the meaning of love?

He said when you don't know what's up or down
Your head is spinning all around
Your feet don't seem to touch the ground

Yeah you won't know from push or shove
Boy you feel the pounding of your heart
You know that you're in love

I am torn apart
What's this pounding in my heart
I can't walk away
Feeling stronger everyday
I can't sleep at night
I fear it might be tragic
I ain't eating right
This time it might be magic
What's come over me
Don't think that I can stand it
It's really got a hold on me
This time it must be love

Daddy told me about the bees
About the birdies in the trees
Love was still a mystery to me
Stand out in the pouring rain
Jump into a roaring flame
When you're in love boy you don't feel no pain

I am torn apart
Lord it's tearing me apart
I can't walk away
Gotta be a better way
I can't sleep at night
I fear it might be tragic
I ain't eating right
This time it might be magic
What's come over me
Don't think that I can stand it
It's really got a hold on me
This time it must be love

Now I know the reason why
I don't know when to laugh or cry
This time it must be love
I don't know from black or white
I don't know from day or night
This time it must be love

I am torn apart
What's this pounding in my heart
I can't walk away
Feeling stronger everyday
I can't sleep at night
I fear it might be tragic
I ain't eating right
This time it might be magic
What's come over me
Don't think that I can stand it
It's really got a hold on me
This time it must be love

This time it must be
This time it must be love
This time it must be
This time it must be love
This time it must be
This time it must be love
