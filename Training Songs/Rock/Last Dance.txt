Today I feel the mood
And I don't feel like talking oh ho a waha
I wasn't ready to lose you
You're the first man to move me yeah
You help me feel alive 
Got me up from nine to five oh ho a waha
I could get through those days
With you on my mind yeah

Gotta try and move on, but I promise you
I will kiss your crown when life takes me down

I saved my last dance for you my friend
I saved my last dance for you my friend

And all the seats in the crowd
Oh people love to move now oh ho a waha
I just can't feel the beat
'Cause my heart's fallen out yeah

Gotta try and move on but I promise you
I will kiss your crown when life takes me down
