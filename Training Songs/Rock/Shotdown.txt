Owwwww!

Maybe it's the moonlight, somethin' doesn't feel right
Won't you come along with me, oh yeah
You know I'm not crazy, just a little lazy
Won't you take a chance, won't you come along with me
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah

Maybe it's the moonlight, maybe it's the rock 'n' roll, oh yeah
Maybe it's the moonlight, maybe it's the rock 'n' roll, yeah
But I don't wanna be lonely
Don't wanna be shotdown, shotdown, no more, no more
I don't wanna be lonely
Don't wanna be be shotdown, be shotdown

Baby what's your answer, there's somethin' that I'm after
Somethin' I can have for free, oh yeah
Tell me that it's alright, talk about your stage fright
Really got me uptight, baby what you want from me
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah (oh yeah)

Maybe it's the moonlight, maybe it's the rock 'n' roll, oh yeah
Maybe it's the moonlight, maybe it's the rock 'n' roll, oh yeah
But I don't wanna be lonely
Don't wanna be shotdown no more, no more, no more
I don't wanna be lonely
Don't wanna be be shotdown, be shotdown

Hey you

I don't wanna be lonely
Don't wanna be shotdown, shotdown, no more, no more
I don't wanna be lonely
Don't wanna be be shotdown
I don't wanna be lonely
Don't wanna be shotdown no more, no more, no more
I don't wanna be lonely
Don't wanna be be shotdown, be shotdown, be shotdown
Shotdown no more
