Well you're smoulderin' with fly words
Catch the moment on the run
And you say there's nothin' easy
About the plywood tract you're from

And you stand inside your wind stilts
Watch the sentence act begun
So you say you lost your baby
Don't you know that you're the one?

And you stand and watch the trials go
From here to there behind the scene
Throw your troubles to the moon trolls
To swallow up like stormy dreams

Take an entrance to a stand-off
Looking if there's such a strife
And you say you lost your baby
Wondering if it's in your life

And you fly your flags on Mondays
That take a rise and fall in one
Ask the questions of the pilgrims
That come to pledge what's all that's done

Claim a tabernacle hillside
Where you'll watch the dyin' sun
And you say you lost your baby
Don't you know that you're the one?
So you say you lost your baby
Don't you know that you're the one?
So you say you lost your baby
Don't you know that you're the one?
