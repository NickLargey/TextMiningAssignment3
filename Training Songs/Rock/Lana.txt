Oh, beautiful Lana
I told it my mama
And my dad
What I had

Was the sweetest
And the neatest
Little girl
In the world

Oh la-la-la-la Lana
La-la-la-la Lana
Oh Lana (ah, ah ah ah)

Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh Lana
Don't make me blue
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh Lana
Don't you know, don't you know I love you

Oh beautiful Lana
Don't you know that I want to
Hug and kiss you
Make you know that I miss you

While we're apart
Oh my heart
All it can say is L-a-n-a
L-a-n-a, hey
L-a-n-a, hey
L-a-n-a, hey hey

Oh oh oh oh oh Lana
Oh oh oh oh Lana
