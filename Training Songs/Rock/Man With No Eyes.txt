Stalemate
In the city, all alone
I'm an orphan of the world
No pity, got no home

They measure your hopes and dreams
In dollar$ and cents
Fear and loathing is their national dept    

The man with no eyes
Takes you by surprise
Breaks into your soul to terrorize

We got famine while you feast
We got new kinds of disease
And it's so hard to make end meets
In the belly of the beast

Just when you think you got it made
You get caught in the net
Sometimes it's hard to remember
But you'll never forget

The man with no eyes
Takes you by surprise
Breaks into your soul to terrorize
The man with no eyes
Takes you by surprise
Slips into your dreams to terrorize    

Won't let me eat, won't let me sleep
Can't buy safety, it takes more than greed
Can't steal my power, it has no rules
The eleventh hour I'll be coming through
