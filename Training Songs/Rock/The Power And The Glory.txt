What if I were to disobey
Give you back the power
Would I be punished like a child
And left on my own
Would you think me ungrateful
And send me away
If I couldn't make you happy

Cause empty handed leaving
As I was when I came
Tiptoeing through the rubble
And running through the flames 
And running through the flames 
And running through the flames 
And running through the flames 

What if I were to disobey
Give you back the power
Would you be the one to turn your back
And cast the first stone
Would you think me a coward
Though I be the hero
And come home a hero

I gave you back your power
I gave you back your glory
Well really I hadn't noticed
Until I had the power to give it all back
Until I felt the glory
When the buildings collapsed
When the buildings collapsed

Cause empty handed leaving
As I was when I came
Tiptoeing through the rubble
And running through the flames 
And running through the flames 
And running through the flames 
And running through the flames 

I gave you back your power
I gave you back your glory
Well really I hadn't noticed
Until I had the power to give it all back
Until I felt the glory
When the buildings collapsed
When the buildings collapsed

I gave you back your power
I gave you back your glory 
I gave you back your glory 
I gave you back your glory
