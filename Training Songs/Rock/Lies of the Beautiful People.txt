Well this ain't no sideshow
This is the great unknown
This is the poison we take
Yeah

Outside the velvet rope
Standing there all alone
Are the grotesque and ashamed
Yeah

Well if you think real beauty's on the outside
Well that's a far cry
From the truth

Maybe all the information you received
Well you should not believe
There's no proof

Save yourself from all the lies of the beautiful people
It's time to run from the lies of the beautiful people

I feel so traumatized
Doped up and televised
Life can be cruel and insane
Yeah

But we've got these ugly scars
On our infected hearts
Maybe it's time for a change
Yeah

And if you think real beauty's on the outside
Well that's a far cry
From the truth

Maybe all the information you received
Well you should not believe
There's no proof

Save yourself from all the lies of the beautiful people
It's time to run from the lies of the beautiful people

Save yourself from all the lies of the beautiful people
Just run and hide from the lies of the beautiful

Save yourself from all the lies of the beautiful people
It's time to run from the lies of the beautiful people
