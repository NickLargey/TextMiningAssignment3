Life, a movie in my head 
A page of lines we read 
The words remain unsaid 

Time, a race you never win 
Look back at where we've been 
And throw the towel in 

[Chorus]
Every time I see a sign 
Tell me what's the bottom line 
Tell Me 
I just want to take my turn 
Now before I crash and burn 
Yeah 

Hope, a candle burning bright 
A temporary light 
'Till we return tonight 

Love, the mighty drug we crave 
The master and the slave 
Will rule us to our grave 

Every time I see a sign 
Tell me what's the bottom line 
Tell Me 
I just want a place to rest, 
Count to four and catch my breath 
One, two, three, four

I don't know what to feel 
Don't know what to say 
Don't know what to do 

I don't know where to go 
Don't know who to be 
Don't know who to know 

Life is never what it seems 
It shakes you from your dreams 
Wake up and start to 
Every time I see a sign 
Tell me what's the bottom line 
Tell Me 
I just want a place to rest 
Stop and let me catch my breath

Every time I see a sign 
Tell me what's the bottom line 
Tell Me 
Forget all that I've been told 
I just want to lose control 

Every time I see a sign 
Tell me what's the bottom line 
Tell Me 
I just want to take my turn 
Now before I crash and burn
