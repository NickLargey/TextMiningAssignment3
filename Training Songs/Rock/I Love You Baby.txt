Ohoho I love you baby, I love you so
I need your honey, I'll never let you go
Cause you're the girl in my life
You're the one I adore
And I, I, I love you 

As I walk by the seaside
As I walk through the grass
I see little bluebirds making love while I pass
Bees are humming there's a singing everywhere
Everyone's in love 

Ohoho I love you baby, I love you so
I need your honey, I'll never let you go
Cause you're the girl in my life
You're the one I adore
And I, I, I love you 

As I walk by the schoolyard
As I walk by the gate
I hear the weeping willow where we kissed on every day
And carved in a bark you and an arrow and a heart
And underneath it says 

Ohoho I love you baby, I love you so
I need your honey, I'll never let you go
Cause you're the girl in my life
You're the one I adore
And I, I, I love you
And I, I, I love you
And I, I, I love you 

And I, I, I love you
