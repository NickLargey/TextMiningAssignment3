I want to hold you in my arms 'till you say "turn me loose"
I want to do little things to you 'till you say "It ain't no use"
I want to wake you every morning with a good morning kiss
I want to kiss you to sleep the same way cause I, I know you like this
I want to do everything for you
Cause that's all that a man can do
When he loves a woman like I love you
And I love ya, love ya, love ya
I want to say sweet things to you 'till you say I've said enough
I want to stand right by your side when the goin' gets tough
I want to mend your broken heart till you say the hurt is gone
I want tostay with you always so that you won't be alone
I want to do everything for you
'Cause that's all that a man can do
When he loves a woman like I love you
And I love ya, love ya, love ya
I want to work for you every day 'till you say "come home and rest"
I want to buy you pretty little things so you can look your best
I want to take you every where so the world can see what I got
I want to treat you with tender love 'till you say I've got to stop
I want to do everything for you
'Cause that's all that a man can do
When he loves a woman like I love you
And I love ya, love ya, love ya
I want to do everything for you
'Cause that's all that a man can do
When he loves a woman like I love you
And I love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya
