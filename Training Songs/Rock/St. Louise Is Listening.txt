I stopped the thought before its drip became insistent,
I rubbed it out and loved the spot where it were missing,
She's widely known the only maquereau that pays her taxes,
I got to box her for the money, said it might end up
Reeling and stumbling,
I've got to bump around awhile.

You don't use words like that.
St. Louise is listening.
You didn't use words like that.
St. Louise is listening.

You rang the Eskimo to meet you at the station.
Oh, he's like milk to you, half Swedish and half Asian.
And your aphasia strikes out a bargain with the barter yard.
I got to box you for the money, said it might end up
Reeling and stumbling, I've got to bump around awhile.

You don't use words like that.
St. Louise is listening.
You didn't use words like that.
St. Louise is listening.

Let me get up on it, let me up on it,
let me, let me, let me get up on it,
Let me get up on it.

Let me get up on it, let me up on it,
let me, let me, let me get up on it,
Let me get up on it.

I could be your baby doll,
I could be your doll, baby
I can be the thing you want,
I could do it all for you,
I could be your baby doll.
I could be your baby doll,
I could be your doll, baby
I could do it all for you.

You don't use words like that.
St. Louise is listening.
Uh huh, uh huh
You didn't use words like that.
St. Louise is listening.

Let me get up on it, let me up on it,
Let me get up on it, let me up on it,
Let me get up on it, let me up on it,
let me, let me,
Let me get up on it, let me up on it,
Let me get up on it, let me up on it,
let me, let me,
Let me get up on it, let me up on it.

Let me get up on it, let me up on it,
let me, let me.
Let me get up on it, let me up on it,
let me, let me.
