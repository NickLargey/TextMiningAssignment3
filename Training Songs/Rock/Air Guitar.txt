Don't care too much about destruction
Just care that my body can function
Quick to the point, to the point, I'm vacant
Whoopin MCs like a pound of bacon
 
(Chorus)
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
High hat, or a souped up tempo
Backbeat and a diddly ahh
I played air guitar and the place shook over
I played air guitar and the place shook over Ã¢?? ohh woh o-oh
I played air guitar and the place shook over
 
Its not hard to find confrontation 
When you got a bad reputation
I wanna piece, piece of the action 
Cos I need my satisfaction
 
When 12 0'clock comes around and
I've been chasing the car down
Did you see my hands touch the ceiling 
I'm on a roll, it's time to go rolling
I played air guitar and the place shook over
 
Take me away to the place that's in your eyes
Its not far away just one step from paradise
I played air guitar and the place
Shook over
Woah Oh
