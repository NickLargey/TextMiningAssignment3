These are the words
That cry out of me in the night
Like a buffalo herd
From a shotgun blast scattered in flight
I got a one track mind
Going down a one train line
Living on dreams half the time
Going West 

I gotta pick up speed
Just to get what I need
The end of the line guaranteed
Your love is my rest 

The coal catches fire
I'm down the wire in a flash
That big old smoke stack
Is belching out black smoke and ash
So sad to think of
Hurting the one you love
But surely that's what leaving does
You'd know best 

I gotta pick up speed
Just to get what I need
The end of the line guaranteed
Your love is my rest
Your love is my rest 

We pass through the land
Of Custer's last stand
And I grin
So this is where old Yellow Hair's
Ghost dance begins
I got the blood on my hands
Can't even live where I stand
I'm just a traveling man
Cursed or blessed 

I gotta pick up speed
Just to get what I need
The end of the line guaranteed
Your love is my rest
Your love is my rest
Your love is my rest
