No evolution
Sometimes it depresses me
The same old same
Oh we keep repeating history
The institution curses curiosity
ItÂ´s our conviction
Sex is not the enemy

A revolution is the solution

I wonÂ´t feel guilty
No matter what theyÂ´re telling me
I wonÂ´t feel dirty and buy into their misery
I wonÂ´t be shamed cause I believe that love is free
It fuels the heart and sex is not my enemy

A revolution is the solution

True love is like gold
ThereÂ´s not enough to go around
But then thereÂ´s god and doesnÂ´t god love everyone?
Give me a choice
Give me a chance to turn the key and find my voice
Sex is not the enemy

A revolution is the solution
Sex is not the enemy
