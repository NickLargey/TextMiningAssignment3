Tonight I cried the tears of a child
Who knows what fear runs deep and wild
Inside
But the river's in flood tonight

I lay down and the light streamed across my face
I felt the beauty of some deeper grace
And I tried
To find my way to the other side

I feel your skin as smooth as silk
Drunk like a baby on his mama's milk
Take me down under the wishing tree
Lay your healing hands on me

Been a long time riding this deserted train
There's no messiahs out here, baby
But I found the holy grail all right
Cause I'm lying in your arms tonight
Yeah

Lay your healing hands on me
