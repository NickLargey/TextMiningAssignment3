Love, lovely love
You got a way that's so exciting
I don't mind the pain
Of that burning flame

You know it's true
I've got the feelin' too
Hey, why don't you take
Whatever you want from me?

I'm in the mood
For all the lovin' that I can't see
Is this for real now?
Oh, I ask you now, can it be?

Love, lovely love
You movin' sweet inside of someone
Comes a thunder rain
And a hurricane

It's coming through
Straight from me to you
Why don't you take
Whatever you want from me?

I'm in the mood
For all the lovin' that I can't see
Is this for real now?
Oh, I ask you now, can it be?

Love, lovely love
You do a dance that's so inviting
I don't know the way
Or the words to say

But I know it's you
I've got the feelin' too
Why don't you take
Whatever you want from me

I'm in the mood
For all the lovin' that I can't see
Is this for real now?
Oh, I ask you now, can it be?

Love, lovely love, love, lovely love
Love, lovely love, love, lovely love
Love, lovely love, love, lovely love
Love, lovely love, love, lovely love

Love, lovely love, love, lovely love
Love, lovely love, love, lovely love
Love, lovely love, love, lovely love

You got a way that's so exciting
I don't mind the pain
Or that burning flame
But I know it's true
I get the feelin' too

Now, why don't you take
Whatever you want from me?
I'm in the mood
For all the lovin' that I can't see

Is this for real?
Oh, I ask you now, can it be?
Oh, why don't you take it?
Whatever you want from me

I'm in the mood
For all the lovin' that I can't see
Is this for real?
Oh, I ask you now, can it be?

Oh, why don't you take it?
Whatever you want from me
I'm in the mood
For all the lovin' that I can't see

Is this for real?
