They were gonna meet
On a Rocky Mountain street
Two bashful hearts beat in advance
Their hands were gonna sweat
It was all set
She ain`t showed up yet
Still a good chance

 It`s a love untold
 It`s a love untold 

Checking on her face
Checks his sleeve for his ace
And both just in case wear clean underwear
Games would be played
Excuses would be made
The stupid things they said
In their prayers

 Oh about a love untold
 It`s a love untold 

Soft hands slowly move across the blank white page
Thinking of words for my silent lips and fingers to obey

They were gonna meet on a crummy little street
It never came to be I`m told
Does anyone recall the saddest love of all
The one that lets you fall nothing to hold
 It`s the love untold...
 Once upon a love untold 
 Just another love untold 

They were gonna meet on a crummy little street
We were gonna meet on a crummy little street
