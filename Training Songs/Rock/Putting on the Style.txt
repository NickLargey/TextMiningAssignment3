Sweet sixteen goes to church 
Just to see the boys 
Laughs and screams and giggles 
At every little noise 
Turns her face a little 
And turns her head awhile 
But everybody knows she's 
Only putting on the style 

She's putting on the agony 
Putting on the style 
That's what all the young folks 
Are doing all the while 
And as I look around me 
I sometimes have to smile 
Seeing all the young folks 
Putting on the style 

Well the young man in the hot rod car 
Driving like he's mad 
With a pair of yellow gloves 
He's borrowed from his dad 
He makes it roar so lively 
Just to make his girlfriend smile 
But she knows he's only 
Putting on the style 

He's putting on the agony 
Putting on the style 
That's what all the young folks 
Are doing all the while 
And as I look around me 
I sometimes have to smile 
Seeing all the young folks 
Putting on the style 

Preacher in the pulpit 
Roars with all his might 
Sing Glory Halleluja 
Puts the folks all in a fright 
Now you might think it's satan 
That's a-coming down the aisle 
But it's only our poor preacher boys 
That's putting on his style 

Putting on the agony 
Putting on the style 
That's what all the young folks 
Are doing all the while 
And as I look around me 
I sometimes have to smile 
Seeing all the young folks 
Putting on the style 

Putting on the agony 
Putting on the style 
That's what all the young folks 
Are doing all the while 
And as I look around me 
I sometimes have to smile 
Seeing all the young folks 
Putting on the style 

Putting on the agony 
Putting on the style 
That's what all the young folks 
Are doing all the while 
And as I look around me 
I sometimes have to smile 
Seeing all the young folks 
Putting on the style 
MY OLD MAN'S A DUSTMAN - 31/03/1960  
4 weeks at #1 - 13 weeks on chart 

Now here's a little story 
To tell it is a must 
About an unsung hero 
That moves away the dust 

Some people make a fortune 
Others earn a mint 
My old man don't earn much 
In fact he's bloomin' skint 

Oh my old man's a dustman 
He wears a dustman's hat 
He wears cor blimey trousers 
And he lives in a council flat 
He looks a proper 'nana 
In his great big hob nailed boots 
He's got such a job to pull 'em up 
That he calls 'em daisy roots 

Some folks give tips at christmas 
And some of them forget 
So when he picks their bins up 
He spills some on the step 
Now one old man got nasty 
And to the council wrote 
Next time my old man went round there 
He punched him up the throat 

Oh my old man's a dustman 
He wears a dustman's hat 
He wears cor blimey trousers 
And he lives in a council flat 

I say I say Les 
(Yeah) 
I found a police dog in my dustbin 
(How do you know it was a police dog) 
He had a policeman with him 

Though my old mans a dustman 
He's got an 'art of gold 
He got married recently 
Though he's 86 years old 
We said 'ere hang on dad 
You're getting past your prime 
He said well when you get my age 
It 'elps to pass the time 

Oh my old man's a dustman 
He wears a dustman's hat 
He wears cor blimey trousers 
And he lives in a council flat 

I say I say I say 
My dustbin's full of lilies 
(Well throw'em away then) 
I can't lily's wearing 'em 

Now one day whilst in a hurry 
He missed a ladies bin 
He hadn't gone but a few yards 
When she chased after him 
What game d'you think you're playing 
She cried right from the 'art 
You've missed me am I too late 
Nah jump up on the cart 

Oh my old man's a dustman 
He wears a dustman's hat 
He wears cor blimey trousers 
And he lives in a council flat 

I say I say I say 
(Not you again) 
My dustbin's absolutely full with toadstools 
(How d'you know it's full) 
Cuz there's not mushroom inside 

He found a tiger's head one day 
Nailed to a piece of wood 
The tiger looked quite miserable 
But I suppose he should 
Just then from out the window 
A voice began to wail 
He said Oy where's me tigers head 
Four feet from his tail 

Oh my old man's a dustman 
He wears a dustman's hat 
He wears cor blimey trousers 
And he lives in a council flat 

Next time you see a dustman 
Looking all pale and sad 
Don't kick him in the dustbin 
It might me my old dad
