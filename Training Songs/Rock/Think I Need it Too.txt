Must've forgotten something
How to forget how to be true
Covered myself in nothing
Don't touch me and i won't touch you
Tryin' to remember something
Why am I here and who are you?
You must admit something
Animals came in two by two

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
I think I need it too
I think I need it too
I think I need it too

Just as I thought I'm thinking
How can I change when I don't want to
Kept getting caught
Kept drinking
How can I blame what I got to
Putting the wheels in motion
Autopilot I can't drive
Covered in chalomine lotion
Scratching my ? bee stung

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you want
Whatever you need

I think I need it too
I think I need it too
I think I need it too

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you want
Whatever you need

I think I need it too
I think I need it too
I think I need it too
