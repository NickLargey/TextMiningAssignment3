I'll warn you, if cornered, I'll scratch my way out of the pen 
Wired, an animal 
The claustrophobia begins 
You think I'm scared of girls 
Well maybe 
But I'm not afraid of you 
You want to scare me then you'll cling to me no matter what I do 
Tell you a secret 
They shared a needle once or twice 
I loved her, she loved me 
We slept together a couple of times 
You think I'm proud of this 
Well maybe 
But the shame you never lose 
Infatuated with a lunatic and cornered by the muse 
And it goes down every might 
This must be what jail is really like 
And I will scratch my way out of this pen, again 
Lonely? 
Maybe 
Or maybe not 
It all depends 
Your ideal, your image 
Your definition of a friend 
If what you're shoveling is company 
Then I'd rather be alone 
Resentment always goes much further than it was supposed to go
