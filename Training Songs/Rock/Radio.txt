One child, he follow the sound, to a far away place
Lonely old town, chasing your dream
Guitar on your back, fire in your heart
You live like a rebel, you know what you want
Blood hot and ready, you're breaking away
You rock steady, you'll make it some day
You're on the radio, ah, oh yeah
You're on the radio, well on and on you go
Taking your chance, you reach for a star
There's no looking back, you know who you are
You know who you are

Gunslinger you shoot from the hip, 
And now it's your time, you never quit
Blood hot and ready, you're breaking away
You rock steady, you'll make it some day
You're on the radio, ah, oh yeah
You're on the radio, well on and on you go
You're on the radio

Wings over waving sun, play me tough, play me loud
Believe in your dream, believe in your dreams

Taking your chance, you reach for a star, 
There's no looking back, you know who you are
Blood hot and ready, you're breaking away
You rock steady, you'll make it some day
On the radio, let it rock
You're on the radio, on and on and oh
You're on the radio, let it rock, let it roll
On the radio, yeah
You're on the radio, ah, oh on the radio
Let it rock, let it roll
On the radio, you're on the radio, yeah you're on the radio
On the radio, oh ah yeah you're on the radio 
Let it rock, let it roll
On the radio you're on the radio
