Straight from the middle right up to the top
Eat or be eaten by the cream of the crop
A smell of burning way down in your soul
When you taught to steal you're never alone 
And you fall to the ground
Upon your knees - testify 
Bruised and beaten, broken bones
Running so hard you can never go home
You live your life on a torture wheel
Gripped by a breeze of cold blue steel
When you fall to the ground
Upon your knees - testify 
Sail into a sea of hell
Oh, you do it so very well
This life you lead will never leave you alone
Testify - testify 
Down on your knees and testify
Straight from the middle right up to the top
Eat or be eaten by the cream of the crop
A smell of burning way down in your soul
When you taught to steal you're never alone 
When you fall to the ground
Upon your knees - testify 
Fall to the ground
Upon your knees - testify
Fall to the ground
Upon your knees - testify
