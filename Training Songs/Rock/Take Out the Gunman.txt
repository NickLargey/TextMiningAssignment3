Awoke where the light
Hit me right in the temple
Felt something cold
Touch my toes as it passed

Might not be the face you'd expect
But he's clearly insane
Got me pegged in the back

Just need a bit of the camera
Point the gun at the eyes
Or at the knees, had to shoot, had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

Bit of the camera
Made a run for our lives
Take out the knees, had to choose, had to find
Gonna take out the gunman

Eyes huge, so little left of something
Cracks and clues, he's crazy as a straw
Why denied, does no one care or nothing
How, you ask, I ever last so long

'Cause I, I went blind, a blinding riot
He's regretting every word
Those empty lies
One more tonight, a blinding riot
As I summon every nerve

Just need a bit of the camera
Point the gun at the eyes
Or at the knees, had to shoot, had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

A bit of the camera
Made a run for our lives
Take out the knees, had to choose, had to find
Gonna take out the gunman
Gonna take out the gunman
Gonna take out the gunman

I'm gonna take out
I'm gonna take out
I'm gonna take out
I'm gonna take out

Just need a bit of the camera
Point the gun at the eyes
Or at the knees, had to shoot, had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

Bit of the camera
Made the run for our lives
I'm so amazed at the way it was televised
Gonna take out the gunman
Gonna take out the gunman
I'm gonna take out the gunman
I'm gonna take out the gunman
