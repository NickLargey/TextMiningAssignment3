I know what you think of me but I had to move on
I know I'm landing on my feet and the hating's gone
Well, here I go down this path again
They say every road must come to an end
When the sun rises then falls into the dawn
Said everybody knows what's going on

All my blood has been forgotten
And all my tears have dried alone

Until the end begins
It seems that everything is coming back again
The end begins
Sometimes you have to start where you begin

I will rise above this thing you imprinted on me
And I will embrace all the pain and a need I will feel
'Cause it's given me sons but I won't give up
You can push me around but I won't shut up
I may fall to the ground but I won't get stuck
I can do it myself, I don't need your luck

Many words I haven't spoken
For everything I've held within

Until the end begins
It seems that everything is coming back again
The end begins
Sometimes you have to start where you begin

'Cause everybody's got to fight sometimes
Everybody's got to try sometimes
Even though it's hard to see the light
You will never know the time is right

Until the end begins
It seems that everything is coming back again
The end begins
Sometimes you have to start where you begin

The end begins
It seems that everything is coming back again
The end begins
Sometimes you have to start where you begin
