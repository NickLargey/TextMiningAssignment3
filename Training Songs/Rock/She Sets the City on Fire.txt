Everybody knows she's a perfect ten
And I'm hanging on tight til the whole thing ends
'Cause New York sky don't get much brighter
She sets, she sets the city on fire

Somebody told me
If I'm not careful, well, this one's gonna roll me
I got my hands full and this one's gonna own me and control me
I'm so mystified
She caught the last train last night, left another note
Saying "see you next time, miss me if you don't"
You look good in your bed, till we meet again
You went through my head and nobody told me so

Everybody knows she's a perfect ten
And I'm hanging on tight til the whole thing ends
'Cause New York sky don't get much brighter
She sets, she sets the city on fire
She sets the city on fire
Burns like a million lighters
I'm going up, I couldn't get much higher
She sets, she sets the city on fire

New scene, next block
She'll be jaywalking right across while the cops talk
Make you feel like a boss when your eyes lock
And you can't stop staring endlessly
She got the whole thing figured out, hits me where it hurts
And I know I might be swinging at a curve
I don't mind it, though, when the lights are low
She can hit the notes wearing my T-shirt

Everybody knows she's a perfect ten
And I'm hanging on tight til the whole thing ends
'Cause New York sky don't get much brighter
She sets, she sets the city on fire
She sets the city on fire
Burns like a million lighters
I'm going up, I couldn't get much higher
She sets, she sets the city on fire

But I don't know if I'm chasing ghosts
Put my hand in the flame of a flickering lighter
Again and again, I was lucky just to find her
But I don't know if I'm chasing ghosts
I put my hand in the flame of a flickering lighter
Again and again, I was lucky

Everybody knows she's a perfect ten
And I'm hanging on tight til the whole thing ends
'Cause New York sky don't get much brighter
She sets, she sets the city on fire
She sets the city on fire
Burns like a million lighters
I'm going up, I couldn't get much higher
She sets, she sets the city on fire

I'm going up, I couldn't get much higher
She sets, she sets the city on fire
