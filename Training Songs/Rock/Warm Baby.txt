[Chorus]
Summertime's for summer girls,
Who kiss and run away.
But winter girls have loving arms,
To warm a winter's day.
My babe,
My babe when the leaves turn brown.
And I'll marry my warm baby,
When the snow is on the ground.

When the wind starts whistlin',
Through the branches of the trees,
And the whisper by the window,
Is the falling of the autumn leaves,
I need someone to caress me,
Like a warm summer breeze.

Cause

[Chorus]

I need a warm baby,
To keep me warm all winter long.
When the summer sun is fading,
And the winter wind is blowing strong.
I need a warm baby,
To keep me warm all winter long.

Cause

[Chorus]
