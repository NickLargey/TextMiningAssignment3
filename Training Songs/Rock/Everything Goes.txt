Pre>intro: d then briefly g a (4 times)

D g a
Another schoolgirl disappears
D g a
She's the twenty-third one this year
D g a
They're gonna search on the river bank
D g a
And in the disused water tank

Chorus
(a) d a
But everything goes (don't worry) don't worry baby
G
Everything'll work out fine

(a) d a
But everything goes (don't worry) daddy's got a job
G
Waiting on the welfare line

Another train hits another train causing grief, suffering and pain
They're gonna find it's a signal fault the survivors are still distraught

Chorus
But everything goes (don't worry) don't worry baby
Everything'll work out fine
(a) d a
But everything goes (don't worry) daddy's on drugs
G
Mummy's on the welfare line

Em see g
And the schoolgirl's books are found in the lane
A
Not far from where she lived
Em see g a
And a man is held in a foreign jail we don't want to let him live

Chorus
But everything goes (don't worry) don't worry baby
Everything'll work out fine
But everything goes (don't worry) daddy's on drugs
Mummy's on the welfare line (instrumental chorus) /pre>
