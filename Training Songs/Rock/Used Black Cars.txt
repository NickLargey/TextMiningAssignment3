I never noticed all the used black cars out on the road
I never noticed all the love songs that are on the radio
Until you left me
Now it's all too clear
I never noticed all the houses that look just like where you live
I never noticed all the places that remind me where we've been
Until you left me
Now I see too clearly
That there's nobody in this world who makes me feel the way you do
And there's nobody in my life who could come close to being you
And there's nobody else who gets me
Nobody like you
And there's nobody who inspires me to be better than I am
And there's nobody who ignites me with the touch of their hands
And there's nobody else who loves me
Nobody like you
I took for granted all the little things you did to let me know
How much you loved me - I bankrupted your soul
Until you left me
Won't you please forgive me
How can I make it up? How can I convince you?
I would do anything in this world for you
Until you left me
I had no clue that it was you
That there's nobody in this world who makes me feel the way you do
And there's nobody in my life who could come close to being you
And there's nobody else who gets me
Nobody like you
And there's nobody who inspires me to be better than I am
And there's nobody who invites me to give a damn
And there's nobody else who loves me
Nobody like you
And I have had a lot of growing up to do
And I have got a lot of making up to you
For I can do so much better
For someone as special as you
And I like the way sometimes we talk just like we're babies
And I like the way sometimes your no means maybe, well
Maybe, Baby?
