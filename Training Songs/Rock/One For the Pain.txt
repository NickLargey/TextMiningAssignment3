I love you though you're toxic
You've got a wicked hold on me
I've got a car that's full of boxes
But I just can't seem to leave
Now I know you can't fix crazy
I tried for way too long
I've got a one-way ticket out of here
And in the morning I'll be gone

'Cause the war is over now,
Now the war is over
Life is back in colour now
Now the war is over

So take one for the pain
Two to forget
Three shots fired, yeah I should have known better
Take one for the pain
Two to forget
Three years gone, yeah I should have known better

Run away from this madness that I crave
Better take one for the pain
Two to forget
Three times now
Yeah I should have known better

I think I've always liked the trouble
Just a hint of misery
'Til the smile tastes of poison
And consumes the rest of me

'Cause the storm is over now,
Now the storm is over
The sky is breaking open now
Now the storm is over

So take one for the pain
Two to forget
Three shots fired, yeah I should have known better
Take one for the pain
Two to forget
Three years gone, yeah I should have known better

Run away from this madness that I crave
Better take one for the pain
Two to forget
Three times now
Yeah I should have known better

The war is over now
Now the war is over
Life is back in colour now,
Now the war is over

Now I know you can't fix crazy
I tried for way too long
I've got a one-way ticket out of here
And in the morning I'll be gone

So take one for the pain
Two to forget
Three shots fired, yeah I should have known better
Take one for the pain
Two to forget
Three years gone, yeah I should have known better

Run away from this madness that I crave
Better take one for the pain
Two to forget
Three times now
Yeah I should have known better
