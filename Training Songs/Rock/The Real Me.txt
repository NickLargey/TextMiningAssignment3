Cowboys don't cry, heroes don't die
Good always wins, again and again
Love is a sweet dream that always comes true
If life were like the movies, I'd never be blue

[Chorus]
But here in the real world
It's not that easy at all
When hearts get broken
It's real tears that fall
Darlin' it's sad but true
Cause the one thing I learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl
Here in the real world

I gave you my love, but that wasn't enough
To hold your heart when times got tough
And tonight on the silver screen
It'll end like it should
Two lovers will make it through
Like I hoped we would
