Born with nothing
And that was most of us
Raided in unemployment lines
Grew inside domestic crimes

Always against the odds
One with the underdogs

Stepped on since day one
Taught to accept defeat
Expections of a failure
Always told I was nothing

Always against the odds
One with the underdogs

We are the underdogs

Had to scratch and fight
Just to stay on my feet
With a heart made of steel
I smashed through everything

Always against the odds
One with the underdogs
