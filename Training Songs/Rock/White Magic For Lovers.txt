Leave a candle by his doorstep
With a snapshot of his face
Turn around and take a deep breath
On the first weekend of May

Keep a hair strand in your pocket
And don't rely on any friend
Brew some Catalina Coffee
With the letters of his name

White magic for lovers
When all your love has gone away
White magic for lovers
When you hold on

Oh, you hold on
To your faith
Turn your tears back into water
And leave the bottle by his door

With a message on the cover
Saying, ?To the one you love?
White magic for lovers
When all your love has gone away

White magic for lovers
When you hold on
Oh, you hold on
To your faith

White magic for lovers
When all your love has gone away
White magic for lovers
When you hold on

Oh, you hold on
When you hold on
Oh, you hold on
To your faith
