Well the first thing I remember, was the way she smiled
And the way she looked at me, drivin' me wild
She was dressed to kill in her five inch heels, her painted on satin pants
She had the look of need, like, give it to me, I dedided I should take a chance

If you see kay, tell her I want her
If you see kay, tell her I need her
If you see kay, tell her I want her now

Her legs were long shapely, I could see her love was hot
And when it came together, she'd give you all she's got
She had the walk of a woman on fire, her eyes undressed my mind and soul
I woulda gladly bet my last ten buck, in love she'd lose control

If you see kay, tell her I want her
If you see kay, tell her I need her
If you see kay, tell her I want her now

I had her in my dreams, three times every night
Her love was so complete, her love was warm and right
When I wake up in the morning, with this achin' in my heart
You can bet the need I'm feelin', is only just a start
I felt the pressure risin', when I looked where she had been
By the time I gave up hope, she'd probably fall in love again

If you see kay, tell her I want her
If you see kay, tell her I need her
If you see kay, tell her I want her now
If you see kay (if you see kay), tell her I need her
If you see kay, tell her I need her
Iff you see kay, tell her I want her now
If you see kay, tell her I want her
If you see kay, tell her I need her
If you see kay, tell her I want her now
