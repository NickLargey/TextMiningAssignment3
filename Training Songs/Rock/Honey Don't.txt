Well, how can you say you will, when you won't
You tell me you do, baby, when you don't?
Let me know, honey, how you feel
Tell the truth now is love real

Ah-hah, oh honey don't, well honey don't
Honey don't, no honey don't, hey honey don't
Say you will when you won't, ah-hah honey don't

Well, I love you, baby, and you ought to know
I like the way that you wear your clothes
Everything about you is so doggone sweet
You got that sand all over your feet

So ah-hah, hey honey don't, honey don't
Well honey don't, ah-hah honey don't, honey don't
Say you will when you won't, ah-hah honey don't

(Oh honey don't)

Well, sometimes I love you on a Saturday night
Sunday morning you don't look right
You've been out painting the town
Uh huh baby, been stepping around

So ah-hah, hey honey don't, well honey don't
Honey don't, honey don't, well honey don't
Say you will when you won't, ah-hah honey don't

Well well, honey don't, oh honey don't
Yeah honey don't, honey don't
Say you will when you won't, ah-hah honey don't
