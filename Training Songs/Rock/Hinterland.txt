I've put outside, beyond the dirty window
To find what I once knew long ago
A grainy detail, a former trace
And I try again just to find that place

The human frame was never built for such strength
Oh could lack a life but just so limiting
Well, I'm all on and straight on
Behind the barricades

Closer to empty space
Inside imagination, behind the dirty pane
Well, I like that it's unruly
Oh my, how I did gain

Let's go back to where we play in fear and wander
I cried a meager tear for I could see no longer
The heart of hinterland
That keeps a part of me

Hinterland
Hinterland
Oh, hinterland
Hinterland
Hinterland
Hinterland
Oh, hinterland
Hinterland, ah

Let's go back to wander
Oh, beyond the dirty window
There's a curious plain
In the dark heart of hinterland 
That keeps on calling me
In the dark heart of hinterland
That's where I'll always be

Get up, stay up, get up, stay up
Pounce into the veins of the sister magic
Get up and stay up, escape
Gotta get back to the sister magic
Get up, stay up, get up, stay up
Pounce into the past of the sister magic
Get up, stay up, get up, stay up
Gotta get back to the sister magic

Hinterland
Hinterland (sister magic)
Oh, hinterland
Hinterland
Hinterland
Hinterland
Oh, hinterland
Hinterland

Dance, dance, oh, move it
Inside imagination
Behind the dirty pane
There's a light that, it's so cool to me
I'm tough as bark like the sister magic, yeah, yeah
