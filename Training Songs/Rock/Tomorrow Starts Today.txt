Takin' it down,so I want more
Leave it around so I won't know
Tell me how could you be sure
Turn it turn around
Turn it upside down

I gotta know give me a reason
I gotta know give me a reason
I gotta know give me a reason
You messed up your last chance

Tomorrow starts today
Tomorrow starts today
Even if it breaks you

Takin your time cause I won't know
Leavin me like I am safe from you
Tell me how could you be sure
Turn it turn around
Turn it upside down

I gotta know give me a reason
I gotta know give me a reason 
I gotta know give me a reason
Messed up your last chance

Tomorrow starts today
Tomorrow starts today
Let's blow it all away
I know this for sure I know I can't be wrong

Stop pretending you're so good
Stop assuming that I would stop
Stop believing that I could stop
I'll walk away from you

Tomorrow starts today
Tomorrow starts today 
Let's blow it all away
I know this for sure I know I can't be wrong
And I think you know I knew it all along
I know this for sure I know I don't belong
