When darkness folds
Across this old sky
Yes, I'll open up 
For you that night

But still shadows they come
Am I safe in your grasp?
Can I be your source
Of strength tonight?

I'll wait for the day
When you creep through the window and hold me
Smash into my life now and hold me
Don't set me free
I've waited too long, yes I'm dying
Smash into me someone and hold me
Speed into this shell now and hold me
Hold me
Hold me

Can you tell me
Will I ever dream again?
In your arms
I now know that I'm home again
I'm home again
I'm home again
I'm home again

I'm drunk for your love
Speed into my life
Speak to me now
Just speak to me someone
For I know your taste
And I can supply
