Nasty, nasty walk the streets at night
Nasty, nasty looking for a fight
Nasty, nasty you're the reason why
Nasty, nasty made somebody cry

What the hell is wrong with you
What the hell you going to do
You going to do

Nasty, nasty always telling lies
Nasty, nasty never really tries
Nasty, nasty want to make them pay
Nasty, nasty brave to turn away

Nasty, nasty rivals blaming you
Nasty, nasty all exploitation news
Nasty, nasty adding up the score
Nasty, nasty what's it really for

Nasty, nasty shocking head to feet
Nasty, nasty think you're really neat
Nasty, nasty into something new
Nasty, nasty soon that won't be true
