Just driving on my way back home
It's dark and it's pouring
I know you're sitting all alone
And you're waiting for me
I'm thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout me
And it's driving me crazy
Why, why we still here, let's disappear
So come on baby

Let's go tonight
Cause we gotta run away, we gotta get away
I know you won't think twice
Cause you're unbelievable
Let's go and see the world
Sail out on the ocean
Don't know where we're going
We can watch a sunset
And baby we can both get
Lost in paradise

It seems like it's the same old thing
Every single day now
I'm tired of the same routine
And I'm trying not to freak out
I'm dreaming 'bout you, dreaming 'bout me
And it's driving me crazy
Why, why we still here, let's disapear
So come on baby

Let's go tonight
Cause we gotta run away, we gotta get away
I know you won't think twice
Cause you're unbelievable
Let's go and see the world
Sail out on the ocean
Don't know where we're going
We can watch a sunset
And baby we can both get
Lost in paradise

Oh, let's leave it all behind
I'm not gonna change my mind
Cause I got you and that's all I need
I'm thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout me
So come on baby

Let's go tonight
Cause we gotta run away, we gotta get away
I know you won't think twice
Cause you're unbelievable
Let's go and see the world
Sail out on the ocean
Don't know where we're going
We can watch a sunset
And baby we can both get
Lost in paradise
