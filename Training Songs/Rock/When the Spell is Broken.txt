When the spell is broken
When the spell is broken
How you ever gonna keep her now
You can't cry if you don't know how
When the spell is broken
When the spell is broken
All the joy is gone from her face
Welcome back to the human race
How long can the flame 
Of love remain
When you curse and fight
And never see like 
Or hear like spoken
When the spell is broken 
(Can't cry if you don't know how)
(Can't cry if you don't know how)
When the spell is broken 
(Can't cry if you don't know how)
Oh when the spell is broken
All your magic and your ways and schemes
All your lies come and tear at your dreams
When the spell is broken 
(Can't cry if you don't know how)
When the spell is broken
Now you're handing her that same old line
It's just straws in the wind this time
When love has died, 
There's none starry-eyed
No kiss, no tears, 
No farewell souvenirs
Not even a token, when the spell is broken 

Don't swear your heart 
From the very start
Love letters you wrote 
Are pushed back down you throat
And leave you choking, when the spell is broken 
(When the spell, When the spell, When the spell is broken)
When the spell is broken 
When the spell is broken 
(When the spell, When the spell, When the spell is broken)
When the spell is broken 
When the spell is broken 

(Can't cry if you don't know how)
(Can't cry if you don't know how)
(Can't cry if you don't know how)
(You can't cry if you don't know how)
(Can't cry if you don't know how)
(Can't cry if you don't know how)
(Can't cry if you don't know how)
(Can't cry if you don't know how)
(Can't cry if you don't know how)
