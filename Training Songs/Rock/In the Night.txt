And where we live is where we hide 
Cause we can't forgive what's inside 
We have sweet love 
We have sweet love 

In the night 
Voices will fight 
Voices of shadows and the runaways 
Running from love 
And every sorrow left behind 

And when we wake up 
It's already dark 
And I touch your face 
Feel your heart 
We have sweet love 

In the night 
Voices will fight 
Voices of shadows and the runaways 
Running from love 
And every sorrow left behind
