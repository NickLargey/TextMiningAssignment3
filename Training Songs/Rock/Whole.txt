A hole that big
I'd never seen before
In the tummy of a good ol' boy 
Who always wanted more.
Then just yesterday
I saw him satisfied.
It seems he'd met the hole fixin' man, 
Much to his surprise.

But are you for real?
Mr. Hole Fixin' Man, 
You fixed my friend can you fix me?
Hey Mr. Hole Fixin' Man, 
I'm as broken as a boy can be,
So how 'bout fixin' me?

And all the charms
That never were enough
It seems the hole was always 
Twice as big no matter what it was,
But to see him now
Is almost to believe
That maybe Mr. Hole Fixin' Man 
Might have what I need.

But are you for real?
Mr. Hole Fixin' Man, 
You fixed my friend can you fix me?
Hey Mr. Hole Fixin' Man, 
I'm as broken as a boy can be,
So how 'bout fixin' me.

Mr. Hole Fixin' Man, 
He says you died on Calvary.
Hey Mr. Hole Fixin' Man, 
If you've got proof I will believe,
So how 'bout fixin' me.

Won't you please,
won't you please.
Start by fixin' me, 
Start by fixin' me.
