Leaving my home isn't always my strength
But it's easier every time
Sleep my darling, don't you cry
There's too many towns that I never have met
And there's too many people to find
I sleep in a van or outside

The summer sun in my eyes
Sleep my darling, don't you cry
I never want to go home
I never want to go home
I never want to go home
Again, again, again

I never want to go home
I never want to go home
I never want to go home
Again, again, again

I never want to go home
I never want to go home
I never want to go home
Again, again, again
