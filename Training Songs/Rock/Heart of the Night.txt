In the heart of the night
In the cool southern rain
There's a full moon in sight
Shinin' down on the Pontchartrain
And the river she rises
Just like she used to do
She's so full of surprises
She reminds me of you

In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
Oh, down in New Orleans

There's a night bird singing
Right on through till the dawn
And the streets are still ringing
With people carrying on
It's been so long waiting
Just to be here again
Anticipating
All the time I could spend

In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
Oh, down in New Orleans

And I trust in your love
Never fallin' down
And I trust in your love
Just like I do in this town
Oh, never fallin' down
Oh, never fallin' down

In the heart of the night
In the cool fallin' rain
There's a full moon in sight
Shinin' down on the Pontchartrain
And the river she rises
Just like she used to do
She's so full of surprises (oh mama)
She reminds me of you (right here)

In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
Oh, down in New Orleans

And I'm so glad to be back in New Orleans
Please don't wake me, don't shake me
If it's only, if it's only just a dream
Cause it's the only place that I can face
It makes me feel so right
Below that Dixie moon and lovin' you
In the heart of the night
