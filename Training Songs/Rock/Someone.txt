You,
Well you can’t touch me
And I can’t speak now
It’s the only way.

V2
Breath,
When you left me gasping
In need of something
Just to mend your ways.

Bridge
But no matter how I try
I feel like I will fail
When there’s only one way out
But for me it’s just the same. Yeah

Chorus
There someone,
Someone I’d like to meet
Just someone, 
To make my life complete
Someone, 
Someone like you. Yeah

V3
Time,
Is the greatest healer
We’ve ever known now
Since your judgement day.

V4
Fear,
In fear of loosing
That certain someone,
Underneath your vail

Bridge
But no matter how I try
I feel like I will fail
When there’s only one way out
But for me it’s just the insane. Yeah

Chorus
There someone,
Someone I’d like to meet
Just someone, 
To make my life complete
Someone, 
Someone like you. Yeah Yeah Yeah
