The bells of St.Mary's
I hear they are calling
The young loves and the true loves
That come from the sea

And so my beloved
When red leaves are falling
The love bells shall ring out
Yes, ring out for you and me

The bells of St.Mary's
I hear they are calling
The young loves and the true loves
That come from the sea

And so my beloved
When the red leaves are falling
The love bells shall ring out
Ring out for you and me
