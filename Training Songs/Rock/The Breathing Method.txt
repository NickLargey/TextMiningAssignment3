Made a grave mistake 
An all too common place 
Not the first time back again 
It's obvious the risks 

Outweigh the benefits 
Should have used our heads 
Couldn't happen to me 
No 

There's no safe hiding place in thinking you're immune 
You're not immune 
Watch advantages pass 
Abrasive, difficult regret 

I was 
Can you conceive that I hate you 
I can barely make the rent 
You are 

That a word as strong as hate can describe the way I feel 
We were 
And in the end there is another 
Nothing 

A product of you 
But you come back fine 
You came back 
Nothing at all 

I won't hide or turn back 
I'll take responsible 
I won't let mine be a mistake
