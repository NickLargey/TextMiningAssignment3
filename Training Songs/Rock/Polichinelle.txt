I said the first thing that came into my head
I said you have a friend in me who knows
That running's not the same for everyone

'Cause if you stay there has to be someone to hold you
Every day, someone to need you
To make a fire out of the gray confusion

There's nothing on the radio
You've gone as far as you can go
Everywhere is emptiness
And everyone is loneliness

But I'll help you if you want me to
I'll help you if you let me through
I'll be the one you tell
Let it go Polichinelle

Where's my funny girl?
Are you ready to believe it's true
That everything we love we lose?
Only in your mind can you choose

Not to live again
And you could find your smile tomorrow
Remember what was beautiful
Not the dark inventions of your burning sorrow

There's nothing on the radio
You've gone as far as you can go
Everywhere is emptiness
And everyone is loneliness

But I'll help you if you want me to
I'll help you if you let me through
I'll be the one you tell
Let it go Polichinelle

Run, abandon your name
The lies, the hurt and the blame
Tonight you're standing on the edge
In hopeless tears that only I can hear
The telephone can't bring you here
