Waiting for wednesday, my stomach doesn't hurt enough
Pain always is the sign.
Waiting for wednesday, no proof of mine exists,
So I don't have to take it back.
Don't want to show you good-bye,
Show you good-bye.
Show you good-bye.
Show you good-bye.
But you're waiting for wednesday.
Waiting for wednesday.
Waiting for wednesday, I pray you'll put me on the spot.
I do believe you, that you'll love me that you'll leave me.
Don't want to show you good-bye,
Show you good-bye.
What will I do when you come near to me? 
You'll put me on the spot.
You've been doing this a long, long time,
Not that you're better than me,
But that you do it a lot.
Now I'm waiting for wednesday,
Waiting for wednesday,
Waiting for wednesday,
I'm waiting for wednesday.
I'm gonna show you good-bye,
Show you good-bye,
Show you good-bye,
Show you good-bye.
Now I'm waiting for wednesday,
You're back from out of town,
The west is dry, your mind is clear,
And I don't want to be here,
I don't want to be here,
I don't want to be here,
To show you good-bye.
And I'm waiting for wednesday,
Waiting for wednesday,
I'm waiting for wednesday, to show you good-bye.
I don't want to be here, to show you good-bye.
Waiting for wednesday.
I don't want to be here.
Waiting for wednesday, to show you good-bye,
To show you good-bye!
