I get the same old dreams, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed, put on my shoes, and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the break-up

These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast the spell, so break it
Oooohhh - Whhooooaaa - Ooooohhh
Since you been gone

So in the night I stand beneath the back street light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, the night-time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me

Your poison letter, your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast the spell, so break it
Oooohhh - Whhooooaaa - Ooooohhh
Since you been gone

[INTERLUDE]

If you will come back
Baby you know
You'll never do wrong

Huhhhhh

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast the spell, so break it
Oooohhh - Whhooooaaa - Ooooohhh
Ever since, you been gone

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Since you been gone, since you been gone
