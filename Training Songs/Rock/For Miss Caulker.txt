Well, you've been gone,
For fourteen long days
Yes, you've been gone 
For fourteen long, lonely days
And I'm prayin' to the Lord
Please don't take my love away...

Come back home,
All I want is you
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, Come back home, baby
You know all I want is you
You know you'll never find another boy
To treat you like I used to treat you

Oh baby, 
Baby, why don't you come back home to me
Hey, baby baby,
Why don't you come back home to me

I want you to come back home baby
Baby, please set me free...
