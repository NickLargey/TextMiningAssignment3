Ohh yeah 

Uh uh 

You got me down on the floor 
So what you bring me down here for? 
You got me down on the floor
So what you bring me down here for? 

If I was a man I'd make my move
If I was a blade I'd shave you smooth
If I was a judge I'd break the law
And if I was from Paris, if I was from Paris 

I would say ooh la la la la la la la 
Ooh la la la la la la 
Ooh la la la la la la la
Ooh la la la la la la

You got me up on your swing 
So when you gonna shake that thang 
You got me up on your swing 
So she you gonna shake that thang 

If I was a man I'd make my move
If I was a blade I'd shave you smooth
If I was a judge I'd break the law
And if I was from Paris, if I was from Paris 

I would say ooh la la la la la la la 
Ooh la la la la la la 
Ooh la la la la la la la
Ooh la la la la la la
