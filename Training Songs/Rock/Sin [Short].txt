You give me the reason
You give me control
I gave you my purity
My purity you stole
Did you think I wouldn't recognize 
This compromise
Am I just too stupid to realize
Stale incense 
Old sweat 
And lies lies lies

It comes down to this
Your kiss
Your fist
And your strain
It get's under my skin
Within
Take in the extent of my sin

You give me the anger
You give me the nerve
Carry out my sentence
While I get what I deserve.
I'm just an effigy to be disgraced
To be defaced
Your need for me has been replaced
And if I can't have everything 
Well then just give me a taste

It comes down to this
Your kiss
Your fist
And your strain
It get's under my skin
Within
Take in the extent of my sin

You give me the reason
You give me control
I gave you my purity
My purity you stole
Did you think I wouldn't recognize 
This compromise
Am I just too stupid to realize
Stale incense 
Old sweat 
And lies lies lies

It comes down to this
Your kiss
Your fist
And your strain
It get's under my skin
Within
Take in well my sin

It comes down to this
Your kiss
Your fist
And your strain
It get's under my skin
Within
Take in the extent of my sin
