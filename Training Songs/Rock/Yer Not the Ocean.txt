Again I'm talking to the lake, I'm standing on the rocks
You're not the ocean, I'm better to watch
Britney Invisible or The Stranger In Myself
Than a wall of water just hitting the shelf

You're not the ocean, you're up to my toes
You're not the ocean, you're not even close

Though you're so real and you're more youth every day
And you can think and feel and get out of your own way
And though I'm nothing, you are just a lake
Made to take it and take and take and take

You're not the ocean, I'm standing on my toes
You're not the ocean, you're not even close
You're not the ocean, you're up to my chin
You're not the ocean, you're not coming in
You're not coming in, you're not coming in, you're not coming in

You're not the ocean, you're up to my chin
You're not the ocean, you're not coming in
You're not coming in, you're not coming in, you're not coming in
