Blind these eyes who never tried 
To lose temptation 
I'm so scared, where's the hesitation? 
You so easily proved that You could save a man 
I am that man 

[Chorus]
It's better off this way 
To be deaf, dumb and lame 
Than to be the way I am, I am 
It's better off this way 
Than be groping for the flame 
Than to be the way I am, I am 
Still this tongue for I am hung 
By this wicked notion 
Tame the beast, release 
The noose I've woven 
O, wasted tears dripping from my tongue 
Well I'm hung, hung 

[Chorus]

Crooked path you never asked 
You just left me there 
And I deal with the aftermath 
And you don't even care 
O, crooked feet you nimbly meet the place of my fears 

[Chorus]
