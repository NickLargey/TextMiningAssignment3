Waking from a dream, will it disappear?
Can you look me in the eye and tell me do you see a trace of fear?
Crawling out of bed in my head I can't handle the day
I was hoping for release, oh give me peace or just get out of my way

On and on and on and on we fly, I live and I laugh and I cry
So doctor take a hammer to my broken heart
Won't you tell me why I've got trouble on my mind?

Tried to read the meaning of a song on a spent coffee cup
It said life's a contradiction, holy water from a dirty jug
Tried impressing honeys with the monies that I already spent
Crying to a hobo I'm in trouble 'cause I ain't got no rent

You ever feel they are dragging you under
Premonition I'm going
I hold on 12 but they dealt me a king to deny

On and on and on and on we fly, I live and I laugh and I cry
Hey, doctor take a hammer to my broken heart
I will show you why I've got trouble on my mind?
On my mind, on my mind

We could have it all, we could have it all
We could have it all but it's falling through our hands
Help me to understand, oh help me to understand

On and on and on and on we fly, I live and I laugh and I cry
Hey, doctor take a hammer to my broken heart
For I'm wondering why I've got trouble going

On and on and on and on we fly, I live and I laugh and I cry
So doctor take a hammer to my broken heart
Won't you tell me why I've got trouble on my mind?
