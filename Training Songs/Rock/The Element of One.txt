Breathe me in
Torn disbelieving separation
I close my eyes to see you
This is for you, everything I am
This is for you, take it from me
Torn disbelieving separation
I close my eyes
But there is no escaping this
This is for you, everything I am
This is for you, take it from me
In your arms in your soul
I will be rejuvenation

Breathe me in,I am forever
Deep within,I am eternal

I will return to you
I am with you always
I will never turn away from you

Breathe me in,I am forever
Deep within,I am eternal
