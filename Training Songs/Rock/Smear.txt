There's something moving under your skin
I saw it creeping in there
It eats you slowly from within
I watch you growing thinner
Your blood is thick and sticky red
All over those fingers
They've warned you as it drains away
But you don't listen
Intent on living a lie
Shame you
There must be Vaseline on your limbs
Do you see everything in restraint?
It leaves a black and dirty trail
You won't recover
And bleeds you dry then moves away
To find another
With teeth and talons in your neck
You look for bidding
And as it takes all it can get
You say that's giving
Intent on living a lie
Shame you
There must be Vaseline on your limbs
Do you see everything in restraint?
There must be Vaseline on your limbs
Do you see everything in restraint?
There's something moving under your skin
I saw it creeping in there
It eats you slowly from within
I watch you growing thinner
Your blood is thick and sticky red
All over those fingers
They've warned you as it drains away
But you don't listen
Intent on living a lie
Shame you
There must be Vaseline on your limbs
Do you see everything in restraint?
There must be Vaseline on your limbs
Do you see everything in restraint?
