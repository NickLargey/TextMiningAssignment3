Sometimes, things get a little hazy
Sometimes, I think I'm just a little crazy
I don't even know my own name
Soon all of me will go up in flames

Wearing scars, on my arms and in my eyes
Are you friends or enemies in disguise
So hard, when everything just runs against me
Jealous words, turn into a love/hate frenzy

Won't someone, lend me a helping hand
Time is up, to the time that's left undone
Time to grab my hat, grab my coat, I gotta load my gun
Silly things always always are the ones that turn out worst

And it seams
The ones that love you always hurt you the most
Won't someone, please understand
Won't someone, lend me a helping hand

Won't someone, please take the time to think
That your actions and words
They don't always say what they mean
Since I was a child, I used to dream of many things

Superstars, the bizzare, kings and their pretty queens
Now it seems, I need a shot, a drink to jog my thoughts
Why does this happen all the time
Is ti, is it just because 

Because no-one will understand
Won't someone, lend me a helping hand
Won't someone, take the time to think
That your actions and words

They don't always say what they mean.
