Won't you let me walk you home from school
Won't you let me meet you by the pool
Maybe Friday I can get tickets for the band
And I'll take you
Ooh ooh oh oooh
Won't you tell your dad to get off my back
Tell him what we said 'bout paint it black
Rock'n roll is here to stay
Come inside now - its ok
And I'll shake you
Ooh ooh oh oooh
Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If its no then I can go
If its yes then let me know
I won't make you
Ooh ooh oh oooh
