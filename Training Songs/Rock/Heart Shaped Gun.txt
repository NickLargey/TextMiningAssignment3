The sun sets the night shines
No more sweet charades
The sky falls
In your eyes
There's no ways to play

I'm here to let you know
You gotta go go go
So don't move
'Cause your time has come

Now the masquerade is over
Gonna watch you come undone
I got a heart shaped gun
A heart shaped gun

It's too late for bows and arrows
You can't have 'em you can't run
I've got a heart shaped gun
My deadly one
And here I come

You drew fast
Shut me down
I fell at your feet
Just one bullet
I set fire
To your make-believe
I came to let you know
You gonna go go go
Don't you move
'Cause your time has come

Now the masquerade is over
Gonna watch you come undone
I've got a heart shaped gun
A heart shaped gun

It's too late for bows and arrows
You cant have 'em you cant run
I've got a heart shaped gun
My deadly one
And here I come
Here I come

Now the masquerade is over
Gonna watch you come undone
I've got a heart shaped gun
A heart shaped gun

It's too late for bows and arrows
You can't have em you cant run
I've got a heart-shaped gun
My deadly one
And here I come
