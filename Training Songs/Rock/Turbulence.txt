Tried and true was my image of you
So erase all the truth and take me back to Ms. Leading.
Bravo, you had me at hello.
The only way to explain yourself, 
Is you’re a saint among men in the eyes of a tyrant.

Was I a part of you? Were you a part of me? 
Time and time again we’re running on empty.
Was I a part of you? Were you a part of me? 
I’m off this broken ride, I can see clearly.

Whoa, you lied from the start.
The sky could fall down, and you could never see it coming.
Whoa, take me back to the start. 
So I can turn around, and walk the other way.

You severed all the faith in me,
When all I needed was loyalty.
Over and over again you lied to me.
I don’t need your loyalty.

Nobody knows what it means to be
A part of this and now is not the time to start asking. 
Girl you don’t want to know 
What happens when the lights go low and you lose your soul.

Was I a part of you? Were you a part of me? 
Time and time again we’re running on empty.
Was I a part of you? Were you a part of me? 
I’m off this broken ride, I can see clearly.

Whoa, you lied from the start.
The sky could fall down, and you could never see it coming.
Whoa, take me back to the start. 
So I can turn around, and walk the other way.

You severed all the faith in me,
When all I needed was loyalty.
Over and over again you lied to me.

Here’s to heart. As I disengage from this counter part. 
I’ll leave you with this token of my regret.

Whoa, you lied from the start.
The sky could fall down, and you could never see it coming.
Whoa, take me back to the start. 
So I can turn around, and walk the other way.
