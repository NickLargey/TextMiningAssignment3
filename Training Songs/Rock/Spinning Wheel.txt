Say you are a dancer - come and dance
Take off your shirt - take off your pants
Take off your stockings - take off your bra
Take off your makeup and let's see it all
Now peel on the spinning wheel

Say you are a singer - come and sing
Take off your necklace - take off your rings
Take off your garter belt - take off your dress
Take off your perfume want to see your nakedness
Now peel on the spinning wheel

In your set of three you can be anything you want to be
In your set of three you think of me anything you want now peel

Say you are a dancer - come and dance
Take off your shirt - take off your pants
Take off your stockings - take off your bra
Take off your makeup and let's see it all
Now peel on the spinning wheel
Now peel get on your poles and ride
