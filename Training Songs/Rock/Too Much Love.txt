I always thought I could take as I wanted
They use to call me their beautiful boy
But though I took my fill from all that I fancied
Those I fancied I would seek to destroy
Just a shagger not a lover of consequence
The kind of lover that just loves to be free
'Cause baby I put the con in confidence
And what you're offering has no value to me

And if I had to ask a personal question
I'd probably ask you what you're wanting to drink
I've had my share and taken more than I've given
But when the choice is mine I'd rather not think
So if you're feeling like I take you for granted
I'm very sorry feelings just aren't my thing
I never waited on the things that I wanted
Conscience and cowardice are still the same thing

But what's left of me
And if you cut me open
I know what you would find
The hollow generation
Inside a gilded mind

And though I'm really not the type you can talk to
It seems it's cute that I have nothing to say
I only smile and do my best to undress you
It's not protection I was programmed this way
So if you're counting that we all have a conscience
I'll be hanging out with all of your friends
'Cause baby I put the con in confidence
And I'll only leave you down in the end

But what's left of me
And if you cut me open
I know what you would find
The hollow generation
Inside a gilded mind

And if you cut me open
I know what you would find
The hollow generation
Inside a gilded mind

Inside a gilded mind
