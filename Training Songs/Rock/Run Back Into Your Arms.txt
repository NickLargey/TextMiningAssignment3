Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh
(Ooh, ooh)

No matter how long it takes, baby
It would never be a day too long
All the mistakes I made and the games that I played
Didn't know I was needing you so bad

But I never thought that I would feel so lonely
And I never thought that I would feel so sad

I wanna run back into your arms tonight
I want you back here where you belong
I wanna take back all of those lies I told
I was wrong, so wrong and now you're gone
Oh, yeah now you're gone

Just give me another chance, baby
To show you how much I really care
All that I put you through, I never knew
Didn't know I was making you so sad

Baby, now that you have given me a reason
And the time has come for me to understand

I wanna run back into your arms tonight
I want you back here where you belong
I wanna take back all of those lies I told
I was wrong, so wrong and now you're gone
Now you're gone ooh, ooh

But you never miss the water till the well runs dry
But ya left me cold and lonely and I know the reason why

I wanna run back into your arms tonight
I want you back here where you belong
I wanna take back all of those lies I told
I was wrong, so wrong and now you're gone
Now you're gone and now you're gone

All alone, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I miss you, baby I wanna run back to your arms
Sometime yeah, hey, babe and now you're gone
Now you're gone and now you're gone
