You shine,
Brighter than the brightest star!
Your love,
Purer than the purest heart!
You shine, 
Filling us with courage and strength
To follow you!

Why should I fear man,
When you made the heavens?
Why should I be afraid,
When you put the stars in place?
Why should I lose heart,
When I know how great you are?
Why should I give up,
When your plans are full of love?

In this world we will have trouble,
But you have overcome the world!
You shine,
Brighter than the brightest star!
Your love,
Purer than the purest heart!
You shine, 
Filling us with courage and strength
To follow you!

Why should I fear man,
When you made the heavens?
Why should I be afraid,
When you put the stars in place?
Why should I lose heart,
When I know how great you are?
Why should I give up,
When your plans are full of love?

In this world we will have trouble,
But you have overcome the world!
You have overcome the world...!

You shine,
Brighter than the brightest star!
Your love,
Purer than the purest heart!
You shine, 
Filling us with courage and strength
To follow you!
You shine,
