Girls on the Avenue
Girls on the avenue, they're trying to get you in,
Strolling by with their rosebud smiles,
They're all dressed up to kill, lean on the windowsill,
Looking your way with eyes of fire;

But don't you slip don't you slip
In love with the girls on the avenue;

Friday night see the girls on the avenue,
Like a child at big store windows you feel confused
So many girls on the avenue.

Girls on the avenue, know how to get you in,
Casting out sighs like tricks from a hat,
All the Miss Lonely Hearts, oh they look awful hard,
Then sometimes they seem as fragile as glass;

But don't you slip don't you slip
In love with the girls on the avenue;

Friday night see the girls on the avenue,
Like a child at big store windows you feel confused
So many girls on the avenue.
