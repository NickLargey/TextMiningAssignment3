Frozen into coats
White girls of the north
Filed past one, five and one
They are the fabled lambs
A Sunday ham
The ancient snow

And they could float above the grass
In circles if they tried
A latent power I'm known to hide
To keep some hope alive
That a girl like I could ever try
Could ever try

So we just skirt the hallway signs
A phantom and a fly
Follow the lines and wonder why
There's no connection
And weakened falling eyes
In cheap shots from the tribe
And we're off to Nemarca' porch again

Another afternoon
Of the goat-head tunes and pilfered booze
We wander through her Momma's house
The milk from the window lights
Family portrait, circa '95

This is that foreign land
With the sprayed-on tans
And it all feels fine
Be it silk or slime

So, when they tap our Monday heads
Two zombies walk in our stead
This town seems hardly worth our time
And we'll no longer memorize or rhyme
Too far along in our crime
Stepping over what now towers to the sky
With no connection
