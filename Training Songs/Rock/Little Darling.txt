I was feeling kind of insecure
In a way I never felt before
I went through my life with no guarantees
I did whatever I wanted whenever I pleased

Before I knew it we were out of the door
And all I wanted was a little bit more
You pulled the strings
And girl I followed you home
Just couldn't wait until I got you alone

I wasn't looking for a love that's true
But theirs no way that I'll get over you
I'm not the kind to sweep you off your feet
But hurry girl because I'm losing sleep

Little darling your the only one
My heart is racing like I'm on the run
Yeah little darling wont you say you're gonna stay with me

Get to your house without the rest of the band
Some of these things don't always turn out as planned
Called me a cab and as I walked out the door
I felt like my heart was gonna fall through the floor

I only wanted to hold you tight
But you made it clear that this just wasn't my night
I didn't mean to get in so deep
Come on hurry darling I'm still loosing sleep

Little darling your the only one
My heart is racing like I'm on the run
Yeah little darling wont you say you're gonna stay with me

Oh little darling take it while were young
Oh little darling we can have ourselves a life or fun

And I wanna tell your momma
And I wanna tell your daddy too
Its just you for me girl
And its just me for you

Little darling your the only one
My heart is racing like I'm on the run
Yeah little darling wont you say you're gonna stay with me
I'm gonna give you everything you need
Just say the word and I'll be on my knees
Oh little darling won't you say your gonna marry me
