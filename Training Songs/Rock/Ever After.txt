Now that you're gone
Nothing is wrong
But every thing's changed
Words in your hand
Do I set them in stone
Or throw them away
Now everything we did
Like photographs that always moved
(And that wasn't strange)
Now they're in the can
Let's put them on a shelf
Let's put them in the ground
They'll never move again

Ever after
Ever after
Ever after

Over and done
All of the fun
And all of the pain
Why don't I laugh
Why don't I cry
It ends up all the same
Now that you're gone
Everything is wrong
Though nothing has changed
And everything we said
Is there on a tape
For the future to play
Let's put it in the ground
That's where it ought to stay

Ever after
Ever after
Ever after

And it'll be all right . . .
