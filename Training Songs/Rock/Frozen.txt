You got my heart in a freeze
A hundred minus degrees
I'm standing here in the dark
But you ain't looking for me
You got my heart in a freeze

And I knew from the start
Felt a chill in my heart
Nothing good come from this
But I couldn't resist

Now your cold, cold hands
Got me so, so damned
And your bitterness
Leaves me frozen, frozen

Like a soul vampire
Boy you bled me dry
Clinging to this life
But I'm frozen, frozen

Yeah

I hope you find what you need
Someone to cure your disease
Got me so sick of your games
Always playing with me
I hope you find what you need

But don't be too surprised
When I'm haunting your mind
I'm the hurt in your kiss
I'm the frost on your lips

Now your cold, cold hands
Got me so, so damned
And your bitterness
Leaves me frozen, frozen

Like a soul vampire
Boy you bled me dry
Clinging to this life
But I'm frozen, frozen

Yeah

And I knew from the start
Felt a chill in my heart
Nothing good come from this
But I couldn't resist

No, No, No

Now your cold, cold hands
Got me so, so damned
And your bitterness
Leaves me frozen, frozen

Like a soul vampire
Boy you bled me dry
Clinging to this life
But I'm frozen, frozen

Yeah
