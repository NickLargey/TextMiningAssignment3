Effective incentives
How dare you stand corrected
No motives, intentions
A single thought to call your own
Deceptive, defensive
Don't look at me, rejected
Conclusions, delusions
Look at you standing all alone

All alone [Repeat x3]

A passive-aggressive
You didn't get the message
A second opinion
A word that turns into a code
A massive offensive
You seem to me obsessive
Your version, diversion
So tell me something I don't know

All alone [Repeat x3]

Effective incentives
How dare you stand corrected
A motive in teachings
The undirected mission
Deceptive, defensive
Don't look at me, rejected
A passive-aggressive
You didn't get the message
A massive offensive
You seem to me obsessive
Conclusions, delusions
Look at you standing all alone
