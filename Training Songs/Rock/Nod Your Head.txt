If you really love me baby
Better than stayin' in bed
If you really love me baby, nod your head

If you really love me baby
Till you fall down dead, she said
If you ever wanna make it, nod your head

Nod it up, nod it down
Side to side, round and round (Round and round)

If you ever wanna prove it
Then you hang it on a thread
If you ever wanna shake it, nod your head

If you think the life your leading
Is better then the life you lead
If you like the life your living
Well nod your head

Well nod it up, nod it down
Side to side, round and round (Round and round)
(Round and round)

If you really love me baby
Better than stayin' in bed
If you really love me baby, nod your head
