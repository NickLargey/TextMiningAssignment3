Give me something life
Give me something real
Give me something honest
That you don't have to steal

Coming down easy
Coming down slow
It makes the tuning
Like engines in the snow

Just looking through your future
Just looking through your past
I don't think this feeling
Was  really built to last

My mouth is selfish
My heart is dull
Coming down easy
Coming down slow

[Chorus]
We've still got a long way to go
We've still got a long way to go

Sometimes I feel like
I'm dryin' the whole world
Sometimes I'm so lost
I wish I didn't feel

[Chorus]

Ooh yeah!

Give me something life
Give me something real
Give me something honest
That you don't have to steal

We've still got a long way to go
We've still got a long way to go, yeah!

We've still got a long way to go
We've still got a long way to go
We've still got a long way to go
C'mon Jo'
Hey!
