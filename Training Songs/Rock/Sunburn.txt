Last July, I drank a bottle of Wolf Blass
And passed out in the tall grass on Portabello Road
Yeah, the sky was alive held you like a gemstone
Got lost on the way home and never told a soul

Now it feels just like it's rainin' rubber balls
You get to run like hell just to watch me crawl
Bet you just can't wait 'til the whole thing falls

And you're, you're gonna be my great regret
Though I guess it hasn't hit me yet
Slow drag on my last cigarette
Just a good excuse to take all I can get
You're the lesson I never learned, you're my sunburn

Sure cuts the groove, makes it hard to be humble
But I trip and I stumble, like a scratched 45
Now it feels just like I'm tied on to a stone
You get to step on a crack just to break my bones
Guess I got my wish, guess, I should have known

That you're gonna be my great regret
Though I guess it hasn't hit me yet
Slow drag on my last cigarette
Just a good excuse to take all I can get
You're the lesson I never learned, you're my sunburn

You change your mind like you change your shirt
You cover my skin so it don't hurt
But it don't work
It just makes it worse

You're gonna be my great regret
Though I, I guess it hasn't hit me yet
Slow drag on my last cigarette
Just a good excuse to take all I can

Roll the bones and double your bets
I got a lot to lose and a lot more to get
Gonna watch it rise and watch it set
Every drop of sweat, 'til it takes away my breath
You're the lesson I never learned you're my sunburn

You're my sunburn
You're my sunburn
You're my sunburn
