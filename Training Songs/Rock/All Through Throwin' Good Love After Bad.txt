Oh a time there was I was feelin' so hopeless 
It's a wonder I didn't cave in 
I kept throwing love at all the wrong people 
Never to see it again. 

[Chorus]
Oh Lord won't you look what I've found 
Starin' me right in the face 
I'm through bein lonely I'm through bein' sad 
I'm all through throwin' good love after bad. 

When I think of all the time I have wasted 
Wearin' my heart on my sleeve 
Entrusting my love to the kindness of strangers 
Oh I was so naive 

[Chorus]
