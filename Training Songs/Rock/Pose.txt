Caught up in the nightlife
Oh
Got a couple fake friends
Got a couple real ones
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, she ain't in her hometown
Livin' on the coast now
Ooh
Henny with the Coke now
She can't even slow down
Ah

She don't wanna be alone anymore
She don't wanna lose herself to this life
She don't wanna take a look in the mirror
She just wanna let go, let go

She pose for the picture
All her friends are off the liquor tonight (Yeah)
And I think she knows something's missing
But this mixture's got her feeling alive
She's lost at sea, she's off that pill
She's on her knees, can't tell what's real
And I think she knows something's missing
But this mixture's got her feeling alive tonight

Yo, check me, check me out (Yeah, yeah)
She feelin' so alive, hoppin' out the ride
Walk up in the high, wait, wait run it back one time
She's feelin' so alive, hoppin' out the ride
Walk up in the high without showin' ID to the bouncer
Young and beautiful so you know that he allows it
Little does he know she's 20, going on a thousand (Thousand)
No, there ain't no doubt about it (Ayy)
Lost at sea, almost drownin'
And wakin' up every mornin' on new couches
And Hollywood houses, nobody's surrounded (Ayy)
She gotta stay high all the time, Tove Lo
Yeah, Sunday night church turned into 1Oak
Goddamn, I wish I could reach out my hand
But she won't pay attention unless I got a bottle in it, no (No way, no way)
All her friends are off the liquor and she's barely even movin'
Like she posin' for a picture, whoa (Pose)
And I can tell deep down she wants to hit the road
Hit theâ€”

She pose for the picture
All her friends are off the liquor tonight (Friends are off the liquor, friends are off the liquor)
And I think she knows something's missing
But this mixture's got her feeling alive, whoa (Mixture's got her feeling, mixture's got her)
She's lost at sea (She's lost), she's off that pill (She's lost)
She's on her knees (She's lost), can't tell what's real (Yeah)
And I think she knows something's missing
But this mixture's got her feeling alive tonight
Yeah
