Odd one, you're never alone
I'm here and I will reflect you
Both of us basically unattached to anything
Or anyone unless we're pretending

You live your life in your head
Some call it imagination
I'd rather focus instead on anything
Except what I'm feeling, what I'm feeling
Odd one

Aye, it's gonna be okay
Aye, we're gonna laugh at this one day

Odd one, I wish I was you
You're never concerned with acceptance
We are all desperately seeking out
And fitting in with anyone who will accept us
But not you, odd one

Aye, it's gonna be okay
Aye, we're gonna laugh at this one day

Hey, it's gonna be okay
Hey, gonna laugh at this one day

Aye, it's gonna be okay
Aye, we're gonna laugh at this one day

Don't let someone tell you you're no one
Don't let someone tell you you're no one
Odd one
