LEAVE MY BABY ALONE
(Harlan Howard - Bobby Bare)

Don't you be a tellin' my baby lies
You better leave my baby alone
And don't you be a winkin' your flirty eyes
You better leave my baby alone
Well I'm not mean and I'm not bad
You better leave my baby alone
You know a jealous gal keep gettin' mean and mad
You better leave my baby alone
He's the only one for me I've always been his girl
And he's all I've got so can't you see I just can't let you take my world
You better gather your sweet talk somewhere else
You better leave my baby alone
Now I can handle my baby all by myself
You better leave my baby alone
You better leave my baby alone
You better leave my baby alone
He's the only one for me I've always been his girl
And he's all I've got so can't you see I just can't let you take my world
You better gather your sweet talk...
You better leave my baby alone you better leave my baby alone
You better leave my baby alone you better leave my baby alone
