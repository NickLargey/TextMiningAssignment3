He was a king 'til she laid waste
Now he can not fill up the space
And I just see him drifting, while he's drifting On Bourbon Alley, feeling low
Just because she let him go
I don't think he even knows
He'll ever be fine

[Chorus]
And he's got a head full of ideas, let me tell ya
That you wouldn't believe
And he's got a heart made of pure gold
And something else, so many tricks up his sleeve
You might think he's a jester because he'll
Make you laugh Ã¢??til you cry
And what else, you better come with your best if you test him
Unless you're ready to die

Wonder woman got rid of wonder man
That man's not part of her wonder plan
Letter to the so called, better bet on my man
Believe it you will find out, baby, damn

[Chorus]

A million people come and go
Through a person's ebb and flow
And faces keep on changing, while they're changing
A certain few will stay intact
When they're not, they'll don an act
I know this important fact
Don't get confused like

[Chorus]

First you love him, then you're loving him not
All the while, he just smiles, giving all that he's got
Do you find it in your heart to say he's not what you sought?
Do you want me to continue with this, or what?  

Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
Head full of ideas, let me tell ya
That you wouldn't believe
And he's got a heart made of pure gold
And something else, so many tricks up his sleeve Sleeve, sleeve
