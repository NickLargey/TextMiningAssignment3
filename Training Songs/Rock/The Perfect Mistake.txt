Wake me up, I've been dreaming
It feels just like any other, day
I sit you down, here goes nothing
And you're not gonna like what I say

And get out, oh, just get out

Get up, get out, that's what you said
You drive me crazy
I can't believe that's what you did
Don't call me baby
And I know I'm wrong, I knew all along that you'd find out
I'm the perfect mistake I'm hoping you'll make right now

Wake me up, I've been dreaming
'Cause I haven't heard from you in, days
Well hazy now, this fog just follows me around
And it's only you that burns it away

So get out, oh, just get out

Get up, get out, that's what you said
You drive me crazy
I can't believe that's what you did
Don't call me baby
I know I'm wrong, I knew all along that you'd find out
I'm the perfect mistake I'm hoping you'll make right now

I see your face every time I close my eyes
It's getting worse you say
It comes as no surprise

Why am I hell-bent on losing?
When I can't get you out of my head

Get up, get out, that's what you said
You drive me crazy
I can't believe that's what you did
Don't call me baby
I know I'm wrong, I knew all along that you'd find out
I'm the perfect mistake I'm hoping you'll make right now

Oh I'm the perfect mistake I'm hoping you'll make right now
Oh you'll make right now
