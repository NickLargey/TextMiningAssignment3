Devil just bought a brand new
Devil just bought a brand new
Devil just bought a brand new
Penthouse in heaven
There goes the old neighborhood
There goes the old neighborhood
There goes the good old neighborhood
On a one way trip to hell!
(Shake you sinner!)
Jesus won't drive nothin'
But a shiny white Mercedes
And all the angels gotta settle
For second hand Oldsmobiles
The virgin Mary loses faith
And starts a chain-reaction
The Lord just stands there weepin'
Bitter tears in the rain
Ain't that a shame
(Shake you sinner!)
Almost as if the bad guys
Got the good guys on the run
All in the line of expectation
In the eyes of the evil one
Like a mad bull chargin'
Through a closet
Of porcelain 'Made in China'
Saddlin' up the righteous
With nightmares full of trauma!
Devil just bought a brand new
Devil just bought a brand new
Devil just bought a brand new
Penthouse in heaven
There goes the old neighborhood
There goes the old neighborhood
There goes the good old neighborhood
Movin' on down to hell
There's no one here
There's nothin' left
No one here to kiss or bless
This damp and dark unholy mess
You could say: Paradise in distress!
(Shake you sinner)
Behind the clouds
There's a silver line
The sun just can't stop waitin'
To put a shine on a clear blue sky
And kill the pessimist in me
Meanwhile.
