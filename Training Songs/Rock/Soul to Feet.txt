You only stop talking
When you're sleeping
There's got to be something wrong
With your past

I can't talk if I'm thinking
I'm not gonna move so fast

Is your life so exciting
You have to tell everyone you meet
Try to make it so enticing
You wear your soul out to your feet
Always leave before them
You want them to think
You've got so much to do
Maybe they're not thinking of you 

If you would shut up
Someone could save you
Manipulate everything
And that's how I love you
