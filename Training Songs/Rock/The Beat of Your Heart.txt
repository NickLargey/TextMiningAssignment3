She was a wanderer
She'd love you as she'd walk away
Beautiful racer, always
Never mind what you say

She was a free one
Had her head in the clouds
I put all of my wonder
I put it out

There's a death on the dance floor
Again my love
There's a light gone out around the world
There's a death on the dance floor
Again my love

She was a wild one
A bright life lit in neon
Everybody that loves you
I wish you could hang on

And she can fix you
Bring you to your knees
There's beauty in danger
There's beauty as far as you can see

There's a death on the dance floor
Again my love
There's a light gone out around the world
There's a death on the dance floor
Again my love
There's a light gone out
There's a light gone out

I sing the beat of your heart (your heartbeat, your heartbeat, your heart)
I sing the beat of your heart (your heartbeat, your heartbeat, your heart)

There's a death on the dance floor (your heartbeat, your heartbeat, your heart)
There's a death on the dance floor (your heartbeat, your heartbeat, your heart)
