I?ll be trouble
You?re so nice
And if I chose to listen
I wouldn?t take your advice
I?m really sorry
Feeling sorry for myself again
But this isn?t working
I wish I could talk to you

You think I don?t care but I do
Yeah I do
When you leave me
You think I don?t care but I do
Wish you knew
But I?m too scared
To tell you how I really feel
Got to do this sometime
Might as well do it now

I want you close
But give me just a little room
I?ll leave the engine running
That is what I do
Putting on a front
You might like that
But will you like me when I?m real
It seems like a long way
A long way to go from here

You think I don?t care but I do
Yeah I do
When you leave me
You think I don?t care but I do
Wish you knew
But I?m too scared
To tell you how I really feel
Got to do this sometime
When it comes rushing out

Is it just too little to late
I messed it up
I think I messed it up
And I think I messed it up with you

You think I don?t care but I do
Yeah I do
When you leave me
You think I don?t care but I do
Wish you knew
But I?m too scared
To tell you how I really feel
Got to do this sometime
Might as well do it now

You think I don?t care but I do
You think I don?t care but I do
