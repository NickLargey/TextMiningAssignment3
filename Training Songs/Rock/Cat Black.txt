Cat Black, you know she`s back 
Been six weeks since she blew her stack 
Now she`s fine, she`s all mine 
I`m gonna stop her blowin` her mind again 
Cat Black she`s my honey 
All she wants to do is spend my money 
She`s a real-gone chick and I love her so 
Knocks me out when she does the rock `n` roll, yeah 

Cat Black you know I`m pleased 
There`s my heart, and here`s the keys to my 
Cadillac, hey Cat Black 
You look all pretty, let`s get turned on 
And fade away 

Cat Black she`s so sweet 
She`s so pretty I can hardly speak 
Dresses in jeans, gets on scenes 
She`s kind and she`s fine to me 

Cat Black, you know she`s back 
Been six weeks since she blew her stack 
Now she`s fine she`s all mine 
I`m gonna stop her blowin` her mind again 

[Repeat last verse]
