Under the cold blue stars
You would just stroll
Around the yard
That's what happens to dreams
When the life strains
And the child lays in you

When you got old
You played guitar
In a little town
Your favorite bar

Just blowing the steam
Now the lights fade and
Everyone's paid to see you

So did the farm
Steal your soul
When the cornfields won't grow
Its time to leave
Now the heart bleeds
And the family leans on you

You were under the cold blue stars
In another town
Your favorite bar
That's what happens to dreams
When the life strains
And the child lays in you
