As I walk in the dirty rain
Acid seeping through my brain
I'm never gonna crack
There can be no turning back
Water runs down the windowpane
As she sucks on a sugarcane
You can see it in my face
Staring into outer space
We're renegades

We belong in the gutter singing
This song, all the bells are ringing
Hey, yeah 
Hey, yeah

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

And it feels like a dirty dream
Like I'm walking to the guillotine
Feel the voodoo in my brain
Sipping on a hurricane

How's it feel to be a freak?
Oh so pale and so unique
To walk lonely in the rain
Unashamed that we are not the same

We belong in the gutter dreaming
Sing along, at the stars we're screaming
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

How does it feel to be alone?
Set apart from all the clones
We're the ones who can't be tamed
Who go against the grain
Alright

Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
We belong in the gutter singing
This song, all the bells are ringing
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

How does it feel to be a renegade?
We're condemned for we are not the same
Visionaries in the cavalcade
No we can't be tamed
