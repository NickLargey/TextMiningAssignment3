I'd like to contest the awards given out by the academy
'Cause I know of a great performance that the judges didn't see

They should have given you the Oscar
For the way you went and broke my heart
There's no name that you could mention
Who'd have done quite as much with a part

And just for the way you said you loved me
And the way you made each lie sound sincere
Oh, they should have given you the Oscar
For the best performance of the year

If the critics could have seen
Your acting on the screen
I'm sure they would have cried as much as I
You knew your lines so well
How was I supposed to tell
That all along you loved another guy?

They should have given you the Oscar
For the scene where you promised to be true
Every word was so convincing
Any audience would fall in love with you

And just for the way you said you loved me
And the way you made each lie sound sincere
Oh, they should have given you the Oscar
For the best performance of the year

Yeah they should have given you the Oscar
For the best performance of the year

Yeah they should have given you the Oscar
For the best performance of the year
