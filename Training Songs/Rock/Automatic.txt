I think, I think I know it all,
But can I be sure of the things I've grown to know,
And can I say I know it all,
When rules just guide me to blindly follow
And things are automatic when you see them everyday
Is it the same routine
Or my fucked up dreams,
That keep me walking mindless all the way?
I think, I think I know it all
But is our beliefs just stringing us along
And was there something wrong in what I heard,
For every hour of the day?
