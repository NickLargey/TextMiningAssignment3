I've been to Alabama, people, ain't a whole lot to sse;
Skynard says it's a real sweet home, but it ain't nothing to me
Charlie Daniels will tell you the good Lord lives in Tennessee, ha!
But I'm going back to the Gator Country, where the wine and women are free

There's a gator in the bushes, he's calling my name
And a saying come on, boy, you better make it back home again
There's many roads I've traveled but they all kinda look the same
There's a gator in the bushes, Lord, he's calling my name

Old Richard Betts will tell ya Lord, he was born a Ramblin' Man,
Well, he can ramble on back to Georgia and I won't give a damn
Elvin Bishop out struttin' his stuff with little Miss Slick Titty Boom,
But I'm going back to the Gator Country to get me some elbow room

There's a gator in the bushes, he's calling my name
And a saying come on, boy, you better make it back home again
There's many roads I've traveled but they all kinda look the same
There's a gator in the bushes, Lord, he's calling my name Yep

There's Marshall Tucker a ridin' a rainbow, searching for a pot of gold
Well, they can take the highway, baby, and take all they can hold
The Outlaws down in Tampa town, yes, a mighty fine place to be
They got green grass and they got high tides and it sure looks good to me

There's a gator in the bushes, he's calling my name
Saying come on, boy, you better make it back home again
There's many roads I've traveled but they all kinda look the same
There's a gator in the bushes, Lord, he's calling my name

Oh, Gator Country, a little bit of that chomp chomp
