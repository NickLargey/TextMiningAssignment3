I found some peace today, I grit my teeth
And swallow all of my pain
And selfish pride, I used to hide behind

Let me out let me out I'm singing
Let me out let me out I'm singing
I'm a liar and cheat in prison
Accused of telling the truth

Flames of pain stained paint my eyes
Child I've lost this face won't lie
Time burns my souls decay gray
Sifting through the smoke and lies
Swimming exhale love that's died
The first and last ain't ever the same
So I'll keep on singing this
I don't care if your right or if I'm always wrong
Just want to sing my song before this whole world

Let me out let me out I'm singing
Let me out let me out I'm singing
I'm a liar and a cheat in prison
Accused of telling the truth

Now and forever I stand to sever all ties and connections
To recollections of pain and fear
Family society authority and ever peer
Swallowing tears line my stomach
I'm getting freer every second corroding and exploding 
All these corporate deceptions I'm out

Mental prison bars block our minds
Youths truth sold and televised
I never bought it and I won't play your game's for fame
Are we just rats in a pipers tune soothed
Scrappin' for cheese in a maze made to loose
I know I'm not and I won't eat your food, subdued
I don't care if your right or if I'm always wrong
Just want to sing my song before this whole world's 
Gone

Let me out let me out I'm singing
Let me out let me out I'm singing
I'm a liar and a cheat in prison
Accused of telling the truth

I'm out
