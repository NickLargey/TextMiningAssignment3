This whole city's black and white
Tell me what is your color.
Could it be the same as mine?
Faded greens and blue street lights,
There's a red fire burning
In the sea up to the sky.

I don't want to wait until tomorrow
To tell you how I'd feel the rest of my life
You don't want a waste another minute to realize
Walking on the dark side of the evening
Baby it is you, that opened my eyes
Burning like a fire on the water
The city of black and white.
Won't you just stay?
Won't you just stay?

I'm on the top step looking down
And their coming up to me
It's where the whole world wants to be found
Golden rings and coffee brown
There's white flag waving 
Where my heart is on the ground.

I don't want to wait until tomorrow
To tell you how I'd feel the rest of my life
You don't want a waste another minute to realize
Walking on the dark side of the evening
Baby it is you that opened my eyes
Burning like a fire on the water
The city of black and white.
Won't you just stay?
Won't you just stay?

Won't you just stay now
With the light poles
Over a dark street
No one else knows
So take my hands
I'll carry you, you can carry me.

'Cause I don't want to wait until tomorrow
To tell you how I'd feel the rest of my life
