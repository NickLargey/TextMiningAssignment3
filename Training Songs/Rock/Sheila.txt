The other night, I had a dream
I was dying in desert sand
And then above watching over me
Stood an angel with a golden hand

Singing Sheila Sheila, Sheila Sheila
Screeling and a reeling
Sheila Sheila, Sheila Sheila, Sheila Sheila
My heart she was stealing

Living here in this old town
There ain't a lot to do
And after work I just ride around
Looking out for something new
When I saw you standing in a drugstore
Trying on your diamond ring
Had to run in jump through the front door
Grab your hand and start to sing about

Singing Sheila Sheila, Sheila Sheila
Screeling and a reeling
Sheila Sheila, Sheila Sheila, Sheila Sheila
My heart she was stealing

She don't run, she don't hide
Sheila thinks that everyone is beautiful inside
Sheila put your red dress on and let your long hair down
We're gonna make them turn the lights on
On the hill at the edge of town
I was lost and on my own I was lost and broken down
And when you sing that old Shirelle song
I'm the king with the golden crown

Singing na na na na oh sheila sheila 
Sheila's inside of the night, 
Trying to take me into the light
