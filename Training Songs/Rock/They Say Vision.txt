I wanna try that pill that people take
Make you believe all the things that people say
Sick of shuckin' 'round with a screwed up face
With my heels dug in, trying to leave a trace

Now come on, put me down somehow
How you lose your faith

Just take my hand and lead me where you wanna
Pay no more mind to what you think you've seen
It's as they do only, say, what they say

'Cause, there's only one way, they say, vision
It takes you back to just where you want
Like when you ain't know no way

Pay no more mind to what you think you've seen
It's as they do only, say, what they say
'Cause, there's only one way, they say, vision
It takes you back to just where you want
Like when you ain't know no way

Industry's down, think I've died and I've flown away, yeah
So, so, long to them thieves
Who came and took all the things to say

I play the joker sometimes
But then those moments slide back my way
'Cause, for real, I'd give my soul away, give it all away

So, take my hand and lead me where you wanna
Pay no more mind to what you think you've seen
It's as they do only, say, what they say

'Cause, there's only one way, they say, vision
It takes you back to just where you want
Like when you ain't know no way

Pay no more mind to what you think you've seen
It's as they do only, say, what they say
'Cause, there's only one way, they say, vision
It takes you back to just where you want
Like when you ain't know no way

I know where they all go find someplace
Where they don't mind loafing about the waste
They say, vision takes you back to where no conscience
Free from how you really see
And if you think that you know, take the back road

I wanna try that pill that people take
I wanna try that pill that people take
I wanna try that pill that people take

Make you believe all the things that people say
Sick of shuckin' 'round with a screwed up face
With my heels dug in, trying to leave a trace

Now come on, put me down somehow
How you lose your faith

Pay no more mind to what you think you've seen
It's as they do only, say, what they say
'Cause, there's only one way, they say, vision
It takes you back to just where you want
Like when you ain't know no way

Pay no more mind to what you think you've seen
It's as they do only, say, what they say
'Cause, there's only one way, they say, vision
It takes you back to just where you want
Like when you ain't know no way

Pay no more mind to what you think you've seen
It's as they do only, say, what they say
'Cause, there's only one way
