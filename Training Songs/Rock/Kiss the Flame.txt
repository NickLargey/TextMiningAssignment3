Please love let's make no impartial vow
Let's all fall away
That's not crucial now
I want a brave love, one that makes me weak in the knees
I want a crazy, crazy love
One that makes me come undone at the seams

Cause I'm tired of all these pilgrims, these puritans, these thieves 
Of all these unbelievers who whittle love down at the knees 
Let these swift roads destroy themselves 
Let the world fall into it's sleep 
For we shall be spared 
We shall be left standing 
To face what's left of concrete and honey

Kiss the flame
Let's run with the hunted, the untamed
Kiss the flame
Embrace the faceless, the unnamed
Kiss the flame

There are nightmares on these sidewalks
There are jokes on TV
There are people selling thoughtlessness
With such casualty
But wherefore art thou Romeo
Where have all the brave men gone
Show me one man who knows his own heart
To him I shall belong

Kiss the flame
Let's run with the hunted, the untamed
Kiss the flame
Embrace the faceless, the unnamed
Kiss the flame
Kiss the flame
Kiss the flame

Please love let's make no impartial vow
