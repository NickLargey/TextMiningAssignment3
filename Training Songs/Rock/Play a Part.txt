You were right
I was wrong from the beginning
Wrong from the very first night
When you said
We could stay here forever
And never ever, ever forget
So we took our love to the sea that night
So see if it could ever swim back
It did and it did
Four hundred thousand times
Over again

I only wanted to play a part
I wanted to be someone
Who could make it and make it with you
Again and again

Well go on, go on
You can have your way
I'll love you till the day that I die
You could have this life
And a cup of tea
And take it to bed right now
In a dim lit bar on my side of town
I'll picture in a green dress
The one that makes me feel alive
Over and over and over again

I only wanted to play a part
I wanted to be someone
Who could make it and make it with you
Again and again

Only wanted to play a part
I wanted to be someone
Who could make it and make it with you
Again and again

Wanted to play the part
Wanted to be someone
With you

I only wanted to play a part
I wanted to be someone
Who could make it and make it with you
Again and again
