As much as she'd like to believe
She's leading a brand new wave
That uniform that she wears
I see on the street every day

She looks heavenward
And struggles to find the right cliche
You've got to find your own space
Have a nice day

She's so young
She's got the answers (she's got the answers)
She doesn't need to question herself like I do
Like I do

She's so young
She's got the answers (she's got the answers)
She doesn't need to question the world like I do
Like I do (like I do)

Like the wisdom of ages
Will flow from her tongue
This is the delusion of the young
She says she'll lead with her heart
But her heart really doesn't know at all
I'll get no satisfaction 
Out of seeing her fall

She's so young
She's got the answers (she's got the answers)
She doesn't need to question herself like I do
Like I do (I do)
