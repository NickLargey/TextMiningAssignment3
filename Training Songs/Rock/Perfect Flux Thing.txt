the cause of this start
an arc finds its falling
at last sign of heat
blue rose ring morning
there's nothing wrong here
there's nothing wrong
sin or pure
i give this glad tear
to blur sure horizon
at risk sense and core
ground work for
good good poison
there's nothing wrong here
there's nothing wrong
nothing wrong
sin or pure
the world leaves no choice
and all shades of warning
so take gain and loss
as food for this
perfect flux thing
there's nothing wrong here
there's nothing wrong
nothing wrong...
