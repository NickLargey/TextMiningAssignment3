There comes time when all the children all want something else to do
They were headed to the graveyard walking down North Avenue
Tell me what to do about you and we’ll be just fine
I said, “I forgive you when I’m near you,” every single time

Running down the alleyway that we took home from school
Hand in hand and face to face, you told me I’m your fool
One by one and two by two, I tried not to be cruel
She said, “Wait for me on Second Street, I’ll see you after school.”

Could it be the reason that I met you at the pool?
The leaves were turning, I was learning what’s not right to do
The same things that I believe in when I’m in need of help
Don’t leave me on the concrete, crying by myself

Running down the alleyway that we took home from school
We were hand in hand and face to face, you told me I’m a fool
It’s goes one by one and two by two, I tried not to be cruel
She said, “Wait for me on Second Street, I’ll see you after school.”
