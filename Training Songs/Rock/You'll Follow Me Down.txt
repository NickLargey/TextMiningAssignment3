Survived, tonight, I may be going down, 
Cause everything goes round too, tight, tonight, 
And it, you watch him crawl, you stand for more. 
And your panic stricken, blood will thicken up, tonight
Cause I don't want you, to forgive me, 
You'll follow me down, you'll follow me down, 
You'll follow me down
Survive tonight, (I see your) head's exposed, 
So we shall kill, constructive might, s'right, 
As your emotions fool you, (my) strong will rule, 
I won't feel restraint, watching you close sense down, 
I can't compensate, that's more than I've got to give.
