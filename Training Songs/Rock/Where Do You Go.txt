Where do you go
When it starts to rain
Where will you sleep
When the night time comes

What do you do
When your heart's in pain
Where will you run
When the right time comes

These are the things
That I want to know
Where will you hide
When the lights are low

Where do you go
When it starts to rain
Where will you sleep
When the night time comes
