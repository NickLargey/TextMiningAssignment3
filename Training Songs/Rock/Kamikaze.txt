Maybe I can get you in
Spend my time on you again
Leave our tickets, at the door
We're not paying anymore

When it's time to go
I'll meet you in the parking lot
We'll escape, like a Kamikaze
But it's late, and you're tired
but we're safe beneath the summer sky
You and me, we're Kamikaze

Just to live is what you want
But the change is what I need
And I'm not wasting another life
We can find somewhere to hide

When it's time to go
I'll meet you in the parking lot
We'll escape, like a Kamikaze
But it's late, and you're tired
but we're safe beneath the summer sky
You and me, we're Kamikaze

Call me up when you're alone
We can find somewhere to go
We can pick it up again
And we'll see the morning in

When it's time to go
I'll meet you in the parking lot
We'll escape, like a Kamikaze
But it's late, and you're tired
but we're safe beneath the summer sky
You and me, we're Kamikaze
