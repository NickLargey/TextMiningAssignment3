This is the voice of God
You've got it, you've got it
Stay in and lock your doors

I don't care what you've achieved
There's only one location if you don't follow me
(You always get what you wanted)
You're gonna burn in a blistering furnace
From now until forever, no matter how it ends
(You always get what you wanted)

Halt, freeze, who goes there?
Do you have the right, do you have the right documentation?
Stop, wait, this ain't right
This is fraudulent, this is counterfeit, you're a hoodwinker, sir

This is the voice of God
The shrinkwrapper of minds
Stay in, lock your doors

Halt, freeze, who goes there?
Do you have the right, do you have the right documentation?

Halt, freeze, who goes there?
Do you have the right, do you have the right documentation?
Stop, wait, this ain't right
This is fraudulent, this is counterfeit, you're a hoodwinker, sir

I don't care if you're devout
To the three thousand
Other gods
I'm the ace that breaks the spade
Hostile to liberty
Burning books
It's mental captivity

It's a swindle for your soul
It's a swindle for your soul
It's a swindle for your soul (you always get what you wanted) 
For your soul

It's a swindle for your soul
It's a swindle for your soul
It's a swindle for your soul (you always get what you wanted)
For your soul

Halt, freeze, who goes there?
Do you have the right, do you have the right documentation?
Stop, wait, this ain't right
This is fraudulent, this is counterfeit, you're a hoodwinker, sir

You are a hoodwinker, sir
What do you take me for, a fool?
Cheeky fucker
