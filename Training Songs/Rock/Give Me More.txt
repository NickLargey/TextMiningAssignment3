Tell me why it hurts so bad.I just don't undestand.
What makes you think I feel so glad.
Just to hold your hand.
You never ever call me on the phone
You're havin' fun and I' m back here alone
Give me more - Give me more - Give me more
Tray to understand
Give me more - Give me more - Give me more
Let me be your man
You wanna play around with me
I ain't that kind of guy
I need more than I had before
Now don't you be so shy
What in the world am I supposed to do
I can't hide the love I have for you
Give me more - Give me more - Give me more
Tray to understand
Give me more - Give me more - Give me more
Let me be your man
Why don't you give me one more chance
You never tried to find romance
I got a lot of lovin' here for you
You don't believe baby but it' s true.
Give me more - Give me more - Give me more
Tray to understand
Give me more - Give me more - Give me more
Let me be your man
