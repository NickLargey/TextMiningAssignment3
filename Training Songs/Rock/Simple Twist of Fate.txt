They sat together in the park
As the evening sky be dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones, it was then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
Watch out for a simple twist of fate

They walked along by the old canal
Was so confused, I remember well
Stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
It hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far off played
She is walking under the arcade
The light bust through a beat-up shade
Where he was waking up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
Forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up and the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself that he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

He hears a ticking of the clock
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
Oh, how long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But God, I lost the ring, she was born in spring
But I was born too late
Blame it on the simple twist of fate
