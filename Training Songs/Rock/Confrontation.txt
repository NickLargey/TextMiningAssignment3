Don't be silent, fight
Violence, mêlées and disturbances of peace

Here's your introduction to destruction and the hate sustaining me
Are we safer or in danger drowning in atrocities?
Riot gear the slaves are here piling corpses high
It's the rich man's war but it's the poor that fight

More capitalist crimes, more enemies than allies
No WMD's, who gives a f*ck if they die?
Just kill 'em all, watch 'em fall, skin the world with their lies
It's the rich man's war but it's the poor that fight

Stand up, speak out, strike back
Stand up, speak out, strike back
They don't know what they started
Confrontation

My religion of resistance challenging everything
Radicals and dissidents of creativity
We are the children of the siege, you hide
In this rich man's war where the poor just die

More deception and greed, more wars and disease
More lies from the high, mind that seek to deceive
A weak nation of need like silent thieves in the night
It's a rich man's war but it's the poor that die

Stand up, speak out, strike back
Stand up, speak out, strike back
They don't know what they started
Confrontation

Stand, fight, speak, fight, strike back
Stand, fight, speak, fight, strike back
They don't know what they started
Confrontation

This is my battle cry
Defy the lies of the tyrant race
With a fist in the air
And a finger in their face

Defy the tyrants, don't be silent
Defy the tyrants, don't be silent
Defy the tyrants, don't be silent
Defy the tyrants, don't be silent

Stand up, speak out, strike back
Stand up, speak out, strike back
They don't know what they started
Confrontation

Stand, fight, speak, fight, strike back
Stand, fight, speak, fight, strike back
They don't know what they started
Confrontation

Well there's no way they can stop us now
There's no way they can stop us now
There's no way they can stop us
So let them try, we fight or we die
