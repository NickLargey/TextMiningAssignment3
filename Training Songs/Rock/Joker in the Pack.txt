Oh my boots they shine
And my bowler looks fine
Take some time and care
Take a look at my hair
We hit the dance hall
So smart and so chic
I make them laught a lot
I make them accept me
Secrets are spoken
Plans are drawn in the dust
With a gay bravado
I'm taken into their trust
Oh my boots they shine
And my bowler looks fine
But don't confide in my smile
Because jokers are wild
