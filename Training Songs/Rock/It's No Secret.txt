It's no secret, how strong my love is for you
It's no secret, when I tell you what I'm gonna do

'Cause I love you, yes I love you
It's no secret, everybody knows how I feel
It's no secret, when I say my love is real
'Cause I love you, yes I love you

It's no secret, when you got me jumping up and down
It's no secret, 'cause my heart is chained and bound
I love you, yes I love you, yeah

It's no secret, everybody knows how I feel

As I get older the years they get heavy for you
Oh is it any wonder why I feel that my whole life is through 
Yeah, when I stop feeling how strong my love is for you 
Oh, know I'll be empty wanting your love like I do

It's no secret, no, when you got me jumping up and down
It's no secret, 'cause my heart is chained and bound
I love you, yes I love you, yeah
It's no secret, no, everybody knows how I feel
It's no secret, no, everybody knows how I feel, yeah 
It's no secret, yeah
