I didn't know my baby loved me so until that letter come to let me know
Now I pack my bags and then I'll go and catch the first train I see headin'south

If I got this letter in Idaho where snow's so deep it wouldn't let me go
I'd went hog wild and melted all that snow
And caught the first train I saw headin' south
If I got this letter in Iowa nothing in this world could make me stay
I'd grab my hat and then been on my way and caught the first train I saw headin' south
I didn't know my baby loved me so until that letter come to let me know
Now I pack my bags and then I'll go and catch the first train I see headin'south

I didn't know my baby loved me so until that letter come to let me know
Now I'll pack my bags and then I'll go and catch the first train I see headin' south

If I'd got this letter in Ohio with a busted back, two arms and broken toe
There'd be no hesitation I would go and catch the first train I saw headin'south
But I got this letter up in Maine you can bet your bottom dollar I feel the same
Every clickety-clack of drivers call her name
As I ride this first train I caught headin' south
I didn't know my baby loved me so until that letter come to let me know
Now I pack my bags and then I'll go and catch the first train I see headin'south
