Little lady
oh little lady you're dancing me off my feet
Little lady
oh can't you feel the heat when you hold me

Oh when you hold me it feels like I'm going insane

Little lady can't get you out of my brain.

You fill me up with desire
you take me higher and higher
You kisses burn me like fire
fire
fire
fire:

Hot lips
hot lips girl you got hot lips burning me all night long
The feeling's comin' on strong
Baby
you're turning me on.
Hot lips
hot lips girl you got hot lips burning me all night long
Our love can never go wrong
Baby
you're turning me on.
Baby
I love you. Hot lips.

When you touch me-oh-when you touch me it feels like I'm gonna die
Watch me baby oh watch me hit the sky. Little lady
oh little lady
You're dancin' me off my feet. Little lady oh

Can't you feel the heat.

You fill me up with desire
you take me higher and higher
. . .

Hot lips
hot lips girl you got hot lips burning me all night long
