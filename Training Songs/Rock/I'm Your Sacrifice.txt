Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Something's rattled your cage
Stopped me dead in my tracks
Been through hell and high tide, but we never looked back
I thought that we couldn't lose and then I bet all I had
From the top of the world I started seeing the cracks

Am I losing you now
Am I losing you now

Why would you change on me
When I took a chance on you
Is it upsetting you that everything's in place
Is this how you play the game
Giving your hand away
When I'm all in and still you roll the dice
And I'm your sacrifice

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Got no cards up my sleeve, nothing under my hat
The moment of truth, there's no going back
Went from Bonnie and Clyde to Jeckyll and Hyde
We're fire and ice, we're fire and ice

Am I loosing it now
Am I loosing it now

Why did you change on me
When I took a chance on you
Was it upsetting you that everything's in place
Is this how you play the game
Giving your hand away
When I'm all in and still you roll the dice
And I'm your sacrifice

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Is this how you play, the game
When I'm all in and still you roll the dice
Giving your hand, away
When I'm all in and still you roll the dice
And I'm your sacrifice

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

I'm still a believer
