Ohh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch a long, lonely time
Time goes by, so slowly
And time can do so much, are you still mine?

I need your love, I need your love
God, speed your love to me

Ohh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch a long, lonely time
Oh time goes by, so slowly
And time can do so much, are you still mine?

I need your love, I need your love
God, speed your love to me
My love, my darling, ohh, my love, my darling, ohh
