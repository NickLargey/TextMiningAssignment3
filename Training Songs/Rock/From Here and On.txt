In this days of hate and division
It's a gift to have someone you can trust
Someone to share every little thing with
The good times, and the daily musts

Right now the sky may seem heavy
But I know the clouds will break up

From here we can only go forward
You and me, we keep the dream alive
And with you it all seems so easy
It's all worth givin' a try.

And when I've been away I've got someone to come home to
You know that means a lot to me
You pick me up when everything is so slow
When I'm knee deep, knee deep in wet concrete.

Right now the sky may seem heavy
But I know the clouds will break up

From here we can only go forward
You and me, we keep the dream alive
And with you it all seems so easy
It's all worth givin' a try
So I'll give it a try

From here we can only go forward
You and me, we keep the dream alive
And with you it all seems so easy
It's all worth givin' a try
