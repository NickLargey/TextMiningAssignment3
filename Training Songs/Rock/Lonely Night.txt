Lonely night, I cry myself to sleep.
Tell me, what am I gonna do?
'Cause it's always been you to dry the tears,
Always been you to wash away my fears,
Always been you each night and day,
Now what can I say when love slips away?
 
Lonely night, I'm walkin' the floor.
Tell me, what am I gonna do
Without your precious love, your tender touch?
Hey, little girl, miss you so much;
Wish we could turn back the hands of time
To the day when you were mine.
 
You used to call me angel face,
Used to call me angel face.
You used to help me through the night,
Make me feel alright.
Now all I have is teardrops through a lonely night.
Lonely night.
 
I promise you I'll change my ways,
I promise you love's here to stay.
Hey, little girl, depend on me,
I'll be yours for eternity.
 
You used to call me angel face,
Used to call me angel face.
You used to help me through the night,
Make me feel alright.
Now all I have is teardrops through a lonely night.
Lonely night,
Lonely night.
Such a, such a, such a lonely night.
Lonely night.
Lonely lonely night lonely night lonely night
