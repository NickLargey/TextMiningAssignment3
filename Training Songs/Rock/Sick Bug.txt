It was a formal kiss
It's one I'm gonna miss
I'm in the mud
Stumbling around like a sick bug
I close my eyes
To take me back
She touched my leg

I want you I want you
I want you I want you
I wanna see your smile
On a blue afternoon
I'm dreamin' of your ceiling
And the smell of your room
I want you I want you I want you

And when the afternoon sea breeze
Cuts through
Bringing with it a cool assault
I feel brand new

Every day I'm growing older
Time is all I have to hold her

I bury my seed
In the garden of teeth
I burn the tape
I lay awake
