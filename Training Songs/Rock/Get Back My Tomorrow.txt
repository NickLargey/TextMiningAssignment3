What goes around comes back around
Your hollow words they echo now
For you to keep when you're alone
So you can lie to yourself when I'm gone
It's a bitter pill to swallow
Can you taste the pain and sorrow
Go on and beg and steal and borrow
But that won't get back my tomorrow

What hurts to learn
Will make you wise
Was it worth the burn to get to this goodbye
I'd rather start again
On this dirt floor
Crawl my way back to the man I was before
It's a bitter pill to swallow
Can you taste the pain and sorrow
Go on and beg and steal and borrow
But that won't get back my tomorrow
Oh yeah

Yeah take all the time you need
Yeah you're taking no more from me
It's a bitter pill to swallow
Can you taste the pain and sorrow
Go on and beg and steal and borrow
That won't get back my tomorrow

It's a bitter pill to swallow
Can you taste the pain and sorrow
Go on and beg and steal and borrow
That won't get back my tomorrow
