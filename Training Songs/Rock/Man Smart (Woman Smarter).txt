Let us put man and woman together
And see which one is smarter
Some say men but I say no
The women got the men like a puppet show 

Ain't me, its the people they say
The men are leading the women astray
But I say, its the women today
Are smarter than the man in every way 

That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter 

A little boy sat down and cried
An old man passing asked him why
He said I can't do what the big boys do
Old man sat down and he cried too 

Ain't me, its the people that say
The men are leading the women astray
But I say, its the women today 
Are smarter than the man in every way

That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
