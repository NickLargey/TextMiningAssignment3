I always thought I was the strong one 
Who had the faith when you had doubt
I was the one to hide my feelings
You were the one to let them out
My daddy taught me, "Son, be tough and strong"
That is what I tried to do
But you're telling me, girl, that you can't live like this
And that you might be leaving soon

Do real men cry?
I never thought that it was true
Maybe I could tough this one out
Be strong enough to make it through
But now there's tears in the eyes of this stubborn fool
Do real men cry?
Baby, now you know that real men do

I assumed you knew that I would love you and be your rock through thick and thin
I've always been a man of few words when what you needed was a friend
I thought if I stood tall just like a wall, it would all be good enough
Please let me hold you now and promise you, girl, that I'm through with acting tough
