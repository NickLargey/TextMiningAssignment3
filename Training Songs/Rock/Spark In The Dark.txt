Oh, welcome to the party 
It's only me and you 
Tell the world to go away, babe 
And I'll tell you what to do 
Come over here and kiss me 
I want to pull your hair 
Turn out the lights and hold me 
I want to touch you everywhere 

We don't need nobody, baby 
We don't need champagne 
I'll take you to the deepest, darkest, hottest, lovers' lane 

For a little spark in the dark 
Just a little spark in the dark 
Don't matter where we sleep 
Don't matter where we park 
All we need is a spark, spark 
Spark in the dark 
Just a little spark in the dark 

Oh, come around midnight 
We'll be crawlin' on the floor 
Burnin' with the fever 
And yellin' out for more 
But don't you write it in your diary, baby 
Don't blab it on the phone 
'Cause if your mom and dad find out 
They'll skin me to the bone 

Now we don't need instructions, baby 
Don't you be afraid 
It takes a little friction, ah ha
That's how our love is made 

From a little spark in the dark 
Just a little spark in the dark 
Don't matter what you say 
No matter what you do 
As long as it is me and you 
We got a spark in the dark 
Just a little spark in the dark
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

We don't need nobody, baby 
We don't need cocaine 
I'll take you to the deepest, darkest, hottest lovers' lane 

Spark in the dark 
Just a little spark in the dark 
Don't matter where we sleep 
Don't matter where we park 
All we need is a spark, spark 
Spark in the dark 
Spark in the dark 
Just a little spark in the dark 
No matter what we say, no matter what we do
As long as it is me and you
We've got a spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark
Oh, Well, you got your reputation baby, I got mine
And there's every indication you're the dangerous kind
You wear the black leather dress and it's toasin' tight
Sparks are gonna fly when I turn out the light
I need a spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark
