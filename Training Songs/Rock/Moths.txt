The leaded window opened
To move the dancing candle flame
And the first Moths of summer
Suicidal came, suicidal came.

And a new breeze chattered
In its May-bud tenderness,
Sending water-lillies sailing
As she turned to get undressed.

And the long night awakened
And we soared on powdered wings,
Circling our tomorrows
In the wary month of Spring.

Chasing shadows slipping
In a magic lantern slide,
Creatures of the candle
On a night-light-ride.

Dipping and weaving
Flutter through the golden needle's eye
In our haystack madness.
Butterfly-stroking on a Spring-tide high.

Life's too long (as the Lemming said)
As the candle burned and the Moths were wed.
And we'll all burn together as the wick grows higher
But before the candle's dead.

The leaded window opened
To move the dancing candle flame.
And the first moths of summer
Suicidal came, oh, suicidal came.

To join in the worship
Of the light that never dies
In a moment's reflection
Of two moths spinning in her eyes.
