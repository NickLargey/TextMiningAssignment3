Don't know enough about the things you do
I don't know enough to say I really know you
But I already fell in love with you
And if you knew what would you do?

I can tell a lot by the things you wear
I can tell you're gonna be a millionaire
But I already fell in love with you
And if you knew what would you do?

I've stopped myself from trying
I shouldn't talk to you
And now inside I'm dying
What would you do?
