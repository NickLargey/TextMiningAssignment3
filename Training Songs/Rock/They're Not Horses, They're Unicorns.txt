You're pulling out your teeth
And I'm the Novocaine you pump in your cheek
That's why I'm still around, you've got blood running down your chin
But you suffered peacefully

She was a termite
Eating away at my roots
I was just a lost soul who needed a home
I was filling a void with you

And I can't, can't wait
Till you've see see seen
What death and disgust
Have done to me

And I spent three years
Wishing for two things
That one day you'd break
And I'd get to see

How all the choices you've made
Would drive you insane
I wish we never met

As angry as I sound
That's just the way I cover up, the way I feel
I've been that way for years and years
Slave to broken hearts and sex appeal

And she was a termite
Eating away at my roots
I was just a lost soul who needed a home
I was filling a void with you

And I can't, can't wait
Till you've see see seen
What death and disgust
Have done to me

And I spent three years
Wishing for two things
That one day you'd break
And I'd get to see

How all the choices you've made
Would drive you insane
I wish we never met

She was a termite
Eating away at my roots
I was just a lost soul who needed a home
I was filling a void with you

And I can't, can't wait
Till you've see see seen
What death and disgust
Have done to me

And I spent three years
Wishing for two things
That one day you'd break
And I'd get to see

How all the choices you've made
Would drive you insane
I wish we never met
