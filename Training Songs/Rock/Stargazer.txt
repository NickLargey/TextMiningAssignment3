So you say that your heart
When it beats its like a landslide
And the word on the street from the man
It brings you down
Can you still find the time and the signs
To look around

You tell me love
Tell me where the stars sleep
Tell me why your eyes weep
I really want to know
And show me love
Take me to the place where
Everything would change there
And we'd all be free

And you place your faith in a mountain
But what you don't understand
Is that the man is
The same old rock
Can you still find the time and the signs
To look around

And tell me love
Tell me where the stars sleep
Tell me why your eyes weep
I really want to know
And show me love
Take me to the place where
Everything would change there
And we'd all be free

These are the times
When we live inside our minds
With our hands in the air
There's voices everywhere
In the slipstream
It's like a daydream
These are the days
When we're dancing through the haze
With our ears to the ground
We're searching for the sound
Of a dove's cry, but it won't be over until

You tell me love
Tell me where the stars sleep
Tell me why your eyes weep
I really want to know
And show me love
Take me to the place where
Everything would change there
And we'd all be free

I really want to know [x4]
