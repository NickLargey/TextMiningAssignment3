Lay down, and rest your head
Stretch your body across my bed
Just close your eyes, I'll take you there
That open highway's waiting where
You'll know me just like I know you
Where every gospel word is true
I'll drive this car, I'll be your guide
Just fasten your seat belt, let's go for a ride

I'll take you someplace that you've never been before
A place you might have only dreamt about what's more

Just one road in and just one road out
I know this country inside out
I speak in tongues, in tongues of fire
With sixteen wheels for my desire

300 horse in my V8
Close to one hundred MPH
And all the meters up in the red
Now don't you worry your pretty little petrol head

I'll take you someplace that you've never been before
A place you might have only dreamt about what's more
Like Moses driving to his promised land
Left turn at the burning bush, a stick shift in my hand

Bring me my bow of burning gold
Bring me my arrows of desire
Bring me my spear, o clouds unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire!

I fought my way from hell to this
And drove my truck through a hail of fists
But I ain't never killed no innocent man
Kept the engine running so I just ran
But I've been wounded, I been shot
And this is all the thanks I got
A busted arm and a busted lip
Let's climb aboard the mothership

I'll take you someplace that you've never been before
A place you might have only dreamt about what's more
Like Moses driving to his promised land
Left turn at the burning bush, a stick shift, two stone tablets
God's commandments in my hands

300 horse in my V8
Close to one hundred MPH
And all the meters up in the red
Now don't you worry your pretty little petrol head
Pretty little petrol head
