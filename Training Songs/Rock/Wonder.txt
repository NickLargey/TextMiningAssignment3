All the signs were there for me to see,
If I cry out with fear I'll feel more afraid,
So beat the sense back into me,
'Cause you are like forbidden fruit out of my reach
And I forgot what I had sometimes

But if everyone has there shot and moves on
And you can't get out the way
Well it's you wonder will save

You were mine and now you're mine to want
And I knew if you'd cut the cord rush like balloons I'd fall
It's criminal to pause
As you basked in the seas applause I had it all
And I forgot what I had, sometimes

But if everyone has there shot and moves on
And you can't get out the way
And its all for the best its all a lie
That everyone has their day

'Cause if everyone has their shot and moves on
And you just get in the way
Well its you wonder will save

La,la,la,
La,la,la,
La,la,la...etc

Don't let them make you feel small with their hands like guns at your head,
They'll claw but they'll never win if you let wonder in...

'Cause if everyone has their shot and moves on
And you can't get out the way
And it's all for the best its all a lie
And everyone has their day

'Cause if everyone has their shot and moves on
And you just get out the way
Well it's you wonder will save

'Cause if everyone has there shot and moves on
And you can't get out the way
And it's all for the best it's all a lie
And everyone has their day

But if everyone has their shot and moves on
And you just get out the way
Well it's you wonder will save

Yeah it's you wonder will save
Yeah it's you wonder will save.
