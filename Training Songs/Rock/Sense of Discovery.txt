Put your hands on me
Rage will dissolve like the wind

One last moment
The days were closing in
The ray of light
Was faltering

Was no more sequence
No words could tell
The pace of time
Was gathering

And you saved yourself for me
And you lead me to a sense of discovery

Waiting for a moment that you think won't come
Belief is navigation but you must go on
The heart is like a temple one cannot see
Inside this world's discovery
From the desert to the ocean we'll be following the sun
The journey now, it has just begun
And the heart is like a temple one cannot see
Inside these walls just you and me

So put your hand on me

One last moment
The waves were rolling in
The ray of light
Was faltering

And you placed your hands on me

Waiting for a moment that you think won't come
Belief is navigation but you must go on
The heart is like a temple one cannot see
Inside this world's discovery
From the desert to the ocean we'll be following the sun
The journey now, it has just begun
And the heart is like a temple one cannot see
Inside these walls just you and me

So put your hand on me
So I'll see
That the rage will dissolve like the wind
Endlessly

No more life cast away, so lonely
When you lead me to this sense of discovery

Put your hand on me
So I will see
That the rage will dissolve like the wind
Endlessly

Inside this world's discovery

Waiting for a moment that you think won't come
Belief is navigation but you must go on
The heart is like a temple one cannot see
Inside this world's discovery
From the desert to the ocean we'll be following the sun
The journey now, it has just begun
And the heart is like a temple one cannot see
Inside this world's discovery

Waiting for a moment that you think won't come
Belief is navigation but you must go on
The heart is like a temple one cannot see 
From the desert to the ocean we'll be following the sun (Put) 
The journey now, it has just begun (Your hand)
And the heart is like a temple one cannot see (On me)
Waiting for a moment that you think won't come (Put) 
Belief is navigation but you must go on (Your hand)
The heart is like a temple one cannot see (On me)

From the desert to the ocean we'll be following the sun 
The journey now, it has just begun
