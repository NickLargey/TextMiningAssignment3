Sometimes I imagine a world without you
But most times I'm just so happy that I ever found you
It's a complicated web
That you weave inside my head
So much pleasure with such pain
I hope we always always stay the same

I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs, I'm digging the lows
'Cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days
But my, life is good
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you

You go and then I can finally breathe in
'Cause, baby, I know in the end you'll never leave it
Well, we're rarely ever sane
I drive you crazy and you do the same
But your fire fills my soul
And it warms me up like no one knows

I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs, I'm digging the lows
'Cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days
But my, life is good
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you

I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs, I'm digging the lows
'Cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days

I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs, I'm digging the lows
'Cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days
But my, life is good
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you

I'm feeling the way that you cross my mind
And the way that you save me in the knick of time
Oh, I'm feeling the way when you walk on back
I feel light, I feel love, I feel butterflies
