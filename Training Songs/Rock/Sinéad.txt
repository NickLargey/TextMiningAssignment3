I've gotta try it's not over yet
No signals of life have you left
My heart is bleeding just for you
Bleeds for only you
And it hurts to know the truth

Are you looking for savior?
Chasing a dream
But love turned to hate
Now I'm crossing the border
Sealing our fate
But I'm not afraid

Oh Sinéad, for the first time
Life is gonna turn around
I'm telling you, you will like it, I know
(I know, I know, I know, I know, I know)
Oh Sinéad, it's the first time
Only you can set it free
Oh Sinéad, come break away with me

This second chance I know won't last
But it's okay, got no regrets
And I, I feel the end near, I'm no fool
Getting closer
But I'm doing what I should

I've been drowning in sorrow
Chasing tomorrow, running away
Now you're crossing the borders
Sealing tomorrow, but you're not afraid

Oh Sinéad, for the first time
Life is gonna turn around
I'm telling you, you will like it, I know
(I know, I know, I know, I know, I know)
Oh Sinéad, it's the first time
Only you can set it free
Oh Sinéad, come break away with me

I've been drowning in sorrow
Chasing tomorrow, running away
Now you're crossing the borders
Sealing tomorrow, but you're not afraid

Oh Sinéad
For the first time
Life is gonna turn around
I'm telling you, you will like it

Oh Sinéad
For the first time
Life is gonna turn around
I'm telling you, you will like it, I know, woah
(I know, I know, I know, I know, I know)

Oh Sinéad
It's the first time
Only you can set it free
Oh Sinéad
Come break away with me
