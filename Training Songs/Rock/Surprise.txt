I woke up in a daydream
A dream is all it was
I'm still lying in my bed
I'm tired of TV dinners

And this ticking in my head
I heard that you quit smoking
I heard you cut your hair
Heard you got naked in a car

Did I forget to mention what a f*ck you are
Let's play, meltdown
Do I smell plastic burning?
I guess by now

You want me crucified
I'm just a jealous guy
Judging by your eyes
You got my surprise

I took out the garbage
You left me the bill
You act like everything is fine
So unwrap the package and take a look inside

Let's play, meltdown
Do I smell plastic burning?
I guess by now
You want me crucified

I'm just a jealous guy
Judging by your eyes
You got my surprise
Writing letters, making plans

I'm gonna make you understand
I'm sending out a souvenir
Set the timer, strike the fuse
You'll see my exploding view

No one's home here anymore
I'll kill the lights and bolt the door on you
I guess you realize
I'm not the kind of guy

You can push aside
Judging by your eyes
You got my surprise
You got my surprise
