These four walls have a got a story to tell
The door is off the hinges, there's no wish in the well
Outside the sky is coal black and the streets are on fire
The picture windows cracked and there's no where to run
I know, I know
This house is not for sale

I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home
I'm coming home

Drove a spike into the ground and I staked my claim
Standing on the dirt where they'll dig my grave
Now what built these walls is in my veins
No time for looking back, the wolf is at the door
This heart, this soul
This house is not for sale

I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home
I'm coming home

This house was built on trust
That's what it is and always was
No wrecking ball could knock it down
This house was built on higher ground

I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home
I'm coming home
Coming home
I'm coming home (this house is not for sale)
Coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home (this house is not for sale)
