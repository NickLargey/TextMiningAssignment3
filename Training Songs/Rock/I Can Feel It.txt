I've got your number
I don't know how long I can wait
To call you over
So we can waste the night away
When the lights go out
We're getting up
We go where we go
We do what we want
Do what we want
We'll be the colour in all this black and white
 
Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
'Cause it's really feeling right
Don't wake me if I'm dreaming
I could stay here all night
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming true
I can feel it, I can feel it
When I'm looking at you

Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
'Cause I'm really feeling fine
Kicking bottles under bleachers
And we're hiding from the light
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming true
I can feel it, I can feel it
When I'm looking at you
 
My head is spinning
I don't know how much I can take
No fortune teller
I guess we'll leave this up to fate
When the lights go out
We're getting up
We go where we go
We do what we want
Do what we want
Say you'll remember singing "Forever Young"
 
Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
'Cause it's really feeling right
Don't wake me if I'm dreaming
I could stay here all night
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming true
I can feel it, I can feel it
When I'm looking at you

Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
'Cause I'm really feeling fine
Kicking bottles under bleachers
And we're hiding from the light
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming true
I can feel it, I can feel it
When I'm looking at you
