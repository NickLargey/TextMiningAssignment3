Say a prayer for me
In my memory
Have a taste, another one is through
Damn this place in me
Damn this destiny
I will be the one who cries when you go

Hello misery
You're the best of me
Hey, someone got the best of you
Come and sleep with me
For infinity
We'll spend some time and find the rest of you

Break down, break down
Reeling in your head
Rain down, rain down
Innocence is dead

Goodbye lament, goodbye lament
Goodbye faith, I swear I won't believe

Pray for me
Fading memories
Give me time and I will fade into you
Come and dance with me
I will always be sleeping behind the eyes
That I'm bleeding through

Break down, break down
Reeling in your head
Way down, way down
Innocence is dead

Goodbye lament, goodbye lament
Goodbye faith, I swear I won't believe
Goodbye lament, goodbye lament
Goodbye faith, I swear I won't believe

Break down, break down
Reeling in your head
Way down, way down
Innocence is dead

Break down, break down
Reeling in your head
Way down, way down
Innocence is dead

Goodbye lament, goodbye lament
Goodbye faith, I swear I won't believe
