When two and two are five
You're gonna go to work like any other day
But things might be much different
Your God might be a vengeful one
Your desk might catch on fire
The church will hold a picnic,
and Jesus and Elvis will get in free
When two and two are five
They'll change the world, make the faithful pay
The trees of the field and maybe the lilies -
They will comfort you
But in the twinkling of an eye there will be nothing,
Two shakes of somebody's tail - no still small voice
Meanwhile I'm gonna sleep all day,
get half drunk each night
I'll be the nothing that is, I'll be the nothing that will be
I'm gonna sleep all day, get half drunk each night
I'll be the nothing that is, I'll be the nothing that will be
And in the darkest corners between conscience and faith
(Lord get my room ready, nothing is adding up)
We'll meet the terrible angel
Straddling our pitiful fathers
Meanwhile I'm gonna sleep all day,
get half drunk each night
I'll be the nothing that is, I'll be the nothing that will be
I'm gonna sleep all day, get half drunk each night
I'll be the nothing that is, I'll be the nothing that will be
(All day, each night)
