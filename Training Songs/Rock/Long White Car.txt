White wheels in the city tonight
There is dust in their hearts
They turn they burn and bring me down
There is dust in their hearts

Cool blue notes echo this land loud
The jewels in my heart
Strike a chord and break my spine
There is dust in their hearts

I saw your face
In a long white car
Move away from here
Get away from here

Gates of the wild kingdom
Open up to me
I stood around in a cloud of doubt
Is this where I should be

White wheels in the city tonight
There is dust in their hearts
They turn they burn and bring me down
There is dust in their hearts

I saw your face
In a long white car
Move away from here
Get away from here

How much longer can I live this way
I've been in the storm so long
Long white car silken gray
Take me back to where I belong

I saw your face
In a long white car
Move away from here
Get away from here
