It was way after midnight, all the village was asleep,
All except for one young villain through the night did creep,
He went down to the church, started ringing the bell,
Everybody came out looking, running like the hounds of hell;

"There are lights in the castle, they are blazing all night long,
Let me tell you everybody there is something going on,"
So they took to the torches and went over the wall,
Someone went ahead to tell of horrors hiding in the hall;

"What did you see?"  "I saw an apparition,"
"What did you see?"  "A monster on a bed,"
"What did you see?"  "I saw an old magician,
Waking up the living from the dead!"

Keep away, keep away, they are making the perfect man,
Keep away, keep away, they are making the perfect,
Making the perfect man!

So they called for the doctor, the doctor said, "it's strange,
He's got pistols on his finger, he's got love on the brain,
He's got a tongue good for lying and the legs to run away,
He will fool all the people all the time some day!"

"What will he be?"  "A leader of the country,"
"What will he be?"  "A member of the press,"
"What will he be?"  "A banker selling moonbeams,
You can watch your money going west!"

Keep away, keep away, they are making the perfect man,
Keep away, keep away, they are making the perfect,
Making the perfect man!

"I'd like to spend a night with you,
and show you what I am"

"What will he be?"  "Could make a politician,"
"What will he be?"  "A member of the press,"
"What will he be?"  "A banker selling moonbeams,
You can watch your money, you can watch your money,
You can watch your money going west!"

Keep away, keep away, they are making the perfect man,
Keep away, keep away, they are making the perfect,
Making the perfect man!

Perfect man, perfect man,
Making the perfect man, making the perfect man!
I'd like to spend a night with you
Making the perfect man, making the perfect man!
