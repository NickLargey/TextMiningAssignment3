My life was black and white until you came around
So baby come around, keep on comin' around
I didn't know wrong from right, til' you came around
So baby come around, please keep comin' around

There is nothing like the light of you
You amaze me with the things you do
I'll do anything you want me to
Don't ever leave me alone

Baby you can use me any way that you enjoy
You know how to groove m
I'm dancing like a little boy
You do something to me
I just want to lay you down
Any time of place so come around

My life was full of doubt til' you came around
So baby come around, keep on comin' around
I'd never been so turned out until you came around
So baby come around, please keep coming around

There is nothing like the light of you
You amaze me with the things you do
I'll do anything you want me to
Don't ever leave me alone

Baby you can use me any way that you enjoy
You know how to groove m
I'm dancing like a little boy
You do something to me
I just want to lay you down
Any time of place so come around
