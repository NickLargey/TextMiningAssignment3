My perception my infection
Self destruct so addictive
Lazy bloody eyes
Here's a taste of death here's your taste of death
And I wish that I could feel the things you feel
I don't feel content
And through my eyes I see all your disgust
And I wish that I could see the things you see
Stomach still uneasy
You don't understand
Can't escape the hate
And from it I'll run
Put you in the river
And from you I'll hide
Standing in the rain
And I'll cut myself in a muddy cove
So when I die
There will be no
You've made me change so
I'll pull the fuckin' trigger watch your head combust
Processed information makes the world go round
Pull the fuckin trigger watch your head combust
You alienated me and made me the stranger
By pointing your fingers
This disease will spread and infect
So instill the values you protect
I see all your disgust
And through my eyes
Yellow running red becoming
Don't you take my actions
Just waiting for the pain
Turn them against me
I feel myself breakI feel myself breaking
