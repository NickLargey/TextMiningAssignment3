I live on the west side, she lives on the east side of the street
And though they say that east is east and west is west
And never the twain shall meet

[ Chorus: ]

Each morning I face her window and pray that our love can be
Because that brownstone house where my baby lives 
Is Mecca(x7) to me

Oh she's my dream goddess and her ruby lips are so divine
And though her folks say we're too young to know of love
I worship at her shrine

[ Chorus x2 ]
Each morning I face her window and pray that our love can be
Because that brownstone house where my baby lives 
Is Mecca(x7) to me
