Cheers, darlin'
Here's to you and your lover boy
Cheers, darlin'
I got years to wait around for you

Cheers, darlin'
I got your wedding bells in my ear
Cheers, darlin'
You gave me three cigarettes
To smoke my tears away

And I die
When you mention his name
And I lied
I should've kissed you
When we were running the reins

What am I, darling?
A whisper in your ear
A piece of your cake

What am I, darling?
The boy you can fear
Your biggest mistake

Cheers, darlin'
Here's to you and your lover man
Cheers, darlin'
I'll just hang around and eat from a can

Cheers, darlin'
I got a ribbon of green around my guitar
Cheers, darlin'
I got a beauty queen to sit not very far from me

I die
When he goes around to take you home
I'm too shy
I should've kissed you
When we were alone

What am I, darling?
A whisper in your ear
A piece of your cake

What am I, darling?
The boy can fear
Your biggest mistake
