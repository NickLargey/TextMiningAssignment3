When I'm lost in a strange place
Scared and alone
When I'm wishing for home
That's when I think of you
When the load gets too heavy
Too much to bear
When I'm going nowhere and there's no-one there
And I'm feeling like a fool

That's when I think of you
It's all that I can do
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you

When I'm caught in the crossfire
Of wrongs making right
When I wake in the night
That's when I think of you
When I'm halfway to heaven
And three parts in hell
When it's all just as well and I can't even tell
I'm lost without a clue

That's when I think of you
It's all that I can do
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you
If not for the thought of you
The promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you

When I'm lonely for loving
So far from home
When it feels like I'm in the Twilight Zone
And I just can't make it through

That's when I think of you
It's all that I can do
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you
If not for the thought of you
The promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you

Oh I'm always thinking of you
It's all that I can do
I'm going mad not being with you
If not for the thought of you
The promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad not being with you
