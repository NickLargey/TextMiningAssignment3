I walked with you
And talked with you
And held your loving hands

We loved awhile
I lived awhile
And thought that fate 
Had it planned

Then someone stole my angel
And I lost what I loved most
I may never get to Heaven
But I once came very close

I may never play a golden harp
Or spread some angel wings
Or walk a golden staircase
While the distant chorus sings

But once I held your sweet love
And felt your tender touch
I may never get to Heaven
But I didn't miss it much

I may never get to Heaven
But I didn't miss it much
I may never get to Heaven
