[reversable words]...Needless to say that the party broke up...

Jason came in from Peoria wearing silk sunglasses
His girlfriend Gloria wore metal shoes
That emitted poison gases from the heels
One drink of that stuff and -Zam!- 
The walls became floors, became ceilings became doors
The singer just kept singing "Feelings", that's right when I snapped
Needless to say that the party broke up

That--That flashing tie was a riot!
And what was that other remark that you made?
Oh yes, you're unemployed. Me too. I know what you mean
Someone began to discuss paranoia
When lightning destroyed half the room with one blast
The last of us killed off the wine and went home
Needless to say that the party broke up
