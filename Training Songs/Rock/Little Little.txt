Pulsing away, just like thunder in your little ear
Be brave, it won't be long till you meet us

My blood is your blood
I'll feel you till the day I die
Dear little little, sweet little little

I love every little thing about you
Even though I can't see your shining eyes
I can tell I'm gonna love you
By the way I love you now

And it's your little little kick down below
Makes me feel the strength of a hundred forces
I never felt the power of a love like this before

Noises from outside, you hardly hea-ear at all
Your lifeli-i-ine pulses with anticipa-why-a-why-a-yation

No dark and dim thoughts
Confound your little hea-ea-ead
Floati-i-ing in paradise
Remember little little little

I love every little think about you
Even though I can't see your shining eyes
I can tell I'm gonna love you
By the way I love you now

See what you can do
And you haven't even showed your face to the world ye-et
You've got power we've forgotten
Everybody's born with, but they lose it

I love every little thing about you
Even though I can't see your shining eyes
I can tell I'm gonna love you
By the way I love you now

And it's your little little kick down below
Makes me feel the strength of a hundred forces
I never felt the power of a love like this before

And I love you little little
I-I love you little little little
