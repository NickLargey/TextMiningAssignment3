Sail lightly on winds
Disappear on the breeze
Lie firmly on pins
Pull them out with ease

Solid boned skeleton key
Opens the most intricate locks
Brother roll another for me
I am shipwrecked on the rocks

Fumble blindly as we speak
You will wither if you are weak
Finger turns and points at me
I'd hoped they wouldn't notice me

Solid boned skeleton key
Opens the most intricate locks
Brother roll another for me
I am shipwrecked on the rocks

Will I ever return?
Will I ever get back?
Are the rocks too high?
Has the dust turned black?

Will I ever return?
Will I ever get back?
Are the rocks too high?
Has the dust turned black?

Skeleton Key (x4)

Will I ever return?
Will I ever get back?
Are the rocks too high?
Has the dust turned black?

Solid boned skeleton key
Opens the most intricate locks
Brother roll another for me
I am shipwrecked on the rocks

Oh yeah
Hey 
That's more like
Here we go here we go 
Here we go go Byker Grove
Can't believe it's so good
Can't believe it's so good
