I didn't know what to say
When you happened to look my way
Far from an answer, the question stands alone
The more that you're after, the more you'll never know

Mystery is the only attraction
Have you heard the sounds and the reactions
Take me on with perfect harmony
Near or far you're moving closer I see

Follow me I'll show you the way
'Cause you'll never find a reason to stay
So just try me if you're willing to play the game

Dreams apart, the moment starts an endless gaze
And you left in a haze
Reach out, you'll find it's meant to be
On and on, you're turning, soon you'll be free

Follow me I'll show you the way
'Cause you'll never find a reason to stay
So just try me if you're willing to play the game

Look and turn away before the truth is known
Dreams will start to fade and then the lights go on

La la la la la (Look and turn away)
La la la la la (Dreams will start to fade)
La la la la la (Look and turn away)
Move in closer to me 

Follow me I'll show you the way
'Cause you'll never find a reason to stay
So just try me if you're willing to play the game
