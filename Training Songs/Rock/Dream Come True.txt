Love of my life, I don't have a lot to give you.
What's in my heart is all that I can really give you.
Love, undying love is all I have.
A handful of words that might make you laugh.
And all the strength you could need,
To make it through all your troubled times. 
I give my love, myself to you, only you,
My dream come true.

Love of my life, you are all I ever wanted.
To be with you is all I ever really wanted.
You, you make my life a fairytale.
You've added love to a life that was so stale.
You know that I'll be here, always for you
When you need a friend
I give my love, myself to you, only you,
My dream come true.

I've been waiting my whole life for you,
Now my waiting is through.
All those nights I spent dreaming I knew,
That my dream would come true.
Dream come true
Dream come true
