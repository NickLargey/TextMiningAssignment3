Now, there's a jumpin' little place I go
Called The Action
It's just about a mile or so
Down the street
And there's a part goin' on in there
Down a lot of funky stairs
And everything will be rare
Till the break of dawn

Now, you don't want to walk on down
To The Action
'Cause once you get in there
You're gonna want to use your feet
And when the music starts a gettin' hot
There's gonna burn up everything you got
And you ain't gonna want to stop
Till the break of dawn

They're doin' the pony
Watch 'em do the jerk
Then they get down on the floor
And they go to work
Sister's doin' the alligator
Up on the table top
Lot of Farfisa racket
Don't never stop

We're goin' down to Santa Ana
Way down to Eagle Rock
Way out in Montebello
And down in Huntington Park
Out in El Sereno
Better show 'em what you got
Out on Whittier Boulevard
The action never stops

Down at The Action
Meet you down at The Action
Don't want to end up in traction
Meet you down at the action
