Uh-huh
Nothing to add, you follow
I'll tell you something, you don't know
Take a look at me now
Got plenty going on on my own
You have got to
Work it out
Uh-huh
Disillusion yourself
You're never quite as thrilling to someone else
What you've got on your mind
We're getting without it just fine
You have got to
Work it out
Uh-huh
Do I look like I've been taught
Turn you into something you're not

Up, down, side to side
Got better things to do with my time
You have got to
Work it out
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
You work it out
Don't come to me like you do
Going wrong, so what's new
Nothing to add, you follow
I'll tell you something, you don't know
You have got to
Work it out
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
You work it out
