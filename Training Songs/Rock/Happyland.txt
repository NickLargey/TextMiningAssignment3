Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
In the happyland
Oh oh oh 
In the happyland
Oh oh oh 
In the happyland

Poison my sight while you kiss me goodnight
In the happyland (in the happyland)
Go on and poison my sight while you kiss me goodnight
In the happyland (in the happyland)
Well your daddy left home
Mum is still on the phone
Lost belief in love's deceiving
Always going, went, gone
Poison my sight while you kiss me goodnight
In the happyland (in the happyland)

Close the door and leave your key
You think you've got me but you'll see
When you're starting to lose me
I'm already gone

Oh oh oh
In the happyland
Oh oh oh 
In the happyland

Night lingers on, we'll be safe until dawn
In the happyland (in the happyland)
As the night lingers on, we'll be safe until dawn
In the happyland (in the happyland)
'Cause your daddy left home
Mum is still on the phone
Lost belief in love's deceiving
Always going, went, gone
Night lingers on, we'll be safe until dawn
In the happyland (in the happyland)
 
Close the door and leave your key
You think you've got me but you'll see
When you're starting to lose me
I'm already gone

Oh oh oh
In the happyland
Oh oh oh 
In the happyland

Oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah oh 

They will hurt you 
And desert you
That's what they do
Run

Oh oh oh
In the happyland
Oh oh oh 
In the happyland

Oh oh oh
In the happyland
Oh oh oh 
In the happyland

Oh oh oh
In the happyland
Oh oh oh 
In the happyland
