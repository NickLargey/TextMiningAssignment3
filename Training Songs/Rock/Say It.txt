Say it three times don't tell a soul
Drink a whisper from a silver bowl
And you will get what you want

Say it three times give it power
Chant it clockwise for a single hour
And you will get what you want

Say it three times say it three times
Close your eyes and hold out your hand

Say it three times use special words
Under moonlight you will be heard
And you will get what you want

Say it three times say it three times
Close your eyes and hold out your hand
