everybody wants to be the dj
everybody thinks it's oh so easy
you think you belong and you come on strong
but i can still tell the right from the wrong

i could never be that kind of girl
nobody takes the time to turn
you always act as if it's understood
but sweet revenge is finger-lickin' good

if only i could sell myself
the way that even i would buy
if only i could sell myself
the way that even i would buy
somethings got to give
somethings got to give
'cause i don't know
somethings got to give
somethings got to give
'cause i don't know

there's one thing how to understand me
loneliness tastes like cotton candy
you answer "i love you" with "i know"
never check the message on your answerphone

if only i could sell myself
the way that even i would buy
if only i could sell myself
the way that even i would buy
somethings got to give
somethings got to give
but i don't know
somethings got to give
somethings got to give
but i don't know
