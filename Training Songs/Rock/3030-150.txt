(I am a) dominant gene
Live as I die
Never say forever cuz forever's a lie
I can see right through you so I can ignore you
The story changes but the ending won't bore you
I tried to tell you but you simply obeyed
You didn't listen so they throw you away
Now all you do is talk
I don't wanna hear your bullshit is this what you want?

This is where it BEGINS
This is where it ENDS

They called us a Dead Generation
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see we're all clearly alive
We know where you are and we're coming
Let's see ya do that shit to our face

In-My-Own-Peculiar-Way-I-Feel-Mercurial
Before I get ahead of myself again
I know the where, but I still don't know the when
You wanna live in a one-sided world?
Be prepared for a whole world of hurt
Now it's the Grand Fa√ßade
I don't wanna be an angel
I just wanna be God!

They called us a Dead Generation

I am a Fuckin' machine- fueled by the past
A memory's a memory until it's a fact
I can bury the hatchet and let some shit go
But I got too many grudges to hold
I saw a lot of people die in the end
I never wanna walk that road again
Now I will never give up
I don't wanna have it all I just wanna have enough

This is where it BEGINS
This is where it ENDS
