I’m a pour it out a big block 4x4
I'm a billboard a buckshot that can't be ignored
I'm a drift store I was built to invade
I'm the realest motherfucker and I'm coming with age
I'm rib-cage
Broke down, battered, and bruised
I was space age
Cowboy shooting the moon
I'm a full blown
Down home rolling stone
I'm a cyclone
I'll shit wherever I roam

Welcome to the greatest
Love you when you hate us
Welcome to the greatest fuckin' show on earth
Welcome to the greatest
Love you when you hate us
Welcome to the greatest fuckin' show on earth

I'm a full blown
Freak show somethin’ to see
Got'em lined up and waiting taking bullets from me
I'm a Mack truck I'm trucking down a one-way street
You better move bitch
My f*ck tank's on E
Baby come and see me shine
I'm a mountain of fame, the last of my kind
Don't test me, oppress me
Arrest me or fine me
You best bring it on me if you're dying to try me
