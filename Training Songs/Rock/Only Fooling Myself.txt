I stop to catch my breath
And I stop to catch your eye
No need to second-guess
That you've been on my mind
I dream days away, but that's okay
It's like I want to hear a silent sound
And then hold it in my hand
But a rose won't blossom from a ground
Of desert sand, but I like to pretend that

One day I'll turn around
I'll see your hand reach out
I'm only fooling myself, oh,
But maybe when you smile
It means you'd stay awhile
Just maybe you'd save me now

Well, now it's etched in stone
That I can't survive alone
You have the missing piece
That I need so desperately
Yes, I slip away to a day that'll never come
It's like a splash of water to my face
When I suddenly realize
That you could never find a place
For me in your eyes, and I don't know why I keep thinking

One day I'll turn around
I'll see your hand reach out
I'm only fooling myself, oh,
But maybe when you smile
It means you'd stay awhile
Just maybe you'd save me now

It's love in disguise
I'm lost in your eyes
I'm lost in your eyes

One day I'll turn around
I'll see your hand reach out
I'm only fooling myself, oh,
But maybe when you smile
It means you'd stay awhile
Just maybe you'd save me now

Save me now
Just maybe you'd save me now
