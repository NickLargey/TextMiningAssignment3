There's a crow flyin' down from over the hill
Cracked paint on my window sill
Each morning broke provides a girl
Forget my evening feeling world
When day gets dark, it seeps into my skin
And I recall the spark that kept me sane

Can't talk to you, it's plain
Won't start to name my pain
Or forget I don't know why
You tugged the corner of my eye
Movin' up the neck of my guitar
I turn the lamp off, I see where you are

Your one light slowly fading in my mind
The furthest from my head
Half the time

Simple point too bright to leave the sky
You're dissolving in my eye, in my eye
My closed eye
Half the time

Mountain Dew and Marlboro while I stew over all I owe
My eyes set wet against the breeze
Guide the sun into the trees
Where squirrels are holding acorns in their teeth
I can't see into why I made you leave

Your one light slowly fading in my mind
The furthest from my head
Half the time
A simple point revolving in my sky
You're dissolving in my eye
