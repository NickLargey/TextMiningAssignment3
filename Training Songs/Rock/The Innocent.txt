The start of Armageddon
It was just another day
We all saw the news, nothing to say

So many friends are missing
And family members gone
So we all pray that God help them be strong

And now we stand together
Remembering that day
The lives we live will never be the same

[CHORUS]
And we don't know why
The innocent die
Will this world ever find a way to change?
And we don't know why
But we know it's not right
We don't know why so many had to die
We don't know why so many had to die

Hate has turned to others
For their religion or their skin
But hate can't solve the problem it began
Everyone is angry
People are afraid
And no one knows what decisions will be made

[CHORUS]

Bridge
And we don't know why (don't know why)
The innocent die (don't know why)
Will this world ever find a way to change?
And we don't know why (don't know why)
But we know it's not right (don't know why)
Will any of us ever be the same?
Will any of this ever be the same?

And we don't know why
The innocent die
Will any of us ever be the same?
Will any of this ever be the same?
