I saw your face
You had nothing to lose
You drew your gun
You fought into the air

I'm getting off
There's no reason to stay
You drew your sword
You had something to learn

But I'm gone
You're there to stay
Memory, leave me today
Sad eyes kill

I heard you speak
You had somewhere to go
I didn't know
I had so much to lose

I saw you leave
You had something to hide
You didn't see
I had nothing but time

But I won't be afraid
Memory, it don't help
Sad eyes kill
