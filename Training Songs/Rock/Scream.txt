I used to know I was always right
Too old to be cute, too small to mind
I sometimes say things really loud
I found out that volume can make up for content drought

Scream until you lose your breath
Force your way  inside some youthful soul tonight
Teach him only you are right

I used to know how to change the word
I lie awake at night and envy that girl
Sometimes i think it's not hard to tell
the good and bad apart
and that idea confirms my fear I'm not the brightest person here

Scream until you lose your breath
Force your way  inside some youthful soul tonight
Teach him only you are right

I changed my minds a million times
I know now for sure
that  that's alright

Scream until you lose your breath
Force your way  inside some youthful soul tonight
Teach him only you are right
