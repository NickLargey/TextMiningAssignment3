Think about my little girl
Her yellow skin and her dark curl
And how her father's heart was frozen
I spoke to her, and I said:
"You won't regret the mother you have chosen."
I lied
Where's she tonight?

I left him
Now we're apart
And I think about his cruel heart
And how his lies have left mine broken
To think that I spoke to him, then I said:
"She won't regret the father she has chosen."
I lied
Where's he tonight?

You were precious to me
After all I called you into being
I wanted you to know that
Yes, you were precious to me

And I miss my little boy
I strayed away
So far away
And I need him tonight
To feel his hands around my face
His loving eyes
His happy face
Would be so right

Once I sat in my husband's car
Him in my arms
Woke up and saw me crying
My heart wouldn't work
And this, he did my special child
He touched my face with his hand and smiled
Oh, boy, everything's alright
Don't cry, everything's alright
Don't cry, Jakes's here tonight
Don't hide, Jake's here alive
