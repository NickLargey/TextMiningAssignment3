Brakes on
Brakes on
The car is running empty
Brakes on, brakes on
The car is runnin' empty
Downhill
Head on
This crash is comin' slowly
Downhill
Head on 
This crash is comin' slowly
Move
Or watch the slow death of your way of life
 
There's a science to fear
It plagues my mind
And it keeps us right here
And it keeps us here
 
My ears 
My eyes
My brain is slowly bustin'
Black smoke
Red sky 
The television's sayin'
Downhill
Head on another crash is comin'
Downhill
Head on another crash is comin'
Move
Or watch the murder of your way of life
 
There's a science to fear
It plagues my mind
And it keeps us right here
And the less we know
The more we sit still
My baby's stuck on a road
That leads to nowhere
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
 
Brakes on
Brakes on
Brakes on
Brakes on
Brakes on
There's a science to fear
It plagues my mind
And it keeps us right here
And the less we know
The more we sit still, sit still
My baby's stuck on a road
That leads to nowhere
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
