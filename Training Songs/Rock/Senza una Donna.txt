I changed the world, I changed the world
I changed the world, I want to change the world

This ain't the way I spend my mornings, baby
Come and stay?
You've been with him and you've come back, lady
What's he like?
I just sit and watch the ocean
By myself even I do my own cookin'
You can laugh at, you're forgiven but
I'm no longer frightened to be livin'

Senza una donna
No more pain and no sorrow
Senza una donna
I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin me torture and bliss
Without a woman
Better than like this

There is no way that you can buy me, baby
Don't make fun
You got a dig, a little deeper, lady
Into your heart, yeah, if you have one
Here's my heart, feel the power
Look at me, I'm a flower
You can laugh at, you're forgiven but
I'm no longer frightened to be livin'

Senza una donna
No more pain and no sorrow
Senza una donna
I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and bliss

I stay here and watch the ocean
Don't know why, I keep on talkin'
You may laugh, you're forgiven but
I'm no longer frightened, maybe, to be livin'

Senza una donna
No more pain and no sorrow
Senza una donna
I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and bliss
Without a woman
Vieni qui! Come on in
Senza una donna
I don't know what might follow
Senza una donna
Oh, maybe from tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and bliss, please
