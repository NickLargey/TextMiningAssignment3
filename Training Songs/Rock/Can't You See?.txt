I'm gonna take a freight train, down at the station
I don't care where it goes
Gonna climb me a mountain, the highest mountain
Jump off, nobody gonna know

Can't you see oh can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman lord been doin' to me

I'm gonna find me a hole in the wall
I gonna crawl inside and die
'Cause my lady now, mean ol' woman lord, never told me goodbye

Can't you see oh can't you see
What that woman lord she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman lord been doin' to me

I gonna buy me a ticket now, as far as I can
Ain't a-never comin' back
Ride me a Southbound
All the way to Georgia now
Till the train run out of track

Can't you see oh can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me, oh lord

Can't you see oh can't you see
What that woman lord she been doin' to me
Can't you see oh can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me

Can't you see (oh she's such a crazy lady) can't you see
What that woman (what a woman) she been doin' to me
Can't you see (lord I can't stand) oh can't you see
What that woman, oh she been doin' to me

Can't you see (I'm gonna take a freight train) can't you see
