In the silent parlor room
If I'd remember to
Keep it down for ya, like you asked me to
Did that hurt too much

Baby did it last long enough
It was fine for me
It was fine for me
I'll go dry off now

This stuff is sticky
It's a little hot in here dear
Can you turn up the air
And don't tell me that you want me to see you this way

If I were weaker
And you loved me
Would you still act this way
I'm sitting on the floor

And I don't feel no more
I'm not prepared to
And I don't dare to
It's so dark in here

And something smells like fear
Now you're sleeping
While I'm conceiving
I'll find my own way out

You'll find the letter
I'm a little weak but
You like that better
I don't think that you want to

See me this way
'Cause I'd kill you
And I'd leave you
And never speak your name

And don't tell me that you want me to see you this way
If I were weaker
And you loved me
Would you still act this way

The roads are wet
And I can't remember your face
As I'm driving away in this, in this taxi cab
And the driver said

Are you sure you want to leave him
Don't I need to get these scars off my face
And I'm bleeding, not just in front of you
But in every single place

Don't you think that I want to see him in a different way
If he were weaker
And I still loved him
Maybe it wouldn't be this way
