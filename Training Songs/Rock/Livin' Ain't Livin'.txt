All the empty words I've spoken
All the promises I've broken
All the lovers and the loves I've pushed away
Now they all come back to haunt me
And the silence seems to taunt me
'Cause they turn the tables round the other way

Livin' is easy with someone who cares
Someone to call you their own
Livin' is lovely with somebody there
Livin' ain't livin' alone
Ain't livin' alone

Did I turn my back so coldly
On the ones who tried to hold me
Saying only that I needed to be free
Now I know some dreams were shattered
Because I never thought it mattered
No I never thought of anything but me

Livin' is easy with someone to care
Someone to call you their own
Livin' is lovely with somebody there
Livin' ain't livin' alone
Ain't livin' alone

Have I taken all my chances
Will there be no more romances
Did I make my choice and never even know
But I'm much too young for endings
And so I have to keep pretending
That tomorrow is the day my love will show

Livin' is easy with someone to care
Someone to call you their own
Livin' is lovely with somebody there
Livin' ain't livin' alone
Ain't livin' alone

Livin' ain't livin'
No it ain't livin' alone
