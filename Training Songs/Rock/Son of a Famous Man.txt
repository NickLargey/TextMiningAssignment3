You were born on an eerie night
Moon rode high on a silver cloud
An air of tension in a room of wonder
She held you gently but you cried out loud

Your old man called from across the sea
The search or fame had taken him away
Out in the heat were a thousand voices
Singing his praise and making him great

You were born to be the lonely one
He was reaching out for number one

He's so busy with all his plans, got no time for his greatest fan, his son
Son of a famous man keeps on giving you alibis
You keep wearing the same disguise, the son, son of a famous man

You were torn from your sleep one night
The winds of change made you come of age
Down in the street was a sea of silence
They couldn't heal you but they shared your pain

You were left to be the lonely one
Now you know you're not the only one

He's so busy with all his plans, got no time for his greatest fan
His son, son of a famous man, keeps on giving you alibis
You keep wearing the same disguise, the son, son of a famous man

Time and again, you look to his eyes for a sign
But love is the one thing that money can't buy
You were born to be the lonely one
Now you know your time has finally come

He's so busy with all his plans, got no time for his greatest fan
His son, son of a famous man, keeps on giving you alibis
You keep wearing the same disguise, the son, son of a famous man
