Too late tomorrow
'Cause everyone needs the love of the common man
Turn the world around
Too late tomorrow
'Cause everyone
Everyone is waiting, just anticipating on you
Won't you make a showing everybody knows what to do
Take a dive from your ivory tower
And fall on everyone will catch you, everyone
I would be so pleased to spend some time
To hear a little talk about what's been on your mind
'Cause it don't take long
To turn my head around
If it comes easy
'Cause everyone needs the love of the common man
Turn the world around
Too late tomorrow
'Cause everyone
