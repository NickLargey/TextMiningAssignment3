I do my best to keep a space for you.
But the bed and the body and the brain they still lay bare.
And I can pretend like this is just a test for you,
But I can't tell who's really there.
I only ever see.

So take the best and make it good for you.
To forget and to beg and to bury is only fair.
Oh, nothing ever matters till you turn it around,
And, nothing's ever real until you left it behind,
But sure, what did I do?
Sure, what did I do?

Everybody's leaving.
Everybody leaves.
Everybody's leaving.
Everybody leaves.
