Sun is settin' on a hard day's work
Sure feels good to get 'er all done
Washed off the sweat, the hay and the dirt
Now it's time to have some fun
Go meet Amy at the Dixie Dog
Get a #3 and a coke float
Mack the drag, then later on
We'll head down to the cove

Back up the pickup, right up to the lake
Throw a blanket on the tailgate
Listen to the bullfrog serenade in the moonlight
In the truck bed dancin' slow
We'll sing along with the radio
Sippin' on grandma's homemade wine
Livin' the good life

There's a cottonwood tree with a limb hangin' over
We can do a cannonball off a rope swing
She can dry her clothes out by the fire
And I swear I won't peek
I'll be wishin' the night would last forever
As I'm lookin' into her doe eyes
Ride back home with her head on my shoulder
Can't wait 'till next time

We back up the pickup, right up to the lake
Throw a blanket on the tailgate
Listen to the bullfrog serenade in the moonlight
In the truck bed dancin' slow
We'll sing along with the radio
Sippin' on grandma's homemade wine
Livin' the good life

Back up the pickup, right up to the lake
Throw a blanket on the tailgate
Listen to the bullfrog serenade in the moonlight
In the truck bed dancin' slow
We'll sing along with the radio
Sippin' on grandma's homemade wine
Livin' the good life
Yeah, this is the good life
That's right
