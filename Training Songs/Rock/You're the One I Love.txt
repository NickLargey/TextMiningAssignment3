Tenderly, tenderly 
Come to me tenderly 
You're the one I love, you're the one I love 

Hold it dear, hold it tight 
When you're near it's alright 
You're the one I love, you're the one I love 
You're the one I love
Baby don't be afraid to love me, love me 
Baby don't be afraid to love me, 
Love me to you 

Come to me, come to me 
Tenderly, come to me 
You're the one I love, you're the one I love x 7 
You're the one I love

You love me 
When it pleases you 
You want me 
When it's easy to do 
You hold me 
When you don't want anybody else to 
You want me when it please you 

I've been keeping it convenient 
For you I keep close to me 
I've been make it too easy for you hang on
I've been holding on and dreaming on
But you only come round to me 
But it pleases you 
Well it pleases you 

I call you 
When I want to hear 
My voice whisper 
And your voice mells
I think of you 
At the strangest times
You got me in the back of your mind 

I've been keeping it convenient 
For you I keep close to me 
I've been make it too easy for you to hang on
I've been holding on and dreaming on
But you only come round to me 
But it pleases you 
But it pleases you 

Late at night 
When the stars come out 
I walk those eyes and turning round 
And it wasn't long enough 
When I see one fall 
Looking for you can't see it all 
Uh uh uh uh uh 

I've been keeping it convenient 
For you I keep close to me 
I've been make it too easy for you to hang on
I've been holding on and dreaming on
But you only come round to me 
But it pleases you 
But it pleases you 
But it pleases you
But it pleases you
