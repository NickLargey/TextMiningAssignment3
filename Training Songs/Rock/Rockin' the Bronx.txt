I got a job in a band called Black 47 
I was doin' nothin' special after 11 
Oh we learned some tunes and wrote some songs 
And we bought ourselves a drum machine to keep the beat strong 

Well we bought the Irish People, the Echo and the Voice 
And we rang a few bars, said "we got a new noise 
Hey, it would please us greatly to come on uptown 
And show you Paddys how we get on down" 

One o'clock, two o'clock, give us a chance 
All we wanta do is be rockin' the Bronx 
3 o'clock, 4 o'clock what does she want 
The girl in black leather wants to 

Rocka the - rocka the - rocka the - rocka the Bronx 
Oh we got a gig in the Village Pub 
But the regulars there all said that we sucked 
Then Big John Flynn, said "oh, no no 

You'll be causin' a riot if I don't let you go" 
Then a flintstone from the Phoenix gave us a call 
When he heard the beat, he was quite appalled 
"D'yez not know nothin' by Christy Moore?" 

The next thing you be wantin' is Danny Boy! Chris is chillin' on the uilleann but he isn't alone 
Here comes Freddy on the slide trombone 
Add a little guitar, Geoff Blythe on the sax 
Gonna shoot you full of our New York fix 

Then we went into the studio and made a tape 
Frank Murray from the Pogues said "I think that it's great 
Galigula said "it could be a hit" 
And if it falls on its face, who gives a shit!" 

Now everywhere we go we cause a fuss 
'Cause we play what we like and our sound is us 
It's got a whole lot of hell and a little bit of heaven 
That's the story so far of Black 47
