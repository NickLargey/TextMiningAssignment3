Help Is On Its Way
by The Little River Band
Why're you in so much hurry?
Is it really worth the worry?

Look around.
Then slow down.
What's it like inside the bubble?
Does your head ever give you trouble?
It's no sin.
Trade it in.

[Chorus]

Hang on.
Help is on its way.
I'll be there as fast as I can.
Hang on,

A tiny voice did say,
From somewhere deep inside the inner man.
Are you always in confusion?
Surrounded by illusion?

Sort it out.
You'll make out.
Seem to make a good beginning
Someone else ends up winning.

Don't seem fair.
Don't you care?

[Chorus]

Don't you forget who'll take care of you.
It don't matter what you do.
Form a duet let him sing melody.
You'll provide the harmony.

Why're you in so much hurry?
Is it really worth the worry?
Look around.
Then slow down.

What's it like inside the bubble?
Does your head ever give you trouble?
It's no sin.
Trade it in.

[Chorus: x 2]

Help is on its way!
Help is on its way!
