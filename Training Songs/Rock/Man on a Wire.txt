Who would have thought that I'd be here by myself?
Who would have thought that you'd be bad for my health?
Now I know, now I know
I'm just a man on a wire, oh
Who would have thought about the cause and effect?
Yesterday's love is not tomorrow's regrets
Now I know, now I know
I'm just a man on a wire, oh

No, I can't look down
I'm trying to fight the feeling
I will fall to the ground
If I ever see you
'Cause I feel like I'm walkin' a tightrope

My heart is in my throat
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you
And I've got my eyes closed
As long as the wind blows
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you, you
'Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire

Who would have thought I'd see you with someone else?
Who would have thought that I'd be in such a mess?
Now you know, now you know
I'm just a man on a wire, oh

But I walk that line
I try to keep my senses
Make it to the other side
I know the consequences and
I feel like I'm walkin' on a tight road

My heart is in my throat
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you
And I've got my eyes closed
As long as the wind blows
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you, you
'Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire
'Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire
'Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire

The higher I get
The more I miss the ground
No safety nets
Now you're not around
I have to keep walking
To keep me from falling down, yeah

Feels like I'm walkin' on a tightrope
My heart is in my throat
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you
And I've got my eyes closed
As long as the wind blows
I'm counting on high hopes to get me over you, you
'Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire
'Cause I'm a man on a wire, on a wire
I'm a man on a wire, on a wire, yeah
