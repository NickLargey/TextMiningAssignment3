Oh, you humor me today 
Calling me out to play 
With your telescope eyes, metal teeth 
I can't be seen with you, you freak

Go cry, go run away 
Let your short legs carry you away 
With your big dress and your dirty hair 
Your pen's waiting for you 
Just get far, far away from me 
I don't want your disease 

[Chorus]
Please don't make me cry 
Please don't make me cry 
I'm just like you 
I know you know 
I'm just like you 
So leave me alone 

Dear Matthew why can't you see 
You're just not near enough like me 
With your telescope eyes, metal teeth 
I can't be seen with you 

[Chorus: x4] 

Oh, you humor me today
