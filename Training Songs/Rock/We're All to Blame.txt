Take everything left from me
All! to! blame!

How can we still succeed taking what we don't need?
Telling lies, alibis, selling all the hate that we breed, 
Super-size our tragedies (you can't define me, or justify greed),
Bought in the land of the free, (land, free)

And we're all to blame,
We've gone to far, from pride to shame,
We're trying so hard, 
We're dying in vain,
We're hopelessly blissful and blind,
To all we are,
We want it all,
With no sacrifice!

Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear,
Stand to salute say thanks to the man of the year,
How did we all come to this (you can't define me, or justify greed),
A greed that we just can't resist (resist)

And we're all to blame,
We've gone to far,
From pride to shame,
We're trying so hard,
We're dying in vain,
We're hopelessly blissful and blind,
To all we are,
We want it all,
With no sacrifice!

Tell me now,
What have we done,
We don't know,
I can't allow,
What has begun to tear me down believe me now,
We have no choice left with our backs against the wall! 

And now,
We're all to blame,
We've gone to far,
From pride to shame,
We're hopelessly blissful and blind,
When all we need,
Is something true to believe,
Don't we all,
Everyone,
Everyone,
We will fall,

Cause we're all to blame,
We've gone to far,
From pride to shame,
We're trying so hard,
We're dying in vain,
We want it all,
Everyone, 
Don't we all
