We tried to get along we tried to just get through
but something here is wrong
don't tell me this is true
there's no reason why I never saw the sign
you didn't say good-bye
I hoped that you were mine

I waited up all night long

The night went on and on
the moon was rising slow
somewhere in the dawn
the hardest feelings grow

The power of that pretty face
my heart could end for you
leaving such an empty space
don't tell me this is true

I waited up all night long
