Locking eyes the waning glance, mistook chance
Inviting meaning to the words forever
Broken silence, defiance, misspoke turn
Will I see you again if ever?

Come on and leave me here
I'm a vagabond though, wandering the night alone
Right now you're over there
In the social club state, pondering the wine
While we elope

A little bit closer to finding the real you
A little bit closer to finding the truth
Stranger things have happened
Stronger men have answered

A little bit closer to loving you

Yet defying I'm lying
If I didn't tell you
You keep me up late at night
Is it all I ever call your lover
Even though we don't know each other
And probably never will

Would you stay with me
Here in my dreams?
If I promised you this heaven
Would you take a chance
On a make believe dance?
Close my eyes and we're together

A little bit closer to finding the real you
A little bit closer to finding the truth
Stranger things have happened
Stronger men have answered

A little bit closer to finding the real you
A little bit closer to finding the truth
Stranger things have happened
Stronger men have answered

A little bit closer to loving you
A little bit closer to holding you
A little bit closer to knowing you
A little bit closer to touching you
