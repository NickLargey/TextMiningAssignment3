Put me into syndication,
Broadcast to a network station
Of people viewing their favorite episodes.
I can't find a new pitch to throw the studios.

I need a re-run to better cast
The next series of events in the air-timeline lapse.

My made-for-TV type was written off
In the last season when I wasn't focused on the cue.

I grew up with David Lee and Tiffany,
In love with Billy Jean
And I was terrified of Freddy.

I grew up, no DVD's, or mp3's, or plasma screen TV's
Because I'm a product of the 80's.

When Punky Brewster came around,
The afternoon stopped being down.
For Pacific/Eastern times
And the Bayside "Saved Byâ€¦" teens
Who were opening with lines a
Nd the songs that became our themes.
"Like a Prayer" and "Like a Virgin,"
A music to video version.
