A man with a tattoo
Made a rendez-vous
He met Lolita in a bar in Soho
The glitter on her lips
The way she moved her hips
Dancing to the beat of the stereo

She's so disco

He said :"You're gonna be my queen
Come on, shake my tambourine
You'Il be the superstar of my floor show"
They drank a lot and jived
Ran away from the lights
Rushing at the doors of the Glass Bowl

She's so disco
She's so disco
She's so disco
She's soooooo disco

He took her for a ride
Kiss me, hold me tight
Don't resist, pump up the volume of the radio
It was the dead of night
Not a single soul in sight
Lolita yields to the killer gigolo

She's so disco

A man with a tattoo
Made a rendez-vous
He met Lolita un a bar in Soho
The glitter on her lips
The way she moved her hips
Dancing to the beat of the stereo

She's so disco
She's so disco
She's so disco
She's soooooo disco
