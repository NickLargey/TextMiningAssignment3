There ain't no god that will save you from regret
It's just that god is in a state of neglect
And it's your goddamn act that is a major threat

Salvation won't be rearing it's head
for a fact at least not in my time
And what good is a song for peace
when the fucker doesn't even rhyme

I won't be calling
Calling as we level
And when were falling
I'm like this with the devil
When they're creeping upon you
Eating dust that you bleed
Don't say I didn't warn you
A toast to your death to myself cuz I'm free
Like this with the devil
