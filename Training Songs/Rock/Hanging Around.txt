Hanging around the streets of your town, 
I was waiting for you there. 
I'd run aground, was on the way out, 
Just kept thinking about your hair. 

Wait alone, head is gone, where you running to? 

Standing your ground, you made us so proud, 
No one noticed, no one cared. 
What you don't know now, 
Ain't worth knowing, ain't worth knowing. 
What you can't know now, 
Is how I feel to know that you're going, 
That you're going, going, 
Going, where you going? 

When I'm talking to you, it all becomes so clear, 
I meant every word I said. 
Hanging around the streets of your town, 
I keep waiting 'til you go. 

What you don't know now, 
Ain't worth knowing, ain't worth knowing. 
What you can't know now, 
Is how I feel to know that you're going, 
That you're going, that you're going, 
Going, where you going? 

I'm wasting life, I'm sure of that. 
The glimpse that I see just fell black, 
Your tears make pretty streams and there 
Is a man over there, says he wants you, 
But this boy needs you now.
