If I could learn to love you
Could you learn to love me?
Lust will only get us so far now

If I could learn to love you
Could you learn to love me?
Lust will only get us so far now, alright

Lust, Top 40 fame
I can smell your Catholic shame
It goes on and on and on and on and on
Oh my darlin'
It goes on and on and on and on and on
Oh my darlin'

The fashion police chasing
The Irish keep gate-crashing
Lust will only get us so far now

If I could learn to love you
Would you learn to love me?
Lust will only get us so far now, alright

I finally shed my puppy fat
No kids, there's no encore tonight
It goes on and on and on and on and on
Oh my darlin'
It goes on and on and on and on and on
Oh my darlin'

It goes on and on and on and on and on
It goes on and on and on and on and on
Oh my darlin'
It goes on and on and on and on and on
Oh my darlin'
