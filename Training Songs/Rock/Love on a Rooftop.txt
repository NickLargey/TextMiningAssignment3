We used to talk never owed a dime
Now we live together never find the time 
We used to walk as lovers on the sand 
Now we're working full time on our lifetime plan 
We never stop to see the moon at night 
We're just to busy leading complicated lives. 

Wo wo, wo wo wo 
I remember 
Love on a rooftop 
We couldn't make the love stop 
We were giving all that we got 
Wo wo, wo wo wo 
I remember holding you so tight 
Our kisses lasted all night 
Wo wo, wo wo 
Love on a rooftop 
Wo wo, wo wo wo 

Look at us now all growed up 
We've got it all together got it all sewn up 
But is this all it was leading too? 
Do we just run out of dreams when all our dreams come true? 
Whatever happened to those endless nights 
When we were happy living young and foolish lives 

Wo wo, wo wo wo 
I remember 
Love on a rooftop 
We couldn't make the love stop 
We were giving all that we got 
Wo wo, wo wo wo 
I remember holding you so tight 
Our kisses lasted all night 
Wo wo, wo wo 
Love on a rooftop 
Wo wo, wo wo wo 

We never stop to see the moon at night 
We're just to busy leading complicated lives. 
Wo wo, wo wo...

Wo wo, wo wo wo 
I remember 
Love on a rooftop 
We couldn't make the love stop 
We were giving all that we got 
Wo wo, wo wo wo 
I remember holding you so tight 
Our kisses lasted all night 
Wo wo, wo wo 
Love on a rooftop 
Wo wo, wo wo wo
