One night, downtown, young girl, head down
Walked in, sat down beside me
One look was enough, and this boy was in love
The cold sweat was burning up inside me

You're not shy like a little girl, you don't cry like a kissin' doll
Little Jeany was just too much, she said, baby baby, look but don't touch

She got up and walked by, a little teaser with one thing on her mind
The jukebox at number twenty-five
Next thing that I knew, she was dancing on the bar
Twistin' on and a-shakin', lookin' like a movie star
Hot sticky stuff and close enough to touch

And this is what she said to me, she said baby baby baby, baby baby baby
Baby baby baby, baby baby baby baby baby baby
Baby baby baby, baby baby baby, she said baby baby baby
Baby baby baby baby baby baby
(Baby baby baby) Look but don't touch
(Baby baby baby) Look but don't touch
(Baby baby baby) Look but don't touch
(Baby baby baby) Look but don't touch me
(Look but don't touch) Look but don't touch
(Look but don't touch) Look but don't touch me
(Look but don't touch) Look but don't touch
(Look but don't touch) Touch me, no no no
Look but don't touch me, no

Don't touch my legs, don't touch my hips
Don't touch my ass, don't touch my lips
Don't touch me there, don't [show a hair]
Don't touch my cheeks, don't touch me there, there, there, and there
Don't touch me there, don't touch me there, no no no, ow...
