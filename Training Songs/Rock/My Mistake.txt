You and I been goin' steady for a whole lot o' years
And it was love that started feelin' like a ????????
My love is dyin', but I can't hide it
I'm sorry honey, but I wanna ride

I saw a real fine girl at the market place
She had a nice way of walkin' and a real fine face
Of course, like a man I don't understand
I'm sorry chick, but it's my mistake

Well, my, my, my, my, my, my, my mistake
Yes, my, my, my, my, my, my, my mistake

Oh, alright now, honey

I had to choose between school and a rock 'n roll band
I made up my mind to rock as fast as I can
I don't want no teachers, or their rules
You've got it right, I'm nobody's fool

But to get yourself spotted, like you just don't know
Too many people got smiles, and they lie like a log
It's hard to take, 'cause I need space
I'm sorry honey, it was my mistake

Well, it's my, my, my, my, my, my, my mistake
It's my, my, my, my, my, my, my mistake
My, my, my, my, my, my, my mistake
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, ooh
My, my, my mistake
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my...........FADE
