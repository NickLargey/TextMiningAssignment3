If you think your mind is ready 
Then open your heart and let it fall 
If you keep on hiding from me 
You´re not gonna'= live your life at all 

Cause if it's love that you want 
You've gotta give me more than you've shown 
Because the sweet light of love won´t come down 
If you don't cry, cry to be found 
If you don't cry, cry to be found 

So get yourself together, let it 
Be something you´ll treasure for evermore 
Make me come out lookin´ for it 
And show me you´re worth me waitin´ for 

Cause´ if it´s love that you want 
You´ve gotta´ give me more than you´ve shown 
Because the sweet light of love won´t come down 
If you don´t cry, cry to be found 
If you don´t cry, cry to be found 

If you could give me a flag to follow 
A bright shiny path toward your door 
Then you might get somewhere at last 
That you wanted to go, ooh yeah 

Cause´ if it´s love that you want 
You´ve gotta´ give me more than you´ve shown 
Because the sweet light of love won´t come down 
If you don´t cry, cry to be found 
If you don´t cry, cry to be found 

Cry, cry, what you waiting for 
Cry, if you don´t cry, (if you don´t cry) 
Cry, if you don´t cry, you´re not gonna´ live your life 
(Cry), you´re not gonna´ live your life at all 
(Cry), c´mon, show me you´re worth me waitin´ for 
(Cry,), oooh (cry), cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
