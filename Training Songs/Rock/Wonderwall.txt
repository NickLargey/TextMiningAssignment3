Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna give it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Back beat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
And I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one who saves me?
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never bring it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you got to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now

And all the roads that we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
You're my wonderwall
You're my wonderwall
You're my wonderwall
