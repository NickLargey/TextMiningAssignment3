Read the news in the Times today...said the world is goin' round (world is
goin' round)
I don't care what somebody said, somebody always puts 'em down (always puts
'em down)
Red or yellow, black or white
Are you left-handed or are you right
When you open your eyes can you see the light
Do you wake up screamin' in the middle of the ni-i-i-ight

Too much talk, and not enough action
Do you know anybody gettin' satisfaction
Everbody wonders 'bout the crowd's reaction.
And the world gets better by a very small fraction.

Turn around til you see a face and it won't be very long (Won't be very long)
Someone soon will be in your place and it won't be very wrong (won't be very
wrong)
Red or yellow, black or white...

[Chorus]

Now's our chance to change the world,
Change the world with love, with love...

[Chorus]
