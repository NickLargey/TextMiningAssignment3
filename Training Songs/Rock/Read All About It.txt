I get my head together on a Saturday morning 
A victim of the night it's called social action 
I'm just trying to keep up with the times 
Moving with the crowd and they want it loud 
I keep saying I'll never do it again 
Same old line I'm right back out there again. 
Chorus 
You can read all about it 
You can read all about it 
You can read all about it 
You can read all about it 

my eyes catch the morning paper on the table 
It's a brand new day but nothing's changed 
Sickness crime and poverty are the headlines that I see 
There's got to be some good news someday 

Chorus 

my head's so much cleaner 
It's a brand new morning 
I can see the world through different eyes now 
Peace love and harmony 
The Bible says these are for me 
I thank God for the good news today 

Chorus
