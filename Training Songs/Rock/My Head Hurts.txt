I can't concentrate
My brain's damaged over you (Woo, ooo, ooo)
I'm saying stupid things
I bet she doesn't know my name (Woo, ooo, ooo)

But my head hurts
And without you it's worse

I want you to take
Shove me deeply into your veins
I want you to come
Breathe me deeply into your lungs

But my head hurts
And without you it's worse
Suffocating on my own
You're killing me, I hope you know

I don't exist
I don't exist
(Woo, ooo, ooo)
I don't exist
I don't exist
(Woo, ooo, ooo)

But my head hurts
And without you it's worse
Suffocating on my own
You're killing me, I hope you know

I hope you know
I hope you know
(Woo, ooo, ooo)
I hope you know
I hope you know
(Woo, ooo, ooo)
I hope you know
I hope you know (My head hurts)
(Woo, ooo, ooo)
I hope you know
I hope you know (My head hurts)
(Woo, ooo, ooo)
