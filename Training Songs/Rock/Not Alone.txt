Should I tell you why I feel so down
When all I've carried for days is the same old doubts?
Well I'd tell you if I'd had a plan
Only you're one of those with your head in the sand

While I don't feel so afraid
Maybe this is just some kind of phase
But I don't care about the wind in my face

'Cause I'm not alone, these days
No, I'm not alone, these days, yes
I'm not alone, these days
No, I'm not alone, these days, yes

Could I tell you how I hear those sounds?
Well I've been roaming the streets
With my head in the clouds
And I won't need to show you my heart
'cause all I need in my hands is an electric guitar

Well I thought that you understood
That friends like these won't ever do me no good
'Cause I have never know the people I should

But I'm not alone, these days
No, I'm not alone, these days, yes
I'm not alone, these days
No, I'm not alone, these days, yea yea yea yeah

No, I'm not alone, these days
No, I'm not alone, these days, yes
I'm not alone, these days
No, I'm not alone, these days, yes

I'm not alone (Well I just thought that you could), these days (I just thought that you should)
No, I'm not alone (Sometimes you would), these days (Stay with me)
Misunderstood (I just thought that you knew)
I'm not alone (I just hope that you do), these days (I just wanted you to stay with me)
Misunderstood
Maybe I misunderstood

Maybe I misunder...
Maybe I misunderstood
