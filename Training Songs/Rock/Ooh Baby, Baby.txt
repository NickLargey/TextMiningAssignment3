Ooo la, la, la, la.
I did you wrong, my heart went out to play
and in the game I lost you; what a price to pay.
I'm cryin'.
Oooh, baby, baby. Oooh, baby, baby.
Mistakes, I know I've made a few,
but I'm only human. You've made mistakes too.
I'm cryin'.
Oooh, baby, baby. Oooh, baby, baby.
(Chorus:)
Ooh, baby, baby. Ooh, baby.
I'm just about at the end of my rope.
But, I can't stop tryin'.
I can't give up hope.
'cause I feel someday I'll hold you near,
whisper I still love you.
Until that day is here, I'm cryin'
Oooh, baby, baby. Oooh, baby, baby.
Oooh, baby, baby. Oooh, baby, baby.
Oooh, baby, baby. Oooh, baby, baby.
Ooooh.
