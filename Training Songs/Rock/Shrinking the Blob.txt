(lyrics: Thomas Flowers)

The deeper you get the more you sink into it
Faster you fall the more you crawl away from it
We're siamese at the knees she said and we're weighted
We're siamese if you please and she said and we're weighted

We are right here with you
We are right here with you

The more that you make the less you should take from others
The longer you live the more you should give to your brothers
We're siamese at the knees she said and we're weighted
We're siamese if you please and she said and we're weighted

We are right here with you
We are right here with you
You came the wait is over
And now your mine
And you 'll never ever be alone

Can't believe how much you've grown in such a short time
Can't believe how much you've grown and are growing
Ornery, but lovingly you scream when your hungry
Can't believe how much you've grown and are growing
Right in front of my eyes

We are right here with you
We are right here with you
You came the wait is over
And now your mine & your mine
And you'll never ever be alone
