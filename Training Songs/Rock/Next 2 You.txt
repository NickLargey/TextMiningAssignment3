Come to you honey on the east side runnin' 
And I ain't got time to waste 
Jump into the car in the back seat lovin'
But your keeping me on the chase 
I've been trying all nightlong 
I put up with your favorite songs all night 
Tempted by your tainted love 
I surely like for you to 
Come inside my crystal ball what can I do 

Is it true what they say you won't give it away 
And I don't what to do to next to you, next to you 
Every night everyday you just push me away 
Tell me what should I do to next to you, next to you 

I've been trying all night long 
Cause I want to get next to you 
I wrote about you baby in this song 
And I want to get next to you 
Next to you 

Better than Kool-Aid sweet my buttercup 
Baby's got a pretty face 
I got to have it, it's another bad habit 
I hope not here to late 

Is it true what they say you won't give it away 
And I don't what to do to next to you, next to you 
Every night everyday you just push me away 
Tell me what should I do to next to you, next to you 

I've been trying all night long 
Cause I want to get next to you 
I wrote about you baby in this song 
And I want to get next to you 
Next to you 

Spent my money, teasing me honey, 
What should I do 
When you gonna show me? 
I think you owe me, 
Come on baby see it through 

I've been trying all night long 
Cause I want to get next to you 
I wrote about you baby in this song 
And I want to get next to you 
Next to you
