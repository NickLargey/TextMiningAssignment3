In Pearl City
Pearl City
No-one knows, no-one cares
about your world of stocks and shares 

I don't need no riding crop
I don't need no roundabout stop 

You're welcome to Pearl City 
See the bank 
Bright white trains
You old coots
retired early 

At Pearl City
In Pearl City 

Cappuccino and a slice of quiche
It's salad for the new educated 'teach'
Everything is gonna work out fine
They're sleepin' us in the lec-lecturer line
In Pearl City 

In Pearl City 
Ye over-counter drugs
Have left you totally bushwhacked 

In Pearl City 
We asked Vauxhall drivers
what they wanted from a garage
Did ya? Did ya? 

At service center on the rock 
Pearl City 
I don't need a bird beggin at my knees
I don't need no riding crop
I don't need no roundabout stop 

(Are you on the ball?)
