I went down to see lonesome Mary
She was a-sittin' all alone
She was a cryin' about her calm drearyness
Of the faded desert of a home

She was a-weepin' and a-wailin'
You know she does it every day
I said Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
How can you live that way?

She said I don't know
It must be in my soul
I guess I've lost beat
With mom's library
How to get along with persons in the world

Oooooooooooooooohhhhh lonesome Mary
Oooooooooooooooohhhhh lonesome Mary
Yeah, yeah yeah

Oh tonight I see lonesome Mary
She was a-sittin' all alone
She was a cryin' about her calm drearyness
Of the faded desert of a home

She was a-weepin' and a-wailin'
You know she does it every day
I said Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
How can you live that way?

She said I don't know
It must be in my soul
I guess I've lost beat
With mom's library
How to get along with persons in the world

Oooooooooooooooohhhhh lonesome Mary
Oooooooooooooooohhhhh lonesome Mary
Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh yeah!
