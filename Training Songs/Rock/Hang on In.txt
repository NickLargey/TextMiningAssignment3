Well the rain's fallin' down around you,
So you cry yourself to sleep.
I know love hurts when one doesn't love as deep.
You're feelin' lost and empty,
'Cause you gave yourself away.
But don't be ashamed to cry,
It's okay.
But you've got to Hang On In,
Baby, be strong,
Love will always find a way.
No, you can't give up,
You've just got to go on,
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day.
Hang on.
You keep searchin' for the reasons,
As you walk the lonely halls.
You wait by a telephone,
But he never calls.
Time's the only healer
For the broken hearts of glass
Love is like the wind it too shall pass
But you've got to Hang On In,
Baby, be strong,
Love will always find a way.
No, you can't give up,
You've just got to go on,
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day.
Hang on.
I know what you're goin' through,
Every time you see his face.
And I don't know where or when,
But I know that you'll love again.
Hang On In,
Baby, be strong,
Love will always find a way.
No, you can't give up,
You've just got to go on,
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day.
Hang on.
