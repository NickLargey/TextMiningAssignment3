While these minutes of no good
Bloody slowly drift away
It's you that comes to help him now
That's not all he wants to say

Tomorrow
And tomorrow
Tomorrow
And tomorrow
Tomorrow
And tomorrow

Tries to keep himself in shape
Washed and cleaned and acting cool
Lonely as a homeless fish
Swimming in an empty pool

Never wants to let you down
Trying hard but fighting fit
Patient as the day allows
Calls you his survival kit

And tomorrow
Tomorrow
And tomorrow
Tomorrow!

Of course you know it's actually me
Embarrassed by this sweet bouquet
I love you till the cows come home
That's not all I want to say
