Some are born to run
Some are born to fly
It's the essence of the love inbuilt in everyman

Some are born for fun
Some are born for lies
Do not regret a moment living out your life

Some are born to love
Some are born to hide
Through the echoes of the feelings drawn in everyman

Some are born to lose
Some are born to try
For trying harder seems the only way to go

Some are born to run
Some are born to fly
Through the echoes of the feelings drawn in everyman

Some are born to lose
Some are born to try
Trying harder seems the only way to go
Trying harder seems the only way to go

hee we meet, I feel it in the morning light
Getting it together, does it feel right
Ohhh-

Let us be together in the morning light
Let us be together in the dawning light
Ohhh-
Let it through
Let it through

Some are born to run
Some are born to fly
It's the essence of the love inbuilt in everyman

Some are born for fun
Some are born for lies
Do not regret a moment living out your life

Some are born to run
Some are born to fly
Through the echoes of the feelings drawn in everyman

Some are born to run
Some are born to fly
Then we spend some time just hanging around
Them we spend some time just hanging around
