I'm here at the crossroad 
Where my life is heading? Man, I don't know 
Should I stay of should I go? 
'cause anythings better than what I've been through 
What I would give to get a sign from above? 
Letting me know that everything would be okay 
I wish someone would pull me up from out of the mud. 
Will anyone out there say to me 

I'm here, for you
Don't worry 'cause I got you 
Don't trip, don't stress 
My life seems to be heading 
Over the edge 
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
The edge, the edge 

Now everyday that goes by 
I see things that'll make another man cry 
I'm sitting, wondering why 
I can't find someone to fit in my life.
See I was searching, but am I worth it? 
And did they every think I'm good enough for her? 
Despite my suffering I felt the loving 
The blessing came when I need it the most.

And that's the sign that I received from up above 
Letting me know that everything would be okay.
And that was the something that pulled me out of the mud. 
And also was the one that said to me 

I'm here, for you
Don't worry 'cause I got you 
Don't trip, don't stress 
My life seems to be heading 
Over the edge 
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
The edge, the edge 

No matter, no matter how far you fall down 
You gotta, you gotta be ready to stand up 
I've been through the same thing you're going through (been through the same thing) 
But you've got to believe in you 
(ooh yeah)
No matter, no matter how far you fall down (oooo)
You gotta, you gotta be ready to stand up (gotta be ready) 
I've been through the same thing you're going through now (stand up) 
But you've got to belive in you
'cause I've got you

I'm here, for you
Don't worry 'cause I got you 
Don't trip, don't stress 
My life seems to be heading 
Over the edge 
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
The edge, the edge 
I'm here, for you
Don't worry 'cause I got you 
Don't trip, don't stress 
My life seems to be heading 
Over the edge 
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
The edge, the edge
