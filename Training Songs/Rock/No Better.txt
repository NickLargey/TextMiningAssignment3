If you could shake back a thousand tears
And you could take back the crosses in your fingers
You would know no better, no better, better that we
We were meant to be together

Spinning freely you could collide
And mercifully, and only, settle
And the gift of union cross breath, and this love, and this life
Is you could stay, and we were meant to be together

'Cause I still see your face
And I still wear that ring
And I will not lie
It's the hardest thing
I still love you, and you don't want me

Bless me, father, for I am not myself
Kiss me, my love, the right way
'Cause you're all that glitters, glitters, glitters, except my shame
And we were meant to be together

'Cause I still see your face
And I still hold that flower
And I will not lie
In that hopeless hour
I still love you

And we were meant to be together
We were meant to be together.
