Life is sweet, knowing you found
What you've always been looking for
That's how I feel about you
Everything that you do

It's ecstasy
True moments of passion never die
When I hold you in my arms
And hear to tenderly sigh

Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake
Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake

Make no mistake, make no mistake

I don't know
Exactly what I was looking for
But once I held you I knew
Nobody else could ever do

In the heat of love
Decisions we make may not all be real
But one thing I know for sure
Is that I love you so

Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake
Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake

Make no mistake

Wanna make something real
Show me how you feel, baby

Life is sweet, knowing you found
What you've always been looking for
That's how I feel about you
Everything that you do

Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake
Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake

Make no mistake, make no mistake

Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, no oh
Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake

Our love is one of a kind
