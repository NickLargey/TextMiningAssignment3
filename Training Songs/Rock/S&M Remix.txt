Feels so good being bad
There’s no way I’m turning back
Now the pain is my pleasure
'Cause nothing could measure

Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling, leaves me wanting more

'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na, come on, come on, come on,
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it

Just one night full of sin
Feel the pain on your skin
Tough, I don't scream mercy
It's your time to hurt me yeah
If I'm bad tie me down
Shut me up, gag and bound me
'Cause the pain is my pleasure, nothing comes better
Yeah

'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na, come on, come on, come on,
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it

Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It’s exactly what, I’ve been yearning for give it to me strong

And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say ah, ah, ah
I like it, like it

'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na, come on, come on, come on,
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
