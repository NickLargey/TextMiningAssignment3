I brought a song into this world
Just a melody with words
It trembles here before my eyes
How can this song survive 

I brought it to the tower of gold
In my coat of many holes
I came unarmed, they've got knives
How can this song survive

Oh now, I can't help wondering how it is
How someone like you exists
When all around you bullets fly
You don't seem to notice them go by
How can this song survive

Oh now, I see the game I'm up against
No wonder I feel so afraid
For every song you ever heard
How many more have died at birth
Oh how, how can this song survive

I brought a song into this world
Just a melody with words
It trembles here before my eyes
How can this song survive
I came unarmed
They've all got knives
How can this song survive
Until we finally say goodbye
How, how can this song survive
I wonder how, I wonder why
