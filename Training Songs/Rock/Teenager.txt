For your birthday she sent you a card
She didn't sign her name
She gave an autograph
And now she's trying to call your bluff
Is she your true love?

We knew the boy that went to from morn' to ten?
She asked matter of fact had he blown off his head
He was uncomplaining as a tree
Not a thing like me

Well, you're not a teenager so don't act like one
Sure she is heartbreaker
Does she have one?
Is it down to me?
Down to me?
But will we speak?

I went for a stroll after dark
I thought of you and how I was staring at the black
I didn't have you down for being easily lead
Girl, you were lead

Well, you're not a teenager so don't act like one
Sure she is heartbreaker
Does she have one?
Is it down to me?
Down to me?
But will we speak?
