We know this place... where we are... doesn't matter
We know this place, we've been here before

The stars are out waiting for the moon
The stars are out waiting for us

Pull the blanket now, creep down the stairs
Don't wake for little ones, the lazy cats, the mice are in their homes

The stars are out waiting for the moon
The stars are out waiting for us

Ease this raging mind, this raging love
Sometimes it feels like a knife, but not tonight
Sometimes it turns like a knife in me, not tonight

The stars are out waiting for the moon
The stars are out waiting for us
