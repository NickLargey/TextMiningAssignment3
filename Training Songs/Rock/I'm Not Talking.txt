No one wants to weigh things down 
But they tend to fly away and rescue teams will look for days 
I like the way things are 
I say abandon the search 
Ford off the rough small work 
Until then, Until then 
Until they've reason to 
Think I've a shot at redemption 
Until then I'm not talkin' 
Yes but remember this 
It's always been a long shot or worse 
Fordin' off the rough small work 
I don't mean to weigh things down 

But fortune telling, let's just see 
When it all comes true we'll see 
Until then, Until then 
Until they've reason to 
Think I've a shot at redemption 
Until then I'm not talkin' 

No I've never been close, I thought you should know
No I've never been close, I want you to know 
No I've never been close, I've never been close 
But I've never been far away 
No I've never been close, I've never been close 
But I've never been far away 

I like the way things are 
Time to abandon the search 
Ford off the rough small work 
Until then, Until then 
Until they've reason to 
Think I've a shot at redemption 
Until then I'm not talkin'
