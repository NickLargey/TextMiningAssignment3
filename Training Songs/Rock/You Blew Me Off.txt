You blew me off it turned me on

All or nothing
More or less
You assault me ruthlessly
Oh you're the best

You blew me off

You don't understand you see
Your not suppose to take on me
You don't understand you see
That's just how it's gotta be

If you ignore me
You get my respect
When you turn to hug me
I like you less

You blew me off

What are you doing
Callin' me on the phone
Sayin' Bobby come back
Won't ya leave me alone

You blew me off

You don't understand
