Lord, give me grace and dancing feet
As I conquer all anxiety
The angel told me not to fear
That the power to was in me
For I have learnt the way to pray
Like a muscle growing taut now
Bind the past into a knot
And let the love consume us
Let the love consume us
Let the love consume us

Can you hear the stars now sing
Resounding in D major?
As the god vibration resonates
And pulls us up towards her
Take your shoes off, feel the earth
Beneath your feet respond to touch
And let our laughter now ring forth
As the love consumes us

The love within is moving upwards
Sweeter than any drug
The melody is taking over
Guide my hand through this hurt
Pull back the veil
Let your eyes meet this world
The love within is moving upwards
So don't you want to get high?
And don't you want to get high?

And don't you want to get high?
Don't you want to get
Don't you want to get high?

The love within is moving upwards
Sweeter than any drug
The melody is taking over
Guide my hand through this hurt
Pull back the veil
Let your eyes meet this world
The love within is moving upwards
So don't you want to get high?
Don't you want to get high?
