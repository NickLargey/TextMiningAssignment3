You know all my deepest secrets
I think you know
You know to keep 'em
But I wonder if you know
I hate sleeping alone

So come and tell me what my kiss tastes like
Don't wanna miss it
So turn off the lights
But I wonder if you know
I hate sleeping alone

I have to fake it
I leave if I could
I'm not in love
But the sex is good
You can't mistake it
Because it's understood
I'm not in love
But the sex is good (yeah, mm hm!)

You got to know
Know my weakness
You always touch
In all the right places
We don't get along that well
Not much for talk
But you're hot as hell

I have to fake it
I leave if I could
I'm not in love
But the sex is good
You can't mistake it
Because it's understood
I'm not in love
But the sex is good (yeah mhm! yeah mhm!)

It's not like
I wanna stick around
It's just tonight
I'm gonna lay you down (yeah)

So now you know
What my kiss tastes like
So in the morning
I say goodbye
But I wonder
If you know
I hate sleeping alone

I have to fake it
I leave if I could
I'm not in love
But the sex is good
You can't mistake it
Because it's understood
I'm not in love
But the sex is good

I have to fake it
I leave if I could
I'm not in love
But the sex is good
You can't mistake it
Because it's understood
I'm not in love
But the sex is good (yeah mhm! yeah mm, hm)
