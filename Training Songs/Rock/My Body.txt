Stop!
The train is riding
Down to the station where you lived
When we were school kids

Hey!
The rails are caught now
And I am falling down
Fools in a spiral
Round this town of steam

My body tells me no!
But I won't quit
'Cuz I want more, 'cuz I want more
My body tells me no!
But I won't quit
'Cuz I want more, 'cuz I want more

Stop
The train is riding
Down to the station where I lived
When I was a cool kid

Hey!
Is it my fault that
The fallen embers burn
Down in a spiral
Round your crown of thieves

My body tells me no!
But I won't quit
'Cuz I want more, 'cuz I want more
My body tells me no!
But I won't quit
'Cuz I want more, 'cuz I want more

And it rides out of town

Oh,

It's my road

It's my road

It's my road

It's my road

It's my road

It's my road

And it's my war, it's my war,
It's my war, it's my war
His eyes are open
His eyes are open

Hey, hey, hey

My body tells me no!
But I won't quit
'Cuz I want more, 'cuz I want more
My body tells me no!
But I won't quit
'Cuz I want more, 'cuz I want more

It rides out of town
