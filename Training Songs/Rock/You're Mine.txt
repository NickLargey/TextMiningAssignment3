Do you love me as I love you
Tell this aching heart of mine
Are you certain that you love me
I'm suspecting more all the time
You're mine just when you're lonely
You're mine just when you need me
Want me more than you do, dear
For your heart knows how much I care
There are nights, dear, you don't call me
When I need to be with you
So I worry and I wonder
Do you love me as I love you
Io ti penso sempre
Sempre, piú di sempre
Io non voglio altro
Non c'è niente senza di te
You're mine just when you're lonely
You're mine just when you need me
Want me more than you do, dear
For your heart knows how much I care
Your heart knows how much I care
