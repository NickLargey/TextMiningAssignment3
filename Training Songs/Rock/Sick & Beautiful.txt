All the world's your ashtray
I'm just your Marlboro
Light me up and butt me
You're sick and you're beautiful

It's Bamby meets Godzilla
A 3D free for all
Set me up, then stomp me
You're sick and beautiful

Squeeze me like your lemon
Then mix with alcohol
Shake me hard then down me
You're sick and beautiful
You're gravy with gasoline
And wicked with whipping cream

I need a quick fix
I'm flashing like an instamatic
Crusted like a worn out penthouse
Your junk is habitual
You're sick and you're beautiful

Bounce me hard and dunk me
I'm just your basketball
Lay me up then heave-ho
You're sick and beautiful
Peel my bandage slowly
It's psychological
You're napalm with novacaine
A kite in a hurricane

I need a quick fix
I'm flashing like an instamatic
Crusted like a worn out penthouse
Your junk is habitual
You're sick and you're beautiful

Leave me in a ditch like roadkill
Or maybe we could switch the driver
Have some mercy and Kevorkian me to sleep
You're cockroach with cabernet
But taste like a Milky Way
You're gravy with gasoline
And wicked with whipping cream

I need a quick fix
I'm flashing like an instamatic
Crusted like a worn out penthouse
Your junk is habitual
You're sick and you're beautiful
