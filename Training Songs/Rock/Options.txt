I could be the guy at the end of the street
high on caffeine
Ranting and raving, baby
And that’s OK
At least I've got options
Or I could be the one who gives it all up
and moves back to the parents’ house
Live in the basement baby
And that’s OK
At least I've got options

All the things you’ll see
And the place you’ll go
All the people you need
Everybody wants you
Wants to be you

I could settle down be responsible
Be a good man
And Learn how to fix things, baby
And that’s OK
At least I've got options
Or I could try and learn what I unlearned
Moving to business 
And make loads of money for gullible people
That’s OK
At least I've got options

All the things you’ll see
And the place you’ll go

All the people you need
Everybody wants you
Wants to be you

I never wanted to change you
I only wanted to share
I don’t believe, I don’t believe
Starting over and over again,
Over and over again

Somebody who understands and loves me 
Despite all my weakness' baby
And that’s OK
At least I've got options

All the things you’ll see
(All the things that you wanted see)
And the places you’ll go
(All the places that you wanted to go)
All the people you need
(All the people you wanted to need)
And the lovers you've known
All the lovers that you wanted to know

Everybody wants you
Wants to be you

Over and over again
Over and over again
