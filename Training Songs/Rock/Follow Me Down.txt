Out in the streets, out in the fields
Over the hills and the valleys
Up on the mountains, up through the clouds
Yeah, I'll take you where I'm going

Far from the taste, far from the smell
Far from the noise of the city
I'll take the fast train, far from pollution
I'll take you where I'm going

[Chorus:]
Follow me, follow me, follow me down
Follow me down, follow me down
Girl, follow me down

A home we will build up on the hill
We'll leave all the plastic and phony
Make love every hour, we can get high
Yeah, I'll take you where I'm going

[Chorus]
