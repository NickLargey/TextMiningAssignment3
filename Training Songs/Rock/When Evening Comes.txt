At the break of day
When my dreams have come and gone
The memories will fade away
But I wonder for how long
Not too long

For I know an evening comes
And I hear the night birds tune
I remember were it all begun
As we dance beside the moon

It's always on my mine
But were did it come from
Our love was the strongest kind
So were can it have gone

Would someone show me the way
To turn my night into day
I'll throw it up around the moon

No don't let see me alone
It's always on my mind
But were did it come from
Our love was the strongest kind
So were can it have gone
