I'm in love again
Been like this before
I'm in love again
This time's true, I'm sure

Don't wanna end up like no nine-day wonder (oh-oh)
I've been hurt so many times before (oh-oh)
So my darlin', I will never leave you (oh-oh)
It's in my blood to always love you more (oh-oh)
Love you more (oh-oh)

It's my heart again (oh-oh)
That drives me so wild (oh-oh)
I just can't explain (oh-oh)
Although I'm not a child (oh-oh)

So why would I cry if you ever left me? (oh-oh)
Maybe 'cause you're all I'm livin' for (oh-oh)
With every heartbeat I want you madly (oh-oh)
It's in my blood to always love you more (oh-oh)
Love you more (oh-oh)

Oh, my love again (oh-oh)
What I say is true (oh-oh)
Though it may sound plain (oh-oh)
I love you

And it means more to me than life can offer (oh-oh)
And if this isn't true love then I am sure (oh-oh)
That after this love there'll be no other (oh-oh)
Until the razor cuts
