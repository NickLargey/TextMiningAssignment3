Come the mornin' don't ya wake me
I'll be dreamin' that I'm free
Come the daybreak don't ya shake me
Send me back to misery

Cause I'm dealin' with a devil
With no help from above
I'm stealin' with the devil
Through this house of broken love

Takin' chances with you baby
I saw something in your eyes
And though no one else could blame me
There were signs I should of recognized

Now I'm dealin' with a devil
With no help from above
I'm sleepin' with the devil
In this house of broken love

If you don't want to lose my lovin'
Use it constantly
If it's gonna be lies, suspicious eyes
Baby oh baby set me free

When the night falls and she's leavin'
Oh the moon shines cold and gray
Hear my heartbeat yeah yeah hear m' weepin'
Pain and sorrow's here to stay

I begged you baby help me
But you turned your back on me
You didn't even listen
You should have set me free

Now I'm leavin' with the devil
Gonna leave this search for love
Leavin' with the devil
Leave this house of broken love
