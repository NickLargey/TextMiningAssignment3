(Chorus)
Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, don't get caught
Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, let us out
Wilder lower wolves. Here's a house to put wolves out the door
In a corner garden, wilder lower wolves
House in order, house in order, house in order, house in order
Down there they're rounding a posse to ride

Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, don't get caught
Suspicion yourself, suspicion ourselves, suspicion myself
Wilder lower wolves. Here's a house to put wolves out the door
In a corner garden, wilder lower wolves
House in order, house in order, house in order, house in order
Down there they're rounding a posse to ride
