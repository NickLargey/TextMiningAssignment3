Put us on a life support machine from the day we're born,
Didn't realise it was just our dawn.
By the media we've been accepted, but in reality still rejected.

From the start it won't last,
But now that's all in the past.
Never admit to being wrong,
Five years on and we're still going strong.

Given a year to pack up and die,
Take the taking, run and hide.
Said 'race against time', thought it was clever,
Time is immortal and we're forever.

So five years on and we should be dead,
New ideas in the same old head.
Don't need help, don't need a tutor,
You're our past and we're your future.
It's a race against time, but whose racing ?
'Cus we've already won.
