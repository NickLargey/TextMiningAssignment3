I'm falling harder than I've
Ever fell before
I'm falling fast while hoping
I'll land in your arms
'Cause all my time is spent here
Longing to belong
To you

I dream of circles perfect
Eyes within your face
My heart's an open wound that
Only you'd replace
And though the moon is rising
Can't put your picture down
Love can be frightening when you fall

And when the time is right, I
Hope that you'll respond
Like when the wind gets tired
The ocean becomes calm
I may be dreaming but I'm
Longing to belong
To you
