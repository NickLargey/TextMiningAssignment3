Oh lend me a hand please Lord and guide me
And help lead me down the road that is right
Oh carry me through these hours of darkness
And show me the path the shining light
I'm a wandering soul I'm lost from my savior
A sheep that has strayed so far from the fold

Just tarrying along in the clutch of old Satan
But I'm hoping someday you'll save my soul
Dear Lord please forgive the grief I have caused you
The thoughts of my sins that tortured my soul
Oh help me to know the joy of salvation
Help cleanse my life through and make me whole
I'm a wandering soul
