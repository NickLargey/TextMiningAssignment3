I walk wherever the weather provides
'Cause everybody needs some time outside
Give me no lip and I tell you no lie

Hands down the illest ventriloquist this side of the Mississippi river 
That's right operator smoother than faders on an automated sound board
Andretti's never raced me but if he wants to oh I'm ready, ready
Coordination of the eye and hand is not my strong point
But I make due with what I have

Pure rock fury the solution is so clear
Calling all humans and able volunteers.

I walk wherever the weather provides 
'Cause everybody needs some time outside
I've seen them boxes with peliculas 
One time stands out in particular
I saw you dance in the arena all in makeup dressed up like a ballerina
I got to wonder what's got into you 
Or just what you got into, got into, got into, got out!

Pure rock fury the solution is so clear
Calling all humans and able volunteers
Pure rock fury the solution is so clear
Calling all humans and able volunteers

I walk wherever the weather provides 
'Cause everybody needs some time outside
Give me no lip and I tell you no lie

Hotter than ABBA in Nevada sun 
In a real small car with the windows rolled up, no
No super trooper because you pooped your pants 
And you're screaming oh please just give me one more chance
Not one to shrink from helping humankind brother 
One other thing that you might keep in mind
Coordination of the eye and hand 
Is not my strong point but I make due with what I have

Pure rock fury the solution is so clear
Calling all humans and able volunteers
Pure rock fury the solution is so clear
Calling all humans and able volunteers
