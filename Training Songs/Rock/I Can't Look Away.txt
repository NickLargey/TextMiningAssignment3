I was waiting
For the moment
I was hoping
For the moment

I can see a city burn on the horizon
Sudden darkness fills the sky and hides the day
Though the fires have set me free
From the clouds that cover me
I can't look away
I can't look away

I have climbed the valley side and scaled the mountains
Though my freedom's still one thousand miles away
Yet, I'm frozen in mid-stride
By this yearning deep inside
I can't look away
I can't look away

I was waiting
For the moment
Then I heard the angels scream
Heard the angels scream

Cloaked in arms of war, I've come to look for you
For until they've seen, there is no other way
Through the flames that set me free
And the clouds that cover me
I won't look away
Won't look away
I won't look away
I won't look away
