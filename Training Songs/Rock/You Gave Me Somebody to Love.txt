Baby, it's been hard for me since you've been gone
But you left me with the strength to carry on
Though it hurts so much, I've accepted the fact we're through
'Cause the greatest gift in life I got from you

Baby, baby, you gave me somebody to love
You gave me somebody to love
Whoa-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Memories of nights when we stayed out till dawn
And every time we kissed, a brand-new world was born
Baby, it's all right, go and do what you gotta do
'Cause the greatest gift in life I got from you

Baby, baby, you gave me somebody to love
You gave me somebody to love
Whoa-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh darlin', it's all right, go on and do what you gotta do
'Cause the greatest gift in life I got from you

Baby, baby, you gave me somebody to love
You gave me somebody to love
Whoa-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, baby, baby

You gave me somebody to love
You gave me somebody to love
You gave me somebody to love
You gave me somebody to love
