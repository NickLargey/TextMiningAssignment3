Hey little girl, I'm a man of the world 
Some say I've been around 
Hey little girl, can I show you the world 
Lay down beside me now 
Never forget, this moment we met 
Forever recall this night 
Doin' it all on a night to remember 

Night to remember, a night to live on 
A moment together, it's here then it's gone 

Turn out the light, look in my eyes 
Open your heart to me 
Love on the run, it's only begun 
Darlin' I know you'll see 
Sweet talk and wine, spendin' the time 
Learnin' what love's all about 
Never forget, this moment we met 
Don't let it end without doin' it all on a night to remember 

Night to remember, a night to live on 
A moment together, it's here then it's gone 
A night to remember, a night to live on 
A moment together, it's here then it's gone 

Sweet talk and wine, spendin' the time 
Learnin' what love's all about 
Never forget, this moment we met 
Don't let it end without doin' it all on a night to remember 

Night to remember, a night to live on 
A moment together, it's here then it's gone 
A night to remember, a night to live on 
A moment together, it's here then it's gone 
A night to remember, a night to live on 
A moment together, it's here then it's gone
