Everything seems so far away,
Everything is going wrong you know...
Too many troubles, nothin' but pain in your heart,
Almost hate things ya love...

Oh, oh, let's go find our way
Oh, oh, with our very weak broken hearts, still
Oh, oh, we must have pride nad strength!
Oh, oh, live with a positive mental attitude!

Complain and blamin' someone else,
Do you know it's gonna come back to you!
So many problems, so much hate in this world,
Who is gonna wake up first?

Oh, oh, let's go find our way...

Now you know what to do!
Look at me, don't look down,
Hpld my hand, hold it tight!

Oh, oh, let's go find our way...

Oh, oh, live with a positive mental attitude!
Oh, oh, live with a positive mental attitude!
