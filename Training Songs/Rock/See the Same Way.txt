There was a little girl, picked up a doll, oh so white as snow
Said, "This is me as I really am"
Same little girl, picked up a doll, looked just like her
And threw it away in the garbage, the garbage can, hey

One man in a courtroom with a grim-faced stare
A sea of armchair experts judging what's said
One man saw another man, that could've been him
One man and a woman saw nothing but red, red, red

You're looking at a picture, I'm looking at it too
Do you see what I see today, hey
Let's talk about the difference, find out what's in the way
Open our eyes, see the same, see the same way, hey now

One man saw a healer doing such good, good things
One man saw a sinner by the holy sea
Well Jesus and the pharisees didn't see eye to eye
But the man on the shore saw so clearly

You're looking at a picture, I'm looking at it too
Do you see what I see today, hey
Let's talk about the difference, find out what's in the way
Open our eyes, see the same, see the same way, hey now
I want to be at the meeting, well I want to be in that number
When we all see, see the same, see the same way

One man saw a million men standing in peaceful grace
One man saw nobody missing work
Telling lots of bad jokes might just make you feel good
But you never know who you, who you hurt with your words

You're looking at a picture, I'm looking at it too
Do you see what I see today, hey
Let's talk about the difference, find out what's in the way
Open our eyes, see the same, see the same way, hey now

There was a man playing G.I.Joe, way back there in the woods
In training for the coming of the promised war
Seeing all conspiracy, needs somebody to blame
If only he could open up, love a little more

You're looking at a picture, I'm looking at it too
Do you see what I see today, hey
Let's talk about the difference, find out what's in the way
Open our eyes, see the same, see the same way, hey now
I want to be at the meeting, well I want to be in that number
When we all see, see the same, see the same way
