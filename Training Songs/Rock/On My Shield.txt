All of the wounded need to be saved
Looked for a handout beyond the gates
I need to know if it was worth it
Raise the inferno and burn down to the bone
All of the arrows that plunge into prey
Are their promises of better days?
I need to know if it was worth it
Raise the inferno, because I would rather
Die on my shield
I would rather die on my shield

And I need to know if it was worth it

Die on my shield
Die on my shield

Love's war rages on
Love's war rages on
Love's war rages on
Love's war rages on

Were our pains worth it?
Together we fall apart
Was our pains worth it?
Together we fall apart
Together we fall apart
Together we fall apart
Together we fall apart
Together we fall apart
