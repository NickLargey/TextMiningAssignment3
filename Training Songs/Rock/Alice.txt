Alice is acting very, very strange
Face almost perfect
But her mind's deranged
She's got a blissful smile
Though a sad exchange for life
Alice expecting a perfect day
Luminous daydreams
Homecoming strays
Alice in wonderland
Acting polite
Is it what she knows
Or what she invites
Alice responding to father's will
That refuses the lie
Swears she won't kill
Alice in wonderland
Wondering why
It's harder to live than it is to die
Alice in wonderland
Acting polite
Is it what she knows
Or what she invites
Alice responding to father's will
That refuses the lie
Swears she won't kill
