The drumsticks were his treasure trove
Found in the ashes of The Coconut Grove 

Hey man, can you give me something?
Hey man, did you give me something?
Hey man, nothing comes from nothing
Hey man, something came from somewhere

Hey man, it's a tenement song
Just there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on

(Tenement song)
(Tenement song)

Tall bottle and one more smoke (Tenement song)
She lived through the fire but the piano got broke (Tenement song)

Hey man, can you give me something?
Hey man, did you give me something?

Hey man, it's a tenement song
Just there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on

Hey man, it's a tenement song
Just there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on
(On and on and on)
