It's dark outside a world on fire
That no one's safe from
Its life or death so hold your breath
Or suffocate them
Provoking fears with smoking mirrors
The tension's rising
We waste our time and wait in line
While nothing changes

But nothing changes
Until the people get loud

So get down
Everybody, everybody get down!
Take it to another level right now
No resolution
Stand up this is renegade music
(Rawr) everybody, everybody get down!
Take back your life right now
Are you ready for some new shit?
Stand up this is renegade music
This is renegade music

A house in flames is not contained
The neighbors watching
But no one moves they live by rules
That gives no options
What don't prevail can tell no tales
A dead man walking
To replicate is playing safe
And nothing changes

But nothing changes
Until the people get loud

So get down
Everybody, everybody get down!
Take it to another level right now
No resolution
Stand up this is renegade music
(Rawr) everybody, everybody get down
Take back your life right now
Are you ready for some new shit?
Stand up this is renegade music

Renegade music
This is renegade music

So get down!
Everybody, everybody get down!
Take it to another level right now
No resolution
Stand up this is renegade music
(Rawr) everybody, everybody get down
Take back your life right now
Are you ready for some new shit?
Stand up this is renegade music

Ah!
Motherfucker!
Ah, stand up this is renegade music
