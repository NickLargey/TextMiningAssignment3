Running through my life 
Like a river, like a song 
Train keeps pushing me 
Right back to the place where I belong... 

Back along the tracks 
Fly a million years 
Right across my path 
Train moves on ringing in my ears... 

Come on board 
Come on board 

Train, oh train, take me back, again 
I remember, I remember, take me back 
Train, oh train, the journey ends and starts again 
I remember, I remember, I remember 

I`ve been up all night trying to get this down 
Now I`m hallucinating 
Staring at the wall look what I`m creating... 

Look at the clock I`m twelve hours old 
So many more remain 
Way up ahead I know I see a train... 

Come on board 
Come on board 

Train, oh train, all those memories, all over again 
I remember, I remember, take me back 
Train, oh train, the journey ends and starts again 
I remember, I remember, I remember 

Waited on the station all day 
Just to see a glimpse of the morning train 
Just to see the wheels turning round 
Blowing up steam, 
See what I mean, 
You see what I mean...
