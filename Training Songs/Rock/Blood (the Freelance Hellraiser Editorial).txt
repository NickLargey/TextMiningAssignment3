This wicked city just drags you down 
You're with the red lights, your side of town 

Don't say it's easy to follow a process 
There's nothing harder than keeping a promise 

Blood runs through your veins, that's where our similarity ends 
Blood runs through our veins 

Blood runs through your veins, that's where our similarity ends 
Blood runs through our veins 

There's nothing believable in being honest 
So cover your lies up with another promise 

Blood runs through your veins, that's where our similarity ends 
Blood runs through our veins 

Blood runs through your veins, that's where our similarity ends 
Blood runs through our veins 

Oh

Blood runs through your veins, that's where our similarity ends 
Blood runs through our veins 

If there's hope in your heart 
Did I see it from the start 
If there's hope in your heart
