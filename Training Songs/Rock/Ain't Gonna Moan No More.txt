Oh oh oh
Ain't gonna moan no more
Oh oh oh
Ain't gonna moan no more
And the wolf at my door
Ain't gonna moan no more

From the old groaner to the deep, deep blues
Muddy Waters and John Lee too
From the master of vocal leads
John Henrik sang it with ease
Ain't gonna moan no more

Satchmo chose to play the clown
It didn't stop him layin' it down
He chose to smile, instead of frown
He kept playin' his gigs and
Movin' from town to town, alright

No time to frown, ain't gonna moan today
Go into town, gonna make my day
Do my best to create all a better space
Ain't gonna moan no more, man
Around this place

Willie The Shake said that life is what you make it
Somebody else said, fake it 'til you make it
Well I feel much better when my
Feet are touchin' the ground
I get hip to the tip
When I hear that lonesome sound

Some people's down, someone else is upbeat
Transform the known tryna make it sweet
When you know things are happening
Well, I just can't be beat
When you know the score
You don't have to moan no more

Oh, oh, oh, d-d, d-d
Ain't gonna moan no more
Oh-woah
Ain't gonna moan no more
Ain't no wolf at my door
Ain't gonna moan no more

Oh, oh, oh

Ain't no wolf at my door
Ain't gonna moan no more
Sing it one more time
Oh, oh, oh
Hey, ain't gonna moan no more
Oh, oh, oh
Ain't gonna moan no more
When you know the score
You don't have to moan no more
