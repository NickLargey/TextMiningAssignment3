Why am I losin' sleep over you?
Relivin' precious moments we knew?
So many days have gone by
Still I'm so lonely, and I
Guess there's just no getting over you
And there's nothin' I can do
Wastin' all of my time, all of my mind over you

Within the prison walls of my mind
There's still a part of you left behind
And tho' it hurts I'll get by
Without your lovin', yes, I
Guess there's just no getting over you
And there's nothin' I can do
Wastin' all of my time, all of my mind over you

And I guess there's just no getting over you
And there's nothin' I can do
Wastin' all of my time, all of my mind over you ...
