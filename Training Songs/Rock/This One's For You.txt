I feel so far away from love
'Cause I can never get enough
Like the kid with his hand in the highest jar
And if I came back from the grave for a while
Would you could you make a dead man smile?
I'd wear you on my arm like a brand new scar

My oh my oh my I've had a few
But my oh my oh my this one's for you
My heart is on its sleeve
I need you to believe
That the dark times will fade

So crack the shell of the hardest heart
Slip inside when they're caught off guard
Kill all the urgent lies that stain their blood
And if you think that you know everything
Don't give me this chance to sing
I'm not a fool, a fool to lighten up

And I can't stop staring at you
And your expression looks a little confused
This little story will end so well
