Here I am singin' my song to you now
I want you to listen yes
I want you to listen
Makin' my time go by, makin' you smile

I been thinkin' of you yes
I been thinkin' of you
And settlin' down

Back on the road agin here I'm alone again
Hotel ain't home no
Hotel ain't home

Worn out faces don't care what the pace is
I miss my woman yes
I miss my woman

And settlin' down
She's hummin' another sound
I hear the music in my ear
