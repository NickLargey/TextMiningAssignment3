Every night, I hit the street
All alone burnin' with the need
Broken dreams and an empty heart have got me
I need a lover with a lot of heart
It's so hard when you're in the dark
And no one's there to help you find your way
I keep running in the night
Searchin' for the light
Cryin' for someone to rescue me
Won't you send me, send me an angel 
Send me, send me an angel 
Send me an angel tonight, tonight
Keep lookin' but I can't see
Listen hard but I don't believe
Is this the way it really has to be?
Say you're in or count me out
I can't live with all this doubt

Save my life with a single word
And I'm out here in the dark
I don't know where to start
Begging for my feelings to be heard
Won't you send me, send me an angel 
Send me, send me an angel 
Send me an angel tonight, tonight
I keep running in the night
Searchin' for the light
Cryin' for someone to rescue me
Won't you send me, send me an angel 
Send me, send me an angel 
Send me an angel tonight, tonight
Won't you send me, send me an angel 
Send me, send me an angel 
Send me, send me an angel
