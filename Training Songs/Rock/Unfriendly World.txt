An old movie magazine
Gold wrapper in between
Pages yellowing with time,
It’s tearing up my mind

Plastic snowflake souvenir,
A city far from here,
But it hasn’t moved in years,
I’m breaking up inside

[Chorus]
Hang on to your girl,
'Cause this is an unfriendly world

Birthday cards from years ago
These will kill you slow
Is it worth this pain to grow?
I guess I’ll never know

Christmas toys and picture frames,
All the photos locked away,
Not to live with day by day,
Just a walk down memory lane

[Chorus]

Business men with nasty tricks
Followers of 666,
Fame and fortune made me sick
And I can’t get out

Out the window there’s a view
Grassy hills and flowers too
Lovers of the chosen few
So maybe me and you

An old movie magazine
Gold wrapper it in between
Pages yellowing like me
Will I ever be free?

[Chorus: x2]
