All this time I have followed the rules
And I've lived the perfect life
Alright
By somebody else's standards
All this time I did not feel too bad
But I was not what you call happy
Not really
I was searching for something
And all this time you were standing by
And all this time you were waiting

All this time I've been living a lie
And I even fooled myself completely
Now I'm really ready
Right or wrong
I will follow your course
And if you go down I'll drown
So save me
I'm not as strong as I look yea
All this time I've been saying
No
But all this time
I've been meaning

Yes I'm ready to take your hand
Follow you into the promise land
Ooh yea let's talk about it
I'm a fool for you
Ducking and diving
'Cos I'm a fool for you
All this time I've been saying
No
But all this time
I've been meaning
Yes I'm ready to take your hand
Follow you into the promise land
