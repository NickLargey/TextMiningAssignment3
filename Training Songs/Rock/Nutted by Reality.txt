Well I heard they castrated Castro
I heard they cut off everything he had
What a dirty low down thing to do
To mess him up like that
They dumped him in the jungle
In the land of the sugar cane
Ever since the day they fiddled around
I said he ain't never been the same

I said oh-La
I say oh-La
We say oh-La

Well I heard they castrated Castro
Because he was the people's friend
They told him once and they told him twice
Said I ain't gonna tell you again

They put a bit of pressure on him
That's when he told them what they could do
So the word came down from a northern town
Ã???Set up a jungle rendezvousÃ¢??

I said oh-La
I say oh-La
We say oh-La

He had been livin' in a different world
Then he was nutted by reality
He had been living in another tree
Then he flew down
To see what happened

I went out to see my sister
She was not in
So I went and bought a paper
Then I returned
She was well into the racing
On the TV
She has never been that fond of me
I went and turned her over

See I'd been livin' in a different world
Then I was nutted by reality
I had been living in another tree
Then I flew down
To see what happens

I was listening to an echo
I was impressed
Even though I couldn't see it
It was the most
I was jumping and a-gleeing at every one
I was speaking in a foreign tongue
My pleasure gave no pleasure

See I'd been livin' in a different world
Then I was nutted by reality
I had been living in another tree
Then I flew down
To see what happened
