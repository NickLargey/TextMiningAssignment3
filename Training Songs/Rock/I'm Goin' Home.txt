Mama please don't go
Won't you stay here for one more day
I've been your boy for so long now
There's so much I've, I still have to say

Sky rips open and I held my heart in my hand
Like a soldier on his very last day
Cried myself to sleep that night and I listened
As I heard the angels sing, sha la la

Sha la la la, sha la la la, I'm going home
Sha la la la, la la la la, I'm going home

Oh, something inside of me makes me scream, oh
How could God take you from a little boy
He'll be alright, he's by my side
He's not a little boy, he's my pride and joy
Sha la la la

Sha la la la, sha la la la, I'm going home
Sha la la la, la la la la, I'm going home

Summer on the radio and the phone rings
And it was Jeanette
She said, boy we had to let her go
I begged no, no not yet

You left six of us to fend for ourselves
Guess it's just part of someone's master plan
We see you laughing 'cause you're my best friend
You're the light of the lamb
And I smiled when the angels sing

Sha la la la, sha la la la, take me home
Sha la la la, la la la la, I'm going home
Sha la la la, la la la la, I'm going home
Sha la la la, la la la la, I'm going home
