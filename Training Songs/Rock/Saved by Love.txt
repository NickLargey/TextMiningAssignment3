Out on the border lines,
Somewhere between heart and mind,
Just trying to make it through okay.
Caught in the battleground,
Resistance is wearing down,
Just couldn't face another day,
Oh but then you came my way.

And I've been saved by love (saved by love)
I've been lonely way too long
I've been saved by love (saved by love)
And I know-o-o-o-o-o
Love wont let me goo.

Placing the world alone,
Out there in the great unknown,
But every turn just turns out wrong.
And then you came along,
When hope and faith were almost gone,
You gave me the strength to carry on.
You were the one that I can count on

And I've been saved by love (saved by love)
I've been lonely way too long
I've been saved by love (saved by love)
And I know-o-o-o-o-o
Don't let me go
No no

Came along and you rescued me,
The miracle of love has set me free,
Oh set me free!

Saved by love (saved by love)
I've been lonely way too long
I've been saved by love (saved by love)
The miracle of love has set me free (saved by love)
Tell me where to go
Saved by love (saved by love)
And I know-o-o-o-o-o-o-o
Don't let me go, don't let me go
Don't let me go
Saved by love
