We won't be told who we are
By the nation or the stars
We won't believe in all the lies
We know the truth inside

Won't question how we're made
No, it wasn't a mistake
And it's not up for debate

We are the chosen
We are royalty
We are Your children
You set us free
You alone are our identity

We won't be moved by demands
We know the truth and we will stand

We know there's so much more
Than what the world is living for
We won't be shaken, we are sure

We are the chosen
We are royalty
We are Your children
You set us free
You alone are my identity

Oh, whoa
We are
You alone are my identity

We won't be told who we are
By the nation or the stars
We won't be moved by demands
We know the truth and we will stand

We are the chosen
We are royalty
We are Your children
You set us free
You alone are my identity

Yeah
We are, we are
My identity, my identity
You set us free
You alone are my identity
