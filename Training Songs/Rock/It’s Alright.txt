Maybe we’re going nowhere fast
Oh
And maybe we never even touched the gas
Oh

Alright, it’s alright, it’s alright
You’ll see
Oh
Alright, it’s alright, it’s alright
Believe
Oh

These building tops
They connect the whole block
Oh
You threw the keys down
And I found my way up
Oh

One day I’ll remember
How the words go
If one day you’ll teach me
All the right notes

Alright, it’s alright, it’s alright
You’ll see
Oh
Alright, it’s alright, it’s alright
Believe
Oh
