And knew just when to come and see what you had done?

To give her time to the little league?

And who's the one who gave her shoulder
When you told her your first love was over she'd met someone older
Mama, mama

It was mama, my ma-a-a-ma-a-a

Ma-a-ma, oh ma-a-ma

Who's the one who taught you obligation then dedication result graduation?
Mama, mama
And who's the one who's shown the friends you've known
A home away from home when they were tired and all alone?
Mama, mama

And who's the one who held a tear inside
When you introduced your future bride?
And who's the one who didn't mean to cry
As you walked down the aisle, the tears you saw her smile
Mama, oh, mama
Ma-a-m-a-a, my ma-a-ma-a
It was ma-a-m-a-a
