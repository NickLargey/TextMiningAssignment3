Hey Sister Moon, are you coming round soon?
Hey Sister Moon, in your midnight blue
Hey Sister Moon, are you coming round soon?
Hey, hey and Sister Moon, oh I've been missing you
Now if you take my heart you can take my hand
And I will be with you up in the big land

And groove on Sister, groove on Sister Moon
Groove on, my baby, grove on, groove on Sister Moon

Now Sister d'you remember all of those days?
All those crazy nights seem lost in a haze
But every new moment that's a brand new start
When you got the nature down deep in your heart
And as the mountains move on the winds of change
There's no fear of the end, when you've got the world
Running in your veins

So groove on Sister, groove on Sister Moon
Groove on my baby, grove on, groove on Sister Moon

Now you got the skies and you got the stars
And you got the power to break a young heart
Yeah you got the power and you got the life
And you the love to make it alright

Hey Sister Moon are coming round soon?
Hey, hey and Sister Moon, in your midnight blue

So groove on Sister, groove on Sister Moon
Groove on, my baby, grove on, groove on Sister Moon
Now you can take my heart and you can take my hand
And I won't feel blue when you got the stars
Shining down on you

And groove on Sister, groove on Sister Moon
Groove on my baby, grove on, groove on Sister Moon
Groove on Sister Moon, groove on Sister Moon
