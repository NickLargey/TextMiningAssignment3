How much do you want, how much do you want it
How much are you willing to spend
Superseded model bargain number special profit margin
How much were you willing to lend
The man at the desk
Who takes everything he can find
It's more a transaction than a bribe
How much did you get, how much do you get it
How long are we going to wait
Something in this information, something fine a new formation
How much are you paying off late
The girl at the bar
Who drinks anything she can find
Avoids this transaction in her mind
The voice in your ear
Who says anything it can find
Enter that transaction blind
How much do you want, how much do you want it
How much are you willing to spend
Superseded model number bargain special profit margin
How much are you willing to lend
The man at the desk
Who takes everything he can find
More a transaction than a bribe
The girl at the bar
Who drinks anything she can find
Avoids this transaction in her mind
The voice in your ear
That says anything it can find
Enter this transaction blind
I'm outside your house
I see everything you can't find
More a transaction than a sign
