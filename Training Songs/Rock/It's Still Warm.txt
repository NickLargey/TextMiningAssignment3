Radio plays a song all night
Miami's just a five hour flight
Didn't you say you don't like what you're doing?
You know, last night I was on TV

Hey, don't that make a big bore of me
I didn't think I'd hate this, man, what I'm doing
You know out here it almost never rains
and they've hardly heard about hurricanes

Well that's one less thing to care about, just like Miami
There's a lot of love and a lot of laughs
I even get to sign autographs
I'm gonna get my picture taken with Frank,

Dean, and Sammy
You know I feel really lonely cause I'm always by myself
Now there's folks around and I'm not behaving properly
I don't eat too good

Don't sleep too good
Don't write too good
Don't drive too good
Don't think too good

Don't drink too good
Don't sing too good
Don't (?) too good
I'm alright

I feel so miserable
Where are you tonight?
Oh, Come on come on come on come on come on...
Hold my hand, I've got a new career

But it's still warm out here, yeah it's still warm out here
I know it's lovely there this time of year
But it's still warm out here, yeah it's still warm out here

Hold my hand, I've got a new career
But it's still warm out here, yeah it's still warm out here
I know it's lovely there this time of year
But it's still warm out here, yeah it's still warm out here

Yeah, step right up, c
Got a great big (tree?) here, 
watch it fall come on, come on

(?) and that's not all
