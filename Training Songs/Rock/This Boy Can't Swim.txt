This boy can't swim, he's wearing too many skins
I hope he sinks, then he'll forget everything
Dreamt up the lies that would hold it together
Then realised those he lied to were cleverer
Left on the side they have long since rejoined him
Back in the fold thick as thieves they will weigh him down

This boy can't swim he's carrying too many sins
I hope he sinks, till he forgets everything

'Good as gold' alternates with 'thick as thieves'
