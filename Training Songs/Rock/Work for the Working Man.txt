I'm here, trying to make a living
And I ain't living just to die
Never getting back what I'm giving
Wont someone help me, someone justify
Why these strong hands are on the unemployment line
And there's nothing left, whats on my mind

Who's gonna work for the working man ?
Work for the working man
(Work) Get the hands in the dirt, who's gonna work of the curse
(Work) Brother I've been damned, if I don't raise a hand
Work for the work, work, work for the working man
Work, work, working man

Empty pockets, full of worries
I had to get two jobs and it was hard enough getting by
But with the grace of God I'm getting us through
But only know that I know how to do
That I'm the only one who's gotta look my family in the eye
Day after day, night after night

Who's gonna work for the working man ?
Work for the working man
(Work) Get the hands in the dirt, who's gonna work of the curse
(Work) Brother Ive been damned, if I don't raise a hand
Work for the work, work, work for the working man
Work, work, working man
Work, work, working man

I lost my pension, they took my ID
These were my friends, these were my dreams
These were my hopes, these are my dreams
Can you hear me ?

Who's gonna work for the working man ?
Work for the working man
(Work) Get the hands in the dirt, who's gonna work of the curse
(Work) Brother Ive been damned, if I don't raise a hand
Work for the work, work, work for the working man
Work, work, working man
Work, work, working man

I lost my pension, they took my ID
These were my friends, these were my dreams
These were my hopes, these are my streets
