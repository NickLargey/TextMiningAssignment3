Rock it and roll!
You know it's easy to say
"Get out and go your own way." 
But, baby, why don't you just stay all night?
You're such a sweet young roller skater 
And I could easily see you later 
If you'd just tell me that it's all right
Because you can make love for the first time 
You can be yourself
It ain't no crime 
You can walk around on such a fine line 
Anything you want to, baby 
That's all right with me 
If that's the way you feel 
It ain't no big deal
I am a rock 'n' roller 
And if I get much older 
They're gonna bury me with my guitar 
I want to live and believe 
I want to give and receive 
And, baby, you're the one that'll make me a star
Well, now, you can walk around with trashy clothes on 
And you can love a man and make him feel strong 
You can numb yourself until the pain's gone 
You can tag along and, baby
Nothin's wrong by me 
If that's the way you feel 
Ain't no big deal
I said, oh, when you tease me 
I said, oh baby, now, you please me
Please me!
Oh yeah
Well, now, you can make love for the first time 
You can be yourself
It ain't no crime 
You can walk around on such a fine line
Anything you want to, baby 
That's all right with me
If that's the way you feel 
Ain't no big deal
I am a rock 'n' roller 
And if I get much older 
They're gonna bury me with my guitar 
I want to live and believe 
I want to give and receive 
And, baby, you're the one that'll make me a star
Well, now, you can make love for the first time 
You can be yourself
It ain't no crime 
You can walk around on such a fine line
Anything you want to, baby 
That's all right with me
If that's the way you feel 
It ain't no big deal 
It ain't no big deal 
Well, ain't no big deal
