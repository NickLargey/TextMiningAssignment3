Too much you need 
Too much you need 
He's a genuine boy with a guilty smile
Hands to pull you forward faster 

You and your game is not the answer 
Not on your own 
Had to fool you're forward faster 
You're smashing heads and breaking ladders

All on your own
Your further on
But you can taste the last girl
She's the servant to the master

Oh now your on your own
Outrun yourself to find the next
You'll take what's coming
Catch your own death

All on your own
Too much you need
Too much is greed
He's a genuine boy with a guilty smile
