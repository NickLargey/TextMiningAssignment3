Catch the tide at the blood
My TV screen is sick and blood
My walls and floors are it too 
The night is comin' after you

Cram the innocent with screams of pain
It coming for you again and again 
There's no escape 
There's no way out 

Catch, catch a horror taxi
I fell in love with my video nasty
Catch, catch a horror train
A freeze frame goin' to drive you insane

The axe is sharp 
And the blade is keen
Creatures spillin' from the screen
Shadows fall and all is gloom
You're not so safe 
In the safety of your room

All I want is to make a killing
To thrill and kill might be really thrilling
Why are my victims so unwilling
You can be sure that you won't see me 
With that action meany

Catch, catch a horror taxi
I fell in love with my video nasty
Catch, catch a horror train
A freeze frame goin' to drive you insane

Catch, catch a horror taxi
I fell in love with my video nasty
Catch, catch a horror train
A freeze frame goin' to drive you insane

Catch, catch a horror taxi
I fell in love with my video nasty
Catch, catch a horror train
A freeze frame goin' to drive you insane
