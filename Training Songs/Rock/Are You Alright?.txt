Are you alright?
All the sudden you went away
Are you alright?
I hope you come back around someday
Are you alright?
I haven't seen you in a real long time
Are you alright?
Could you give me some kind of sign
Are you alright?
I looked around me and you were gone
Are you alright?
I feel like there must be something wrong
Are you alright?
'Cause it seems like you disappeared
Are you alright?
'Cause I been feeling a little scared
Are you alright?

[Chorus:]
Are you sleeping through the night?
Do you have someone to hold you tight?
Do you have someone to hang out with?
Do you have someone to hug and kiss you
Hug and kiss you,Hug and kiss you?
Are you alright?

Are you alright?
Is there something been bothering you?
Are you alright?
I wish you'd give me a little clue
Are you alright?
Is there something you wanna say?
Are you alright?
Just tell me that you're okay
Are you alright?
'Cause you took off without a word
Are you alright?
You flew away like a little bird.
Are you alright?
Is there anything I can do?
Are you alright?
'Cause I need to hear from you
Are you alright?

[Chorus:]

Are you alright?
Are you alright?
Hey...
