I can't stand the pain of love
When you get all the love
I can't stand the pain of life
I can't even stand the shock. 
But when I hear you say
That you will go away
And leave me someday
I can't stand itI can't stand it
I can't stand itI can't stand it
When you stand close to me
You makes me kind of weak
And when you hold me tight
My poor heart skips a beat
And when I hear you say
That you will go away
And leave me someday
I can't stand it 
When you're standin' close to me
You make me kinda weak
And when you hold me tight
My poor heart skips a beat
And when I hear you say
That you will go away
And leave me someday
I can't stand it
