On the street where you live
Girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint
A touch of sable in their eyes

All your life all you asked
When is your Daddy gonna talk to you
But we're living in another world
Tryin' to get your message through

No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

A different line every night
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets
Call me for a wild time

So you sit home alone
'Cause there's nothing left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows
Left there to look at you

You know she likes the lights
At night on the neon Broadway signs
And she don't really mind
It's only love she hoped to find

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
Now she wants a night away

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
Now she wants a night away
