Want to take a chance and dance before
I got to leave alone.

On short song and shell be gone
I wish her off was on
Gotta try, gotta try another way to get her
To come around to me.

Want to take a chance and dance before
I got to leave alone.

Let the music do the talking

Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking

There's just one more thing
I've gotta say
But, Ill explain a different way
You've gotta know I got an axe to grind
I know you won't mind

In your eyes I see the sky no question
Our hearts belong entwined
One last thing, our love
Is positively meant to be

Let the music do the talking

Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking

Want to take a chance and dance before
I got to leave alone.

On short song and shell be gone
I wish her off was on
Gotta try, gotta try another way to get her
To come around to me.

Want to take a chance and dance before
I got to leave alone.

Let the music do the talking

Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
Let the music do the talking
