How do I tell my baby
Momma's not coming home
How do I tell myself
I'll be staying alone
Oh, I can't stop crying
She'll say Daddy, I want to hold her
I want to see her again
Want to kiss her, want to touch her
Oh, what can I say
So do I
Oh Momma, I'm missing you real bad
But it don't do me no good
Sitting, thinking about what we had
 
[Chorus ]
Love don't stop
It goes on forever
Love don't stop
And it never will
Love don't stop
One day we'll be together
Love don't stop
And I'll sing this song to you someday
On heaven's highest hill
How am I gonna look into those big brown eyes
When she wakes up crying out in the middle of the night for Momma
How will I make it better
The house is full of people
But nobody's home
Everybody's here and I'm all alone
Calling out your name but there's no answer
Oh, Momma last night she told me not to cry
I swear I see you every time she smiles
 
[Chorus ]
I don't know if you hear me
Sometimes I like to think you do
All the things we been fighting for
I'm gonna make them all come true
And these arms they ache to hold you
And I know one day I will
I'll meet you in the tall grass
Up on heaven's highest hill
 
[Chorus ]
