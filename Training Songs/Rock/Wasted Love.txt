Careless love
Quit pouring honey in my ears
You're speaking diamonds crystal clear
So far away I want you near

Crying out for more
Just a little more
Tied down on the floor
Like a prisoner of war
Oh, I've been down so long
The day is nearly gone
I must carry on
With this wasted love

Careless love
There's more to say than should be said
Can't get these words straight in my head
You make me feel so powerless

I'm crying out for more
Just a little more
Tied down on the floor
Like a prisoner of war
Oh, I've been here so long
The day is nearly gone
I must carry on
With this wasted love

Wasted love
Wasted love

I'm crying out for more
Just a little more
Tied down to the floor
Like a prisoner of war
Oh, I've been here so long
The day is nearly gone
I must carry on
With this wasted love

Wasted love
Wasted love
