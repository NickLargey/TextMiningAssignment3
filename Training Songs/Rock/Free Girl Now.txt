I remember when you were his dog 
 I remember you under his thumb 
 Yeah baby, when he would call 
 Every time, you had to come 

 Hey, baby, you're a free girl now 
 Hey, baby, you're a free girl now 

 I remember when he was your boss 
 I remember him touching your butt 
 I remember you counting your blessings 
 Yeah honey, you had to keep your mouth shut 

 Hey baby, you're a free girl now 
 Yeah baby, you're a free girl now 

 Yeah, well all right 
 Honey, put your sugar down 
 Dazzle, dazzle the moon above 
 Lay your victim down 

 No longer will you be a slave 
 No longer will you have to crawl 
 No longer will you suffer 
 No longer will you stall 
 One day you'll live for a reason 
 One day you'll be gone, no more 
 When you walk from the table 
 No longer, will you bow down 

 Hey baby, you're a free girl now 
 Hey baby, you're a free girl now
