I suffer for my sanity every night
But I won't know
I forgot where I come from
The record spins with the beat of a
Vague fragility of my memories
Moving on into no direction moving on
Are you there all this time
Turn the pages over again
To another season to another year
What if I knew it all
And who killed who
Like I opened a box full of yesterday
You still haunt me
You were well hidden for all these
Years yet still you were there
All this time, on my fingers,
In my head
