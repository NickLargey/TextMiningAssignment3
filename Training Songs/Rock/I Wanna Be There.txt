Won't you let me catch your fall
Won't you let me land a hand
Those lonely eyes have seen it all
But love's too blind to understand

Cause you don't know what you have
Til your everything is gone
You need someone to show you how to live again

I wanna be there when you're feeling high
I wanna be there when you wanna die
I'm gonna to light your fire 
Gonna fuel your flame
I wanna be there when you go insane
I wanna be there when you're feeling down
And I'll be there when your head is spinnin' round
Gonna be you lover 
Gonna be your friend
I wanna be there til the end
You wouldn't know that I was there 
Cause I have been there all the time
And if I had my way I'd hold you in my arms
And leave the madness all behind

Cause you got so much to give 
But you throw it all away
And all you got to show for who you are is pain

And I've got so much to give
If you'd only let me in
I'm gonna take this time to show that I'm a friend
You'll believe in love again

I wanna be there in the pouring rain
I wanna be there when you call my name
I'm gonna light your fire
Gonna fuel your flame
I wanna be there when you go insane
I wanna be there when I'm outta town
And when your damn world is crashing down
I'm gonna be your lover 
Gonna be your friend
I wanna be there till the end
Cause you don't know what you have
Till your everything is gone
You need someone to show you how to love again

And I've got so much to give
If you'd only let me in
I'm gonna take the time to show you I'm a friend
You'll believe again

I wanna be there when your baby cries
I wanna be there when they tell you lies
I'm gonna light your fire 
Gonna fuel your flame
I wanna be there when you go insane
I wanna be there when your nights are long
And when you're feeling like you don't belong
Gonna be your lover
Gonna be your friend
Gonna be there til the end

I'm gonna be there in the morning
I'm gonna be there in the night
I'm gonna be there to make you strong when you're tired
I'm gonna be there when you want me
I wanna be there when you don't
Gonna be your lover 
Gonna be your friend
Gonna be there til the end.
