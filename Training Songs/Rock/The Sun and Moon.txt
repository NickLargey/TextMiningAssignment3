You're like the Sun and I'm the Moon
A mere reflection of your magnitude
A replica cast across the room
A remedy for your solitude

Because you are my Sun and I'm your Moon
I am the one without a name
You are the glue; I'm bonded to you

I can see through you like a two-way mirror

No man's tried the trials you've been through
I see behind your eyes the horror that haunts you
Hanging over your shoulder
Hanging over your shoulder

Who's that misfit sitting in the corner?
The things that kid did are cloistered like a coma
Hanging over your shoulder
Hanging over your shoulder

My flesh and blood? It can't be true
You're everything I could never be
I was no one, now I'm two
You're actually here acknowledging that I am the we that makes us complete

It sure has been a lapper's life, living in these shadows
No that's not quite right
It was an illustrious life, until you eclipsed my lustre

Who was there when you dined with Dionysus?
Who'd you think that was, nourishing your hubris?
Hanging over your shoulder
Hanging over your shoulder

Who was there, engorged in Gommorah?
Who'd you think that was, dancing in the sulphur?
Hanging over your shoulder
I was hanging over your shoulder, singing in your ear

You're like the Sun and I'm the Moon
You're like the Sun and I'm the Moon

Well, maybe I'm like the Sun and you're the Moon?
Nah, you're like the Sun and I'm the Moon
