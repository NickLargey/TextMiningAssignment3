Hey, Bill Bailey, don't look now but somebody's calling you
Who, why, your lady friend, that's who
If I were you, If I were you, I'd get my little old self home

Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home?
She moans the whole day long
I'll do the cooking, honey, I'll pay the rent
I know I done you wrong

Do you remember that rainy evening
I threw you out with nothing but a fine tooth comb
Yeah, I know I'm to blame, ain't it a shame
Bailey, won't you please come home
(A walk on home, Bill)

(Ah, like it like that)

(Hey, Bailey let's go on home one more time you hear)

Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home?
She moans the whole day long
I'll do the cooking, honey, I'll pay the rent
I know I done you wrong

Do you remember that rainy evening, ah
That I drove you out, with nothing but a fine tooth comb
(And you are bald)
I know I'm to blame, well ain't it a shame

Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come, ah
Bailey, won't you please come

Come on, baby, won't you please come
Yo baby, won't you please come
Baby, won't you please come
Baby, won't you please come
One more time
Oh, Bailey won't you please come home
(Get on home)
