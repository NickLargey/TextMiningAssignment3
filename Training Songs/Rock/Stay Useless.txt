Can I see what's going wrong with me
I used to have it all, now I'm alone
I never said, I'm better off this way
I need something to do, somewhere to go

I need time to stop moving
I need time to stay useless
I need time to stop moving
I need time to stay useless
I need time to stop moving
I need time to stay useless
I need time

Can I feel so utterly unreal
But nothing I could do would make things changes
I'm stuck in here and I'm tired of everywhere
I'm never going to learn to be alone

I need time to stop moving
I need time to stay useless
I need time to stop moving
I need time to stay useless
I need time to stop moving
I need time to stay useless
I need time

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I need time to stop moving
I need time to stay useless
I need time to stop moving
I need time to stay useless
I need time to stop moving
I need time to stay useless
I need time
