It's a Saturday night and on the lower East side
And the kids in from Queens have now taken their ride
Starlight in their eyes
Well they're sheek on the streets and they're struttin'
with pride
And their light on their feet as they hustle inside
They're all giggles and sighs

The club's hot and sweaty and heads start to stare
But nobody cares...It's their favorite band

But you, you're a loner heading out with the crowd
And everybody knows that it's kinda hard to get by
When you're so nervous and shy
You're just a loner heading out with the crowd
Looking for a love that could take you down with his
heart
On your night out
(On your...on your night out,
Night out
Night out
Night out
On your night out)

There's band posters all over the place
