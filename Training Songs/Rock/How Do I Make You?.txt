You're a doll, your eyes see all
How do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you wanna see me?

You're so young but your feelings are deep
But how do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you feel for me?

You put your head on my pillow and you're fast asleep
But how do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you dream about me?

Ooh, ooh baby
The world's a wall of ice
You're gonna need someone
To treat you warm and keep you nice

I like the way you dance, the way you spin
How do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you spin for me?

You put your head on my pillow and you're fast asleep
But how do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you dream about me?

Dream about me
Dream about me
Woo dream about me
Dream about me

Woo dream about me
Dream about me
Woo dream about me
Dream about me
