Ride on the storm I made. I glide on
The ashes of the sky. My blue raincoat
Makes me say 'no' today. Hey, when
Does weather ever change
Some finer day, say things go my
Way; some finer day, I'll play your
Sunshiny girl (irony!)
Ride the mercury with me see how
Unpredictable it feels. red this shelter
Where we fell to the ground found out
The weather never changed
Some finer day...I'll play your
Sunshiny girl...and brighten up my
World with sunflowers and book I have
Burned and see what you want me to
See and I'll be what you want me to
Be...
