Strugglin' in the streets just trying to survive
Searchin' for the truth is just keepin' us alive
Gotta break these shackles gotta break these chains
Said the only way we'll do it is if we use our brains
Said there's gotta be some meaning to the purpose of life
I know there must be more than the struggle and strife
Cause I'm looking for the answers and I need a clue
Cause my mind's so disturbed now what do I do?

Notice everywhere there's mass confusion and packs of lies
We gotta know!
We're starin' down our enemies in the eyes
We gotta know!
These are the days of the cheaters and the cheated
We gotta know!
But we're not gonna bend you know we won't be defeated
We gotta know!

Cause my minds so disturbed now
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

This planet's turnin' into a hell
And I figured out that things don't really look too well
Reactions coming they're already starting to show
But the question is who'll go with the flow
You know there's gonna, be a fight!
Cause somebody's always tryin' to keep ya,
From doing the right
There's always gonna be somebody
Comin' no matter where you go
So now you know why we gotta know,
We gotta now!!
