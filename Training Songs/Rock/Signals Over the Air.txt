This is what you see when you look in my direction:
Incandescent corsets draw eyes tight like wires.
This is how it feels,
Calling out but no one even hears

The signals that we send over the air
Over the air
Over the air
Over the air.

[Chorus]
When you say my name,
I want to split it from your lips
And hide like whispers in the rain.
When you say my name,
I want to stop it in your lungs
And collect all of your blood to put in the radio.

Is this how it feels
When you don't even fit into your own skin?
And its getting tighter,
Every day I'm getting smaller
If I keep holding my breath I'm going to disappear.

[Chorus]

There's no where to hide.
They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio.
There's no where to hide.
They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on.

If I keep holding my breath, all of this will fade away.
If you keep driving we'll be lying in the wreck.
Changing the shape,
Folding like an envelope to keep each other in.
Shattered glass, broken looks, and mascara gets
Washed away by windshield wiper blades.

[Chorus]

There's no where to hide.
They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio.
There's no where to hide.
They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio.
That's where we hide
The love and lies and sex, on the radio.
