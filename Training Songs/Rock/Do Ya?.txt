In this life I've seen
Everything I can see, woman
I've seen lovers flying
Through the air hand in hand
I've seen babies
Dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that came
From the heavenly skies above

I've seen old men crying
At their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting
Watching picture slides
But I never seen nothing like you

[Chorus]
Do ya, do ya want my love, woman
Do ya, do ya want my face, I need it
Do ya, do ya want my mind, I'm saying
Do ya, do ya want my love

Well, I heard the crowd
Singing out of tune
As they sat and sang Auld Lang Syne
By the light of the moon
I heard the preachers banging on the drums
And I heard the police
Playing with their guns
But I, I never heard nothing like you

In the country, where the sky
Touches down on the field
She lay her down to rest
In the morning sun
They come a running just to get a look
Just to feel, to touch her long black hair
They don't give a damn

But, I, I, I never seen nothing like you

[Chorus]

Well, I think you know
What I'm trying to say, woman
That is I'd like to
Save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of the world to know
That I've got to get it all
To get it all to grow

Do ya, do ya want my love, come on now
Do ya, do ya want my face, I need it
Do ya, do ya want my mind, alright now
Do ya, do ya want my love

Ah, look out
Do ya, do ya want my love
Do ya, do ya want my love, oh oh
