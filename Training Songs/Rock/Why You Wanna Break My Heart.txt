Sometimes we got lost in love
Sometimes we got lost in our lives
But I, I didn't want to lose you
Maybe it's not in the cards
Why'd you let me down so hard?
When all I ever wanted was to love you

Chorus:
Why you wanna break me heart?
Oooo
x4

Sometimes what seems wrong seems so right
Sometimes when we shouldn't we might
But all I ever wanted was you
Cause when I held you last
Our love could you forget so fast
There's a little bit of you in everything that I do

Chorus

And I wanna tell you about me
I asked you to stay, still you leave
Well I may look lonely and blue
But I been here waiting for you
And I, I want an answer or two

Chorus till fade
