Gonna start dressing
Finer things
Maybe just nothing
Maybe just a dream

You are gonna find him one day knockin¹ at your door
He¹s not the hero any more
He says baby don¹t you want me in your life
You tell him what is wrong, not right 

Don¹t She La
Don¹t she look happy
Don¹t She La
Don¹t she look happy 

Gonna start living
Fantasy
Maybe just nothing
Maybe just a dream 

Fire in the blue sky when he hits you in the mouth
This the war and not the warning
He says baby I love you won¹t you stay
You say good-bye to him too late 

Don¹t She La
Don¹t she look happy
Don¹t She La
Don¹t she look happy
Don¹t she look happy now

That he¹s gone away from here
He¹s gone away he died they say an awful way
It was attack of the heart 
You have started something big

By cuttin¹ through the man
There was a sign you heard a calling
He says baby I don¹t want to die today
You say so long man it¹s too late
