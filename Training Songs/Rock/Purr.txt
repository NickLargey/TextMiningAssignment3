Wa-hoo!

I love you baby 'cause you're back in time
I love you today
Your eyes are flashing like a magic sign
The sun comes out to play

I learned it all from you, girl
I got it all from you
How to howl at the moon, yeah
And how to scratch your dog
I do it every day
Come back again tomorrow
You chased it all away

A dreaming beauty sleeping day and night
The sun around you
I love you baby yeah, you're superfine
A-claw me down, too
A purring, whirring, fuzzy like today
Switching sunlight
I chase you kitten, catch you every time
Funny how it flies

I learned it all from you, girl
I got it all from you
How to howl at the moon, yeah
And how to scratch your dog
I do it every day
Come back again tomorrow
You chase the life away

I hear you purring through a supersoul
I puff into it
A puss in leather, yeah a prince in gold
A leather tale away

I learned it all from you, girl
I got it all from you
How to howl at the moon, yeah
And how to scratch your dog
I do it every day
Come back again tomorrow
You chase the life away
