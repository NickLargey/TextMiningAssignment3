In my home and on my couch
Lies a girl she's oh so dull
I've tried to ask her where she's from 
She doesn't remember 
No she doesn't care
She wears my clothes 
And laughs at her own jokes
She writes silly poems in my palms
She drinks my wine
And spits on my floor 
Cuts her toenails in my bed
Though I hate her
I have to confess
I am envious
I am jealous
She love to cry
To Ricki Lake
She orders pizza 
And let's me pay
Her topless lifestyle's
Just too much
But without me
She just couldn't be
I'm her best friend
She always says 
Though she keeps forgetting
My real name
I must hate her
But I must admit
She is something I wish I were
