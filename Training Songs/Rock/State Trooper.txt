New Jersey turnpike
Riding on a wet night
'Neath the refinery's glow
Down where the great black river flow

Licence, registration:
I ain't got none
But I got a clear conscience
'Bout the things that I done

Mister State Trooper
Please don't stop me
Please don't stop me
Please don't stop me

Maybe you got a kid
Maybe you got a pretty wife
The only thing that I got's
Been bugging me my whole life

Mister State Trooper
Please don't stop me
Please don't stop me
Please don't ya stop me

Well, in the wee wee hours
Your mind gets hazy
Radio relay towers
Gonna lead me to my baby

Radio's jammed up
With talk show stations
It's just talk, talk, talk, talk
'Til you lose your patience

Mister State Trooper
Please don't stop me
Please don't stop me
Please don't ya stop me

Hey, somebody out there
Listen to my last prayer,
Heigh-ho Silver oh,
Deliver me from nowhere
