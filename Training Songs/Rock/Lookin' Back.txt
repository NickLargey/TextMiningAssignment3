Lookin' back over my life
I can see where, where I caused you strife
But I know, oh yes, I know
I'd never make that same mistake again

Lookin' back over my deeds
I can see signs that a wise man needs
Oh, if I had just one more chance
I'd know I'd never make that same mistake again

Once my cup was overflowin'
But I, I gave nothin' in return
But I can't, I can't begin to tell you
What a lesson, what a lesson I have learned

Lookin' back over the slate
I can see love as it turns to hate
But I know, oh yes, I know
I know I'd never make that same mistake again
