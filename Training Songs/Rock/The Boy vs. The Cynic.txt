I tried to communicate, I tried to relate
Now all I want to do is escape and vanish into fantasies
I ventured out of the galaxy into the outer regions
Where folks believe in something
Much, much bigger than their demons

And aren't controlled by their circumstances
Sounds romantic, we'll dance with it slowly
In here my failures don't control me
It's a place of solitude but I'm not lonely
And it's beautiful but let's be reasonable

It's just not real, it just plays with your imagination
And for a moment or two can make time stand still
But when it's over, all you have is a memory
I had to leave 'cause the real world was calling me
I left my youth in pursuit of the truth
And gained a world of dishonesty

I see your innocence and envy it
I reminisce of mine and remember it
Full of peace full of hope full of truth
I remember when I used to be you before you became me

I see your innocence and envy it
I reminisce of mine and remember it
Full of peace full of hope full of truth
I remember when I used to be you before you became me

Man, it's sort of overwhelming
It didn't seem like I was storytelling
But you didn't believe me when I told you that I could see
My hopes and dreams come alive as it seems

But there's a time and place for everything
Well, I left my imagination there
Now it's only what I can touch, see, taste and hear
With my natural senses, I wish I could stretch the limits

But my defenses keep me limited from the boundaries I set
So I won't get burned again
Sure, I'd like to be optimistic but that doesn't line up well with reality
So I'll go to sleep now and dream of a younger healthier better me

I see your innocence and envy it
I reminisce of mine and remember it
Full of peace full of hope full of truth
I remember when I used to be you before you became me

I see your innocence and envy it
I reminisce of mine and remember it
Full of peace full of hope full of truth
I remember when I used to be you before you became me

Don't mistake innocence for ignorance
Don't mistake purity for inexperience
Don't mistake humility for weakness
I sincerely mean this

You understand more than you know
There's no goal like peace of mind
So what else are you trying to find
What's left except regret and heartache

And yes, your heart will break and go numb
Lots of times before this life is done
You'll look for answers but there's just one
Patience, one day it will make sense

But waiting is a pinch waking you up
From the worlds you've made up
The one where you dream
And the one where you gave up time
To create a new atmosphere where
The boy and the cynic can both play fair
