You call us hypocrites
Your wrong
Been trying to put us down
For too long
I'm tired of your negative ways
Muscle head
We'll fall on better days
Straight ahead
Don't you mind the fool
Who tries and tries
He wants to cut you down
To his size
Keep your head up high
Guard your grill
Believe in yourself
No one else will
Break the walls...
That are in your mind
Don't let them pull you down
No more wasting time
It's hard to see life through...
Bruised black eyes
Keep pushing for your best...
Straight ahead
