Somehow you came out fighting, somehow it turned out good.
This must be the happy ending, I believed would come

The American Adventure
Brought you closer to the end.

I wouldn't like to fly today,
Look at the clouds.
A year ago you ran away,
Look at you now.

Do you see it's all because of you, now?
Do you know it's all because of you, yeah?

Never was I one to step out of line,
Don't put it down to a need to belong.
I'll give you seven reasons why you need to get a grip.

And always be the one that you talk about,
But never understand why it hurt so bad.
I'll give you seven reasons why you need to get grip

But it's too late for that;
To have hope, to be saved.
You won't.
