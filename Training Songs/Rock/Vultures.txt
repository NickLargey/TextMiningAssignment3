Wait, i'm just as shallow
Disappointed in a youth for being hollow

Yeah, well the vultures rule the world
Yeah, well your money don't hold it's worth

Time, throws
Come on Plebeian prove your worth
Time shows
Come on plebeian prove your worth

Take, all your little follies
and turn it into views where we console it

Waste every little prophet
by saving it away and drooling on it
