Coming out I'm deep in doubt I'll meet you
Calling out it's always with a stare
I can't give you less than what I mean to
I'll pretend that I don't see you, baby

I wanna know
I wanna go
I'm all alone
I wanna know

You place a friend I'm overwhelmed I need to
Fear is good you understood it wrong
Box is overflowing and I see you
Feeling is I can't be friends for long

I wanna know
I wanna go
I'm all alone
I wanna know

I know it, I know it for sure
I'll blow it, I know it, it's her
Did I show you a compass of ?
I'll know it
I'll know it

I wanna know
I wanna go
I'm all alone
I wanna know

Calling out
Come and take it back and you know where
Call your friends, it all depends on me to
Call me back get on track I swear

I wanna know
I wanna know
