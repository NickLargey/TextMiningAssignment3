Long before a time and far away
There was a bang in the night and a flash
You couldn't see through
Things remained the same, even pourin' rain
Falling down from the sky, givin' something, new to you

Along came a time, and the world was new
Peace and harmony they got no enemy
The first step of a man - the balance was gone
Sad days for a child, singin' a song for you, just for you

You are the target of your fate
And you ain't got time to wait, no

Starin' eyes- starin' with desire
Starin' eyes
Those starin' eyes - they won't see tomorrow
Starin' eyes

Starin' eyes- starin' with desire
Starin' eyes
Those starin' eyes - they won't see tomorrow
Starin' eyes
