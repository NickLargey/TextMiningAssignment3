Want your body
Want your mind
Live together
Both unwind
Love is what we need to say
Live together anyway

When you say hello
But you mean goodbye
When you're lying awake
Go ahead and cry
When you know in your heart
That they'll tear us apart
I love you

Want your body
Want your mind
Why are people so unkind
Never listen to what they say
Turn your head and look away

When you say hello
But you mean goodbye
When you're lying awake
Go ahead and cry
When your closin' the door
Don't you look back for more
I love you
Oo, oo, ah. Oo do do do, do do do, do, oo.

Want your body
Want your mind
Live in sin
Let's both entwine
Love is what we need to say
Live together anyway

When you say hello
But you mean goodbye
When you're lying awake
Go ahead and cry
When your closing the door
Don't you look back for more
I love you
