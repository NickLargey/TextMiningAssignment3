Never felt bad lending a hand
I think you hoped i wouldn't be in a band
Broken ashtray i can always replace
I kick the door then i spit in you face

You are not my friend
Never ever again

Dream of sunsets with a drink the in sand
Of all my friends and losing money in the van
Remember holidays that weren't such a waste
And a broken jaw from a punch in the face

Picture perfect with a frame that pretends 
To be a martyr for a cause with no end 
I was thinking that you needed a break
What i meant was every bone in your face
A mental photo of discoloured eyes
Of dirty carpets and moistened thighs
These recollections i will keep to the end
I'm sure it's wrong that you were never my friend
