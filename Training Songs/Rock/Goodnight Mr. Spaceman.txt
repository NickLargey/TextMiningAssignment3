Well they gave me amytriptiline
They fed me pseudochlorophine
It helped me sleep
But I felt so deep
And most of the time I wanted to weep

The days seemed black just like the night
A big long tunnel without lights
Where everything's dark then everything's bright

Oh, the train's gone past my station
Oh bloody hell I wish I'd signed to Creation

Singing goodnight Jowe, goodnight Dan
Goodnight Mr. Spaceman

Goodnight Mr. Spaceman

Well I think I'll die of a broken heart
If my record doesn't make the indie charts
I'll do anything
I'll swallow my pride
Commit artistic suicide

And I dig St. Etienne, Denim and Suede
And naturally I go to the occasional rave
But when I was young it was Wizzard and Slade

Oh, this record is sponsored by Pepsi
I've taken three e's I still can't dance like Bobby Gillespie
And maybe...

Singing goodnight Jowe, goodnight Dan
Goodnight Mr. Spaceman
Goodnight Mr. Spaceman

And I like to walk around the town
With my trousers halfway down
And I often feel like Edvard Munch
If my analyst calls I'm out to lunch

Singing goodnight Jowe, goodnight Dan
Goodnight Mr. Spaceman
Goodnight Mr. Spaceman

[What's a nice alien like you doing in a place like this?]

Goodnight Jowe, goodnight Dan
Goodnight Mr. Spaceman
Goodnight Mr. Spaceman

Goodnight Jowe, goodnight Dan
Goodnight Mr. Spaceman
Goodnight Mr. Spaceman

[This is Planet Earth]

Goodnight Jowe, goodnight Dan

I'm off my face
