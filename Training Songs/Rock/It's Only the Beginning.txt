I like the way that you took advantage
Stayed at my party 'til everyone went home
A perfect stranger
Need a place to lay your hat
The lone ranger couldn't saddle me with that
But you were right on track
It's only the beginning
But I've already gone and lost my mind
I feel like making daisy chains
And playing hide'n' seek
When it's only the beginning
The fairy dust is still in flight
And this could be the love of a lifetime even if it lasts a week
Or maybe just a daydream
When we go walking along the river
Watch the old men fishing the sunny side of the pier
It's like a movie and you're my leading man
The way you woo me just like Cary Grant
You want to hold my hand
It's only the beginning
But I've already gone and lost my mind
I feel like breaking window panes all up and down my street
When it's only the beginning
We can bring the house down every night
And this could be the love of a lifetime even if it lasts a week
Or just the sweetest daydream
And do you ever feel the passion
To jump from a speeding train
I'd like to be the wheels beneath you
I'd like to be the rain
That could wash away your pain
It's only
So hold me closer
Let me feel you sigh
My Spanish butterfly
It's only the beginning
But I've already gone and lost my mind
I feel like breaking window panes all up and down my street
Any day now I will hear you call
And this could be the love of a lifetime even if it lasts a week
