You've got a loaded imagination
Uncovering investigations
And I like that
You were born on another planet
In words of the man I think you have it,
And I want some

Well every time I try to call you on the telephone
I'm full of sadness when I know that you're not there
Another star appears high in the heavens and I guess I don't care

Imagination
Uncovering a Watergate investigation,
That's good
You were born on another planet,
In the words of the man you have it,
And I think I'd like some.

Well every time I try to call you on the telephone etc.
I keep, calling calling can't get the number
My garden's full of green vegetation
And underneath the greenfly I think something's
Growing there 
You were born on another planet
In the words of the book I think you've read it,
I want some.

Well every time I try to call you on the telephone etc.
I can't reach that number, I keep calling.
