I was born a travellin' man, that's all I'll ever be
Moving around from town to town, it's what makes me so free
My father was a trucker for the years since '23
On the day that I was born his blood was left to me

I'm the travellin' man
Travellin' man, that's what I am
Travellin' man
Travellin' man, that's what I am

Travellin' man, that's what I am, no one puts a hold on me
You'll see me once or maybe twice, that's all you'll see of me
All you pretty women Lord, I hope you understand
Don't be a fool and fall in love, put your heart in a travellin' man

I'm the travellin' man
Travellin' man
Travellin' man
Travellin' man

Travellin' man, that's what I am
Guess I'll always be
Travellin' man, that's what I am
But at least I am free
I'm a traveller

Travellin' man
Oh, that's what I am

Travellin man, that's what I am, Lord, I move so fast
I have had so many women, none of them have last
I am just a mover, movin' fast as sound
Always free, sometimes lonely, always movin' around

I'm the travellin' man
Travellin' man
Travellin' man
Travellin' man
Oh, that's what I am
Travellin' man
