Well, tried to be your paper boy
Tried to be your boy scout
Tried to be your ice cream man
Well, I could not be your soldier
Or even drive your bus
My skills were always inobvious

But I hope you understand
I'm doing the best I can
I ain't no perfect man
But Sam I am

I'm a bad-talking fighter
A silver bullet biter
A flip-flop slider
And guitar moonlighter
I'm your groovy all-nighter
Your holy ghost rider
Pale of shade whiter 
I'm your rock and roll driver, yeah
Oh yeah, that's all I am

Yeah, I tried to be your oil man
Tried to be your big boss
Tried to be your broker 
But you took the loss
It's just a hopeless case
And I ain't no lawyer
I only got a few tricks 
I can show ya

And I hope you understand
I'm doing the best I can
I ain't no Superman
But Sam I am

And I'm a feel good doctor
Big bad talker
After midnight walker
Sittin on the bay docker
I'm a sunshine stalker
Oh daddy, weight watcher
Heaven's door knocker
Blue, white, and Red Rocker
Oh yeah, oh yeah, that's all I am

I tried to be everything to you
Yeah, but it would not do
You're nothing on my resume
But I can rock you
And roll you each and every day

Have mercy on me
I am not sorry
Believe me, it's easy

I'm doing my best to be a
Straight shot shooter
A bad motor scooter
Sunny honeymooner
Your heavy metal crooner
Make you wanna holler
Shirt with no collar
Just a couple inches taller
White, blue, and Red Rocker
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I said yeah, yeah, yeah
That's all I am
That's all I am
Baby, baby, baby
Sam I am
