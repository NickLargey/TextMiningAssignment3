Those school girl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will live on and on
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayon to perfume?
It isn't easy but I'll try

If you wanted the sky I will write across the sky
Letters that will soar a thousand feet high
To sir with love

The time has come for closing books
And long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong
That's a lot to know
What can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon I will try to make the stars lie
But I'd rather you let me give my heart
To sir with love
If you wanted the sky I will write across the sky
Letters that will soar a thousand feet high
To sir with love
