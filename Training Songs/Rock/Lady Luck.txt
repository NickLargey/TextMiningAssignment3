You can break a mirror
Light three on a match
Walk under a ladder
Kick a black cat
Try your luck in Vegas
Shoot nothing but craps
But I'll gamble on my lady
When my luck's running bad.

[Chorus]
Cause she's my lady luck
She must have come
From heaven above
Now she's my lady luck
My good luck charm
A winner at love.

Spin the wheel of fortune
Look for your pot of gold
Try to make the clock turn back
And never get old
Rolling seven's and eleven's
'Till the dice grow cold
But I'll always be a winner
With the luck that I hold.

[Chorus]

You can break a mirror
Light three on a match
Walk under a ladder
Kick a black cat
Try your luck in Vegas
Shoot nothing but craps
But I'll gamble on my lady
When my luck's running bad.

[Chorus:Repeat x4]
