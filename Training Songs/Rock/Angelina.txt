Lost in the sound of the city like a shadow in the rain.
Memories come back to haunt me and I still feel the pain.
Some days are better than others but the nights remain. 
I sit and watch the dawn breaking and I whisper your name.
Angeline, you're living proof, it's not the way it seems.
Angeline now I can only hold you in my dreams.
Words left unspoken and hearts are broken in two shades of blue.
I should have seen it coming like a silent scream 
I felt a cold chill when I heard the message on the answering machine.
Angeline, the love I have for you still lingers on.
Angeline, you never know what you got till it's gone.
Angeline.
