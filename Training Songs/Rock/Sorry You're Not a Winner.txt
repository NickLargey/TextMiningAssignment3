Scratch card glory
Waist low pleasure
Black eyes, nose bleed
Don't look back now
My white abode do you remember?
But it's such a thrill just to find out

Sorry you're not a winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got to loose
But false intentions and a life so pretentious?

Scratch card glory, waist low pleasure
Black eyes nose bleeds, don't look back now
My white abode, do you remember?
I sweat I ache

Sorry you're not a winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got to loose
But false intentions and a life so pretentious?

What?-What?-What?
Goodbye, Your world, is.
