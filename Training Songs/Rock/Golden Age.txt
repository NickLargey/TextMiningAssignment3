Once a book attracted
My attention not too long ago
It said the future would reveal a way
The reading book which pleasured me
Reflected days we dream about
And now it seems those days are drawing near

And have you seen the order
And the parting of the older ways
The sky has never been so high before
The minstrel tunes his pleasure songs
The sounds proclaiming the new age
It's time the news was free for all to hear

Have you seen the order
And the coming of the golden age
When all our hearts
Will know the everlasting days
Love will pour throughout the land
As never known before
The meeting of the ways

Is the dawn
Is the dawning of the golden age

You and me time feeling
In the morning light
Getting it together
Does it feel right?

Let us be together
In the morning light
Let us be together
In the dawning light

Let it through
Let it through
Let it through

Have you seen the glory
And the coming of the golden age
When all our hearts
Will know the everlasting days
Love will pour throughout the land
As never known before
The meeting of the ways

On this day
On this day of days

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la our ? is
Falling
