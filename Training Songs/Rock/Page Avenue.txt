I still recall every summer night
Like it was yesterday
The time would never end
And my friends were family
Nothing mattered more
Than the loyalty we had
Now I'm a world away from everything we shared

I had something better
Waiting ahead
I try to take control of my heart
I had something better
But I'll tear it down and I'll tape it up
By my own design I fall

Bring back the days
Three story parking lot
The air is never dry
As the city falls asleep, days bleed into the night

The tables set the stage
For a life of memories
But I'm a world away from everything

I had something better
Waiting ahead
I try to take control of my heart
I had something better
But I'll tear it down and I'll tape it up
By my own design I fall
Apart as time passes by
I fall apart but the memories never die

And I still recall every summer night
It seems like yesterday but I'm still a world away

I had something better
Waiting ahead
I try to take control of my heart
I had something better
But I'll tear it down and I'll tape it up
By my own design I fall
