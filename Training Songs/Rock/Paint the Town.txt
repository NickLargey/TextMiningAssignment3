6:15, it's almost time to go out
I cut myself shaving,
toothpaste on my mouth
Isn't that the way we paint the town
I can't find a shirt,
man I need some new clothes
Tuck in the stain and no one will know
Isn't that the way we paint the town
Long enough to say we saw
the sun come up
The Songs we sing will sooth our suffering
Stumbling DJ, play it one more time
8 o'clock sharp
you were gonna pick me up
But your car broke down
Now you need a tow truck
Isn't that the way we paint the town
10:45 you pick me up on your bike
In a three-piece suit everybody looks twice
Isn't that the way we paint the town
Long enough to say we saw
the sun come up
The Songs we sing will sooth our suffering
Stumbling DJ, play it one more time
Late for the party everybody's crashed out
You got nine on the floor,
you got four on the couch
Isn't that the way we paint the town
We're like two stray dogs
sitting on the front steps
Sipping up the last drop
of night that's left
Isn't that the way we paint the town?
Long enough to say we saw
the sun come up
The Songs we sing will sooth our suffering
Stumbling DJ, play it one more time
Long enough to say we saw
the sun come up
The Songs we sing will sooth our suffering
Stumbling DJ, play it one more time
