Scotty doesn't know that Fiona and me 
Do it in my van every Sunday
She tells him she's in church but
She doesn't go
Still she's on her knees and
Scotty doesn't know

Oh Scotty doesn't know oh
So don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
(So don't tell Scotty!)

Fiona says she's out shoppin'
But she's under me
And I'm not stoppin' 'cause

Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
So don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know ph
(Don't tell Scotty!)

I can't believe he's so trustin'
While I'm right behind you thrustin'
Fiona's got him on the phone
And she's tryin' not to moan
It's a three way call
And he knows nothin', nothin'

Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Don't tell Scotty 'cause
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know oh

So don't tell Scotty
We'll put on a show
Everyone'll go
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know oh

The parking lot, why not
It's so cool when you're on top
His front lawn, in the snow
Life is so hard 'cause
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know

I did her on his birthday
Scotty doesn't know

Gonna tell him myself
