I'm not going out tonight 'cause I don't want to go
I am staying at home tonight 'cause I don't want to know
You revealed a world to me and I would never be
Dwelling in it's happiness, your gift on purity

Eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee,oh, eh-ee-oh
Eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee,oh, eh-ee-oh

Ahh, you and me it will always be
You and me forever be
Eternally it will always be you and me

I don't pay attention to the ones who never cared
Find your own direction 'cause there's sweetness in the air
You will be the world to me and I will always be
Dwelling in this happiness, your gift of purity

Eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee,oh, eh-ee-oh
Eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee,oh, eh-ee-oh

Ahh, you and me it will always be
You and me forever be
Eternally it will always be
You and me

Always be you and me
Forever be, eternally
It will always be you and me
Forever be, eternally
