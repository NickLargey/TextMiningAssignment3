I thought I could find the kind of girl
Who'd think that I was the only guy in the world
No more half-hearted kisses, oh that's bad enough
Oh-oh-oh, no more teardrops, no one-way love

One-way love
Don't look for someone who likes to love fast
You know that that kind of love will never last
If she's fast and furious, oh that can be tough

Oh-oh-oh, no more teardrops, no one-way love
One-way love
Well, there are girls who like to cheat and flirt
Those kind of girls are worst of all

How they lie, you know how they hurt
Take it from me I know what I say
I'll find me a girl who don't like to play
The game of heartbreak, well that's mighty rough

Oh-oh-oh, no more teardrops no one-way love
One-way love
One way love... [To fade]
