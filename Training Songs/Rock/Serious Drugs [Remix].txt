I said I don't think I can take it much longer
She said maybe your tabloid should be stronger
Get some serious drugs
Get some serious drugs
Toytown medicine don't make a change
If you want your head rearranged
Get some serious drugs
Get some serious drugs

The trouble with me
I can't give in you see
The trouble with me
I can't give in you see

I'd cut off my hair if you want me to
I'd cut off a finger if it'd get me
Your serious love
I've got serious love
I said I don't think I can much longer
She said maybe your tabloid should be stronger
Get some serious drugs
Get some serious drugs

The trouble with me
I can't give in you see
The trouble with me
I can't give in you see
