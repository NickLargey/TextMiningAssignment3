Oh now mama, could you bend your ear for just a tiny minute?
I’m afraid I’m goin crazy again, could you spare me a little perspective?
See, I’m having all these visions, ma, but I don’t want you to worry
And there’s this girl that I must’ve been wild about in some long-distance point in my history

And I saw her last night with a handsome young man
She was glowing to me, is she glowing to him?
And mama she was famous in my dreams

And on a good night, can you keep a secret in the low light?
Where heaven meets the ocean, I will find you in a dream
In between the needles and the pins
Where you and I go walkin’ in our sleep

And I don’t mind, the empty hours, I’m learning to sit with my demons
Been itching to write up this book again, but it’s so hard explaining the fevers
I’m workin’ to live with the livin’, ma, 'cause I spent too many years running
And I just want to find somebody designed with the same old electricity humming

And I saw her last night with a handsome young man
She was perfect to me, is she perfect to him?
And mama she was famous in my dreams

And on a good night, can you keep a secret in the low light?
Where heaven meets the ocean, I will find you in a dream
In between the needles and the pins
Where you and I go walkin’ in our sleep
Where you and I go walkin’ in our sleep

If you see her, say I'm waitin' on the fireworks
I’m waitin' on this sunbird, I’m waitin' on the fireworks

And on a good night, well can you keep a secret in the low light?
Where heaven meets the ocean, I will find you in a dream
Yes, I will find you in a dream

And on a good night, can you keep a secret in the low light?
Where heaven meets the ocean, I will find you in a dream
In between the needles and the pins
Where you and I go walkin’ in our sleep
Where you and I go walkin’ in our sleep

Honey, ain’t this life, woah
Honey, ain’t this life a pretty little dream?
Honey, ain’t this life a pretty little dream?
