Lost and alone but I still keep proceeding on
No sense of time, I don't even know where I'm goin'
I begin to get breathless and my heart, it keeps beating faster
I know I just can't take this, how much longer now?

I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready to explode
Spark out the fire, light up the fuse, I'm letting go
I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready to explode
Don't hold me down now, I'm just about to overload

Time's running out, feel I'm walking upon a wire
Heading to the edge and I'm starting to lose my mind
I begin to get breathless and my heart, it keeps beating faster
I know I just can't take this, how much longer now?

I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready to explode
Spark out the fire, light up the fuse, I'm letting go
I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready to explode
Don't hold me down now, I'm just about to overload
