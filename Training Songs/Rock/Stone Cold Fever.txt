Oh! Stone cold fever, yerr! 
So hard to see
I've got trouble in my back bone
Since that lonesome day
Oh! Yerr!

Tried too hard, I heard you speak
Somethings wrong, only me
I've been washed, as long as my hair
What do I do? If it ain't no dream nightmare
Yerr!
Yerr! One, Two, Yerr! One, Two.
