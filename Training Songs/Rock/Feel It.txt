Luck has been on your side, boy
And life is what you made it
As you've done what you can do
People say, people say that your the only one

Time keeps slipping through the hour glass
You're living in the future, boy
But there something inside
Something to hide in too much pride
Maybe you cried, wondering why

You know you've got to feel it
Feel it over you, under you

Talking to your little sister now
Tell her how you turned to liquid love
Don't get beaten by the tide, boy
You've got so much to give of yourself

Some of the things you said
Been living in your head you know
And what you feel are just trade marks of your suffering
But you're looking for a reason for everything
'Coz you know that there has to be something in

Every little thing that you're
Feeling, feeling, feeling, over you

Voices on your shoulder
Pounding in your temple
Like a bullet in your head
Waiting for release

Your simplistic measures
Your holistic treasures
What you want and what you need
What you feel in your dreams

Been around and fought a lot of wars
Before you could walk, yeah
But then again you walked
A lot of miles before you could talk
And now you know that you feel it

What you gonna, ohh
Can you, can you feel it, feel it, feel it over you? Ohh
Can you, can you feel it, feel it, feel it over you?
Can you, can you feel it, feel it, feel it over you?
Can you, can you feel it
