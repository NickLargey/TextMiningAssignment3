Saw you on the corner by the cash machine
You made the cutest couple that I ever did see
You're hugging and you're kissing and I'm hearing what you're saying
Brit and your juncture's not the place for me

what's he got that I haven't got?
Where's he been that I've never seen?
I can't bear to see you walking hand in hand
He's kinda cool but I don't understand
What in the world has he got?
I guess he's just better looking than me

Got a brown leather jacket on ad bright blue jeans
Wears a pair of black Beatle boots just like me
He's got a lot of hair on his face and his head
So why'd I get my haircut so short instead?
