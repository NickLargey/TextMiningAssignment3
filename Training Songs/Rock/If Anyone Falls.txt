I hear a voice in the room next to mine
Feels good sounds good
Closes the door from behind
And another voice comes through the door

I am dealing with a man
When away from me stays deep inside my heart
And he says if anyone falls in love
It will be one of us

If anyone falls in love
Somewhere in the twilight dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind
If anyone falls 

And I heard someone say
As my eyes turned away
He said I have loved many women
I have many times run away

Ooh I have never known the words
Well I have tried to be true
Well I have never known what to say
How to say seen anything today
Never seen anything like you

If anyone falls in love
Somewhere in the twilight dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind
If anyone falls

So I'm never gonna see you
Never gonna see you deep inside my heart
Oh I see your shadow against
Shadow against shadow against the wall
Baby I see your shadow against the wall
