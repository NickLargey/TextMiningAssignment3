In my head
I have dreams
I have visions of many things
Questions longings in my mind

Pictures fill my head
I feel so trapped instead
But trapped doesn't seem so bad
Cause you are here

It doesn't mean anything
Without you here with me
And I can try to justify
But I still need you here with me

In my heart I had hope
Built on dreams I'll never know
Answers to love left behind
Visions filled my head

I felt so trapped instead
But trapped didn't seem so bad
Cause you were near

It doesn't mean anything
Without you here with me
And I can try to justify
But I still need you here with me

I can't do anything without you
You give me strength to do anything
And I can't be everything I try to
You saved me from the everything I couldn't be

It doesn't mean anything
Without you here with me
And I can try to justify
But I still need you here with me

Need you here with me
I need you here with me
