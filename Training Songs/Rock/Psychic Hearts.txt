I know you had a fucked up life
Growing up in a stupid town
Your mother was a mixed up jerk,
And your father he just fucked around
A little too much for his own good
I'll kill the bastard if I could
I'll kill all the boys with their fucked-up noise
And all the bullshit they seem to enjoy
The kids at school
Called you slut
Nothing but
What the f*ck are they into
The stupid fools
Losers assholes suck all the luck
Out of the world the world for you
If I can get it back to you I will,
And kick their asses all over town
All over town I'll turn it over
I don't even know you that well
What the hell, summer spell

What's it like
Going out
And no one knows what you're about
Abused and used and cut in two
By hollow men with nothing to do
Laugh all the time try to get high
Try to hide behind no lie

They fucked your head up
That's for sure
Your heart is ripped now wrapped in fur
But you know that sex is pretty insane
And magic seems to kill the pain
And the things that go on inside your brain
Make you seem to think that you're to blame
Don't think about it, throw it out
Love 'em all and say it loud
Fight the scumbags that slap you around
Scream your crazy lost and found
We don't have to tell you what is right
We have all the faith it was not right

Sadness is and sadness was,
And sadness will always be because
Comfort comes around from the strangest of men

I got no time for sad songs, baby
Don't need you to say I'm crazy
Stick your tongue and you look at me
And I will bite it off you see
Push you down onto your knees
Do you laugh away the sleaze

You're not the only girl in town
But you're the only one that's got me down
Psychic hearts go out to you
A psychic heart go right to you

My prayer to you
Is that you do all the things you set out to do
Live your life the way you love
But will you remember one thing for me
I will always love you
I will always love you
