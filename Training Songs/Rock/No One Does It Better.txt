I woke up this morning with a grudge the size of your story
Oh, I feel, I feel so low
Let me start at the end, the part I haven't figured out yet
Yes, I am, I'm moving slow

You are playing the lead
The headache that my actions feed
Oh I've only got myself to blame
Here's another test which I would fail, and at my best
Oh, always ending the same

If I were an honest guy
I'd give this world another try

What are we doing?
I was so in love with you
I've forgot what I wanted to say
What are we doing?
You will change your ways in time, in time

If I just saved you, you could save me too
If I just saved you, then you could save me too

I woke up the next morning and I didn't see it coming
Oh, your bags were packed and gone
I called all your friends and they said hadn't seen you yet
Oh, my head's going to explode

If I were an honest guy
I'd give this world another try

What are we doing?
I was so in love with you
I've forgot what I wanted to say
What are we doing?
You will change your ways in time, in time

If I just saved you, you could save me too
If I just saved you, you could save, you could save me too

I believe in the finer things, and you don't believe in me
I said, I believe in the finer things, and you don't believe in me
I said, I believe in the finer things, and you don't

If I just saved you, you could save me too
If I just saved you, then you could save, you could save me too

What are we doing?
I was so in love with you
I've forgot what I wanted to say
What are we doing?
I was so in love with you
I've forgot what I wanted to say

If I just saved you
No one does it better,
No one does it better,
No one does it,
No one does it better
If I just saved you
No one does it,
No one does it better,
No one does it,
No one does it)

I woke up this morning with a grudge the size of your story,
Which now I have told you all
