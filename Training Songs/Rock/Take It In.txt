I know it's none of my business what you do
But you don't have a clue
He's just a friend but he's got it out for you
I thought I should tell you 

Hold this close to your chest, no one can know
He won't let his feelings show
He keeps them under wraps, although
They would love to flow 

What he never told you
Is that he would love to hold you
Take a look around, take it in 

Take it in
Take it in 

I don't think that it's appropriate to cry
Here's something to wipe your eye
His only fault was that he was much too shy
And he didn't even try 

So bein' all by yourself is no way to be
There's plenty of fish in his sea
It's not the end of the world, take it from me
You can take from me 

'Cause you have more to offer
Than you will ever know
Take a deep breath, take it in 

Take it in
Take it in
Take it in
Take it in
Take it in 

Hold me close to your chest before you go
There's something that you should know
Put your mouth on my back and lightly blow
Where does the warmness go? 

Up to my arms and shoulders
Could I be any bolder?
It looks like you have been taken in 

Take it in
Take it in
Take it in
Take it in
Take it in
Take it in
Take it in
