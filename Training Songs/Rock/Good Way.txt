Traffic noise, expensive toys
A love that never lasts
Broken homes and self-made thrones
We're livin' life too fast

That we forget the things that his love brings
Beyond what this world is
I can hear it still today, what the preacher used to say
This is how you live, you've got to

Believe in your heart, right down to your soul
And speak the true things and know that you know
'Cause this might be the day, so live like it is
Find the good way and walk in it, walk on

Saints of old and streets of gold
Will gaze upon His throne
Singin' holy, holy God of glory
We'll worship Him alone

So keep your eye on the sky, while it's all passing by
This world is not our home
'Cause someday soon, we're gonna be made new
But until' then you've got to

Believe in your heart, right down to your soul
And speak the true things and know that you know
'Cause this might be the day, so live like it is
Find the good way and walk in it

Believe in your heart, right down to your soul
And speak the true things and know that you know
'Cause this might be the day, so live like it is
Find the good way and walk in it, walk on

Take a look around, the world is falling down
Why can't we see that it's almost over?
The clouds are rollin' in
He's gonna break the sky the dead are gonna rise
Those who are alive in Him will fly, will fly

Find, find the good way
Find, find the good way

Believe in your heart, right down to your soul
And speak the true things and know that you know
'Cause this might be the day, so live like it is
Find the good way and walk in it

Believe in your heart, right down to your soul
And speak the true things and know that you know
'Cause this might be the day, so live like it is
Find the good way and walk in it, walk on
