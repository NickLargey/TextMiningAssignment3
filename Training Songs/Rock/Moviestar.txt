You feel like Steve McQueen
When your driving in your car
And you think you look like James Bond
When you're smoking your cigar
It's so bizarre
You think you are
The new kind of James Dean
But the only thing I've ever seen of you
Was a commercial spot on the screen

Movie star, oh movie star
You think you are a movie
Movie star, oh movie star
You think you are a movie star
Ah-ha

You should belong to the jet set
Fly your own private Lear Jet
But you worked in a grocery store
Everyday until you could afford to get away
So you went to Sweden to meet Ingmar Bergman
But he wasn't there
Or he just didn't care
I think it's time for you my friend
To stop pretending that you are a

Movie star, movie star
You think you are a movie
Movie star, movie star
You think you are a movie star
Ah-ha

Frozen hero
Your words are zero
And your dreams have vanished into dark
And long ago
But you don't want to know

Movie star, oh movie star oh woh oh
You think you are a movie
Movie star, movie star oh woh oh
You think you are a movie
Movie star, oh movie star oh woh oh
You think you are a movie star
Movie star, movie star
Movie star, movie star
Movie star, movie star
