You sleep just like a baby
After you've been holdin' me
With tenderness and with love

And as I watch you sleepin'
My heart builds up with feelings
That make me cry the tears of love

[Chorus]
We are one
You and me baby
In body and soul

We are one
We take care of our special love
And when the mornin' comes
And in the face of the sun
We'll still be together

We are one
We are one

As I watch you sleepin'
I wonder how I'd ever live without you dear
Oh, without your love

My fingers trace your brow
And then I feel a tingle deep inside, takin' a high
We were makin' love, oh love

[Chorus]

We are one
We take care of our special love
And when the mornin' comes
And in the face of the sun
We'll still be together

We are one
We are one

And when the mornin' comes
And in the face of the sun
We'll still be together

We are one
We are one
