We're not a movie with written lines
Still we're chasing the perfect pretty lie
Where are you going?
What you tryna find?
Like it's greener on the other side

It's like we're stressing out
To find some peace of mind
It's a story of our time

Oh, will you stay with me
Or chase another dream
In this heartbreak century
It's more than way too fast
Can lovers ever last?
In this heartbreak century

Between the future and the past
Why aren't we happy?
With everything we have
We ain't perfect
I know it too (I know it too)
But if I go now
I'd look for another you

It feels like we're stressing out
To find some peace of mind
It's a story of our time

Oh, will you stay with me
Or chase another dream
In this heartbreak century
It's more than way too fast
Can lovers ever last
In this heartbreak century
In this heartbreak century
In this heartbreak century

We're not a movie with written lines
Still we're chasing the perfect pretty lie

Oh, will you stay with me
Or chase another dream
In this heartbreak century
It's more than way too fast
Can lovers ever last
In this heartbreak century

Oh, will you stay with me
Or chase another dream
In this heartbreak century
It's more than way too fast
Can lovers ever last
In this heartbreak century
