Some things are long forgotten
Some things were never said
We were on one endless road
But I had a wandering heart

I said we were opposite lovers
(Said it from the beginning) you kept trying to prove me wrong
(Said you'd always see it through) and I know that I ran you down
So you ran away with your heart

But just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you, I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you, I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

I know it's hard to hear it
And it may never be enough
But don't take it out on me now
'Cause I blame it all on myself

And I had a fear of forgiveness
(Said it from the beginning) I was too proud to say I was wrong
(Said you'd always see me through) but all that time is gone
No more fearing control, I'm ready for the both of us now

So just know that I want you back
So just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you, I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back (just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you back (just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you, I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you (just know that I want you back, baby)
