I woke up this morning
To a voice in my head
It said it's time to get a job
It said it's time to more ahead
It's time to do what's right
It's time you get a life
It said go to the closet
And picked out some clothes
Make a healthy breakfast
And a cup of jo
It's time to do what's right
It's time you get a life

so I went to the closet
And looked at my clothes
And thought to myself I'm screwed
A beat up old jacket and a pair of shoes
That the dog has definitely chewed

I rolled out of bed
And to my surprise
Repo men was at my door
With disgust in his eyes
It's time to do what's right
It's time you get a life
Then he took all my stuff
And laughed in my face
Gave me the finger
And said you're a disgrace
It's time to do what's right
It's time you get a life

so I looked in the mirror
And I thought to myself
That the voice, it could be right
Now it keeps coming back
And talking to me everyday and everynight
