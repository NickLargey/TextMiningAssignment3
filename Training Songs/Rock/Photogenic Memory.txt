Photogenic memory
Past looks better than reality
Believe me, it's just an illusion

Photogenic memory
Makes it better than it used to be
Believe me, you're better without him

You see her leave with him
You want him back again
But remember what your life was like

You can't forget the nights
You forget the lies and fights
You remember only the good times

Photogenic memory
Makes it better than it used to be
Believe me, you're better without him

Yesterday you have done him harm
Now you wanna be on his arm
Remember the way he pretended

Yesterday he was history
Now today he's all you see
You remember the way that it ended

Past looks better than reality
Believe me, it's just an illusion

Photogenic memory
Makes it better than it used to be
Believe me, you're better without him

Slip away before you fall
Rip the phone out of the wall when he calls
Anything to keep him out
Out of your new life that he inspires
