Wake up, set your sights
For never shall we fail
Stand up for your rights
And justice will prevail

You're listening
Through endless nights
And decision is your goal
So wake up, set your sights
Oh, the time is right for your role
Yeah, or your role

Wake up, wake up, wake up
Set your sights
Never, never, never
Shall we fail
Stand up, stand up, stand up
For your rights
Justice, justice, justice
Will prevail

There in the morning
Flying over the hills
While men are yawning
They are crushed by our wills
Never have I witnessed
People in fear
Not like today
Not in many a year

Go kill another
There are more close behind
"No" screams a mother
"Are you out of your mind"
Though they are shattered
They just don't seem to yield
Bodies are scattered
In all parts of the field

Oh no, did I tell you
What would happen if you tried
"Oh god, stop this killing!"
Said a young man
Before he died
