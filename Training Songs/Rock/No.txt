No silence, no sound
No feeling, on and on and on and on...
Go under and go down again and on and on...

No pressure, no talk
No heartbeat, R-E-S-P-O-N-S-E
I go under and go down again and on and on....

Something is wrong, something is wrong
Something that was making me feel good is not
Something is wrong, something is wrong
Something that was making me feel good is not
Is not, is not, is not...
Nobody understands and it's all I got

No violence profound...
As violence, I act out against myself
When I go under and down again and on and on...

No wonder I fell
Nobody was underneath me there to catch me
When I go under and down again and on and on...

Something is wrong, something is wrong
Something that was making me feel good is not
Something is wrong, something is wrong
Something that was making me feel good is not
Is not, is not, is not...
Nobody understands and it's all I got

So liar, stand up
So liar, stand up
Stand up
