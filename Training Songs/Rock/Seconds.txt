Who would have thunk I did not think of it
In for the night again it sinks
When broken arms would they still mend
With careful stitching and strong thread
I'm asking stay here till I go
I want an answer won't take no
I'm asking stay here rock n' roll
I want an answer won't take no
Seconds

When you're not drunk don't reach for drink until
Out for the night again it sinks
When broken arms would they still mend
With careful stitching and strong thread
I'm asking stay here till I go
I want an answer won't take no
I'm asking stay here rock n' roll
I want an answer won't take no
Seconds

Inkers pens and broken lighters
I tried to tell you all along
I tried to rewrite this whole song
In hopes that you might sing along
And all I heard was "so long"
I'm asking stay here till I go
I want an answer won't take no
I'm asking stay here rock n' roll
I want an answer won't take no
Seconds
