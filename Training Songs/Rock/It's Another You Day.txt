It's another you day
It's another you day
There you are
At the bus stop by the car
You're the music on my radio
And I can't turn you down
You're the driver on the ghost train
That's pulling me around
You are the traffic
You are everywhere
It's another you day
It's another you day
There you are
By the bandstand in the park
You're the star in every picture
And I'm so unrehearsed
I see you in the mirror
I see myself reversed
You are a vision
You are everywhere
It's another you day
It's another you day
There you are
In my bedroom in the dark
I still think about you
All the time
You're always on my mind
That's okay
It's just another you day
It's another you day
It's another you day
There you are
At the bus stop by the car
It's another you day
It's another you day
There you are
By the bandstand in the park
There you are
In my bedroom in the dark
It's another you day
