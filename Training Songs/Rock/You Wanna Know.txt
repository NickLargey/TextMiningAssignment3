Called me up one day
Said you didn't mind
Just called to find out
What you thought already

What'd you hope I'd say?
That you were my one true love, a lie
But it'd keep you happy

So I told the truth
Look at where it got me
Girl, did you have to mention
Girl, what you said

What you say, what you say
Why you gotta be like that?
Why you gotta be like that?
Is she not gonna take me back?
What you say, what you say
Why you gotta be like that?
Why you gotta be like that?
Is she not gonna take me?
Said you wanna know
But I know you don't
But I know you don't

You liked getting laid
And it's not like you laid all of your cards out face up on the table

Never broke no rules
Never crossed no boundaries
Girl, did you have to mention
Girl, tell me what to do

What you say, what you say
Why you gotta be like that?
Why you gotta be like that?
Is she not gonna take me back?
What you say, what you say
Why you gotta be like that?
Why you gotta be like that?
Is she not gonna take me?
Said you wanna know
But I know you don't
But I know you don't

You said you wanna know
You said you wanna know
But I know you don't
But I know you don't

You said you wanted names
You said you wanted dates
But I know you don't
But I know you don't

You said you have your cake
You said you eat your cake
Now you know I won't

(Said you wanna know, oh oh oh oh, oh oh)

Why you gonna be like that?
Why you gonna be like that?

(Whatchu' say, watchu' say?)
Why you gonna be like that? 
Why you gonna be like that?
Is she not gonna take me back?

(Said you wanna know, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Why you gonna be like that?
Is she not gonna take me?

(Said you wanna know, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Why you gonna be like that?
You ain't gonna have me back
You ain't gonna have me back
