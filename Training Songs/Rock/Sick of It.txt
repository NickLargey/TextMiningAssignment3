don't say you're having fun 
 there's no fire in your sun  
 there's nothing here that is real   
nothing that I'd stay here for  
nothing I'd like to steal  
And I'm sick of it all  
I'm sick of it 
 don't say you're heaven nigh 
 there's no stars in your sky  
 there's nothing here that is real  
well nothing that I'd stay here for  
nothing I'd like to steal  
And I'm sick of it all  
I'm sick of it   
there's nothing here that is real  
nothing that I'd stay here for  
nothing I'd like to steal  
And I'm sick of it all  
I'm sick of it   
don't say you're having fun  
(don't say you're heaven nigh)  
there's no fire in your sun  
(there's no stars in your sky)   
sick of it  
sick of it all  
sick of it  
sick of it all
