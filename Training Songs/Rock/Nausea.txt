Here I am, motherfucker!

Here I am
As I am
As you made me think I am

I don't hear you
I don't need you
I don't want you
I

Don't wanna feel anymore
(Don't hear you)
Don't wanna feel anymore
(Don't need you)
Don't wanna feel anymore
(Don't want you)
Don't wanna feel anymore
(Don't feel you)

This is this
This is it
Not my kisses, just my fist

I don't hear you
I don't need you
I don't want you
I

Don't wanna feel anymore
(Don't hear you)
Don't wanna feel anymore
(Don't need you)
Don't wanna feel anymore
(Don't want you)
Don't wanna feel anymore
(Don't feel you)

Don't wanna feel any more
(The sickness is inside you)
Don't wanna feel any more
(The sickness is inside you)
Don't wanna feel any more
(The sickness is inside you)
Don't wanna feel any more
(The sickness is inside you)
Don't wanna feel any more
(The sickness is inside you)
Don't wanna feel any more
(The sickness is inside you)
Don't wanna feel any more
(The sickness is inside you)
Don't wanna feel any more
(The sickness is inside you)
