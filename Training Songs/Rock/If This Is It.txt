I've been phoning night and morning
I heard you say "tell him I'm not home"
Now you're confessing, But I'm still guessing
I've been your fool for so so long
Girl don't lie, just to save my feelings
Girl don't cry, and tell me nothing's wrong
Girl don't try to make up phony reasons
I'd rather leave than never believe
If this is it, please let me know
If this ain't love you'd better let me go
If this is it, I want to know
If this ain't love baby, just say so
You've been thinking
And I've been drinking
We both know that it's just not right
Now you're pretending
That it's not ending
You'll say anything to avoid a fight
Girl don't lie, and tell me that you need me
Girl don't cry, and tell me nothing's wrong
I'll be alright one way or another
So let me go, or make we want to stay
If this is it, please let me know
If this ain't love you'd better let me know
If this is it, I want to know
If this ain't love baby, just say so
