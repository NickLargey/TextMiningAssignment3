Knowledge is key.
You can never know too much.
Open your books aim to the stars 
Well I won't let them
Keep me from learning all I can.
Public schools just stand up.
The system feeds our minds.

Did the system tell you about democracy?
The same system that supported slavery?
And doesn't it seem strange that 
When we try to make a change
To lock us up and throw away the key.

I won't let you
Play me for a fool
Set me free to go to church
But I can't pray in school.
Make a decision for yourself
Don't bother with any trends
Open up a book
And share the knowledge with your friends.
