So young and beautiful in her old used car
And she's had a bellyful of the way things are
Trying to make ends meet
Been down to her last dollar
Running from the heat of a temper like lava

She's a volcano
She's a volcano

Hot-wired by nature like so many before her
And you thought that you chased her
Then without any warning

She's a volcano
She's a volcano

Try to calm her down
Oh you must be joking
Give her all your love
The sweet sacrifice
Waiting on the cool quiet night

She can't understand it
All she wants is a good life
Nothing going like she planned it
Full of struggle and strife

She's a volcano
She's a volcano

Try to calm her down
Oh you must be joking
Give her all your love
The sweet sacrifice
Waiting on the cool quiet night
Waiting on the cool quiet night
Waiting on the cool quiet night
