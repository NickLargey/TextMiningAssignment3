You're a woman - you're a child
Sometimes you're weak and then you're wild
And I just can't understand
'cause I'm a boy who plays the part of a man, now
It's not hard to see
Must be the way it was meant to be

You keep me guessin' all the time
You play the fool and then you shine
Can I meet you in between?
'cause you know we could both do without a scene, now
I don't mean to blame you
I got some work of my own to do

Ooh - We could tear it down and build it up again
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me, first of all, learnin'
And maybe then we can make amends
We could follow it through to the very end - it's true
I'm talkin' 'bout me and you
Me and you

We could tear it down and build it up again...
