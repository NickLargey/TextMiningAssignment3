I seen the demons but they didn't make a sound 
They tried to reach me but I lay upon the ground 
I seen the people but they didn't make a sound 
They tried to reach me but I gave the runaround 
I reached for feelings but they didn't make a sound 

They tried to reach me but I lay upon the ground 
I saw miles and miles of squares, where's the feeling there 
Still nobody cares for miles and miles of squares 
Daydream I fell asleep beneath the flowers
