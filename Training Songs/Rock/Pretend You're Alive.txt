Oh summer life, oh summer life
Crawling with these worms you're afraid of all their germs
Oh bask in life, oh bask in life
The weather gonna swallow you into the great divide
Oh enjoy life, oh enjoy life
Climbing up those trees and breaking all your knees

Watch angels in the morning become a devil's afternoon
I will panic in the evening underneath the crashing moon
So fall in love while you can still hold your head up high
And pretend that you're alive again
It's friends that leave you here in the end so hold your head up high
And pretend that you're alive again

Now autumn brings the beautiful things
Where all you give comes back to you like the crown upon my king
Your life's a song so sing along
Before the silence swallows you and leaves you like a pawn

Watch angels in the morning become a devil's afternoon
I will panic in the evening underneath the crashing moon
So fall in love while you can still hold your head up high
And pretend that you're alive again
It's friends that leave you here in the end so hold your head up high
And pretend that you're alive

Your friends now ghosts are screaming
Bury us, they said, while panicking my mind was broken.
