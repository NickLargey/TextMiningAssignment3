This man I married is buried deep
And the more I try to wake him, the more he sleeps
I used to think I knew this man
The tenderness, not the back of his hand

It's been two weeks since he last had a drink
But the time bomb's ticking, I can never sleep
It would be easier if he did
Why do you stay here, stay with him

Why do you do it
Why do you treat us bad
When you've got two kids that love you
And a wife that's missing you bad
I've got to go now
I've got to say goodbye
Don't try to stop us now
And please don't you cry
Can't you see, we've all been through it
It's all been said before
With all these fears
For how many years can I keep coming
Back for more
No more

Must be addicted to all this pain
'Cause I keep coming back for the shame
Dear God, give me the strength to leave
I've got to keep going, keep going this time

Don't try to stop us now
Don't pull that stuff on me
I've got the kids all packed up
Harry's in the back with his pick-up truck
Jenny's fallen asleep again
I've got to keep driving 'til I reach the end

I can't come back here anymore 
And I know it
And I know it
I can't come back here anymore
And I know it
And I know it
