To all who are looking down
Holding on to hearts still wounding
For those who've yet to find it
The place is near where love is moving
Cast off the robes you're wearing
Set aside the names that you've been given
May this place of rest in the fold of your journey
Bind you to hope
You will never walk alone

In the shelter of each other
We will live
We will live (Never walk alone)
In the shelter of each other
We will live (Your arms are all around us)
We will live 

(Oh, oh, we will live)
(Oh, oh)

If our hearts are turned to stone
There is hope we know the rocks will cry out
And the tears aren't ours alone
Let them fall into the hands that hold us
Come away from where you're hiding
Set aside the lies that you've been living
May this place of rest in the fold of your journey
Bind you to hope
We will never walk alone

In the shelter of each other
We will live
We will live (In the shelter)
In the shelter of each other
We will live (You will never walk alone)
We will live 

In the shelter of each other (In Your arms are all around us)
We will live 
We will live 
In the shelter of each other (In Your arms are all around us)
We will live 
We will live 

If there is any peace
If there is any war
We must all believe
Our lives are not our own
We all belong

God has given us each other
And we will never walk alone

In the shelter of each other
We will live
We will live (In the shelter)
In the shelter of each other
We will live (Your arms are all around us)
We will live 

In the shelter of each other (And Your arms are all around us)
We will live
We will live 
In the shelter of each other (And Your arms are all around us)
We will live
We will live 

In the shelter of each other
We will live
We will live (In Your arms are all around us)
In the shelter of each other
We will live
We will live (In Your arms are all around us)

In the shelter of each other
We will live (We will never walk alone)
We will live
Never walk alone
