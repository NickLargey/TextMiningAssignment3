I wear my heart on my sleeve,
I'm not afraid to say what i mean,
Mean what i say.
I set myself up, let myself down,
I may be a fool to spread it around.
But i just wanna let you know,
Sometimes i find it so hard not to show,
So i sigh and i let my feelings go.

I wear my heart on my sleeve,
Don't count the cost,
If i can't live in love then surely i've lost.
You tend to get burned, tend to get bruised,
But it's my life whatever i choose.
Oh, i just wanna let you know,
Sometimes i, i find it so hard not to show,
So i sigh and i let my feelings go.

I wear my heart on my sleeve,
I wear my heart on my sleeve.
You tend to get burned, tend to get bruised,
But it's my life whatever i choose.
Oh, i just wanna let you know,
'Cause sometimes i find it so hard not to show,
So i sigh, but, baby, you're not alone.

You wear your heart on your sleeve,
You wear your heart on your sleeve.
I wear my heart on my sleeve,
I wear my heart on my sleeve.

I wear my heart on my sleeve,
I wear my heart on my sleeve,
I wear my heart on my sleeve,
Mm, my heart on my sleeve,

Baby, you know, i wear my heart on my sleeve,
Oh, my heart on my sleeve.
You wear your heart on your sleeve,
I wear my heart on my sleeve.
