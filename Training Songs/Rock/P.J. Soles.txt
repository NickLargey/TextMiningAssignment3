I think of P.J. Soles
And wonder where you are
I'll never see you anymore

Where do you think they go?
All the Fallen Stars
Heaven doesn't know you like I do

See you, bleed through
The gauzey haze I sink into
I think of you like P.J. Soles

I was your biggest fan
You seemed to understand
They'll never see you like I do

I guess it's like they said
That it was all just built up in my head
But you're still so real to me

If fine, this time
To me it makes no nevermind

But you know I keep you close
Yearbook, it took
Just one thousand tearstained looks
I think of you like P.J. Soles

And if I do think of you
It's only in the darkest place inside of me
You should know, I think of you like P.J. Soles

See you, bleed through
The gauzey haze I sink into
Phone call, f*ck all
You're just one part of my free fall
This part of me will never close

And when I do think of you
It's only in the darkest place inside of me
You should know, I think of you like P.J. Soles

P.J. Soles
