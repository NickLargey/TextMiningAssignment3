When it's passing strange
And I'm waiting for the train
Caught up on this line again
And it's passing slowly

Killing time but it's better
Than living in what will come
And I've still got some
Of your letters with me

And I thought sometimes
Or I read too much and I think you know
Let's drink to the dead lying under the water
And the cost of the blood on the driven snow

And the lipstick on my cigarettes
Frost upon the window pane

Nine while nine
And I'm waiting for the train

She said, "Do you remember a time when angels?
Do you remember a time when fear
In the days when I was stronger
In the days when you were here"

She said, "When days had no beginning
While days had no end when shadows grew no longer
I knew no other friend but you were wild"
You were wild

Frost upon these cigarettes
Lipstick on the window pane
And I've lost all sense of the world outside
But I can't forget so I call your name

And I'm looking for a life for me
And I'm looking for a life for you
And I'm talking to myself again
And it's so damn cold it's just not true

And I'm walking through the rain
Trying to hold on waiting for the train
And I'm only looking for what you want
But it's lonely here and I think you knew

And I'm, and I'm waiting
And I wait in vain
Nine while nine
And I'm waiting for the train

And I'm waiting
And I wait in vain
Nine while nine
And I'm waiting for the train

And I'm waiting
And I wait in vain
Nine while nine
I'm waiting for the train
