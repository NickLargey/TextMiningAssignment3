He went down, down, down
And the devil called him by name
He went down, down, down
Hangin' onto the back of a train

He went down, down, down
This boy went solid down
Always chewed tobacco, and the bathtub gin
Always chewed tobacco, and the bathtub gin
He went down, down, down
This boy went solid down
He went down

Well, he went down, down, down
And the devil jumped on his head
He went down, down, down
Stayin' in a broken-down shed
He went down, down, down
Sleepin' in the devil's bed
He went down, down, down
Never listened to the words I said
He went down, down, down, down
Well, he went down

Well, he went down, down, down
And the devil said "where you been?"
He went down, down, down
He went screamin' down around the bend

Down, down, down
This boy went solid down

He was always cheatin' and he always told lies
He was always cheatin' and he always told lies

Down, down, down
This boy went solid down
He went down
