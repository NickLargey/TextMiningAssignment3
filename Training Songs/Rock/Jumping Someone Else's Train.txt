Don't say what you mean
You might spoil your face
If you walk in the crowd
You won't leave any trace
It's always the same
Your jumping someone else's train

It won't take long to learn
The new smile
You have to adapt 
Or you'll be out of style
It's always the same
Your jumping someone else's train

If you pick up on it quick
You can say you were there
Again and again and again
Your jumping someone else's train

It's the latest wave that you've been craving for
The old ideal was getting such a bore
Now your back in line
Going not quite as far
But in half the time
Everyone's happy, they're finally all the same
Because everyone's jumping everybody else's train

Jumping someone else's train
Jumping someone else's train
Jumping someone else's train
