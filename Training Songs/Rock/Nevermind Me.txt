What is this game we're playing?
Should I stick around for more?
Snap your fingers I'll come running
Leave again when you're bored with me
I'll make it easy

Nevermind me, nevermind me
I'll just cast shadows on your wall
Nevermind me, nevermind me
My God I feel so small!
Nevermind me, nevermind me
I'll just cast shadows on your wall
Nevermind me, nevermind me
I'll let myself out

This facade that I'm stuck with
Has got me wondering
Just tell me how you want me
And I'll be naked stumbling
Just to get a reaction, any signs of love

Nevermind me, nevermind me
I'll just cast shadows on your wall
Nevermind me, nevermind me
My God I feel so small!
Nevermind me, nevermind me
I'll just cast shadows on your wall
Nevermind me, nevermind me

Bottle up your smile
And pour it in a cup
I'll be on my way
Once I sobered up

Nevermind me, nevermind me
I'll just cast shadows on your wall
Nevermind me, nevermind me

Nevermind me, nevermind me
I'll just cast shadows on your wall
Nevermind me, nevermind me

Nevermind me, nevermind me
I'll just cast shadows on your wall
Nevermind me, nevermind me
My God I feel so small!
Nevermind me, nevermind me
I'll just cast shadows on your wall
Nevermind me, nevermind me
I'll let myself out
