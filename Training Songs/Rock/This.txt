Attention high and conviction strong
You’ve got that sashay groove like a Marvin Gaye song
Yeah my piston’s fire, and your engine roars
It’s a tight turn baby that can’t be ignored

I got to go, got to go where this song leads
I got to go, got to go where this heart bleeds

Ooh ooh oh ooh, Ooh ooh oh ooh
How am I gonna leave you in a moment like this?
Ooh ooh oh ooh, Ooh ooh oh ooh
How am I gonna leave you when I want you like this?
Ooh ooh oh ooh, Ooh ooh oh ooh
How am I gonna leave you when I love you like this?
How am I gonna leave you when I love you like this?

Those crazy words mixed with truth and lies
You’re a camouflaged trouble right before my eyes
I see angels in bloom, you see devils in sight
It’s a new world order that could serve us tonight

I got to go, got to go where this song leads
I got to go, got to go where this heart bleeds

Ooh ooh oh ooh, Ooh ooh oh ooh
How am I gonna leave you in a moment like this?
Ooh ooh oh ooh, Ooh ooh oh ooh
How am I gonna leave you when I want you like this?
Ooh ooh oh ooh, Ooh ooh oh ooh
How am I gonna leave you when I love you like this?
How am I gonna leave you when I love you like this?

It’s hard to settle in when your moving round, boy
Yea what lifts you up, may bring you down (Down)
Down (Down)
Down

I got to go, got to go where this song leads
I got to go, got to go where this heart bleeds

Ooh ooh oh ooh, Ooh ooh oh ooh
How am I gonna leave you in a moment like this?
Ooh ooh oh ooh, Ooh ooh oh ooh
How am I gonna leave you when I want you like this?
Ooh ooh oh ooh, Ooh ooh oh ooh
How am I gonna leave you when I love you like this?
Ooh ooh oh ooh, Ooh ooh oh ooh
How am I gonna leave you when I love you like this?
How am I gonna leave you when I love you like this?
How am I gonna leave you when I love you like this?
How am I gonna leave you when I love you like this?
