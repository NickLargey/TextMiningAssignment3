Oh yeah alright
I know now
Everything stops here
You don't love me
I am a street that you live on
People walking towards me
Yeah a girl on a bus stop
Reading postcards from nowhere
It feels like a movie

She saw the world and she wanted it all
What can I tell you?
She saw the world and she wanted it all

Gangsters in traffic surround you
And up on the rooftops
Yeah she's waving
It doesn't seem to matter anymore

She saw the world and she wanted it all
She saw the world and she wanted it all

Letters and numbers surround you
And out on the corner
A policemen is sending flowers
It feels like a movie

She saw the world and she wanted it all
And what can I tell you
She saw the world and she wanted it all
What can I tell you?
She saw the world like a silver ball
What can I tell you?
She saw the world and she wanted it all

She wanted it all
Yeah

Stop bringing me down stop bringing me
Stop bringing me down stop bringing me
Stop bringing me down stop bringing me
Stop bringing me down stop bringing me
What can I tell you?
What can I tell you?
