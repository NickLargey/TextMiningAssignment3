Open your eyes to the millions of lies that they tell you every day
Open your mind to the clever disguise that the advirtisements say
How do they know what's good for you?
Wake up, Wake up woohoo
Wake up, Wake up woohoo
A shot to the head, They're better off dead
Will you wake up, wake up, woohoo
Destory all the land, kill what you can just to make the profits rise
Sell you from birth
For all that your worth 
Money spreads like lies
How do they know what's good for you
Wake up, Wake up, woohoo
Wake up, Wake up, woohoo
A shot to the head they're better off dead
Won't you wake up, wake up, woohoo

RUN!

Don't want to hate you
Don't want to blame it all on you
Out of options
If you don't look, I'll force you too
If you don't look, I'll force you too
If you don't look, ILL FORCE YOU TOO!

Wake up, Wake up, woohoo,
Wake up, Wake up, woohoo,
A shot to the head, just so you can be fed,
Open your eyes, Open your eyes,
OPEN YOUR EYES!
