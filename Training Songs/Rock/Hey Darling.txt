I’m trying hard, but I can never reach you
I tried hard, and no one ever knew
This time, I’m gonna make a plan
If you can’t, find your own way back
If you can’t, no one ever will
This time, I’m gonna make a plan
Hey darling, I’m walking right behind
I told you, I’m lost and confused in the dark
Hey darling, I’m walking right behind
I told you, I’m lost and confused in the dark
I’m trying hard, but I can never leave you
I tried hard, and you, you never knew
So this time, I’m gonna make a plan
If you can’t, find your own way back
Tell me, who will remind us about
This city, we’re in?
Hey darling, I’m walking right behind
I told you, I’m lost and confused in the dark
Hey darling, I’m walking right behind
I told you, I’m lost and confused in the dark
