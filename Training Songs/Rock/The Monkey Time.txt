Now there's a place right across town, whenever you're ready 
Where the people gather 'round, whenever they're ready 
And then the music begins to play 
You feel a groove comin' on its way 

Are you ready? Yes I'm ready. 
You get yours, I got mine 
For the monkey time, monkey time 

Now this dance that the people do, don't know how it started 
All I know is when the beat brings the feel 
it's hard to get parted 
And then the music begins to play 
And automatically you're on your way 

Are you ready? Yes I'm ready. 
You get yours, I got mine 
for the monkey time, monkey time 

Do the monkey yeah, 
Do the monkey yeah, 
Do the monkey yeah, yeah 
Do the monkey yeah, yeah 

Twist them hips 
Let your backbone slip 
Now move your feet 
Get on the beat 

Are you ready? Yes I'm ready. 
You get yours, I got mine 
for the monkey time, monkey time 

[spoken] 
Say Fee, are you ready tonight? 
I'm ready baby. 
But you're ready for what, Fee? 
I'm ready to do the monkey. 
But are you ready for my monkey? 
I'm ready, and my monkey's ready. 
Your monkey?! Oooo, you'd better put that baby on a chain! 
Say baby, my monkey know what he talkin' about. 
Now stop it Fee! 

Want a whole lot o' love tonight 
Treat your monkey right 
Want a whole lot o' love tonight 
Monkey time tonight
