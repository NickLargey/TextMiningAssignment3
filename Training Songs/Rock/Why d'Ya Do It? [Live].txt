When I stole a twig from our little nest
And gave it to a bird with nothing in her beak,
I had my balls and my brains put into a vice
And twisted around for a whole fucking week.
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you let that trash
Get a hold of your cock, get stoned on my hash?

Why'd ya do it she said, why'd you let her suck your cock?
Oh, do me a favor, don't put me in the dark.
Why'd ya do it, she said, they're mine all your jewels,
You just tied me to the mast of the ship of fools.

Why'd ya do it, she said, when you know it makes me sore,
'Cause she had cobwebs up her fanny and I believe in giving to the poor.
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you spit on my snatch?
Are we out of love now, is this just a bad patch?

Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did?
You drove my ego to a really bad skid.

Why'd you do it, she said, ain't nothing to laugh,
You just tore all our kisses right in half!

Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd ya do what you did,
Betray my little oyster for such a low bitch.

Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did?
You drove my ego to a really bad skid.

Why'd ya do it, she screamed, after all we've said
Every time I see your dick I see her cunt in my bed.

The whole room was swirling,
Her lips were still curling.

Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd ya do it, she said,
Why'd you do what you did ?

Oh, big gray mother, I love you forever
With your barbed wire pussy and your good and bad weather.
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did

Ah, I feel better now.
