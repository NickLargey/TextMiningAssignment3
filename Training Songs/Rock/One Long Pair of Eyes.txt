In the tower, the lover sighs
"Good sir knight, please take my eyes I've used them."
"Doctor, Doctor, I'm on fire!"
"Oh, I'm sad to hear that, squire
We're closing."
She snuffs you out like silk
And pours you out like milk
But just before the dawn appears, Stealing all the blue away
And just before
All your perspectives change
Isn't it strange?

On the black Fellini sails
Tattered rags that hangs on nails Reminds me
You, the mistress of your chair
I, the sergeant of your hair
You blind me
You turn me on like light
A silver liquid light
That emanates inside of you
Decorates the room around you
Just before the curtains part for dawn
And everything's gone

She had one long pair of eyes
She had one long pair of eyes
Between her
One long pair or eyes
So she could see you

On the lone Norwegian shore
Lovers weep for evermore in evening
With the clouds above their heads
Go back to their lonesome beds
And leave them
She falls on you like rain
When will she fall again?
Oh just before the dawn appears, Draining all the blue away
And just before
All your perspectives change
Isn't that strange?

She had one long pair of eyes
She had one long pair of eyes
Between her
One long pair of eyes
She had one long pair of eyes
Between her
One long pair of eyes
Oh, she had one long pair of eyes Between her
One long pair of eyes
So she could see you
