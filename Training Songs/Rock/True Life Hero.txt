The last time I went swimming
I started to drown
And my head it went down
And then the lifeguard he jumped in
Grabbed hold of my hair
And he pulled me to ground
He was a true life hero
Friend of every man and child
A true life hero
I really do think it'd be wild

I wonder what it would be like
To be the ultra maroon
Who was first on the moon
'Cause who could help but dislike
A man it is known
Has the guts of a prune
Wanna be a true life hero
Friend of every man and child
A true life hero
I really do think it'd be wild

I could never be like him
I could never be strong
'Cause I'm always wrong
So I'll just sit here thinking
How nice it would be
If it only was me
Who was a true life hero
Friend of every man and child
A true life hero
I really do think it'd be wild
Yes I really do think it'd be wild [Repeat: x1]
True life hero, a true life hero
A real life, true life hero
