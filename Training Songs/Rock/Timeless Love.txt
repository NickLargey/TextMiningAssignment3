Timeless love is livin' on 
Here in my heart baby 
And here in my song 

I miss your laugh 
And I miss your smiles 
I hope you hear this 
Across the miles 
And if ya do, 
Maybe my nights won't seem as long 

So I'll sing about you 
In the morning sun 
And I'll sing about you 
When my music's all done 
Then I'll smile 
'Cause it feels good even missin' ya 

So I'll sing about the day you said goodbye 
Then I'll sing one to many and I'll start to cry 
But that's OK 
'Cause it feels good even missin' ya 

Cry my memories away 
They haunt me by night, honey 
And they chase me by day 
I think about what I left behind 
A piece of my heart and a piece of my mind 
But still and all 
They weren't enough to make you want to stay 

So I'll sing about you 
In the morning sun 
And I'll sing about you 
When my music's all done 
Then I'll smile 
'Cause it feels good even missin' ya 

So I'll sing about the day you said goodbye 
Then I'll sing one to many and I'll start to cry 
But that's OK 
'Cause it feels good even missin'
