How you gonna reckon with a God like this?
When you gonna face what you can't dismiss?
Whatcha gonna say to the...soul kiss that is my God?
Fearsome like the sag in a fat man's chair?
Sweeter than a patch of Rogaine hair?
How do you define what you can't compare?
This is...my God 
And there's no use explaining what can't be contained

Chorus:

I'm not following a God I can lead around
I can't tame this deity
That's why Jesus is the final answer
To who I want my God to be
He's who (I want my God to be)

How you gonna reckon with a God this great?
Why you wanna measure what you can't equate?
Whatcha gonna say to the...check mate that is my God 
Stronger than the burn of an aftershave?
Tender as a burger in your microwave
Rarer than the air in an empty grave
This is...my God 
And there's no use explaining 
What can't be contained 

Bridge:

How we gonna work this out? 
To fabricate a God like this no doubt
We'd end up worshipping a Christ
Of our own design 
But Jesus doesn't fit that profile
His ways aren't mine

Chorus
