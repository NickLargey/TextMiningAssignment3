You say you want to go there,
Ride then-
I did- and I loved it-
Say you don't want to be here,
Leave then-
Time comes , to get gone
Say good morning to another set
Of creature
My dear, I'm gone-she said-

You want to go for a ride?
I got sixteen hours to burn
And i'm gonna stay up all night-

Tell your mama fever come
Back again
Look what you started-
And break it eazy to your boyfriend
She said-
You want to go for a ride?
I got thirteen hours to burn
And i'm gonna stay up all night

She said-she said
You want to go for a ride?
I got no more money to burn
And i'm gonna stay up all night-
