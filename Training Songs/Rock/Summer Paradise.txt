I gotta find my way back
back to summer paradise
Sean Paul, Simple Plan.

My heart is sinking as I’m lifting 
Up above the clouds away from you
And I can’t believe I’m leaving
Oh I don’t kno-kno-know what I’m gonna do

But someday
I will find my way back to where 
Your name Is written in the sand (stay in my brain)

‘Cause I remember every sunset
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye, yeah
Singing la-la-ta-ta-ta

Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
And I’ll be there in a heartbeat
(Quick time, quick time girl), Oh-oh
I’ll be there in a heartbeat 
(Quick time, quick time girl), Oh-oh (tell ‘em)

My soul is broken
Streets are frozen
I can’t stop these feelings melting through
And I’d give away a thousand days, oh
Just to have another one with you (baby girl)
Well, real life can wait (It can wait)
I’m crashing like waves (yeah)
Playing in the sand (me and you girl)
Holding your hand (make some noise)

‘Cause I remember every sunset (I remember)
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye
Singing la-ta-ta-ta-ta
Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you, (yeah)
And I’ll be there in a heartbeat 
(Quick time, quick time girl), Oh-oh
I’ll be there in a heartbeat 
(Quick time, quick time girl), Oh-oh '

The promises that we made to about our friends,
Thinking about it shine shine under trees,
Summer time on the beach,
Of fine we get closer under them trees,
Baby girl, you really got to me

It’s 3 o’clock, and were together and the time doesn’t leave
In a heartbeat girl, sex on the beach
Don’t stand your world, ask me I'm rich,
Loving you girl, is the best part of me

Someday, I will find my way back
To where your name
Is written in the sand 
(Bring it back, bring it back) (rewind)

'Cause I remember every sunset (I remember)
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye (no way)
Singing la-ta-ta-ta-ta

Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
Yeah, and I’ll be there in a heartbeat
I remember where we first kissed (I remember)

How I didn’t wanna leave your lips
And how I’ve never ever felt so high (so high)
Singing La-la-ta-ta-ta
So tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
I’ll be there in a heartbeat 
(Quick time, quick time girl), Oh-oh
I’ll be there in a heartbeat 
(Quick time, quick time girl), Oh-oh 
Summer Paradise
I’ll be there in a heart, yeah
