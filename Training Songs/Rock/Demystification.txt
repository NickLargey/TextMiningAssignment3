I look out the window and I wonder at it all,
Staring at the symbols that decorate the wall,
And everybody's calling to come and join them all,
But I can't go with no one till I understand the call.

Don't come round with any of that cheap karma,
Don't come round with any of that cheap karma,
Don't come round with any of that cheap karma

Now, I want....

I want some demystification,
I want some demystification,
I want some demystification about what's going on.

My electronic shaver won't plug into the wall,
Now I can't go to the party the electrician didn't call,
And I hear they're counting numbers to install down in Whitehall,
So much information what can they do with it all?

Don't come round with any of that cheap karma,
Don't come round with any of that cheap karma,
Don't come round with any of that cheap karma

Now I want.

I want some demystification,
I want some demystification,
I want some demystification about what's going on.

Some people talk of Shiva and some they talk of God,
Some talk of politicians and some they talk of love,
Demystify their heroes offerchances we can take,
I'm not looking for escapism I just want to escape.

Don't come round ,with any of that cheap karma
Don't come round with any of that cheap karma,
Don't come round with any of that cheap karma

Now I want.

I want some demystification,
I want some demystification,
I want some demystification about what's going on.

Don't come round with any of that cheap karma,
Don't come round with any of that cheap karma,
Don't come round with any of that cheap karma

Now I want.

I want some demystification,
I want some demystification,
I want some demystification about what's going on,
I want some demystification,
I want some demystification,
I want some demystification about what's going on.
