You play your stereo loud
You got your headphones on
I see you dancing around
To your favorite song
It's â€˜Who do you Love'
I want to know his name
And does he feel like I feel
Is he standing in the rain

I'm out in the street
The city lights above
It's the nighttime baby
Don't let go of my love

You've come a long way baby
From your days at school
I heard you're really living uptown
I'm just a downtown fool
And would it be all right
If I took you for a ride
Took you out on the town
Maybe someplace nice

Out in the street
City lights above
It's the nighttime baby
Don't let go of my love

And maybe later on
After the late late show
We can go to your room
I can try on your clothes
You know I'm not the kind of man
To come on so strong
But when you look as good as you do
I knew it wouldn't be long

I'm out in the street
The city lights above
It's the nighttime baby
Don't let go of my love
It's the nighttime baby
Don't let go of my love

Yeah, It's the nighttime baby
Don't let go of my love, love
Don't let go of my love
