I don't mind and I don't regret
And I wanted you to know
You will find and I hope you get
Everything you need to go

It won't fade away
It gets me through the day
And I am so alive
I've told you, I've told you

It's the dopamine that gets me high
The dopamine connects me
It's the dopamine, I can rely
The dopamine reflects me

Escalate to a better day
You can hear my soul refrain
Educate, it's the only way
Feel the blood rush to my brain

It won't fade away
It gets me through the day
And I am so alive
I've told you, I've told you

It's the dopamine that gets me high
The dopamine connects me
It's the dopamine, I can rely
The dopamine reflects me

And if you ask me why I feel this way
I know just where I'm going
And it is just because, I have no say
And there's no way of knowing

It's the dopamine that gets me high
The dopamine connects me
It's the dopamine, I can rely
The dopamine reflects me
