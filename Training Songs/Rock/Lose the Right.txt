I always knew you put poison in your potion
I lost my will to reason so long ago
You are as broken as the ghost that you believe in
I seen him in you, you know

Listen to me when I tell you what you mean to me
Just to clear the air, the air around you is killing me
Oh, whatever's in between you and me and the vicinity
It isn't fair to me so leave and don't come back to me

Oh, you lose the right
Oh, you lose the right

When your mind goes straight to hell, you lose the right
To tell anybody what to do
Your fire licks the sky just to blind
Whoever happens to come close enough to you

You lose the right

I always knew you put poison in your potion
You're broke like the ghost, the ghost, the ghost
The ghost that you believe in

Oh oh, you lose the right
Oh oh, you lose the right
