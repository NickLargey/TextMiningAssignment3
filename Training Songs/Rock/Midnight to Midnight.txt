When this town gets lonely
I got the new york stars
It feels like turning for you
Like diamonds in the dark
I got fascination
When you call my name
I might make history
Or throw it all away
It hurts like the first time
It hurts just like crime
When we're hot with confusion
From midnight to midnight
It hurts like confusion
And words don't come close
When your sweet dreams get lonely
I'll burn a candle then
I'm a town full of strangers
Of big time and lies
I'm all sirens and love songs
Shot down in black and white
I got fascination 
When you call my name
I might make history
Or or throw it all away
It hurts like confusion
And words don't come close
When your sweet dreams get lonely
I'll burn a candle then
It hurts like the first time
It hurts just like crime
When we're hot with confusion
From midnight to midnight
Love is no law
Love is no crime
It feels of turning sensation
And fun times
Love is no law
Love is no crime
It feels of turning sensation
And fun times
When this town gets lonely
I got the new york stars
It feels like turning for you
Like diamonds in the dark
I got fascination
When you call my name
I might make history
Or or throw it all away
It hurts like the first time
It hurts just like crime
When we're hot with confusion
From midnight to midnight
It hurts like confusion
And words don't come close
When your sweet dreams get lonely 
I'll burn a candle then
It hurts like confusion
It hurts like confusion
