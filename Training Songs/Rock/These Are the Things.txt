A pint of milkâ€“a loaf of bread-a magazine-on special offer
Check the weather forecast
Buy a new umbrella
Send a text message, take a shower
Meet me in the park, in half an hour

These are the things that keep us together
These are the things that keep us together
I love you I want you
Must have you I still love you
These are the things that keep us together

Make the bed, wash the sheets
Iron a shirt, try to eat
Check for e-mail, send replies
Set the video 
Catch the headlines 
Write a Get Well card, have a cup of tea
Think of you again, think of you

These are the things that keep us together 
Uh huh

Another night with some old friends
I pray that it will soon be over
I'm not listening to them
Their laughter floats out of the window
I wish that they would leave, so I can go to sleep
And dream of you again
Until tomorrow

These are the things that keep us together
These are the things that keep us together
I love you I want you
Must have you I still love you
These are the things that keep us together
These are the things that keep us together 
Uh huh
