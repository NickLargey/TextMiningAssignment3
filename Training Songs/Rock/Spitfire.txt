It's all fighting 
My sides are careening 
Boiling past the point 
At where she crashes 

Heard a tale of lore 
Body is a garden 
See the wrong after it's gone 
All along she's spitting 
Here comes the word so understanding 
And folding her up 

Spitfire 

Buring fingers that's branded into here 
Pass it off to the cut of glass, frozen flash 
She's just asking for what she won't say 
Here comes the world so understanding And sucking her 

Spitfire
