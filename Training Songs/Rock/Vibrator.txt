Hey! Looks like an emergency
Well that's ok with me 'cause I want to tell you in this elevator
Looks like you're my baby now
So put away that thing 'cause my baby don't need no vibrator

[Chorus]
I'm sure I'm the one you're looking for
I'm sure I'm sure you've heard it all before
I care but I don't care anymore
I'm sorry but I don't know what I'm sorry for

She don't, she don't, she don't need no vibrator
She don't, she don't, she don't need no vibrator
She don't, she don't, she don't need no electric entertainer tonight investigator

Hey now the doors are opening
And I look like a jerk while you're grinning like an Alligator
Can't we just forget the whole thing
Shake each others hands and say goodbye baby see you later

[Chorus]

She don't, she don't, she don't need no vibrator
She don't, she don't, she don't need no vibrator
She don't, she don't, she don't need no artificial stimulator non-organic excavator

[Chorus]

She don't, she don't, she don't need no vibrator
She don't, she don't, she don't need no vibrator
She don't, she don't, she don't need no electric entertainer tonight investigator

Hey she don't, she don't, she don't
Hey she don't, she don't, she don't
Hey she dies, she dies, she dies
Hey she dies, she dies, she dies

So I will see you later
