Expert lover, my baby 
You ever had a Crystal Ball? 
Expert lover, my baby 
You ever had a Crystal Ball? 
Ooh, expert lover, my baby 
Ever had a Crystal Ball? 
Expert lover, my baby 
You ever had a Crystal Ball? 

As bombs explode around us and hate advances on the right 
The only thing that matters, baby, is the love that we make tonight 
As little babies in make-up terrorize the western world 
The only thing that matters, baby, is love between a boy and girl 

Oh, expert lover, my baby 
You ever had a Crystal Ball? 
Undercover, no maybe 
All for fun and fun for all 

I can't remember my baby's voice 'cause she ain't talkin' no more 
Only the sound of love and prayer echo from the yellow floor, yellow floor 
Huh, she's sayin' C "Dear Jesus, save us from temptation 
Dear Jesus, save us from hell 
Save us from the madness that threatens us all 
Can you hear us? 
It's hard to tell 
In your name we pray". 

Expert lover, my baby 
Ever had a Crystal Ball? 
Undercover, no maybe 
All for fun, fun for all 

As soldiers draw swords of sorrow 
My baby draws pictures of sex (Yes, she does) 
All over the walls in graphic detail, sex! 

Everybody say it now 
Expert lover, huh, my baby 
Ever had a Crystal Ball? 
Under, undercover, ha, no maybe 
All for fun and fun for all 

Rip it, ouch! Uh 

Expert lover, my baby

Uh, expert lover, my baby (My baby)

My baby, my baby, my baby, my baby 
Kiss me, lick me, trick me, whoa! 
Oh yeah, yeah 
Come on, come on, come on, won't you come on? 

Expert lover, huh, my baby 
Have you ever had a Crystal Ball? 

Don't you want to? 
What my drummer want to say? 
Don't you want to? 
What my drummer want to say? 
Yeah! Drummer 
Tell me what the bass said 

Yeah 
Oh, ow! 
Listen to my, uh, listen to my bass man play 

Alright, (Expert lover, my baby is alright) 
Alright, (Undercover, my baby is alright) 
Listen to the guitar play 
Hey! Wait a minute now 
It's groovy 
Ouch! Guitar, guitar 
Come on now 
Oh yeah! 

My baby licked me fast 
Her mama watch her gas 
Come on, baby, do me fast 
Come on, come on 
Your mathematical gas 

Uh 
Ooh wee! 
Darlin', darlin', you know you want a Cry, Â­Crystal Ball 
Crystal Ball 

I don't know, I have to ask my mommy first 

As bombs explode around you and hate advances on your right 
The only thing you can be sure of is the love we make tonight 

Expert lover, my baby

Take off your clothes, baby 
Come on, get the Crystal Ball
