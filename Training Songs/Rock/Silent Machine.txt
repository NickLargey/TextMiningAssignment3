Walking through woods in the streets every nights
I walked into people who walk too close
Into each other they're hanging so bright
I am told as a mother you may remember her

In the name of the father but never the ghost
Me I need the money for those just as hard
Who hung he said for the ladies I'll pretend That he did

She loves you, she loves you, she loves you so hard
The wonder the person to have you cannot
Charley is a sinner, tell me teacher
To put on your light and then turn around

Ah ah ah!

Silent machine is here to make sure
To put on your light and then turn around
You lie, you lie, you lie...a lie

She loves you, she loves you, she loves you so hard
The wonder the person to have you cannot
Charley is a sinner, tell me teacher
To put on your light and then turn around

If there ever was a religious figure
In my age it don't count to have butter cup house

She loves you, she loves you, she loves you so hard
The wonder the person to have you cannot
Charley is a sinner, tell me teacher
To put on your light and then turn around

Silent machine is here to make sure
To put on your light and then turn around
You lie, you lie, you lie...a lie

Ah ah ah!
