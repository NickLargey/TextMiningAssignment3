Thinking suicide 

Look at my eyes (Suicide) 
I need a disguise 
To hide my lies 
Oh god 
What have I done 
To myself 
To her 

Before your eyes 
What could drive me so mad 
To lose what we had 
The mystery remains inside 
Want to make it real 
Like it was before 
And I lost the bond 
Cause I shut the door 
In search of ways to be myself 
But ended up like somebody else 

Trusted me 
Honored me 
Fought for me 
Cried for me 
Lived for me 
Died for me 

Open my eyes I see the walls 
White as snow 
They don't seem strong 
Betrayed myself 
Opened my eyes 

Can't see those walls I feel so dumb 
Like a fuckin' bum 
Preferred to run 
Then face the fact I stabbed your back 

I understand that 
Did not deserve that 
You can't go back 
Do you see it? 
Oh my god What have I done? 

Please forgive me f*ck that! I feel 
So hated 
So aggravated 
So frustrated I can't explain it 
The way that I feel I feel so dumb 
Like a fuckin' bum 
Preferred to run 
Then face the fact I stabbed your back I'm a victim 

Slippin' through the system 
Victim 
Slippin' through the system 
Open my eyes 
Can't see those walls I feel so dumb 
Like a fuckin' bum 
Preferred to run 
Then face the fact I stabbed your back 
I understand that 
Did not deserve that You can't go back 
Do you see it? 
Oh my god What have I done 
Please forgive me f*ck that I feel 

So hated 
So aggravated 
So frustrated I can't explain it 
The way that I feel I feel so dumb 
Like a fuckin' bum 
Preferred to run 
Then face the fact I stabbed your back I'm a victim 

Slippin through the system 
Victim Slippin through the system 
Victim Slippin through the system 
Victim Slippin through the system 
Victim Slippin through the system 
Victim Victim Victim Victim Victim Victim Victim Victim
