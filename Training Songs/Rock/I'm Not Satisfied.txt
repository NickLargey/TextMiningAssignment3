Yeah!
Got no place to go
(I'm tired of walking
Up and down the street all by myself)

No love left for me to give
(I tried and tried
But no one wants me the way I am)
Why should I pretend I like

To roam from door to door
Maybe I'll just kill myself
I just don't care no more
Because

I'm not satisfied
Everything I've tried
I don't like the way
Life has been abusing me

Yeah!
Yeah!
Who would care
If I was gone

(I never met no one
Who'd care if I was dead and gone)
Who needs me
To care for them

(Nobody needs me
Why should I just hang around?)
Why should I just sit and watch
While the others smile

I just wish that someone cared
If I was happy for a while
Because
I'm not satisfied

Everything I've tried
I don't like the way
Life has been abusing me
Yeah!
