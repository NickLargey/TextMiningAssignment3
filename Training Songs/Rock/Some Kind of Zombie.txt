I must have been,
Confused or vain
To let this evil in my brain
Lord did I, 
Enjoy the change 
That you made inside my heart

Oh here they come
But I'm not afraid
There's no temptation 
I can't evade

Stand up straight 
Look through the haze
I begin to walk
Through the maze
Here they come 
They're all up on me
But I'm dead to sin like 
Some kind of zombie

I hear you speak and I obey
Some kind of zombie
I walked away from the grave
Some kind of zombie
I will never be afraid
Some kind of zombie
I gave my life away

I'm obliged and obey
I'm enslaved to what you say

Oh here they come
But I'm not afraid
There's no temptation 
I can't evade

Stand up straight 
Look through the haze
I begin to walk
Through the maze
Here they come 
They're all up on me
But I'm dead to sin like 
Some kind of zombie

I hear you speak and I obey
Some kind of zombie
I walked away from the grave
Some kind of zombie
I will never be afraid
Some kind of zombie
I gave my life away

Stand up straight 
Look through the haze
I begin to walk
Through the maze
Here they come 
They're all up on me
But I'm dead to sin like 
Some kind of zombie

I hear you speak and I obey
Some kind of zombie
I walked away from the grave
Some kind of zombie
I will never be afraid
Some kind of zombie
I gave my life away

Some kind of Zombie
I will never be afraid
Some kind of Zombie
I will never be afraid
Some kind of Zombie
I will never be afraid
Some kind of Zombie
