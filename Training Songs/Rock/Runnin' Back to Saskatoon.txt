I been hangin' around gas stations
I been learnin' 'bout tires
I been talkin' to grease monkeys

Red Deer, Terrace, Hanna, Medicine Hat
Sing another prairie tune
Sing another prairie tune

I been hangin' around libraries
I been learnin' 'bout books

I been workin' on words, phrases

Moose Jaw, Broadview, Moosomin too
Runnin' back to Saskatoon
Red Deer, Terrace, Hanna, Medicine Hat
Sing another prairie tune
Sing another prairie tune
