Everybody's always looking for Jack
In the fire and in the water
Everybody's always looking for Jack
In the streets and on the corners

I always wanted to be like Jack
He's as cool as they come
Yeah, I always wanted to be like Jack
Still for me, he's the one

Someday, someday
Someday, someday

Hear the wind blow through the long grass
I hear laughter in the night
No revelations as the years pass
Just disappear from sight

As I grow older, I grow younger
Every day is like a dream
I wouldn't go back for a moment
Except for maybe seventeen

Someday, someday
Someday, someday

Everybody's always looking for Jack
In the fire and in the water
Everybody's always looking for Jack
In the streets and on the corners

Yeah, even Jack is always looking for Jack
He's always in another room
And when I spoke to the woman there
She said, "He left this afternoon"

Someday, someday
Someday, someday

Someday, someday
Someday, someday
