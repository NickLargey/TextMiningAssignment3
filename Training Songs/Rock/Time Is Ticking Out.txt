We better think about the things we say
We better think about the games we play
The world went round, yeah, around and round

We better think about the consequences
We better think about the global census
If time went down, yeah, if time went down

What about Chernobyl
What about radiation
We don't know, we don't know

What about deprivation, gluttony, the human nation
We don't know, we don't know

For me love is all
Time is ticking out
   
Looks like we've screwed up the ozone layer
I wonder if the politicians care
The dime went down, yeah, if time went down

What about our children then
Is there nothing left for them
We don't know, we don't know
For me love is all

I need the oxygen, I need the oxygen

For me love is all
To do do do 
Time is ticking out yeah time is ticking out
