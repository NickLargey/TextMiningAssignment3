Hopscotch, double dutch and going fishin
It dont matter if youre playin or wishin
Feelin like we are too far gone

And every day, its like a warning baby
A warning baby
Definitely darkest before the dawn

And I know
It takes more than words to make us whole

Into the deep we go
Baby til I drown
Into the deep we go
