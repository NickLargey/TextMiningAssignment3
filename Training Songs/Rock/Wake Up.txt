Production of deadly chemical arms
Lusting for power
Battle lines drawn 
Troops in position 
Battalions await 
Sowing the seeds of our impending fate 
Ashes to ashes, 
Bodies to burn
Senseless and endless 
They never learn

[Chorus]
Wake up screaming 
Wake up screaming 
Wake up screaming 
Wake up screaming 

A bomb the life from mother and son
God is a bullet, 
Heaven a gun 
Superior fashioned from nuclear waste 
The well has been poisoned 
Just have a taste 
We had all the peace money could buy 
That's over now, 
We're all gonna die

[Chorus]
