Big ideals I can't suppress
Little lies I do detect
Through pleasure, pain, delight and wonder
But there's the rub of irony
Where indecision slices me
From high of highs, it pulls me under

There will always be two different views
Of the same thing baby
Two many views that can collide
There will always be those two different views
Too many views with loaded pride

Emotions sway from side to side
Devotion preys upon my pride
I will respect the winner in the battle for my mind
These jealousies and dumb regrets
Wasting time just beckons death
Here today and gone tomorrow

There will always be two different views
Of the same thing baby
Two many views and reasons why
There will always be those two different views
Too many views to satisfy

As I stray from either side
Too confused to fantasize
Like a judge who needs forgiveness

But is there peace for two as one?
What divides can be undone
Regain the pulse of what was priceless

There will always be two different views
There will always be two different views
There will always be two different views

Big ideals I can't suppress
Little lies I do detect
Through pleasure, pain, delight and wonder

Emotions sway from side to side
Devotion preys upon my pride
Will I respect the winner in the battle for my mind?
