Oh the trees will all bend down and kiss you/ As you head to the land of the smog/ No one will be there to greet you/ But your friends are all coming along/ You need a brand new plan/ While I need someone with hands/ No one will give a damn/ 'Cause they've already cared too much/ No need to ask your family/ 'Cause your family is never right/ No need to ask forgiveness/ You will get on that bus tonight/ I said it's a shame/ You changing your name/ Ramona/ No one will ever respect you/ 'Cause you've always been pampered and paid/ No one who works would mistake you/ For someone who carries his weight/ You need a brand new scheme/ And I need a brand new song/ No one will be there to sing it/ But it's alright/ 'Cause it's all wrong/ No need to ask your family/ 'Cause your family is never right/ No need to ask forgiveness/ You will get on that bus tonight/ I said it's a shame/ You changing your name/ Ramona/ I said it's a shame/ You changing your name/ Ramona/ Oh no/ Have a good time/ She will/ Have a good time/ She will/ Have a good time/ Have a good time/ I won't.
