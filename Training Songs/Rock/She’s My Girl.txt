Morning, Morning Glory.
If you'd like to know where was I last night.

Well I saw a girl with a bullet in her eye
And she's so out of sight

She's my girl
And that's wehere I was last night
off in a dream

She's my girl
I took her away last night
Went for a ride.

Off in the sky
that's were I was last night.

I just come back to tell ya
there's a little bit of heaven underneath the apple tree
Every time I see you with that smile upon your face
a little bit there for me

She's my girl 
and that's where I was last night
Went for a ride

She's my girl 
Took her away last night
We went for a ride.

My girl
We went for a whirl last night
up in the sky

My girl
Took me a way last night
off in the sky

My girl
Went for a whirl last night.
getting so high
Off in the sky that's where I was last night.

My girl
Took her away last night
that's where I was last night
Took her away last night
off in the sky..
My Girl
We went for a whirl last night.
