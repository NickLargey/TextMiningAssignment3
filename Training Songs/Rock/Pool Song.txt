When I was young
Tucked in the bed
Just like a dream
You crept into my head

They're always looking for something
They're always waiting close

Where have you gone
Out there alone
Returned the calls?
We sent letters from home

They're always looking for something
They're always waiting close

But all you can do is wait till they come through
You know they will
And when it's over, you feel much older
You've had your fill

We weren't like that
Like all of those
I remember when 
You showed me all your clothes

But they're always looking for something
They're always waiting close

But all you can do is wait till they come through
You know they will
And when it's over, you feel much older
You've had your fill
