LLand of the free and we're united, make our destiny, we take control, 
Yeah, never divided, we got the power and we'll never be, divided we fall, 
Oh yeah, land of the free, free to conspire, control destiny, 
Oh yeah, you're gonna see, no use resistin', 
You're livin' in the land of the free, free to control your life, 
Land of the free, free to control your mind, land of the free?
Land of the free, united nations of hypocrisy, profit's our goal, 
We're incorporated, it's big business and oil companies controlling us all, 
Oh yeah, land of the free, free to conspire, control destiny, 
Oh yeah, you're gonna see, no use resistin', 
You're livin' in the land of the free, free to control your life, 
Land of the free, free to control your mind, land of the free?

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of hypocrisy
And to the republic for which it stands, one nation,
Without liberty and justice for all

Land of the free, free to control your life, land of the free, 
Free to control your mind, land of the free, land of the free, 
Free to control your life, land of the free, free to control your mind, 
Land of the free?

Yeah, right
