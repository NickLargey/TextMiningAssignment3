Verse One
There Is A Thread
Running Between
The First And The Last
Breath That We Breathe

And In This Strand
Of Flesh And Bone
Reside The Hopes
And Dreams We Call Our Own.

Chorus
And There's A Hand
That Sews The Threads Together
Around One Strand
Of Saving Scarlet Thread

Come As You Are
Weary, Worn, And Tattered
Come And Take
Your Place Among The Threads.

Verse Two
There Is A Thread
Sometimes Unseen
Moving Through Life's Tapestry
And When This Strand
Enters A Soul
It's Woven To The One That Makes
Us Whole.

Chorus
And There's A Hand
That Sews The Threads Together
Around One Strand
Of Saving Scarlet Thread

Come As You Are
Weary, Worn And Tattered
Come And Take Your Place
Among The Threads
Come And Take Your Place
Among The Threads.
