You know I didn´t mean to hurt you baby
I didn´t really mean to cause you pain
So if you want I will cover you with kisses
And I will be your slave again

I need your love to understanding baby
But you changed the lock on your front door
If you want I will cover you with roses
Want to be your slave again

I want to be your, I want to be your, I want to be your slave, slave
You know I´m getting tired of back door loving
You give me all my heart desires
Lord have mercy then I slipped
And fell and I broke your heart
Want to be your slave again

I want to be your, I want to be your, I want to be your slave, slave
I want to be your slave, slave

If you want I will cover you with kisses
Sweet surrender to your touch
If you want take all I give
I want to be your slave
Want to be your slave again

(Solo)
So here I am waiting to see you baby
Stacking roses around your front door
I miss you love, I miss your loving touch now mama
I want to be your slave again

I want to be your, I want to be your, I want to be your, I want to be your
I want to be your, I want to be your, I want to be your
I want to be your slave, slave
I want to be your slave, slave
