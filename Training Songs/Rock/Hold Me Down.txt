I'm in the wind
I am going to let it take me where it may
Maybe it lifts me to
New Orleans orthe dark streets of L.A.

I'm in the wind
And I am in the wind
And if I fall to where you're standing
Will you tend to me?

I'm in the wind
I am in the wind
And if I end up in your arms
Will you help me stay?

I want your comfort for the evening
I need to pause and get my head
Hold me down, baby
Or the wind will catch me out again

I'm in the wind
I don't know long the breeze will let me stay
Maybe your kiss
Maybe your kiss
Will calm the weather down
And let me wait

I want your comfort for the evening
I need to pause and get my head
Hold me down, baby
Or the wind will catch me out again

I'm giving you up
I'm giving you up
I'm giving you up
I'm giving you up again, yeah

I'm giving you up
I'm giving you up
I'm giving you up
I'm giving you up again, yeah

I want your comfort for the evening
I need to pause to get my head
Hold me down, baby
Or the wind will catch me out again

Hold me down
Hold me down
Hold me down
Just keep me for another night
