Cemetery break the stone Mom was right, shoulda stayed at home Seems like all the good old days are gone Back and forth and side to side A lonely boy, a mans disguise Another silhouette against the sky Overcome the obstacle of animosity Take me to my old back yard, security and family When all is said and all is done Iüm not the only one When all is said and all is done Take it all for granted, I donüt mind its all been handed down to me But ill give it back someday Once upon a time a tale, began on a television now I watch it slowly spin away Overcome the obstacle of animosity Take me to my old back yard, security and family When all is said and all is done Iüm not the only one When all is said and all is done Clean the slate, turn the page Lonely boy has paved the way Mom was right, I should have stayed at home When all is said and all is done Iüm not the only one When all is said and all is done Iüm not the only one When all is said and all is done Iüm not the only one When all is said and all is done seems like all the good old days are gone
