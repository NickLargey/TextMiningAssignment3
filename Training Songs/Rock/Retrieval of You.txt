I drive by Airports three times a day
Synchronizing every single move
It's on the airwaves you're coming my way
Sure I don't have much to lose
I'm a fumbled wrecked star
They call me DJ Mini-Mart
'Cause that's where I work

Everybody knows I fell afoul of fame
And you're to blame that I am What's his name
I'm setting an example you're the one I choose
For page two news it's my retrieval of you

For right behind you don't turn around
I was the one who cut your first song
Get in the backscat keep your head down
Didn't I shout it out all night long
Now you're a fabled wrecked star
And I'm DJ Mini-Mart
'Cause that's where I work

Everybody knows I fell afoul of fame
And you're to blame that I am What's his name
I'm setting an example you're the one I choose
For page two news it's my retrieval of you

I've got a boxcar with blankets and bread
In sector 9 where no one goes
I bought a pillow for your precious head
You'll be fine once you get to know me again
I'm a fumbled wrecked star
Call me DJ Mini-Mart
'Cause that's where I work

Everybody knows I fell afoul of fame
And you're to blame that I am What's his name
I'm setting an example you're the one I choose
For page two news it's my retrieval of you

I drive by airports practicing retrieval of you
