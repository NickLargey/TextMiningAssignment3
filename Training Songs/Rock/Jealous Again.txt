You're jealous again No, she's just a friend Why can't I do anything without being yelled at? Always on the phone Never leave me alone Why don't you just tell me what you want from me Said I'll never leave you, No I'll never leave you It's not the end, No it's not the end I won't beat you up But I won't push you around Because if I do that the cops would grab me for doin' it I want to go and have some fun Go where the action is Who the hell are you to tell me who my friends are Said I'll never leave you, No I'll never leave you It's not the end, No it's not the end Said I'll never leave you, No I'll never leave you It's not the end, No it's not the end You're jealous again You're jealous again You're jealous again and again and again and again and again and again and again
