And you said rise above
Open your eyes up
And you said rise above
But I can't
I can't

How long will it take
Before these feelings
Go away
How much longer do I wait
And are there any real answers
Anyway

Your silence in a crowded room
Louder than the loudest tune
I hang on every word

And you said rise above
Open your eyes up
And you said rise above
But I can't
I can't

I miss you in everything
I was too fast traveling
To take you in
I know, silence is no crime
Just wish I could hear you fill it up

One more time

Yes, I know what you'd say to me
Exactly what you said to me
I Still hang on every word

And you said rise above
Open your eyes up
And you said rise above
Yourself

In a time of treason
Is there time for trust
Where there's no them
Only us
Is there time for reason?
Has your heart had enough
Is it time to let go
And rise above?

And you said rise above
Open your eyes to love
And you said rise above
Yourself
