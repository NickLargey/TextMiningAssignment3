[Chorus]
Lady of the dawn, you opened up my sleeping eyes,
I never knew that I was born.
Well, I like you for your body, but I love you 'cause you're wise,
I am your prisoner, oh my lady of the dawn.

You are the dealer,
In this strange, uncertain game,
Take my cards and deal again,
I can feel my life is changing.
Woman,
Now you've taught me how to learn,
Teach me to earn
The love you give to me,
The love you give to me.

[Chorus]

I was waiting,
In the darkness of the night,
Only now I see the light
Softly shining in the silence.
Woman,
If you really hold the key,
Turn it for me,
And help me understand,
And help me understand.

[Chorus]
