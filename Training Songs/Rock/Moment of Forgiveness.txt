Well I guess that I was lonely
That's why I called you on the phone
'Cause in a moment of forgiveness
I didn't wanna be alone 

And I guess that I was willin'
More than I ever was before
'Cause in a moment of forgiveness
I come a knockin' at your door 

Baby I woke up crying last night
Just to realize that you were gone
Has it been two long years without you
Tell me now
When are you gonna come home 

Guess that I was hoping
That you'd finally understand
And in a moment of forgiveness
You'd reach out and take my hand 

Now baby I know (baby I know)
You're not one for bearing witness 
And you told me that (one wrong move)
One wrong move is gonna sell you out
And I see that you kept your word (see that you kept your word)
And made it harder than it had to be
Wish I could save you the trouble baby (oh oh oh)
Give you a little piece of mind
