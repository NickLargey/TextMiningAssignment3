Hot thoughts melting my mind
Could be your accent mixing with mine
You got me uptight, twisting inside
Hot thoughts all in my mind and all of the time, babe

Hot thoughts all in my mind and all of the time, yeah
Hot thoughts all in, all in my mind all of the time (woo)

Your teeth shining so white
Light up this sad street in Shibuya tonight
Hot thoughts melting my cool
Is it your motion, signal and cue?
Hot thoughts all in my mind and all of the time
You must be trouble for sure

Hot thoughts all in my mind and all of the time, yeah
I’ll tell it to your soul
I want you to know
Hot thoughts all in, all in my mind all of the time

Took time off from my kingdom
Took a break from the walk
Took time off from my kingdom
Raise up my creatures
Diamonds from space
Pure facets and features
That drag drug from your lips
Making you think how good it was to let baby kiss on the lows
Hot thoughts melting your cool
Could be the motion, the signal and cue
You’ve got

Hot thoughts all in your mind all of the time
I’ll hold it to my rind
Make up your mind, yeah
Oh, you know, I think I, I think all your love is a lie
