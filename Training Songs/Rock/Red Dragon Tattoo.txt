Monday, gonna take a ride on the N train,
Down to coney island with the money I saved,
Gonna get me engraved.

Drink down a lot of Basil Hayden,
Get kicked out when I can't see straight and,
What an island to be on,
Under the neon

Red Dragon tattoo,
Is just about on me,
I got it for you,
So now do you want me,
With nothing to prove,
Will you be my honey,
Oh yeah

In you I confide,
Red Dragon Tattoo,
I'm fit to be dyed am I fit to have you

I hear the man,
Say you want to see the others,
A Mermaid,
And a heart that says mother,
But I don't know from maritime,
And I never did hard time,
I brought a .38 special CD collection,
Some bactine to prevent infection,
And Incase I get queasy,
A photo of easy rider

Red Dragon tattoo,
Is just about on me,
I got it for you,
So now do you want me,
With nothing to prove,
Will you be my honey,
Oh Yeah

In you I confide,
Red Dragon Tattoo,
I'm fit to be dyed am I fit to have you,
Will you stop pretending, I've never been born,
Now how I look a little more like that guy from korn,
If you came a little bit closer,
You'd see it isn't painted on,
Oh no no
