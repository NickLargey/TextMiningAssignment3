Do you ask yourself why
You run scared, with nowhere to go
Your heart full of Sundays
The surface of saturday nights
You stare at the floor
The fistful of dreams that you crave
Got burned out on nicotine stains
When nobody called

Tell me why, you're alone my friend
Tell me why, do you fill yourself on empty
Tell me why, you're alone again

Do you ask yourself why
You don't care for no-one at all
You trip on the mainline
You're bound to the static that's there
All you've ever known

Tell me why, you're alone my friend
Tell me why, do you fill yourself on empty
Tell me why, you're alone again

Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
Nobody knows you're all alone
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
Nobody knows the way to go
