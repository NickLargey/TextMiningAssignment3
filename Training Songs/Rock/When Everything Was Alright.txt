There goes my mind there goes my mind
And it's the same mistake I've made so many times
That my own mother think I'm blind

You can't be true, you can't be true
And I'm spending all my money
Making sure that things are going right for you

Starting it over to a time when everything was alright
When everything was alright to the time
When everything was alright to the time
When everything was alright

You got no love, you got no love
And don't come crying home girl
When you realize you ain't got no love

I'm coming down, I'm coming down
And I'm paranoid of everything
Yeah girl you got me living underground
(Yeah you know what I'm talking about)

Starting it over back then when everything was alright
When everything was alright to the time
When everything was alright to the time
When everything was alright

When jaundice went away in 1997
They said your liver's fine now
But you're never goin' to heaven

'Cause of what you've done
'Cause of what you've done
I said listen son It's 'cause of what you've done

Starting it over back then when everything was alright
Yeah everything was alright, everything was alright to the time
When everything was alright to the time
When everything was alright to the time
When everything was alright
