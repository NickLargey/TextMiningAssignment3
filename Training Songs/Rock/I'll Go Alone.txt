Muskets aimed right at my head
It's just our job to do they said
Have you anything to say
A preacher whispered and swayed
Why a man in a checked shirt shot him down on the ground
Tell the dream I have all alone
And I know when I go I'll go alone
You make me fell like I am
What I am
I seem much older than then
But I'm young, why feel down
My eyes are closed
I cannot speak
Though I hear you talk to me
Where's a man I saw dead cold
I'll count ten and make sure
Here I am with my hands bound in a plane going down fast
Tell the dream I have all alone
And I know when I go I'll go alone
Where can I find you to tell you the truth
I'll raise a flag of white satin brocade
Why feel down
Muskets aimed right at my head
I closed my eyes there in my bed
People talk and I don't hear a word
All that they say I can say with a nod
Why feel down
The captain cried out to his mate
That man has had his time don't wait
Have you anything to say
A preacher whispered and swayed
Why a man in a checked shirt shot him down on the ground
Tell the dream I have all alone
And I know when I go I'll go alone
