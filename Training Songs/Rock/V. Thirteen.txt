Good morning Sodom and Gomorrah, good morning sinners
No, that wasn't your radio set on the bleep again
Sodom and Gomorrah, let the DJ play
'Cos I'm only gone tomorrow and here today

Lotta rockheads on the block
Dougie died and Sue got frocked
If the stove is hot, then I ain't lost
And Rosa says my star is crossed

Little Jamie writes V. Thirteen
Comes in by the door, goes out by screen
He don't listen to me, he knows everything
Girls on the avenue ask me to sing

Sodom and Gomorrah, let the DJ play
'Cos I'm only gone tomorrow and here today

The paper drags and folds me down
Like a paper cup, I fly around
I've been eating food that ain't been checked
And the Russian rain is beating down my neck

Screen blackout on the southern war
Cue talk breakdown on point forty four
There must be a place, the preacher says, "I guess"
But a drifter will tell you, no place is best

Shout for all the people who have nothing to say
'Cos we're only gone tomorrow and here today

Was a one-off dirt jam when England came good
One night in a thousand, they've played knock on wood
We used to go roamin', go roamin' around
When you don't look for something, it's sure to be found

Sodom and Gomorrah, let the DJ play
'Cos I'm only gone tomorrow and here today
Shout for all the people who have nothing to say
'Cos we're only gone tomorrow and here today

Sodom and Gomorrah, let the DJ play
'Cos I'm only gone tomorrow and here today
Yes, I'm only gone tomorrow and here today
Sodom and Gomorrah, this is London gov
