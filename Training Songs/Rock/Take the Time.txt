Where the hell are you running to
Trying to find yourself a life'
Look at yourself, you're standing still
The night could cut you like a knife

There's no hope now left in this world
So you think and you still fly
Take the time to look in front of you
It's a matter of your mind

Waiting for the night to come
Tell me how you feel inside
Don't you know which way to run'
It's a matter of your pride, matter of your pride
Matter of your pride

Tired of people talking what they're gonna do
What they said or should've done
Now I'm not waiting around for the axe to fall
Take my chances on the run

There's no hope now left in this world
So you think and you still fly
Take the time to look in front of you
It's a matter of your mind

Waiting for the night to come
Tell me how you feel inside
Don't you know which way to run'
It's a matter of your pride, matter of your pride
Matter of your pride, matter of your pride
Matter of your pride

Take your time, think it over
Take your time, think it over
Take the time to look in front of you
Take the time to look in front of you
Take the time to look in front of you
Take the time to look in

Take the time to look in front of you
Take the time to look in front of you
Take the time to look in front of you
Take the time to look in front of you
