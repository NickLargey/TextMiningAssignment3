The way she sees me
She's always leads me
Thru the night 
She's out to tease me
With a glance
I take a chance
From the start 
I'm in a trance
It's time you're mine
She's just taken you for a ride
You're alone
Out on your own
And then you know
Know she lied

Chorus 1:
Some other deal
Some other way
I hate to say
Don't you know
Love's a bitch
Some other deal
Some other way 
All I can say
Don't you know
Love's a bitch
(Love's a bitch)

The road to a mountain
Seems so long the farther you get
You sing the same old song, yeah
As I get higher
I feel the fire
Oh you're my one desire
In time you're fine
And she's just taken you for a ride
You're alone
Out on your own
And then you know
Know she lied, yeah

Chorus 1

Oh yeah yeah yeah

Chorus 2:
Some other deal
Some other way
All I can say
Don't you know
Love's a bitch
Some other deal
Some other way
All I can say
Don't you know
Love's a bitch
Don't you know 
Love's a bitch

Put out the booze
Cause you can't lose
I hate to break ya
Of all the bad news
Now here's the thing
To keep you straight
You gotta get up
But you know it's too late
It's time you're mine
She's just taken you for a ride
You're alone
Out on your own
And then you know
Know she lied

Chorus 2

Some other deal 
Some other way
I hate to say
Don't you know
Love's a bitch
Some other deal
Some other way
I hate to say
But don't you know
Love's a bitch
Well don't you know 
Love's a bitch
