She's a skin art junkie all cute and petite 
All her fat cat schemes don't look around 
Don't you even blame me 
It's a real bad thing to spill your shades for a blind man to 
Find it 
Who can feel the whole earth move and don't even mind it 

I want to know You 
Better than I do 
Relieve me from myself  bring me Into You 
I want to know You 
Better than I do 
Relieve me from myself  bring me Into You 

She's a want to be hero 
Yeah, she try to be strong 
And the end of the hour 
You find that that tower ain't standing so tall 
It's a real hard thing 
To show you weakness 
If anyone can love you, I know my King does 

I want to know You 
Better than I do 
Relieve me from myself, bring me Into You 
I want to know You 
Better than I do 
Relieve me from myself, bring me into 

Your holiness 
Your kingdom 
Your righteousness 
My freedom 

She's an easy scare 
She's a simple bluff 
She's a timid girl 
She's in love 

I want to know You 
Better than I do 
Relieve me from myself, bring me into you 
I want to know You 
Better than I do 
Relieve me from myself, bring me into you
