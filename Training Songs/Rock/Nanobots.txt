(Grow the nanobots up)
Grow the nanobots up
(Grow them in the cracks in the sidewalk)
Grow them in the cracks in the sidewalk
Wind the nanobots up (Wind them up and ask them a question)
Wind them up and ask them a question

(Raise the yellow bots up)
Raise the yellow bots up
(Raise them up and make them respect us)
Raise them up and make them respect us
Wind the marching bots up (Wind them up and wish them away)
Wind them up and wish them away

After all the hullabaloo
We very nearly forgot about you
Now all the old troubles will soon be at an end
When all the neurons begin when we send the signal
To the newborn citizenship
Of the micronations
Sleeper cells awaken, now this is your plan
Hear the voices tuned into the confederates
See the tiny figures stretching their limbs
Stand back and watch them

Grow the nanobots up
Grow them in the cracks in the sidewalk
Wind the nanobots up
Wind them up and wish them away

The sun is rising in the wrong place
I would decorate the room but there's no more space
All I see is pictures of matchstick men
I turn my back for two minutes and they've grown again
They're arranging beds
Using what's available
In their hand-me-downs
Making do with leftovers
Looking up, reading comic books
Sitting three-deep in each other's laps
On the messed up notebook of the van
Riding on the tidal wave where they

(Grow the nanobots up)
Grow the nanobots up
(Grow them in the cracks in the sidewalk)
Grow them in the cracks in the sidewalk
Wind the nanobots up (Wind the nanobots up)
Wind them up and wish them away

Raise the yellow bots up (Raise the yellow bots up)
Raise them up and make them respect us
(Raise them up and make them respect us)
Wind the marching bots up (Wind the nanobots up)
Wind them up and make them to send a signal
To the newborn citizenship
Of the micronations
Sleeper cells awaken now
This is your, this is your time
