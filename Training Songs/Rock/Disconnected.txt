Maybe I'm just out of place in the modern world
Don't wanna go to their My Space, I wanna talk to girls
Now I'm letting go
Cause I'm getting so

Disconnected
Disconnected
So call me old or jaded
Cause I'm so disconnected

Maybe I don't agree with the world today
I'm feeling oh so analogue in a digital age
I tune to my favorite show
Alienation radio.

Disconnected
Disconnected
So call me old or jaded
Cause I'm so disconnected

Don't take away the essence
And what's important in everything

You live your life online
I'll pull the plug and live mine

So disconnected
Disconnected
So call me old or jaded
Cause I'm so disconnected

Disconnected
Disconnected
So call me old or jaded
Cause I'm so disconnected

Cause I'm so disconnected [Repeat: x2]
