Some say it's better off this way
Now it's over
You say, "The future's looking gray
If it's over"

Yeah, there's sorrow as we break
But it's over
Yeah, we've had all we could take
So it's over

Stow away memories of yesterday
To think over
Run away, the truth you can't betray
Or pushover

Yeah, there's silence as we break
'Cause it's over
Yeah, you've made your last mistake
So it's over

Words they hurt, fingers point blame
Look to yourself and do the same
Painful thing to admit
This puzzle piece just won't fit

But we tried, and we pushed so hard
'Til something had to give
Still we cried, and I screamed so loud
I'm sure you had to hear

Now my fingers bleed and I need some relief
Because my back it breaks
So, I let you down before you fall
But still my heart it aches

Judgment day, the good and bad we weigh
And look over
Cast away your negative display
And start over

Yeah, there's silence as we break
'Cause it's over
Yeah, you've made your last mistake
So it's over

Yeah, there's sorrow as we break
But it's over
Yeah, we've had all we could take
So it's over
