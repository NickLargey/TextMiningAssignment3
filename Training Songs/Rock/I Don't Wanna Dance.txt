I don't want to dance no more
Not since you walked out the door
Left without a second glance
That's the end of my romance
No more fancy footwork in the nightclub
I'm a still point in a turning world

I don't want to dance tonight
I can hardly stand the sight
Of lovers moving on the floor
There's a memory I can't ignore
Of listening to the D.J. play the record
Take your partner and move around
And I'm dancing in my baby's arms again

I don't want to dance
Not without my baby
I don't want to dance
Not without my baby
I don't want to dance

Every night it's always there
The memory of our sad affair
I'm underneath the coloured lights
You're asking me am I alright
I can only answer "I'm the dancer"
Whose sense of rhythm is paralyzed
Til I'm dancing in my baby's arms again

I don't want to dance
Not without my baby
I don't want to dance
Not without my sweetheart
I don't want to dance, not tonight
