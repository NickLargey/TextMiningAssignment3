I'd sing a song for you. 
You know I'd even change my tune. 
I'd pull you up when you drown in the water baby. 
I'd jump the highest mountain, 
swim across the ocean blue, 
I could never imagine you with another baby. 
Am I having a breakdown? 
Am I going insane? 
You do me then leave for another girl. 
I wake up every morning crying you're not there. 
I get the feeling that you're looking for a new beginning. 
You change your mind every minute. 
One day you want me then the next you leave it's never ending, 
I'm getting used to It. 
Tell me how to get to you to get back in you're heart. 
You make it hard should I even bother baby? 
My tongue is tied in two and I believe I need another drink. 
I know you like to watch me sink to the bottom baby. 
Am I having a breakdown? 
Am I going insane? 
You do me then leave for another girl. 
I wake up every morning crying you're not there. 
I don't care what you do now. 
You say you want me now but when you need me just forget it. 
I'm getting used to it.
