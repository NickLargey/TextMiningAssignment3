What a waste of time
The thought crossed my mind
That I never missed a beat
Cant explain the who or what I was
Trying to believe
What would you do
What would you do
Do you know
I once had a grip on everything
It feels better to let go

I'm not over
I'm not over you just yet
Can not hide it
Your not that easy to forget
I'm not over

Never took the chance
Could have jumped the fence
But was scared of my own 2 feet
Could have crossed the line
It was black and white
No contrast to be seen
What would you do
What would you do
Do you know
Was it all a joke
Never had control
I'm not better on my own

I'm not over
I'm not over you just yet
Can not hide it
Your not that easy to forget
I'm not over

What a waste of time
The thought crossed my mind
Can't explain this thing or what I mean
I'm trying to let go

I'm not over
I'm not over you just yet
Can not hide it
Your not that easy to forget
I'm not over

I'm not over
I'm not over you just yet
Can not hide it
Your not that easy to forget
I'm not over

I'm not over
