Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your-your-your-your, forever, forever

I need more dreams
And less life
And I need that dark
In a little more light
I cried tears you’ll never see
So f*ck you, you can go cry me an ocean
And leave me be

You are what you love
Not who loves you
In a world full of the word yes
I'm here to scream

No, No
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll, rock and roll

No, No
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll

Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your-your-your-your, forever, forever

Blood brothers in desperation
An oath of silence
For the voice of our generation

Whoa
How’d it get to be only me?
Like I’m the last damn kid still kicking
That still believes

I will defend the faith
Going down swinging
I will save the songs
That we can't stop singing

No, No
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll, rock and roll

No, No
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll

Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no

Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no

You are what you love
Not who loves you
In a world full of the word yes
I'm here to scream

No, No
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll, rock and roll

No, No
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll

Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no

Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no

Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no
