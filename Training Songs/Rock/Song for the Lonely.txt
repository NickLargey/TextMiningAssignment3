All dressed to die
Underground
Behind the clock
That liberates

Masquerading 
Left no replies
No photographs
No recall

Passing through
Passing through the walls
There must have been
Some time before

Could understand 
But I'm singing for the lonely
Yeah
You keep them in your mind

Oh yeah
Singing for the ones we left behind
Lost in space and time
You keep them in your mind

One single ride
With no return
No address
No Mystery

And no surprises
Caught in the light
there's a lonely boy
On a lonely ride

It must have been
Some time before
Could understand
But I'm singing for the lonely

Yeah
You keep them in your mind
Oh yeah
Singing for the ones we left behind

Lost in space and time
You keep them in your mind
You keep them in your mind
You keep them in your mind
