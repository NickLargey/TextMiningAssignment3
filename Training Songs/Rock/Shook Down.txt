To collapse in a sugar cane
Suck it sweet to kill the pain
There was someone I was looking for
There is no more
My tongue is weak from a kick or two
The word is dry, I think of you
Tie my face to the back of a jet
To keep my essence there

And its been a week
And its been a week too long
There are several things that I've been doing wrong
You see the time it takes for you
Is the time it takes for me
So don't agree

If it's late then I will go
Turn the lights out, turn it slow
Like you turned me upside down
And faced the ground
Spinnin' left I spin at you
Listen girl I think of you
Back up by the back of the chair
I left you there

And its been a week
And its been a week too long
There are several things that I've been doing wrong
You see the time it takes for you
Is the time it takes for me
So don't agree

You can be my destiny
You can mean that much to me
You can be my destiny
You can mean that much to me
You can be my destiny
You can mean that much to me
You can be my destiny
You can mean that much to me
You can be my destiny
