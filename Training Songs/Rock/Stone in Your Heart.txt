Is this how it ends?
We're strangers again
It's over but you won't explain
No kiss no goodbye,not one final lie
Just cold to the bone from the ice's that's runnin' through your veins
You have stone in your heart.

[Chorus]
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na stone in your heart
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na 
What is keepin' us apart?
Stone in your stone heart.

Don't you recall the fire and all
I want you in my arms every night
But now you forget
No passion,no sweat

You poured out your love
And you're tellin' me your well is dry
You have stone in your heart.

[Chorus]
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na stone in your heart
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na 
What is keeping us apart?
Stone in your heart.

Run away and hide 
Keep it inside
Make believe it never happened
All you're goin' do is keep fooling you
Some day you'll find love's been passin' you by.

Will you or fight?
Let's do it right
I'm gonna get it over now
But no feelin' left

No pride to protect
You don't want my love
I don't need you in a wedding gown
You have stone in your heart
