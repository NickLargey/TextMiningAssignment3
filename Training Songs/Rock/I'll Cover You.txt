A million miles across the desert
The wind is blowing, but I'll get through
I'll go the distance and I'll cover you

I'll back you uup when you're in danger
And there's nothing I wouldn't do
I'm your brother, (brother) and I'll cover you

No man is a saint, no man is an island
The beacon is faith, it shines like a diamond in your hand
Will you cover me like I cover you

I'll be there when you need protection
In your darkest moment of truth
Give me a signal (signal) and I'll cover you

It's one from the heart, one for the highway
Survival is nothing new
Maybe I'm a dreamer (dreamer)

No man is a saint, no man is an island
The beacon is faith, it shines like a diamond in your hand
Will you bleed for me like I bleed for you

I'll cover you

There are no winners, there are no sinners
Only victims with nothin' to lose
You're my brother and I'll cover you

Love is the flame, love is the reason
Love is the answer and we are the proof
Just give me a sign
