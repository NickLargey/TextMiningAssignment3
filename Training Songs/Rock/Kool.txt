You want so much for everyone 
To like you for who you really are 
But you care about it so much 
You won't be yourself 
But I know you feel so much better 
Than that and I know you 
Would not have to let someone else 
Do this bullshit to you 
What I want to know is why you let 
Those fucking wankers talk to you like that 

What makes you think they are so cool 

You want so much for everyone 
To like you for who you really are 
But you care about it so much 
You won't be yourself 
Is it because for them 
Everything seems to go so well 
Not like you because you struggle 
For everything like hell 
Let me tell you I respect that 
Because it's easy when it's easy 

What makes you think they are so cool
