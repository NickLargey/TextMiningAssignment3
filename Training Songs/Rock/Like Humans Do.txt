For millions of years, in millions of homes 
A man loved a woman, a child it was born 
It learned how to hurt and it learned how to cry 
Like humans do 

I'm breathing in 
I'm breathing out 
So slip inside this funking house 
Dishes in the sink 
The tv's in repair 
Don't look at the floor 
Don't go up the stairs 

I'm achin' 
I'm shakin' 
I'm breakin' 
Like humans do 

I work and I sleep and I dance and I'm dead 
I'm eatin, I'm laughin and I'm lovin myself 
I never watch tv except when I'm stoned 
Like humans do 

I'm breathing in 
I'm breathing out 
So slip inside this funking house 
Dishes in the sink 
The tv's in repair 
Don't look at the floor 
Don't go up the stairs 

I'm achin' 
I'm shakin' 
I'm breakin' 
Like humans do 

I'm breathing in 
I'm breathing out 
So slip inside this funking house 
Wiggle while you work 
Anybody can 
The rain is pourin in on a woman and a man 

I'm achin' 
I'm shakin' 
I'm breakin' 
Like humans do 
I'm breathing in 
I'm breathing out
