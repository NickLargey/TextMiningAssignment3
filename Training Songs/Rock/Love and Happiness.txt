Wait a minute, something's going wrong
Someone's on the phone
It's three o'clock in the mornin'
Talkin' about, how she can make it right

Well, happiness is when you really feel good about somebody
Nothin' wrong with being in love with someone

Oh baby, love and happiness
(Love and happiness)
Love and happiness
(Love and happiness)

Oh baby, love and happiness
(Love and happiness)
Love and happiness
(Love and happiness)

You be good to me, I'll be good to you
We'll be together, see each other, walk away with victory

Oh, love and happiness
(Love and happiness)
Love and happiness
(Love and happiness)

Now make you do right, lovin' will make you do wrong
Make you come home early, be crawling there
Power of love, women got to love
Got to wrap around the finger, you know now

Love and happiness
Love and happiness
Love and happiness
To the power of love and happiness

Love and happiness
(Love and happiness)
Love and happiness
(Love and happiness)

Love is, wait a minute
Love is, talking to girl
Talking to girl, talking to girl
(Love and happiness)
Love and happiness

Talkin' about love and happiness
Got to ??
(Love and happiness)
Talkin' about my lady
Got to keep me ?? before it's too late
