She talk like a lunatic
She's got her lies
She talk about her politics
While her mother dies
She likes black leather
Bring you to your knees
She takes no orders
Doing just what she please
No, No, No, No, No
Nobody wants a peace of my
Strange love
No, No, No, No, No
Nobody wants a peace of my
Strange love
She works the night shift
Ain't no 9 to 5
This girl's the real thing
Commin' from the other side
If you hear her knocking
It's too late to hide
This woman gonna bring you down
You'll never get out alive
No, No, No, No, No
Nobody wants a peace of my
Strange love
No, No, No, No, No
Nobody wants a peace of my
Strange love
She burns like fire
She's cold as ice
Her eyes of emerald
They'll cut you like a knife
This ones the real thing
Commin' from the other side
This woman gonna take you down
You'll never get out alive
No, No, No, No, No
Nobody wants a peace of my
Strange love
No, No, No, No, No
Nobody wants a peace of my
Strange love
