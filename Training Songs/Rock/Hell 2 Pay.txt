Some say you cards were marked in advance
Gun in your hand and God on your side
a shot rang out on a London night
In a land where justice is a game
As dawn breaks over London town
Hell 2 pay
Revenge you find is nowhere to be found
Forget ? Forgive ? I`m gonna take you down
With a friend started as a brother
I ended with no brother
