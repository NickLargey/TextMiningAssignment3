This little piggy's got more than anybody's got
He's been stuck dumb struck, what about me?
Mirror man, mirror me, dumb dummy can't see
He's walking in my sleep, what about me? Well well

Goodnight valentine, I never saw the sun shine
Goodbye good times, what about me?
Good times never stop, times turning tic toc
You've got more than I've got, What about me?

(Well well)
You could be standing
(Well well well)
In my feet

(Well well well)
You could be walking
(Well well well)
In my sleep
(Well well well)

This is the time to stop
Consider it all
And this is the time to live
I'll wait 'til you call

Well well well
Well well
Well well well

Mirror man, mirror me, dumb dummy can't see
He's walking in my sleep, what about me?

(Well well)
You could be standing
(Well well well)
In my feet

(Well well well)
You could be walking
(Well well well)
In my sleep

(Well well well)
You could be standing
(Well well well)
In my feet

(Well well well)
You could be walking
(Well well well)
In my sleep

Well well well
Well well
Well well well
Well well
Well well well
