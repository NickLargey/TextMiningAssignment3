All the prison walls we won't let them stand 
I got to burn them down. up against the wall  
There's no way they won't make me go 
There's no way no one judges me 

There's no way nobody wants them all the prison walls 
Burn it down. we won't let them stand 
Burn it down I got to burn them down 
Burn it down
