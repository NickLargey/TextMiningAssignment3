We wait to wake to get a ride in the rain 
Buy a ticket they can check we can claim 
So we don't spend what's our own for a 
Seat a place to stop a green light a red 
Cross they run around naked doing old 
Things like the ones before 
Wait for a break so you can take a little 
Something that'll make your next break 
Come along a little quicker than the one 
Before wait for an answer spy a sweet 
Dancer as she walks from the door of the 
Hall wish you waited for your wedding  
Vows so hurry up and wait 
But what's worth waiting for? 
We wait to get warm the car starts from 
Cold stall to make a first move magazines 
Made the rules to make us lose wait for 
Your dream man the house you could both 
Plan the car in the sales ad the wet dream 
With the man you wished that you had 
A watched pot never boils 
Sugars seconds to dissolve 
See your appetite lost 
Foods relevance is lost inside 
So hurry up and wait 
But what's worth waiting for? 
So join the queue me and you 
Wait in line 
It takes our time to be satisfied
