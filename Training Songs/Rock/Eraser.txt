Eraser, eraser
You're never quite there
To feel your empty heart

Eraser, eraser
Eraser, eraser
Eraser, eraser
Eraser, eraser

You know you're out of luck
The feeling's here to stay

Eraser, eraser
Eraser, eraser
Eraser, eraser
Eraser, eraser

It goes the blast of heart
A feeble listening

Eraser, eraser
Eraser, eraser
Eraser, eraser
Eraser, eraser

Eraser
