Only in my dreams, are you really mine dear 
Only in my dreams, are you really mine

Only in my dreams, do I have your love dear
Only in my dreams, in the still of the night 
Hold you tight, you say goodnight

It’s easy baby, to love you in my dreams every night 
But when that sun shines in my window
You leave with the night
Fade from sight, into the night

Only in my dreams, do I hold you tight dear 
Only in my dreams, do I hold you tight
In the night, you say goodnight

It’s easy baby to love you in my dreams every night 
But when that sun shines in my window 
You leave with the night
Fade from sight, into the night

Only in my dreams (only in my dreams)
Only in my dreams (only in my dreams)
Only in my dreams (only in my dreams)
Only in my dreams (only in my dreams)
