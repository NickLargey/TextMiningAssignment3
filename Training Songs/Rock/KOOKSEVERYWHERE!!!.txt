Sweet, sweet heaven it feels like defeat, yeah
The cold, cold blood it covers my feat, yeah
These bitches keep bitchin' and twitchin', oh don't ya know
I know that nobody knows, so go, go, baby don't go

Maybe its cold blood!
Cold blood! C-c-c-cold blood

The cold, cold blood the wall in her chest, yeah
The rubles and gold are from the ole in her ch-ch-ch-chest
But if ya learn something, take nothing from me, yeah
I know that love is a terrible, terrible thing, ahh

Maybe its cold blood!
Cold blood! C-c-c-cold blood

Their eyes are all around me, now they see me, now they don't
Their eyes are all around me, now shes lookin' at a ghost
Their eyes are all around me, now they see me, now they don't
Their eyes are all around me, now shes lookin' at a ghost
And I cried, and I cried 'cause I still love you the most
Their eyes are all around me, now shes lookin' at a ghost
Their eyes are all around me, now they see me, now they don't
I carried, and I carried cause I still love you the most
Their eyes are all around me
Cold, blood
