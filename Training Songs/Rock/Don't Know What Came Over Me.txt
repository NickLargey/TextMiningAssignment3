I was such a lucky man
Before I turned the tables

You were everything to me, whoa yeah
Now I'm like a fallen angel

Made a promise to myself
I would love nobody else
But I don't know what came over me
No, I don't know what came over me
I was such a fool
All I ever cared about was you
Always you, always you

It was only for a night
A moment in madness

But I've paid a heavy price, oh yeah
For these endless days of sadness

Made a promise to myself
That I wouldn't love nobody else
But I don't know what came over me
No, I don't know what came over me
I was such a fool
But all I ever cared about was you
Always you, always you

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Made a promise to myself
That I would love nobody else
But I don't know what came over me (I made a promise to myself)
No, I don't know what came over me (oh, that I would love nobody else)
But I don't know what came over me (I was such a fool)
No, I don't know what came over me (I wish that I knew)
But I don't know what came over me (all I ever cared about was you)
No, I don't know what came over me (don't know what, over me)
I don't know what came over me
