We all make our plans, we all have our choices
Try on different faces, talk in other voices
I said a lot of things that never let me sleep
Made promises I really meant to keep
I'm not ashamed of the things I've done
I took the blame when I could have run
I'm not ashamed of the things I've done
I know I stayed when I could have gone
I don't expect it to be easy for me
We're tied together by a simple little pledge
Before we know the trust it takes to walk up to that edge
We build a house of cards where the wind has always blown
We build our little garden on a bed of sand and stones
It took to long for me to be who I am
Maybe it's enough for me to be it when I can
I'm not ashamed of the things I've done
I took the blame when I could have run
I'm not ashamed of the things I've done
I know I stayed when I could have gone
I don't expect it to be easy for me
Our little house is where the wind has always blown
Our little garden on a bed of sand and stones
We drift along in quiet waters on the tide
We rise and fall in rhythm almost satisfied
We let ourselves be drawn, let ourselves be used
I only ever wanted to be taken in by you
It took to long for me to be who I am
Maybe it's enough for me to be it when I can
I'm not ashamed of the things I've done
I took the blame when I could have run
I'm not ashamed of the things I've done
I know I stayed when I could have gone
I don't expect it to be easy for me
I'm not ashamed of the things I've done
I took the blame when I could have run
I'm not ashamed of the things I've done
I know I stayed when I could have gone
I don't expect it to be easy for me
