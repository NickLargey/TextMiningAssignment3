It's rainin'
Been rainin' for a long, long time
I don't know when the sun is gonna shine
I'm stranded till the hurricane's through
But at least I know I'm stranded with you
The water is risin' in the town
Last report said more rain's comin' down

It's rainin'
The road is not no place to go
Too bad there ain't no late night show
Stranded till the hurricane's through
But at least I know I'm stranded with you
(Listen to the rain)

Stranded till the hurricane's through 
But at least I know I'm stranded with you
