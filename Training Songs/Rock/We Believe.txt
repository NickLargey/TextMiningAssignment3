I believe there's no evil out there
We didn't have a hand in
You believe it's a time for peace
And a time for understanding

Some of us believe that we are chosen
And if God is on our side, we'll win the game
And some of us believe that there's a heaven
When the trumpets sound and the judges call your name
But let's get it straight

I believe there's just once chance in this world
To hear our brothers
Yeah, you believe there's a better way
To listen to each other

We don't get what the other guy is saying
We hear the words but we don't understand
So around the world the same old anger raging
And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down

We believe there's a better way to fight
There's a way to make our children safe at night, yeah we believe
And we believe there's a war we could be winning
But the only way to win it is to give what we need to receive

I believe we need a hero to step boldly
From the shadows, yeah
You believe there must be someone
On the scene that fits the bill

A man or a woman who knows how to say I'm sorry
With courage in his heart to match his creed
A leader who can build a brand new morning
And match the tide of changes, match the intent with the deed

Oh, we believe there's a deed of obligation
To bring reconciliation
To make peace with every nation
In our time, we believe

We believe there's not a minute
We should be wasting
When the darkness falls
It's too late to fix the crime
It's peace that we need
That's why we believe

Every father, every mother knows the meaning
Human treasure that our leaders do forget
And the bullets fly in the face of common reason
And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

We believe there's a song that's worth the singing
It's a song of truth we're bringing
There's a way to share the Earth with everyone
We believe every creature has a being
Has a right to respect and feeling
To live and breathe and flourish in the sun

Yeah, that's what we believe
Hey, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, that's what we believe
