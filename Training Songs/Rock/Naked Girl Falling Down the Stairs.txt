I went to the museum and stood on a chair. Some girl drew a crowd by what she didn't wear. She made everybody look up there. It was a naked girl fallin' down the stairs! Naked girl fallin' down the stairs. Naked girl fallin' down the stairs. All the way down she was up in the air. Naked girl fallin' down the stairs. It was a naked girl right in my face. High class culture all over the place. My watch stopped tickin'...shoes came unlaced. When I watched her trippin' down a staircase. It looked like a mistake at a steeplechase. A busted flywheel at stock car race. I fell in love at a terrible pace. When someone gave her a shove down a staircase.
