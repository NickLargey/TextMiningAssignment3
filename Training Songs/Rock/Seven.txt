I got a letter, story of frustration
I got a number, counting complications
It's got me running from my situation
Blame it on my own imagination

(Roll the dice)
And tell it like it is
(Count it twice)
And call it what it is

Luck, 1, 2, 3 if you just let it be
4, 5, 6 it's an experience
8, 9, 10 do it all again
While we're waiting on a lucky number 7

I wouldn't talk if it's not a solution
A second thought is only an illusion
And talking trash just adds to the pollution
Blaming it on all of my confusion

(Must be strong)
To tell it like it is
(Can't be wrong)
To tell it what it is

Luck 1, 2, 3 if you just let it be
4, 5, 6 it's an experience
8, 9, 10 do it all again
While we're waiting on a lucky number 7
While we're waiting on a lucky number 7

I need a 7 or maybe 11
It's some kind of heaven for the lucky in
I need a 7 or maybe 11
It's some kind of heaven for the lucky in

Luck 1, 2, 3 my advice
4, 5, 6 roll the dice
8, 9, 10 take a chance
While we're waiting on a lucky number 7

Could be luck
(If you just let it be)
Don't you run
(It's an experience)
Be yourself, tell it like it is
(Luck, luck,luck, luck, luck, luck, luck )

Luck 1, 2, 3 if you just let it be
4, 5, 6 it's an experience
8, 9, 10 do it all again
While we're waiting on a lucky number 7

1, 2, 3 if you just let it be
4, 5, 6 it's an experience
8, 9, 10 do it all again
While we're waiting on a lucky number 7
While we're waiting on a lucky number 7
(Luck)
