She comes walking down the street
That's the kind, hey,
That's the kind I want to meet
I think I'm making it up
I should be putting it down
And it's beginning to show
I get it fixed in my head
And it won't let go

Oh, I can't help myself
When I feel this way
I want to be someone else
When I get this feeling
It gets in my system
I can't put the brakes on

Now she's walking next to me
That's the place, yeah,
That's the place I want to be
I think I'm making it up
I should be putting it down
And it's beginning to show
I get it fixed in my head
And it won't let go
