I'd like to re-write
History books for all time
The future, the past
Search for the rhyme
The search goes on
For truth in everyone
Numbers on the wall
Counting sad young faces, count them all

The thrill of the fight
Killing's such a noble deed
And John said love is all we need
Should we forget or pause a moment to regret
Where have we been
I see things I wish I'd never seen

[Chorus]

Battle cry, brave men never fear
Battle cry, never shed a tear
Battle cry
All good soldiers hear the battle cry

[Bridge]

So many, many miles from home
Oh lord have mercy on my soul
I think the loneliest man in the
- world is a soldier

Yes I know, try to believe
Political renaissance we need
It's the will of god we must heed
The image fades
To blacks & blues & subtle grey
It's modern song, the cry goes on and on
