I'm about to get wicked
You got me lying on my back
Hallelu-
All will be forgiven
But why you gotta act like that?
Make me beg for you?

I'm wired on Red Bull and Hennessy
Higher than you
I'm on fire, c'mon and get next to me
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you

What's a matter with me?
I can see it in your eyes
After all we've been through (Through, through)
Oh don't you wanna kiss me? (Kiss me, kiss me)
Don't you wanna even try?
And devour the moon

I'm wired on Red Bull and Hennessy
Higher than you
I'm on fire, c'mon and get next to me
I wanna ride with you

And we had it all
Right from the start
Never going back in with your heart (Heart, heart)
And we had it all
It's falling apart
Never getting back again without that spark

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I'm wired on Red Bull and Hennessy
Higher than you
I'm on fire, c'mon and get next to me
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you
