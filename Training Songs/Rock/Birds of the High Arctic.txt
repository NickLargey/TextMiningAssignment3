Baby say it isn’t true
You're never there
It wasn’t you
It’s more than I can do
To try and keep it shiny new
The gap just opens up
Between the words we like to use
And the thing that’s seen
Seen through your eyes now darling
In blue distances calling
Like the birds of the high Arctic
And you don’t have to make the move
No there ain’t nothing left to prove
Accept the plain unvarnished truth
It’s a part of you, you can’t remove
Like a love that’s been
There ain’t no answers darling
Just blue distances calling
Like the birds of the high Arctic

They’re calling
Like the birds of the high Arctic
This darling
For the light in your eyes sparked it
Two sheets to the wind

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Like the birds of the high Arctic
Like the birds of the high Arctic
Like the birds of the high Arctic
Like the birds of the high Arctic

Baby say that it isn’t true, na na
Never there
You were never there
Baby say that it isn’t true, na na
You were never there
You were never there

Baby say that it isn’t true, na na
You were never there
You were never there
Say that it isn’t true, na na
You were never there

Like the birds of the high Arctic
Like the birds of the high Arctic
Like the birds of the high Arctic
