I don't need a whole lot of money
I don't need a big, fine car
I got everything a man could want
I got more than I could ask for
I don't have to run around
I don't have to stay out all night
Cause I got me a sweet, sweet lovin' woman
And she knows just how to treat me right
Well my baby, she's alright
My baby, she's clean out of sight

Don't you know that she's
She's some kind 'a wonderful
She's some kind 'a wonderful
She's some kind 'a wonderful

When I hold her in my arms
She sets my soul on fire
Oo, when my baby kisses me
My heart becomes filled with desire
When she wraps her lovin' arms around me
It drives me out of my mind
Yeah, when my baby kisses me
Chills run up and down my spine
Well my baby, she's alright
My baby, she's clean out of sight

Don't you know that she's
She's some kind 'a wonderful
She's some kind 'a wonderful
She's some kind 'a wonderful

Now is there anybody here got a sweet
Little woman like mine
Got to be somebody got a
Got a sweet little woman like mine
