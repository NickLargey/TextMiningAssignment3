Hey hey, it's okay to make
A little mess out of your life
'Cause you don't need a diagram
To tell you how to have a good time

I said hey
(Hey)
I don't mean to frighten you away
This is cracker soul
It comes so easy
I said hey
(Hey)
I don't get your head a mess
This is just the best
It comes so easy
It comes so easy

Hey hey, it's okay to never know
The answer but ask why
(Why oh why?)
'Cause you don't need another burden
Come and party with your spirit guide

I said hey
(Hey)
Don't get your head a mess
This is cracker soul
It comes so easy
I said hey
(Hey)
Don't get yourself distressed
Love is just the best
When it comes easy
It comes so easy

I said hey
(Hey)
Don't get your head a mess
Just like cracker soul
It comes so easy
I said hey
(Hey)
Don't get yourself distressed
This is just the best
When it comes easy

I said hey
(Hey)
Don't get your head a mess
And live it for the rest
It comes so easy
I said hey
(Hey)
I don't mean to frighten you away
This is cracker soul
It comes so easy
It comes so easy
