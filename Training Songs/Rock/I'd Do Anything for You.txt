Nothin's gonna hurt you 
As long as I am here 
We're both livin'for the dream 

And I won't desert you 
So c'mon and dry your tears 
You know it's never as bad as it seems 

It just kills me 
To see that you've been cryin' 
Everybody needs someone to help 'em sometime 

[Chorus] 
I'd do anything for you 
I'd change the world 
And give it back to you 
And everything I've got 
I'd give it all to you 
I'd do anything for you 

When nobody sees you And nobody hears a word 
Let me be the one you come to 

And all those wishes 
That you thought no one heard 
I would try to make'em come true 

And it just kills me 
To see that you've been cryin' 
Well everybody needs 
Someone to help'm sometime 

[Chorus ]

Look at me 
I'm just like you 
And everything you need 
Well I need it too 

[Chorus ]
I'd do anything for you 
I'd do anything for you
