Sgt. Gonzo says
I am just a freak
I look into your eyes
And all I see is weakness

Sgt. Gonzo says
You're talking to a freak
Why don't we turn things to a plan?
And then we could just freak out

On a roof, escaping streets, trashing Cadillacs
Rocking with Gonzo, rocking with Gonzo is fat

When you hear that sound from the underground
This is it! 
On a roof, escaping streets, trashing Cadillacs
Rocking with Gonzo, rocking with Gonzo

Well, well, if you are into freak
We should do it while we can
I'll supply some anger
And turn into the man

Then I look into your eyes
I look into your soul
I look into your eyes
I look into your soul

On a roof, escaping streets, trashing Cadillacs
Rocking with Gonzo, rocking with Gonzo is fat
On a roof, escaping streets, trashing Cadillacs
Rocking with Gonzo, it's like rocking with God

When you hear that sound from the underground
This is it! 
On a roof, escaping streets, trashing Cadillacs
Rocking with Gonzo, rocking with Gonzo is fat
On a roof, escaping streets, trashing Cadillacs
Rocking with Gonzo, rocking with Gonzo

A face in the crowd
Anger and doubt
Get it?
A face in the crowd
Rocking with Gonzo is fat
On a roof, escaping streets, trashing Cadillacs
Rocking with Gonzo, rocking with Gonzo is fat
On a roof, escaping streets, trashing Cadillacs
Rocking with Gonzo, it's like rocking with God
When you hear that sound from the underground
This is it! 
On a roof, escaping streets, trashing Cadillacs
Rocking with Gonzo, rocking with Gonzo is fat
On a roof, escaping streets, trashing Cadillacs
Rocking with Gonzo is like rocking with God
