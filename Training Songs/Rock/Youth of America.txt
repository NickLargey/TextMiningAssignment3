Youth of America
Is living in the jungle
Fighting for survival with the wrong place to go
Youth of America
There's pressure all around
The walls are coming down the walls are crumbling down on you
It is time we rectify this now
We've got to feel it now
Got to feel it now, now, now...
Whoa!
They attack you from the right side
Down the left side
Down the middle 'til you don't know who you are
Stick around because it don't really matter
They'll try to put you 6 feet under the ground
It is time we rectify this now
We've got to heal it now
Got to heal it now, now, now...
Whoa!
It is time we rectify this now
We've got to save it now
Got to save it now, now, now...
Whoa!
(Whisper)
The rich get richer and the poorer get poorer get poorer...
Now there's no place left to go...
Got to get off this rot...
You don't want to be born here again?
I don't want to be born here again...
Man, this just ain't no existence...
Beware of those guys in disguise...
We're living in the jungle, fighting for survival
Can't wait much longer, hurry...
Ahhhhhhhhhhh.....
Take the risk...
Let it expand your imagination...
Take it...
We have no place left...
No place left
No place left
No place left to go
Ahhhhhhhhhhh...
They attack you from the right side
Down the left side
Down the middle 'til you don't know who you are
Stick around because it don't really matter
They'll try to put you 6 feet under the ground...
It is time we rectify this now
We've got to feel it now
Got to feel it now, now, now
Whoa!
