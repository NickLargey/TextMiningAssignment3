He came bursting out of nowhere
Like a spear into the sky
And he cast his light on everything
It was like he'd never die

And he landed right on target
But the target rolled away
And it left him pointing nowhere
You could hear the children say

"He's the fella
The man who invented himself
He's the fella
The man who invented himself"

When you need her love so badly
But she's trying to relax
You can't work it with your fingers
So you try it with an axe

And he taps you on the shoulder
"Looking out for number one
Is like drilling for a rainbow
Or an iceberg in the sun"

He's the fella
The man who invented himself
He's the fella
The man who invented himself

Nobody knows where he's from
Nobody knows where he's gone and gone and gone
But he's not here

When you're waiting for your baby
To get back from the moon
And throw her arms around you
In a very quiet lagoon

Well, that loneliness is nothing
Just imagine how he feels
He's the only person in the world
Who still believes he's real

He's the fella
The man who invented himself
He's the fella
The man who invented himself
He's the fella
The man who invented himself
He's the fella
The man who invented himself
He's the fella
The man who invented himself

Yep

He's the fella
