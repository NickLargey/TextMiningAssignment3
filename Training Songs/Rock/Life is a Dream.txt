Oh no not you oh no not you anyone but you

Everytime I realize there's something wrong when I see you
The way you try to prophesise that dreams just can't come true
The times you tried to undermine my reach what I still believe
The times you tried to bring me down cut me up and watch me bleed
But now the hand of faith has turned opened up and turned inside
What you stole dreams returned my believe in life

And when you turn you, you turn inside and when you burn you, you burn alive

'Cause everytime I opened up you were never around
And everytime I lost myself you were nowhere to be found
I lived inside an innocence but innocence was born to die
Inside the soul of everyone who's lost their faith in life

And life is a dream to me, life is a dream

Sometimes I wonder if you knew it all the time
And tried to stop my innocence from leaving you behind
I thought that you were powerful I thought you were strong
But now when I look around I realize there's something wrong

And when you turn, you turn inside and when you burn, you burn alive

'Cause everytime I opened up you were never around
And everytime I lost myself you were nowhere to be found
I lived inside an innocence but innocence was born to die
Inside the soul of everyone whose lost their faith in life

And life is a dream to me, life is a dream to me
Yeah life is a dream to me, life is a dream to me

But now you want to open up but there is no one around
Now you try to loose yourself in the hope that you'll be found
I see you for you innocence I see your soul wants to fly
You feel the hand of faith has turned and given you back your life

Life is a dream to you and me, life is a dream to you and me, life is a dream to you and me
