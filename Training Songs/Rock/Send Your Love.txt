I'm out among the wildlife
Waiting among the daylight again
To come from above
It's like falling in love

You walk on the high road
To see just where life goes
And then your heart beats so slow
It just wants you to know

That I've had your love
I'll never be the same

Send your love
Give it all to me
Send your love
Senorita send your love

You walk on a fine line
But the bell saves you
In time again
So the world sets you free

Now it's looking for me
But I've had your love
Now I'll never be the same

Listen,
You're searching all alone
With a heart that's
Turned to stone

And it tears you up inside
But it's your life
