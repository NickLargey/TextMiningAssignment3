He said he didn't even hear trains let alone the few words
The ladies maybe sayin' about him
She freaks and tells her closest friend
That she'll never love again
But she'll never, no not ever
Live without him

Wouldn't believe it, if you seen it
Oh, mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta mayhem, woh oh oh yeah

She said he didn't mean a thing
So she threw her diamond ring
Out the window of a black cab in Camden
He couldn't take it, what she did,
So he threw a hissy fit
And he took it out on anyone at random

Wouldn't believe it, if you seen it
Oh, mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta mayhem, woh oh oh yeah

Dinning sound, lights spinning round,
Some mother's son
Gotta fight or got to run run run run
Run run run run run

Ten pints and then he starts a fight
And he lands himself a night
In a cell wearing gray pants and bruises
Twelve mates bangin' on the door,
Oh the back up vans galore
Never saw such a street full of losers

Wouldn't believe it, if you seen it
Oh, mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta mayhem, woh oh oh yeah

Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta mayhem oh yeah

Oh mayhem
