We was broke and hungry on a summer day
They sent the sheriff down to try and drive us away
We was sittin' ducks for the police man
They found a dirty faced kid in a garbage can

And I'm alone
I'm on the highway
Wanted, dead or alive
Dead or alive

Broken down and dirty, dressed in rags
My from the day, my Mama told me boy, you pack your bags
I send the mayor down in his pickup truck
The jury look at me, say outta luck (woo yeah)

And I'm alone
And I'm on the highway
Wanted dead or alive
Dead or alive

Now, I'm broken down and dirty, dressed in rags
A from the day, my mama told me boy, you pack your bags
And we was sittin' ducks for the police man
They found a dirty faced kid in a garbage can
Dirty yeah, yeah

Babe, I'm alone
And I'm on the highway
Wanted dead or alive
Dead or alive

I'm gone woo yeah
Baby, let me run
I'm a spark on the horizon
