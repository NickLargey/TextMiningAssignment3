Anybody here see the noise, see the fear and commotion
I think we missed it
Anybody here see the love, see the hate, the emotion

Don't give me no hand me down shoes
Don't give me no hand me down love
Don't give me no hand me down world
I got one already

Anybody here see the long-distance cheer for the notion
Well, I think we missed it
Anybody here see the sky weeping tears for the ocean

Don't give me no hand me down shoes
Don't give me no hand me down love
Don't give me no hand me down world
I got one already

Anybody here see the fuzzy-wuzzy loving cup explosion
I think we missed it
Anybody here see the changing of the year and emotion

Don't give me no hand me down shoes
Don't give me no hand me down love
Don't give me no hand me down world
I got one already

(Don't give me no hand me down world)
I don't really need it and I'm not gonna take it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
A-don't give it to me 'cause I really don't want it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
I don't want to take it and I really don't need it, no
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
I don't want to take it and I really don't need it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
I don't want to take it, I don't want to take it 'cause I really don't need it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
You know I don't want it, know I don't need it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
You know I don't want it, know I don't need it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
You know I don't want it and I'm not gonna take it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
I don't want to take it 'cause I don't really need it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
Just don't give it to me, don't want to take it
(Don't give me no hand me down world)
Gimme no, gimme no, no-no no-no-no
