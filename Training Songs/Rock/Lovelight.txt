You - you've got that lovelight in your eyes
The moment we re-met
I knew that I'd forget my sorrow oo-oo-you
You've got that lovelight in your eyes
I'm hoping you'll say, you wanna stay
Till tomorrow ow-ow-ow

Seems so long ago since I first met you
I've waited for you patiently
Though there's a gypsy in your heart
I knew from the start
You'd always come back home to me
Oh and it's true
Oh baby, it's true oo-oo-you

You've got that lovelight in your eyes
It's no good denying
Not even trying it's true oo-oo-you
Yoy've got that lovelight in your eyes
There's no use pretending
You're just defending your virtue oo-oo

Don't think it's strange
The way we've changed
And yet here we are together again
And there's something
In the way you look today
That makes me love you just the same
Oh and it's true
Oh baby it's true oo-oo-you

You - you've got that lovelight in your eyes
It's no illusion, a foregone conclusion
It's true oo-oo-you
You've got that lovelight in your eyes
There's no more to say
When you look this way
Oh it's true
