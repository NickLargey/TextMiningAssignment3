Cats in the bag / the neighbours holler
This party is higher / than the eiffel tower

we're all here to be reckless / we're all sleazy and easy to please
Dreamers and schemers on the loose

we're all here for a celebration / the madcap scene and the max machine
And the friends you see go up in smoke
And this heel toe dance song tour de force

climbing a cloud climbing a cloud / put a little life on the line

here's Lucy she's choosey / of who calls her on the phone
She's from a very rich foreign family / but displaced cause of rivalry at home

now Daphne is the orphan / still searching for her roots
She likes concert blisters and leather boots
And knows one fact her act is to get loose

now we're just musicians / here to thin the thickness of your skin

show us your body / show us your curls / show us your tour de force
Show us your thrills / keep that smile on your face
This is the best offer you've had so far

we're innocent we're naive / in the cabarets we get our veins wet
In the saloons we hassle the richest guests
In the climb we're breathless above the rest

climbing a cloud climbing a cloud
