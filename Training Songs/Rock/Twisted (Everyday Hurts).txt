I cried on my blood day
There was nothing that I
Could hold on to
Just a line could have helped
Remind me of you, of you

I screamed till the blood came
I was living in a cloud of hope
Lover's kiss then they make a wish
To the end, they pretend

[Chorus]
Everyday hurts a little more
Everyday hurts a little more
And I'll do anything
Yes I'll do anything
To belong
To be strong
To say there's nothing wrong
Everyday hurts a little more
Everyday hurts a little more
And I'll do anything
Yes I'll do anything
To belong
To be strong
To say there's nothing wrong
Everyday hurts

I cried in the sunlight
Would I fake all the times I loved you
Just to play in a game of twisted with you
With you
I need to believe you
Sacrificed all the lies we made up
How we kissed then we made our wish
to the end, to the end

[Chorus]

Time made me confide in you
So contrived were the words you sold me
Now nothing can swallow
The feeling so shallow inside
