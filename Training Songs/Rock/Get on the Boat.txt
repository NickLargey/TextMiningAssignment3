Look out side you're window 
Tell me now what you see 
Coming up the mountain
For a new philosophy 
Every single color 
Every race and every creed
Lookin' for the truth y'all
That's gonna set somebody free

[Chorus: x2]
Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more 

All across the nation
People doing what they can
To avoid the tribulation
That will be great throughout the land 
Everything in darkness must come out into the light
When we love each other that's the only way that's gonna be right

[Chorus x2]

Good lord!

We were meant to live together underneath the sun
Eye can't think of nothing better
Don't you wanna come?

Get on the boat

Never mind what time it is
The party's just begun

No te alejes de esto
No te alejes de este momento de inspiraciÃ³n

You can can let your hair down 
Let the music move you're feet
Panamama bring the drama 
Dancin' to the beat

Maceo!

What's the harm in listening to the hopeful words we say
If it moves you're heart
You know you better get in without delay 

Get on the boat
Get on the boat,people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more

Dance to the beat
