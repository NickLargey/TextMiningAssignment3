Every thought of you is so sweet in the morning
I don't know why I'm feeling so free
Floating like a cloud, it's a springtime feeling
So new, not a clue what's come over me

And I can't explain it
But I know I've got to be close to you

'Cause your love has changed me
Taken me where I need to be
Deep into you, I'm falling over and over

Like the sun that's shining
And the warmth of the air I'm breathing
Oh, 'cause the love you're giving me
Is undeniable, and so natural

Everybody looks for a piece to the puzzle
We all will fall from time to time
It's simple what I know about some artificial
Game, not the same old storyline

And I can't explain it
But I know I've got to be close to you

'Cause your love has changed me
Taken me where I need to be
Deep into you, I'm falling over and over

Like the sun that's shining
And the warmth of the air I'm breathing
Oh, 'cause the love you're giving me
Is undeniable, so natural

'Cause your love has changed me
And taken me where I need to be
Deep into you, I'm falling over and over

Like the sun that's shining
And the warmth of the air I'm breathing
Oh, 'cause the love you are giving me
Is undeniable, and so natural
