Feels like your life is over,
Feels like no hope is gone,
You kiss it all away,
Maybe, maybe

This is a second coming,
This is a call to arms,
You'll find us now and we'll be,
Wasted, wasted

Hey, hey,
Hell is what you,
Make, make,
Rise against your,
Faith, faith,
Nothings gonna keep me down,
Even if it's killing you
Because you know the truth

Well listen up, listen up
There's a devil in the church,
Got a bullet in the chamber,
And this is gonna hurt
Let it out, let it out,
You can scream, and you can shout
Keep your secrets in the shadows,
And you'll be sorry

Everybody's getting numb (everybody's getting numb)
Everybody's on the run (everybody's on the run)

Listen up, listen up,
There's a devil in the church,
Got a bullet in the chamber,
And this is gonna hurt

You got your hell together
You know it could be worse
A self inflicted murder,
Maybe, maybe

You say it's all a crisis
You say it's all a blur
There comes a time you gotta,
Face it, face it

Hey, hey,
Hell is what you,
Make, make,
Rise against your,
Faith, faith,
Nothings gonna keep you down,
Even if it's killing you
Because you know the truth

Listen up, listen up,
There's a devil in the church
Got a bullet in the chamber,
And this is gonna hurt
Let it out, let it out
You can scream and you can shout
Keep your secrets in the shadows,
And you'll be sorry

Everybody's getting numb (everybody's getting numb)
Everybody's on the run (everybody's on the run)

Listen up, listen up,
There's a devil in the church
Got a bullet in the chamber,
And this is gonna hurt

This is gonna hurt

Listen up, listen up,
There's a devil in the church,
Got a bullet in the chamber,
And this is gonna hurt
Let it out, let it out
You can scream, you can shout
Keep your secrets in the shadows,
And you'll be sorry

Everybody's getting numb (everybody's getting numb)
Everybody's on the run (everybody's on the run)
And everybody's getting some (everybody's getting some)
Everybody's on the run

And this is gonna hurt
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
This is gonna hurt
