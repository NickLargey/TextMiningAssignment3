Kicking pigeons in the park, we had to stop 'cause it got dark.
I went home got a guinea pig that I had stored in my mates fridge.
Grabbed the thing around its throat,
Threw it in the bath it didn't float,
Kicking pigeons in the park.

So you stamp down on the floor, you can't take it anymore,
In your search for absolution there is only one solution,
Kick a pigeon in the park.
