(diane warren)

For a while I've been so unlucky
Always stumbling around in circles
But I must've stumbled into something
Look at me am I really alone with you
Now I'm loving the life I'm living
Can't recall when I last felt that way
Guess it must be all the love you're giving
Never knew, never knew it could be like this
But I guess
Chorus:
Some hearts seem to have it so easy
Some hearts have all the stars on their sides
Some hearts always get all the right breaks
And some hearts just get lucky some time
Never thought someone like you would love me
You're the last thing my heart expected
Didn't think I'd ever find somebody
Someone who makes me feel like this
Chorus (3x's)
Bridge:
Some hearts like mine get lucky
Lucky sometime
