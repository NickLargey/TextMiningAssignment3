Gentlemen, how'd you get up there?
How you gonna get down?
Sweeping all the search lights above
Over the ground
And I shudder to think
That this is the catastrophe
That fate has in mind
And now buried are the feelings still alive
That you'll never find

They stopped digging for you long ago
My sacred soul, it won't be long

Boderline, and I cannot keep still
Your enemies have trained you
To wear a smile as you kill
And now buried alive
You can't deny
That worst of all
The joke was on you
Now you're scratching out a silent goodbye
With just a candle in a coffin and

They stopped digging for you long ago
My sacred soul, it won't be long
Look into my eyes
At the price I pay
Watch them fade away
Still the beat goes on

They stopped digging for you long ago
My sacred soul, it won't be long
Look into my eyes
At the price I pay
Watch them fade away
Still the beat goes on

The price I pay
The price I pay
The price I pay
