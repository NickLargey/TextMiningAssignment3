Giving you more of what for
Always worked for me before
Now I'm a shabby doll
What's going on behind the green elevator door
With just a shabby doll?

There's a hit man facing
A compromising situation
With just a shabby doll
And a very neat line in character assassination
She's just a shabby doll

She's just a shabby doll (she's just a shabby doll)
She's putting him off and putting you on (she's just a shabby doll)
She's just the shabby doll (she's just a shabby doll)
She's just the shabby doll (she's just a shabby doll)
You're swearing upon, you know in your heart (she's just a shabby doll)
She's gone, you know in your heart (she's just a shabby doll)
She's just a shabby doll

There's a girl in this dress, there's always a girl in distress
She's just a shabby doll
She's so sure she's self-possessed
Then again she's half-undressed
She's just a shabby doll

The boy that I used to be showed no sign of sympathy
For just a shabby doll
I have betrayed you and me
And paid for my own bribery
With just a shabby doll

She's just a shabby doll (she's just a shabby doll)
She's putting him off and putting you on (she's just a shabby doll)
She's just the shabby doll (she's just a shabby doll)
She's just the shabby doll (she's just a shabby doll)
You're swearing upon, you know in your heart (she's just a shabby doll)
She's gone, you know in your heart (she's just a shabby doll)
She's just a shabby doll

He's the tired toy that everyone's enjoyed
He wants to be a fancy man but he's nothing but a nancy boy
He's all pride and no joy

And being what you might call a whore
Always worked for me before
Now I'm a shabby doll
Untie the gag, the cat's out of the bag
But won't show his claws
He's just a shabby doll

She said you must be joking
Some things are left unspoken
You're just a shabby doll
He's lying limp and soaking
He was openly broken
By just a shabby doll

She's just a shabby doll (she's just a shabby doll)
She's putting him off and putting you on (she's just a shabby doll)
She's just the shabby doll (she's just a shabby doll)
She's just the shabby doll (she's just a shabby doll)
You're swearing upon, you know in your heart (she's just a shabby doll)
She's gone, you know in your heart (she's just a shabby doll)
She's just a shabby doll
She's just a shabby doll
She's just a shabby doll
