The summer is gone I can't believe 
It went so fast 
Why do only the cold and lonely times 
Seem to last 
Now it's late at night I watch you 
Sleepin, I wanna wake you up 
And tell you I'm sorry, though I know 
I can't make it up 
I made my mistakes now baby 
But I did the best I could 
It takes what it takes and sometimes 
It takes longer than it should 
To just live the kind of life that 
We both have been dreaming of 
There are No Mistakes in love 

I walk through a fire in my dreams 
Just to pull you through 
But when I'm awake sometimes it seems 
I'm just so hard on you 
Baby a change has got to come 
And I can't see 
After another winter's gone 
Well who's gonna rescue me 

There are No Mistakes now baby 
We did the best we could 
It takes what it takes and sometimes 
It takes much more time than it should 
To just to make the choices that we both 
Have been dreaming of 
There are No Mistakes in love 

The nights are much colder now 
I feel the need to have you near 
Maybe we could start all over 
I feel a change the air 

There are No Mistakes now baby 
We did the best we could 
It takes what it takes and sometimes 
And sometimes it's so hard to understand 
And just take the changes that we all 
Have been dreaming of 
There are No Mistakes in love 
There are No Mistakes in love 
Oh there are No Mistakes in love...
