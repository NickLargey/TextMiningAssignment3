We came across the West sea
We didn't have much idea
Of the kind of climate waiting

We used our hands for guidance
Like the children of a preacher
Like a dry tree seeking water or a daughter

Nice 'n' sleazy
Nice 'n' sleazy does it

Nice 'n' sleazy, nice 'n' sleazy
Does it, does it, does it every time

Nice 'n' sleazy, nice 'n' sleazy
Does it, does it, does it every time

Nice 'n' sleazy does it

Nice 'n' sleazy, nice 'n' sleazy
Does it, does it, does it every time

Nice 'n' sleazy, nice 'n' sleazy
Does it, does it, does it every time

Nice 'n' sleazy does it

An angel came from outside
Had no halo had no father
With a coat of many colors

He spoke of brothers many
Wine and women song a plenty
He began to write a chapter in history

Nice 'n' sleazy
Nice 'n' sleazy does it
Nice 'n' sleazy does it
Nice 'n' sleazy does it, does it every time
