Magnificent, holy father
I stand in awe of all i see
Of all the things you have created
Still you choose to think of me

And who am I that you should suffer
your very life to set me free
the only thing that i can give you
is the life you gave to me

Chorus
This is my offering, dear Lord
this is my offering to you, God
I will give you my life
for its all i have to give
because you gave your life for me

I stand before you at this altar
so many have given you more
i may not have much i can offer
Yet what i have is truly yours

Chorus

This is my offering
This is my offering, dear Lord
This is my offering to you, God
Well i will give you my life
For its all i have to give
Because you gave your life for me

This is my offering to you, God
well i will give you my life
For its all i have to give
Because you gave your life for me
Because you gave your life for me
