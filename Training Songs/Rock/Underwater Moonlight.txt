He was white and she was white
As only statues are
Fifty years they stood there looking
Stupid by a jar
One night in mid August when the moonlight got too strong
They climbed off their pedestal and then they sang this song

Past the gun emplacement and the
Bones as white as bleach
Through the rats and ivy til' they
Came out on a beach
Out into the ocean til' they disappeared from view 
Honey when it gets you there's just nothing you can do. 

[Chorus]
Underwater moonlight, sets the body free
Underwater moonlight, baby you and me 
Underwater moonlight, underwater moonlight 

He was pink and she was pink
And onward they did row
Didn't see the giant squid, though
It was fairly slow
When they hit the bottom they were well and truly dead
The statues took their place, and then they rode back home instead

Underwater moonlight
Take your baby down
Underwater moonlight
Watch your baby drown
With love
And in the moonlight
Underwater moonlight
Underwater moonlight
Underwater moonlight
Underwater moonlight

Underwater moonlight
Sets the body free
Underwater moonlight
Baby you and me
Underwater moonlight
Underwater moonlight
Underwater moonlight
