Well she wants to be a singer in the band,
Maybe I'll give the girl a hand
And a microphone.
Looks like she's all alone.
She can bring a friend,
Though she's not my kind of friend.
She keeps on staring me out with her
Ole black 'n' blue eyes.

And I can take her dancin'
Just to give the girl a chance 'n'
I was never that good
At being nice when I should.
I guess that she'll forgive me
Right before she tries to kill me
'Cause I sold her on yesterday's
Come take me home eyes.

And I can take you waltzin'
Just so she could kick my head in.
Oh, I do believe I was drunk
And both of my heads had shrunk.
I guess her name was Tina,
'Cause before I'd even seen her
I was lost in her "What's your name?
Just get me...
Oh take me home eyes.

And Chelsea says she's got nowhere to go,
And if she does she's gettin' there slow,
And I can help her out but I've got somewhere to be,
And that's the very thing when your dealing with me.

Young soul shagger,
Beggin' me to bag her
Filthy heart and swollen hips,
And she said, "Oh, my dearest,
I'm not pretty.
Isn't it a pity
That you won't kiss these rotten lips?"
Oh take me home eyes.
Ole black and blue eyes.

And Chelsea says she's got nowhere to go,
And if she does she's gettin' there slow,
And I can help her out but I've got somewhere to be,
And that's the very thing when your dealing with me.

Do do do do do do do do do....
