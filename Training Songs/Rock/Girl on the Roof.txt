Is she jumping? What an evening
To admire the view
Flower in her hair
Girl on the roof
I can see her, I believe her
So would I say something true
Love is in the air
Girl on the roof
In the balance of the silence
From the street down below
Crowding is everywhere
Dying to know
I can see her, I believe her
Is she asking for proof
Love is in the air
Girl on the roof
Love is in the air
What a perfect day to find
Nothing could compare
What a waste to turn and wave goodbye
Is she thinking of the meaning
That we all want to know
Crowd is gonna stare
Girl doesn't show
I can see her, I believe her
But could I say something new
Love is in the air
Girl on the roof
Love is in the air
What a perfect day to find
Nothing could compare...
