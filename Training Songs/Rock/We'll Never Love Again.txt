Oh the nights I've cried, how I'd die inside
Knowing we'll never love again, love again
One mistake I've made, what a price I've paid
Knowing we'll never love again
Passion ruled my mind, made my conscience blind
And a million times, I've paid for my sins
Darlin' please forgive, I don't want to live
Knowing we'll never love again
I still hear you say, as you walked away
Knowing we'll never love again, love again
I was such a fool, broke love's golden rule
Now you say, we'll never love again
