You speak, saying nothing
You hide, face to face
Life keeps pouring over us
It's like an endless waterfall
And we can build a bridge above it all
Faith alone is not enough
And I think we put too much trust
In one of us to solve this all alone

Everything will not be still
If we don't talk about it
All the pain it lives here still
We don't talk about it
Try to avoid it, we can't ignore this
Space that our silence fills
So we don't talk about it

Change
Change needs patience
But patience is running dry
I can't believe we got this far
These battle scars and tender hearts
Are all that's left for you and I to show
When I look into your eyes
Behind that sea of compromise
There's still the only love I want to know

Everything will not be still
If we don't talk about it
All the pain it lives here still
We don't talk about it
Try to avoid it, we can't ignore this
Space that our silence fills
So we don't talk about it

Everything will not be still
If we don't talk about it
All the pain it lives here still
We don't talk about it
Try to avoid it, we can't ignore this
Space that our silence fills
So we don't talk about it
