It gets us all in the end
It gets us all in the end
Loves so hard it gets us all in the end

It gets us all in the end
It gets us all in the end
Love's so hard it gets us all in the end
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I feel so out of place
Could it be I can't hide this look on my face
One step turns into two
Your so hung up from what you do
I don't care you can do what you do

Love is the shining light that sees us through
It's out of its shine a placement in time
Where all of us stand love makes it demands
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

It gets us all in the end
It gets us all in the end
Love's so hard it gets us all in the end
Whoa, whoa

You think we should be free
But we won't get there by trying to be
Let the chips fall where they may
You can leave you don't have to stay

Even though love's hope is slight
We find the strength to keep fighting back
Inside of this shrine with nothing in time
We all understand love makes its demands
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

It gets us all in the end
It gets us all in the end
Love's so hard it gets us all in the end

It gets us all in the end
It gets us all in the end
Love's so hard it gets us all in the end
Whoa, whoa

Yeah

It gets us all in the end
It gets us all in the end
Love's so hard it gets us all in the end

It gets us all in the end

Baby it gets us all in the end
Love's so hard sometimes
Whoa, whoa
