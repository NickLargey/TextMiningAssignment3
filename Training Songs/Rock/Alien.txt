Brother won't you look at the sky 
There's something burning so bright 
And what it is I can't see 
But I think it's coming at me 

Did you get here in a rocket 
And journey through space 
Did your mother never scold you 
Oh when she looked at your face 
Do you know where you came from 
Because you look out of place 
In a town where only the rain comes down 
You fell down to earth 

Like an alien, like an alien, like an alien 

Funny because I feel quite at ease 
I think you come here in peace 
We're universal in smiles 
You know they see it for miles 

Did you get here in a rocket 
And journey through space 
Did your mother never scold you 
Oh when she looked at your face 
Do you know where you came from 
Because you look out of place 
In a town where only the rain comes down 
You fell down to earth 

Like an alien, like an alien, like an alien
