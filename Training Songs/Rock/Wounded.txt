We're wounded but walking, dumbstruck but talking still
And I don't think we've made it, don't think we ever will
We're radio rental, so accidental too
And I don't think we've made it don't care if we ever do

Smashed in, crashed out
Spun around, messed about
Can't get up for falling down
Heh come and join the zoo

Shell shocked, red raw
Punch drunk, saddle sore
Forest Gump at heaven's door
Just looking for a clue

We're wounded but walking, dumbstruck but talking still
And I don't think we've made it, don't think we ever will
We're radio rental, so accidental too
And I don't think we've made it don't care if we ever do

Love bite, bee sting
Heavy heart, broken string
Never mind, cos everything
Yeah everything is alright now

We're wounded but walking, dumbstruck but talking still
And I don't think we've made it, don't think we ever will
We're radio rental, so accidental too
And I don't think we've made it don't care if we ever do.
