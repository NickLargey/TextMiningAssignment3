Ask any girl, in this lonely world
Ask any girl, she'll say make it last forever

I'm holding out my hand, I finally understand
So turn out the lights (oh yeah) we'll make it last forever.

I've been down the streets of desire
Sometimes I was so uninspired
You found what was locked up inside of me

This could be the night, the night to remember
We'll make it last forever
This could be the night
Oh, to end all nights

I've always been the one
Lovin' on the run
That's when you came undone, oh girl
Why do you wait for me?

Out on the borderline, between the hurtin' lies
And the true emotions, that ,make it last forever

This could be the night, the night to remember
We'll make it last forever
This could be the night
Oh, to end all nights

I've been down the streets of desire
Sometimes I was so uninspired
You found what was locked up inside of me

This could be the night, the night to remember
We'll make it last forever
This could be the night
Oh, to end all nights

This could be the night, the night to remember
We'll make it last forever
This could be the night
Oh, to end all nights

To end all nights.
