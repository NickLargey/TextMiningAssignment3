I went from San Fransico
To Memphis Tennessee
I just had to find
Muh my sugaree

I didn't know her number
I didn't know the street
I just drove around
A hopin' we would meet

I got stopped by the sheriff
On a one way street
Said I was goin' backwards
And I was in for heat

He took me down to the jailhouse
Said I could stay for a week
And in the very next cell
Was my sugaree

We just jumped for joy
Kissed through the bars and then
Yeah the very next mornin'
She was back in my arms again

Ooh ooh ooh ooh wee
Ooh ooh ooh ooh wee
Ooh ooh ooh ooh wee
Muh my sugaree

I went from San Fransisco
To Memphis Tennessee
So glad to find
Muh my sugaree

And now I know her number
Triple N, Double Two, Double Three
I call her when I need her
Whoa! My Sugaree
