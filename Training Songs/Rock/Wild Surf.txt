Come on
Yeah come on while we still can
Yeah come on while it still stands
Burning in my head
Tonight beneath the moon rays
We stand in the doorway
Looking towards other skies
They are yours and mine for now
Yeah ride
Ride the wild surf
Until the dawn
Is ushered in at your word
Your heart must always burn
You burn like a star
In the cold night
Yeah burn until the dawn light
And make it to a new time
Burning in my head
Yeah so come on
Yeah come on while we still can
Yeah come on while it still stands
Burning in my head
Tonight the sky above us
Dark and wondrous
How could you be unsure
It's all mine and yours for now
Yeah ride
Ride the wild surf
Until the dawn
Is ushered in at your word
Your heart must always burn
You burn like a star 
In the cold night
Yeah burn until the dawn light
And make it to a new time
Burning in my head
Yeah we're gonna make it to the new times
We're gonna make it from the old times
We're gonna make it to the good times that's for sure
Ain't gonna let it slip away
Ain't gonna let this chance fade
Ain't gonna let it go in vain
Ain't gonna let it slip away
Yeah so come on
Yeah come on while we still can
Yeah come on while it still stands
Burning in my head
In the cold night
Yeah burn until the dawn light
And make it to a new time
Burning in my head
