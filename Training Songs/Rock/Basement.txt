Locked in the basement I'm so paranoid 
I'm all encased in and I can't escape 
And when I look up Mother's looking down 
And when I wake up Mother's not around 

'Cause if you want you can have everything that I've got 
If you want you can take it all away from me 
Away from me Away from me Away from me 

Nobody's perfect but you just can't see 
My life's a circus that you don't believe 
You're saying something but not coming clean 
And when I look up Mother's living 
She's living in a dream 

'Cause if you want you can have everything that I've got 
If you want you can take it all away from me 
And if you're unsatisfied well I'll watch you wave goodbye 
If you want you can take it all away from me 

Please don't come down and see me this way 
Please don't come down I'm too afraid 
Please don't come down and see me this way 
Please don't come down I'm too afraid 
I'm too afraid  I'm too afraid 
Please don't come down I'm too afraid 
Please don't come down I'm too afraid 
Please don't come down I'm too afraid 
I'm too afraid  I'm too afraid 
I'm too afraid  I'm too afraid 

'Cause if you want you can have everything that I've got 
If you want you can take it all away from me 
'Cause if you want you can have everything that I've got 
If you want you can take it all away from me 
And if you're unsatisfied well I'll watch you wave goodbye 
If you want you can take it all away from me 
Away from me  Away from me  Away from me
