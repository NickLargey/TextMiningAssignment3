Loose nut in my head Loose nut rattling my skull Crying for a human touch Or anything that'll reach my soul Loose nut in my head A bolt of lightning between my legs I can't think straight my mind's a mess I only see straight when I'm being led Loose nut in my head A bolt of lightning between my legs I can't think straight my mind's a mess I only see straight when I'm being led Loose nut, I want head The loneliness I dread Loose nut you can help Be with me so I don't hurt myself Loose nut in my head A bolt of lightning between my legs I can't think straight my mind's a mess I only see straight when I'm being led Loose nut in my head A bolt of lightning between my legs I can't think straight my mind's a mess I only see straight when I'm being led Loose nut, no bolt fits My head is giving me fits Loose nut looking for diversion Just anything that'll let me stick it in Loose nut in my head A bolt of lightning between my legs I can't think straight my mind's a mess I only see straight when I'm being led Loose nut in my head A bolt of lightning between my legs I can't think straight my mind's a mess I only see straight when I'm being led Don't mind my crazy smile Hand me the phone so I can dial I'll be back in a little while But first I gotta get some vertical smile Loose nut in my head A bolt of lightning between my legs I can't think straight my mind's a mess I only see straight when I'm being led
