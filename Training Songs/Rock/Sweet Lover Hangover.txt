Sweet lover of mine
Sweet lover of mine
You know a million tears are gonna fall

Sister blue stay away from me
Tears so many now I can't see
Just waitin' for the jerk to phone
See you waitin' by the telephone

Ah that, sweet lover of mine
Sweet lover of mine
Sweet lover of mine
You know a million tears are gonna fall

Get a feeling like a desert inside
I'm so thirsty for some peace of mind
You never know me 'cause I'm always alone
So hungry for that little girl

Ah that, sweet lover of mine
Sweet lover of mine
Sweet lover of mine
You know a million tears are gonna fall

Sister blue stay away from me
Tears so many now I can't see
Just waitin' for the jerk to phone
See you waitin' by the telephone

Ah that, sweet lover of mine
Sweet lover of mine
Sweet lover of mine
You know a million tears are gonna fall

Sweet lover of mine
Sweet lover of mine
You know a million tears are gonna fall

Sweet lover of mine
Sweet lover of mine
Sweet lover of mine
