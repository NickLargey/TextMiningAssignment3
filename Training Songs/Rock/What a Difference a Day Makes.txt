What a difference a day made, twenty four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers where there use to be rain
Mm, my yesterdays were blue dear
Today I’m a part of you dear
Yes, my lonely nights are through dear
Since you say you are mine, all the time
What a difference a day made

Now there’s a rainbow before me
Skies above can’t be stormy since that moment of bliss
Mm, that thrilling kiss
It’s heaven when you, when you find romance on your menu
Aah what a difference a day made
Mm and the difference is you
What a difference a day made, mm and the difference is you
