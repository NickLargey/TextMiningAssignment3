Jailhouse Rocker roots training down
In Memphis

Liverpool Johnny rocks out round Paul's place
Seconds away as the rhythm comes down
King faces King in the ring for the crown
King rocker king rocker, rock rock rock
King Kong
King Kong

Elvis from the body shakes from the hipbone
Quarry St. kids in leather take Hamburg
Creole was sharp but his guitar was acoustic
Go Johnny go use your electric
Crazy man crazy

King rocker king rocker, rock rock rock
King Kong
King Kong
King rocker king rocker, rock rock rock
King Kong

Round three, Ali buzzin like a bee,
Elvis in the corner and you won't catch me
Round four, Johnny lookin' poor,
Gotta find a hit gotta even up the score
Round five, some jive, Elvis took a dive
Waitin' for the towel more dead than alive
Round six, seven, eight, nine,
Ref stops the fight with the men on forty two
For a rematch in heaven
If they ever come through

(Gotta) see this fight right through 'til the last round
Follow the man
Whose puttin' out the boss sound
Of king rocker king rocker rock rock rock

King Kong
King Kong
King Kong
King Kong
King rocker king rocker rock rock rock
King Kong
King Kong
King Kong
King Kong
