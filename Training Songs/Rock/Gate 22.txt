I won?t try to argue now
Anyway I feel there?s nothing I could say
To ease your mind
Maybe there?s nothing exciting outside
But ?round here I?m just wasting my time
Spinning ?round on nothing new
When I close my eyes I remember that kiss
I?d rather keep them wide open
And if I miss that train do you really think
That even here, I?d be closer to you

So here I am leaving soon and
I?m standing at gate 22
?Cause whatever you may think I forgot
You know I?m still thinking about it
Sometimes I wish I could stay
But no matter where I go, no matter how long
You know I?ll keep hanging on. Sweet memories
I?m leaving but my mind will surely stay
At gate 22

There?s too many dreams I must chase down
Though sometimes I bite off more than I can chew
I know you?d like to keep me near
I know it?s easier to be two
But I can?t plan my life all around you
I?m weaker than I?ll let you know
So don?t ask me to jump this wall
From here it looks too tall
Two people kissing goodbye facing a door
A classic picture we?re all tired of

So here I am leaving soon and
I?m standing at gate 22
?Cause whatever you may think I forgot
You know I?m still thinking about it
Sometimes I wish I could stay
But no matter where I go, no matter how long
You know I?ll keep hanging on. Sweet memories
I?m leaving but my mind will surely stay

And I already see the picture of that day
When you?ll say you?ll wait for me
And I?ll pretend just then to believe you
I?ll send you postcards for a few weeks and then
Another perfect moment at the wrong time
But the timing is always wrong

Here I am leaving soon and
I?m standing at gate 22
?Cause whatever you may think I forgot
You know I?m still thinking about it
Sometimes I wish I could stay
But no matter where I go, no matter how long
You know I?ll keep hanging on. Sweet memories
I?m leaving but my mind will surely stay
At gate 22
