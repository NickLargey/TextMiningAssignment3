I came through today
At the back of a street parade
And their I am, right side of your TV screen
Slightly out of focus
But unmistakably serene
Never made the big time
But I was in that scene.

Oh I was thinking about in films
How in no time so it seems
The hero meet his princess
The king found his queen
But in real life
There's only in between
I've never been a hero
But I was in that scene.

Hollywood exist still
Cause there's a sign upon the hill
We buy the maps, and make the tours
To touch the world of, motion, pictures.

So here I am
Until the good time end to be
I've never made the big time
But I was in that scene

Hollywood exist still
Cause there's a sign upon the hill
We buy the maps, and make the tours
To touch the world of, motion, pictures.

A star died today
And they had a little street parade
And all the other stars turned out
To say how nice he'd been
Someone at the back
Flowing with the stream
Never made the headlines
But I was in that scene.

Someone at the back
Flowing with the stream
Never made the headlines
But I was in that scene.

Someone at the back
Flowing with the stream
Never made the headlines
But I was in that scene.
