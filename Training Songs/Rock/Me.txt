I am not the person who is singing 
I am the silent one inside 
I am not the one who laughs at people's jokes 
I just pacify their egos 

I am not my house or my car or my songs 
They are only just stops along my way 
I am like winter 
I'm a dark cold female 
With a golden ring of wisdom in my cave 

[Chorus]
And it is me who is my enemy 
Me who beats me up 
Me who makes the monsters 
Me who strips my confidence 

I am carrying my voice 
I am carrying my heart 
I am carrying my rhythm 
I am carrying my prayers 

But you can't kill my spirit 
It's soaring and it's strong 
Like a mountain 
I go on and on 

But when my wings are folded 
The brightly colored moth 
Blends into the dirt into the ground 

[Chorus] 

And it's me who's too weak 
And it's me who's too shy 
To ask for the thing I love 
And it's me who's too weak 

And it's me who's too shy 
To ask for the thing I love 
That I love (6 times) 
I am walking on the bridge 

I am over the water 
And I'm scared as hell 
But I know there's something better 
Yes I know there's something 

Yes I know, I know, yes I know 
That I love (5 times overlapping chorus) 
But it's me 
And it's me 
But it's me (4 times)
