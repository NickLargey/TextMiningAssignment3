I heard a rumor that love will make you crazy
Well is it true?
Well that's no rumor, look at the crazy things that love made Jesus do
The friends he chose were thought to be outrageous
And you could even find him touching the contagious
And the craziest is how he chose to save us
He gave his life away
Then he had to go and say
"Gotta love the same way that I love you!"

Love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
The way he loves you and me
Ãƒ???Cause if the world's ever gonna change
We gotta love like crazy

What the world needs now is for love to spread
As fast as the rumors do
But to make it, we gotta take this thing from another whole point of view
We can start by keeping our vows, and not breakin' promises
And bring hope to the women at the well, and the doubting Thomases
And you kids, you gotta cheerfully do what your pops and your mama says
He gave his life away
Then he had to go and say
"Gotta love the same way that I love you!"

Love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
The way he loves you and me
'Cause if the world's ever gonna change
We gotta love like crazy

Well I'm tellin' you boy, you got a lot to learn
I think you're crazy all right to love for nothin' in return
You've lost your marbles, got a few loose screws
And if you count your cards I'll bet you got less than fifty-two
But now you got me thinkin', you sorta planted a seed
'Cause you know this might be just the kind of love that I need
Naw, your train's off the track, you're from the loony bin
You know that brain that you ordered? Well it never came in
Or else you've fallen on your head and all your brains leaked out
'Cause your lights are on, but ain't nobody in your house
Your elevator doesn't quite reach the top floor
I think you're out in left field, and I could say a lot more
But you don't care what I think, it doesn't matter what I'm tellin' you
You got the love of Jesus, and he's the one compellin' you to love
Like he does
You gotta love like he does
You gotta love like he does
'Cause if the world's ever gonna change
We gotta love like crazy
