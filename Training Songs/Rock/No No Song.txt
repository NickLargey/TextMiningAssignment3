A lady that I know just came from Columbia
She smiled because I did not understand
Then she held out some marijuana, ha ha
She said it was the best in all the land

And I said

I'm tired of waking up on the floor
No, thank you, please, it only makes me sneeze
Then it makes it hard to find the door

I'm tired of waking up on the floor
No, thank you, please, it only makes me sneeze
And then it makes it hard to find the door"

I'm tired of waking up on the floor
No, thank you, please, it only makes me sneeze
And then it makes it hard to find the door
