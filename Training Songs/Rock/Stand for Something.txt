Caught in chains
Shackles on too tight
Squirming for your life
Because you've gone and lost your freedom

Manacles cut deep when they're too tight
You have to break the lock or find the key so you can defeat dem
Enslaved by the wickedest power
We're smashing up the cells and all the right ones gunna follow
Uprising we need not the chains
And we aren't gunna make the same mistakes again

If you want it you got to rise and take it
You go to wake up you know you can't contain this
Stand for something!
Or you'll fall for anything

If you want it you got to fight for it
Wake up you'll never contain it
Stand for something!
Or you'll fall for anything

Wolves they creep
Out to take the sheep
The vulnerable, the easy led, the weak
Who will protect dem?

Against the wall now they execute
The blind can't lead the blind,
They always need someone to lead dem

Restrained by the evillest power
Captive of the chains because these things you've done are so'a
Not surprising - it's all done in vain
But you have gone and made the same mistake again

If you want it you got to rise and take it
Got to wake up, you know you can't contain this
Stand for something!
Or you'll fall for anything

If you want it you got to fight for it
Wake up you'll never contain it
Stand for something!
Or you'll fall for anything
