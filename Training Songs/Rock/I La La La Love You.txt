Want to tell you that I love you, baby
Don't you know that I like it
From the bottom of my heart

Oh, who could love me like you did
From the very start, right from the heart

Oh, make a little room for you in my heart
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

Gave me lovin' that was worth the gamble
Oh, you made me move together
From the very start
Right from the heart

Right from the start

Don't you know that I like it
From the bottom of my heart
Right from the start
