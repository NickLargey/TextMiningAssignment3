We've been abducted
My head corrupted
Sharp shock commotion
Stirs up confusion
We failed to notice
Blinded by daylight
This grand delusion
We lost the track

I stand corrected
Captain arrest me
These bones upon me
Plastered and fractured
Make your selection
Through gaps in memory
They tell their own tale
Playing for time..

For all the steps that we can take
We'll never close the open space
So captain get us out of here
Return us to the fear we know

To guard against the animals
A shelter from the avalanche.
