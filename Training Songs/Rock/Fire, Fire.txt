Don't tell me your name 
I know it ain't gonna change 
Anyway that I think (you mother fucker) 
It's not as if you're to blame 
If we're one and the same 
We're on the edge, on the brink (you mother fucker) 

Come take control 
Won't be the soul 
Just do as you're told 
Come burn a hole 
In what they know 
Get up and go 

Throw matches to see 
What you can ignite 
Fire fire, fire fire 
Throw matches to see 
What stays out of sight 
Fire fire, fire fire 

Cause when the clouds come down on this town estate 
We'll make our way to a great escape 
Throw matches to see 
What you can ignite 

No time to spare 
No truth or dare 
Give them something to hide (you mother fucker) 
Go with the time 
Step on the mines 
Our time to shine (you mother fucker) 

Come steal the wind 
Come throw the earth 
Come bring the storm 
Come seize the day 
Come make the change 
Give them something to mourn 

Throw matches to see 
What you can ignite 
Fire fire, fire fire 
Throw matches to see 
What stays out of sight 
Fire fire, fire fire 

Cause when the clouds come down on this town estate 
We'll make our way to a great escape 
Throw matches to see 
What you can ignite 

We're all brought down in desperation 
By this dirty town and aggravation 
It's time to leave and find another new home 
Yeah
We've had our day 
Our day is done so 
In this weird landscape let's do it over 
There's no time to waste 
To find another new home 

Throw matches to see 
What you can ignite 
Fire fire, fire fire 
Throw matches to see 
What stays out of sight 
Fire fire, fire fire 

Cause when the clouds come down on this town estate 
We'll make our way to a great escape 
Throw matches to see 
What you can ignite
