You're dynamite!
You're dynamite!

Dynamite! Hey, baby when you kiss it's
Dynamite! Hey, baby when you hug and 
Hold me tight, I just explode like dynamite
If I might do all that things I'd love to 
Do tonight, then I would love you dear with 
All my might, because you're dynamite

You do such big attraction chain reaction things to me
They ought make you wear sign of danger T.N.T.

Love me right
Hey,baby let's make history tonight 
The power of one hour of love's delight
Just knocks me out like dynamite
