I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved
I've been pushed down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart into
It happens every time
I've been made blue
I've been lied to 
When will I be loved
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart into
It happens every time
Oh, I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved
When will I be loved
Tell me, when will I be loved
