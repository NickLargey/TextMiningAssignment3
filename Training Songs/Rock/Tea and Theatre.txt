Will you have some tea
At the theater with me?
We did it all
Didn't we?

Jumped every wall
Instinctively
Unraveled codes
Ingeniously

Wired all the roads
So seamlessly
We made it work
But one of us failed
That makes it so sad
A great dream derailed

One of us - gone
One of us - mad
One of us - me
All of us sad
All of us sad

Lean on my shoulder now
This story is done
It's getting colder now
A thousand songs

Still smolder now
We play them as one
We're older now
All of us sad
All of us free
Before we walk from this stage
Two of us

Will you have some tea
Will you have some tea
At the theater with me
