Daddy Loves your sweet perfume 
Not the kind you bought in France 
Daddy loves to smell your sex 
Makes him want to scream and dance 
Seems we've had enough profound 
There's a point you just get down 
Sex seems to be our curse 
Honey let me quench your thirst 
I'll do you first, then do myself 
Do you first, then do myself 
Do you first then do 
Tell me what it is you fear 
Misogynistic thoughts aside 
My gypsy pussy willow dear 
Join the rolleer coaster ride 
What did you expect from me? 
What could I expect from you? 
Things have gone from bad to worse 
Honey let me stop this hurt 
So Sunday when we go to church 
Does heaven feel any near? 
Why do we call our maker's name 
More times when you and I are here 
Over and over, and over and over again 
My gypsy pussy willow dear 
Oh my God, Oh my God
