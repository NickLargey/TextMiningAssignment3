Simmer down, my head is too hot so
Simmer down, he's gonna get dropped so
Simmer down, man, here's what I say
Simmer down, now I've got to got to simmer down

A long time ago we used to be friends
Picked my bones in my pockets that's where it ends so

Simmer down, control my temper
Simmer down, the battle will be hotter
Simmer down, o.k. here's what I say
Simmer down, oh, I'm leaving in a day
Simmer down, here's what I say
Simmer down, oh, I'm leaving in a day
Simmer down, o.k. here's what I'm saying
Simmer down, it's got to be this way

Where's the love, where is the loyalty?
We did our part now where is the love?

Simmer down, control my temper
Simmer down, the battle will be hotter
Simmer down, it's hard cause it hurts so
Simmer down, kick me off

Simmer down, but the pain still exists
Simmer down, and hey I'm sure he'll be missed
Simmer down, it'll make us stronger
Simmer down, and we'll live a lot longer so
Simmer down, what goes around
Simmer down, will come around
Simmer down, I know I've got to simmer down
Simmer down, I'm trying to simmer down
Simmer down, I've got to got to simmer down oh
Simmer Down, it's hard cause it hurts
Simmer Down
