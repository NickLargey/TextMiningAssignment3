Well it hit me hard was just the other day 
Had some trouble sleeping something wasn't right 
I was out of body I was out of mid 
Like when you love somebody more than all the time 

So come on baby you know I'm begging you to stay 
You know I need your lovin' twenty-five hours a day... 

It's like my life was crashing to a big black hole 
Like my world was spinning out of my control 
Then a voice inside said better get in sync 
Better make your move it's later than you think 

Believe me baby I know it absurd to say 
I live and breath your lovin' twenty-five hours a day 
Twenty-five hours a day... 

And when the spirit moves you
You'll come shining through 
And there won't be nothing
Nothing we can't do 
Twenty-five hours a day... 

Believe me baby whatever else may come my way 
I'm gonna need your lovin' twenty-five hours a day 
Twenty-five hours a day...
