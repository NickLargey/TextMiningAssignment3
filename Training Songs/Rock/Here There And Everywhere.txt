To lead a better life, I need a love of my own here
Making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there, there

Running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking
But she doesn't know he's there

I need her everywhere
And if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes
And hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes
And hoping I'm always there

I will be here, there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
