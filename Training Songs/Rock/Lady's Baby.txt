Lady's Baby smiles and coos,
Takes away my lonely blues.
(Lady's/Baby's?) mother cooks my meals,
Warm and cool is really real...

Runnin' never was much fun -
All it did was bring me down.
Chasin' round isn't where it's at.
Tension puts you in the ground.

Lady's Baby pulls my hair,
Lets me know he's really there.
(Lady's/Baby's?) mother touches me,
And at last I really see...

Runnin' never was much fun -
All it did was bring me down.
Chasin' round isn't where it's at.
Tension puts you in the ground.

Lady's Baby lets me know
Life was meant for movin' slow.
(Lady's/Baby's?) mother knows this too.
Lady, I love you.
