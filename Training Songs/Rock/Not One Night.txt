I used to dream of only you
Now I don't do that.
I used to miss talkin' to you
Oh, now I don't do that.

Since you've been gone I learned to stop
Tryin' to hold on because

there's not one night, one single day
That I wouldn't give to you.
So with all my might in every way,
I'll try to forget you too.

I thought you could tell me anything
Yeah, you used to do that.
You let me inside of everything
Yeah, you used to do that.

Never to change at least I thought
It feels so strange because

there's not one night, one single day
That I wouldn't give to you.
So with all my might in every way,
I'll try to forget you too.

Loneliness may come knockin' at my door
Where I'm comin' from that don't phase me anymore.
Time has shed a little light on where I'm supposed to be
There ain't no used in thinking you'll come running back to me.

Since you've been gone I learned to stop
Tryin' to hold on because

there's not one night, one single day
That I wouldn't give to you.
So with all my might in every way,
I'll try to forget you too.
