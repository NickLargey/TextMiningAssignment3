One thing I've learnt after all these years
You're gonna save yourself a whole lot of tears
Don't try to figure out who was wrong and who was right
Got to move along, baby

That's right, you got to roll with the punches
Yeah, you've got to go with the flow
Roll with the punches
Yeah, that's one thing I know

No use staring at your old photograph
Walkin' around your neighborhood, gotta tear it in half
Only one way you can clear your tormented mind
Stop thinking she was one of a kind

You've got to roll with the punches
Man, you've got to go with the flow
Roll with the punches
Oh, that's the only way to go 

No use staring at your old photograph
Walkin' around your neighborhood, gotta tear it in half
Only one way you can clear your tormented mind
Stop thinking she was just one of a kind

You've got to roll with the punches
Man, you've got to try and go with the flow
Got to roll with the punches
Man, that's the only way you go

You've got to roll with the punches
Got to roll with the punches
Got to roll with the punches
Man, you've got to go with the flow
Roll with the punches
Man that's the only way to go
Only way to go, yeah, yeah, yeah
