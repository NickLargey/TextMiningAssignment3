Here I am in my four corner cage, I need the love that my momma gave back
Then at that tender age when my daddy used to call me babe
Didn't have to run for love
Didn't have to run for love
Sometimes I get up and I feel fine, other times I can't relax my mind 
Straight shot, keep cryin' for my momma,pure love straight shot
Straight shot, keep cryin' for my momma,pure love straight shot
Now I've found somethin' close to what I thought only mother's love could do
She read my mind and then I knew she was the one I could do it too
Sometimes I get up and I feel fine, other times I can't relax my mind
Straight shot, keep cryin' for my momma,pure love, straight shot
Straight shot, keep cryin' for my momma,pure love, straight shot
