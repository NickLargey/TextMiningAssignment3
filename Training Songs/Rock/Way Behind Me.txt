I don't remember what you said  
I'm gonna leave the past behind me   
all those lies inside your head 
 took my hand and lead me blindly   
I'm gonna try my best move  
I'm gonna leave you way behind me  
I'm gonna try my best move  
I'm gonna leave you way behind me   
I want to go  
I want leave  
I want to grow  
I want to breathe   
I didn't want to be a fool  
took my hand and so unkindly  
cut me down with words so cruel  
I'm gonna leave you way behind me   
I'm gonna try my best move  
I'm gonna leave you way behind me  
I'm gonna try my best move  
I'm gonna leave you way behind me   
I don't remember what you said  
I'm gonna leave the past behind me  
 all those lies inside your head 
 took my hand and lead me blindly   
I'm gonna try my best move  
I'm gonna leave you way behind me  
I'm gonna try my best move  
I'm gonna leave you way behind me   
I want to go  
I want to leave  
I want to grow  
I want to breathe   
I'm gonna try my best move  
I'm gonna leave you way behind me  
I'm gonna try my best move  
I'm gonna leave you way behind me   
way behind me  
way behind me  
way behind me
