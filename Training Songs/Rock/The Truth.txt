Mm
What if half the things ever said
Turned out to be a lie...
How will you know the truth?
If you were given all the answers
And you stopped to wonder why
But how will you know the truth?

Everybody's got a right to love
Everybody's got a right to lie
But the choice you make ain't no piece of cake
It ain't no MF piece of pie

{clock ticks}

What If time's only reason?
Was to give us all somethin' to fear?
And if so y'all, the end of the journey's so clear

Questionnaire, what did you stand for?
Questionnaire, who did you save?
When it gets right down to-wait a minute
When it gets right down to the nitty of the gritty
When it gets right down to it you take more than you gave

Everybody got a right to love
Everybody got a right to lie
But the choice you make ain't no piece of cake
It ain't no MFMF {O(+> screams the following} piece of pie {computer blips}

Mmmm oh
Gotta (Gonna?) tell the truth y'all
Gotta tell the truth
Gotta tell the truth y'all
Gotta tell the truth
Gotta tell the truth y'all
Gotta tell the truth

If there was just one day
That everybody tell the truth
We'd all trade bank accounts and move to back to Neptune
