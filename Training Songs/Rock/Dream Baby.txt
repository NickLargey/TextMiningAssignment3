Ever sit around and wonder why people
Constantly let you down
Tired of watching the late night news
It's a nightmare, nightmare, nightmare

You're starting to think
It might be time to find somebody new
You're feeling all alone
Like nobody loves you but baby I do

But baby, tonight my life's on the line
And I can't let you go
Your eyes, they take me to heaven
And your heart it already knows

Don't you cry 'cause I can't stand the pain
You and I, we can have it all again, again
Baby tonight

You say you fell in love with a man who made you feel
Like you were the only one
At first he bought you all kinds of expensive things
And then he hurt you, hurt you, hurt you

You're starting to see
Everything, everything you ever wanted in a man
Baby, is looking right at you
You said nobody loves you but baby I do

Oh babe, tonight my life's on the line
And I can't let you go
Your eyes, they take me to heaven
And your heart it already know

Don't you cry 'cause I can't stand the pain
You and I, we can have it all again, again
Baby tonight

Tonight while our hearts are beating
Tonight while the world is sleeping
While the Gods are keeping watch over you

Tonight my life's on the line
And I can't let you go
Your eyes, they take me to heaven
And your heart it already know

Tonight my life's on the line
And I can't let you go
Your eyes, they take me to heaven
And your heart it already, already knows

Tonight my life's
Take me to heaven
Tonight my life's
Take me to heaven
