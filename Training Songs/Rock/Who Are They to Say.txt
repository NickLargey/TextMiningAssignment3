Feels good
To wonder what I'm doing here
Feels right
Getting smashed with god all night
Relax
Exploit my mind
To each his own king
Within his own tribe
Define for me free at last 
We are history
They don't want no human contrast
They should know
Jekyll shouldn't have to Hyde
Who are you - who am I
Who said I can't alter my mind
Who said the puzzle needs each piece
Who said say your seven Hail Marys
And who are they to say
You keep invading me with your
Self-righteous camouflage uniform
Can't you let me be
Who I want to be
If I had gills I'd fly
You can't tell me what's right
If I lose my mind
I wonder what I'd gain tonight
A lunatic
Just livin' a real life
Stimulate me try to find me
Who would call it sin
Every Tom Dick Harry
Who said absence makes the heart grow fonder
Who said smiling means I'm happy
Who said I can't scream for mutiny
And who are they to say
Who are they to say
