Cold night
You're gone
I can't remember who was right
Or who was wrong

Warm days
With you
Girl we had everything
Nothing to lose

Used to own the world
When you were near me
Used to have it all
Now you're not here
Now all I'm hearin' is the

[Chorus]
Lonely beat of my heart
I'm lost in loneliness
I can't hear nothing but
The lonely beat of my heart
That's how it's gonna be
Till you're beside me again

Night fades
Day breaks
Another morning baby calling out your name

Walk down
These streets, yeah
I see your face in everybody's face I see
I can't stand the pain

I need you near me
Baby don't you know,
Until you're here
All I'll be hearin's is the

[Chorus]
Lonely beat of my heart
I'm lost in loneliness
I can't hear nothing but
The lonely beat of my heart
That's how it's gonna be
Till you're inside me again

Don't you know I'd give anything
To have you back in my life
Well you know baby
I would sell my soul
Just to hold you one more time

[Chorus: x2]
Lonely beat of my heart
I'm lost in loneliness
I can't hear nothing but
The lonely beat of my heart
That's how it's gonna be
Cause all I'm hearing is the
Lonely beat of my heart
