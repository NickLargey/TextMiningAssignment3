I sit and wonder what's taking them so long
Or is the time frame I use so wrong
They should have been here
But no one has shown but their absence
Became the reason for this song

I'm in love with the making of something to be
Something truthfully from within me
I love the feeling of total expression
The falling down, the no control, the filling a hole

I don't never wanna change my ways
The freedom we've created
I am proud to be a part of these days
Never underestimate it

Well, maybe I have to slow down a little
I know I really should
But it takes a lot more than I thought it would

There's always something
I think I need to do just to survive
In order to keep the fire in me alive
