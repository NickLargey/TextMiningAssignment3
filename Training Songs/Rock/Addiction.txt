You pushed too hard, you crossed the line
And uncovered a hunger you can't satisfy
Now you're lost in a haze, you just can't see
That a fucking substance won't set you free
Keep your drugs and alcohol I don't need them
No, no
I said I don't need them
We said we don't need them
You're losing respect, you're wasting your life
Just try to see yourself through these eyes man
You're letting addiction get the best of you
So just catch a breath and try to make it through
Night after night I see you banging your head against the same fucking wall
