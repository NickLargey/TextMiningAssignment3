Yeah, yeah
The invisible people
Yeah, yeah

Walking in the garden
Flowers dying
The garden is a jungle
Everywhere
Black rain is coming down
And nobody is watching
But I see you there

[Chorus]
I know you`re not a number
You got a name
We`re invisible people
Invisible people
You gotta give a hand to
Invisible people
Yeah, yeah

They`re looking out the windows
Of ivory towers
Filling in the details
They got it made
Where are we going wrong?
Won`t anybody tell me
I don`t understand

[Chorus]

Invisible people
Stand up and be counted
Invisible people
Invisible people
You gotta give a little love to
Invisible people
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Invisible people
Invisible people

Invisible people
Stand up and be counted
I know you got a voice, yeah
You got something to say
Tell me, where do we go from here?
I want to hear the message, yeah
Loud and clear

Invisible people
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

I know you`re not a number
Invisible people
Invisible people
You gotta give a little love to
Invisible people
Yeah, yeah

Invisible people
Invisible people
Invisible people
Yeah, yeah

Invisible people
You gotta give a little love to
Invisible people
Yeah
Invisible people
Yeah, yeah
