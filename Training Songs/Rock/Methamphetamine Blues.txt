Wake up
Wake up
Children don't ya hear me comin'
Get up
Get up
Because I got to have the honey
And I don't want to leave this heaven so soon
Rollin' children keep on rollin'
Rollin' children keep on rollin'
Keep the light turned low and the back door open
My love rain down like sugar so sweet
(got what you want, so come and get it)
Yes children I will
Tall lawman rides
With his uniform clean, shine on his shoes
My radio plays
Methamphetamine blues
And tell all the news
I'm rollin' just to keep on rollin'
Wake up
Children
Get right soul church, keep a lock on the kitchen
Do risks for your daddy
(I'll do it daddy)
Keep your eyes wide open and my shotgun loaded
Cause I don't want to leave this heaven so soon
Rollin' just to keep on rollin'
Rollin' just to keep on rollin'
Rollin' just to keep on rollin'
My love rain down like sugar so sweet
(got what you want, so come and get it)
Yes baby
Tall lawmen rides
With his uniform clean, shine on his shoes
My radio plays
Methamphetamine blues
And tell all the news
I'm rollin just to keep on rollin'
Rollin just to keep on rollin'
Rollin just to keep on rollin'
I don't want to leave this heaven so soon 
Rollin just to keep on rollin'
Rollin just to keep on rollin'
Rollin just to keep on rollin' 
Rollin just to keep on rollin' 
I don't want to leave this heaven so soon
