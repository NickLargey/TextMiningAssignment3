Never let a woman go even when you know she can always be replaced.
She can always be replaced.
Oh, lust only grows like anger and revenge oh beauty comes and goes but love stays until the end.

I wrote you a song Mississippi Isabel 
I even sent you flowers when you fell ill
You've the strength of the Greeks
You are God's masterpiece
You're every triumph, every victory
I believe in every breath you breathe.

And I always imagined you'd be by my side
Whether I'm hiding in the city or tearing through the wild
You're only a yoke and noose on my throat
If your beauty is a fortress then my love will be the moat.
Oh, fall in love with you, fall in love with you, I must. 

I'll consume every part of you to indulge my love lust.

Never let a woman go even when you know she can always be replaced.
She can always be replaced.
Oh, lust only grows like anger and revenge oh beauty comes and goes but love stays until the end.

Never let a woman go even when you know

With a guitar in my hand or a gun in my hand, I'd give it all up for your hand in my hand. 
For the sun on my skin as the morning begins, I'd die in the darkness to feel your skin on my skin.

Young soul
Young love
Young blood

Treasure every beating heart that sets your soul on fire.
Love will set your soul on fire.
