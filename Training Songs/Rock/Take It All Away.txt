I've never seen
Such an opening
I've never had
Such a plan that turned out right
It's not right
I'm losing pride
You steal what is real from me
You try to make me break
I'll take your pride

Take it all away, take it all away
Take it out of sight
You wonder why I'm broken
Take it all away, take it all away
Take it out of sight
You wonder why I have to lie

You never cared about anything
I even wondered
If you knew that I was alive
That's not right
I'm losing pride
You steal what is real from me
You try to make me break
I'll take your pride

Take it all away, take it all away
Take it out of sight
You wonder why I'm broken
Take it all away, take it all away
Take it out of sight
You wonder why I have to lie

Don't push me
You're pushing me
Don't push me
You're pushing me
Take it away from me
Take it all away
I'll take your pride

Take it all away, take it all away
Take it out of sight
You wonder why I'm broken
Take it all away, take it all away
Take it out of sight
You wonder why I have to lie
