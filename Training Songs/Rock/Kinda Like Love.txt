She walked in the bar room,
Not a day over twenty two,
Heads turned,
Eyes burned,
Temperatures were rising too.
And the looser and the stranger and the man behind the bar
All agreed she had potential
And that guidance was not far
Then the stranger by the station where the waitress pays her dues
Was left lookin' for a lover
Just someone else to use
It's not a long way from the dance floor to the dark of the parking lot
It's kinda like love but it's not.

[Chorus]
Kinda like love
So young and tender
Kinda like the moves you used to make but you don't remember
Kinda like being 16 and hot
When you gave it everything you got
Kinda like love but it's not.

Now the stranger
He walked over just to say, "How do you do"
He said something about Texas
But she knew what he was getting too
They ordered more tequila while the man behind the bar
Was talking about the job last year in a town that was not far away
Then I walked out of the bar room
Couldn't even turn around
I guess I know what they were going to do
I knew what was going down
It's not a long way from the dance floor to the dark of the parking lot
It's kinda like love but it's not.

[Chorus]

Kinda like being sixteen and hot
When you gave it everything you got
Kinda like love but it's not
Oh, no it's not, it's not.
