In the cities there is talk of rain and fire,
It was on the air today, it almost filled me with desire  
All our skies are grey, they say the dreamers line the streets 
Looking out from hollow houses, rivers running at their feet 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, there's panic in the world 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, there's panic in the world 

My love and I, we escaped, we left no trace 
For they had raped both body and soul  
The taste was much too hard to swallow
We ran naked through the cold  
Above our heads, in fiery red, 
The clouds, they bled like open wounds across the sky  
The wings of many nations, falling, burning, turning
Trying oh, so hard to die  

Oh, oh, oh, oh, there's panic in the world 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, there's panic in the world 

We'll find an island, we'll burn the maps, 
We'll lock our hearts and throw the keys into the sea, 
Let's be survivors, they'll never find us 
It's all behind us, I know a place they've never been  
In new horizon, in golden swarms, in comes tomorrow
It's thunder storms over the hill  
The future falls, beyond these walls 
Destiny calling, like the dawn a sweeter thrill 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, there's panic in the world 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, there's panic in the world 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, there's panic in the world
