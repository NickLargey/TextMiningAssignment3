Darling hold my hand
Let me know that you understand
That 'til I'm free
From the girl who loves me

We must be secretly
Lovers by night, strangers by day
'Til the time you can be in my arms endlessly
Lovers by night, strangers by day

She's been good to me
And she gets hurt, oh so easily
So 'til I tell her it's all over
Stay with me

Let's still be lovers by night
Strangers by day
'Til we walk, walk as one
Hand to hand in the sun
Lovers by night, strangers by day
