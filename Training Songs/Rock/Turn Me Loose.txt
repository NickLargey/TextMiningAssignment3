I'm not the lover you want me to be 
I'm just a loner man 
I got to be free 

I don't know what you want me to do 
I can't change my ways for you 

Turn me loose, hey hey 
Got to be free, hey hey 
Turn me loose, hey hey 
Cold cold city, hey hey

I'm gettin' sick of what 
You want me to do 
I'm not the one for you 
I can't pull through 

I don't know who you want me to be 
I'm just a loner mans 
I gotta be free! 

Turn me loose, hey hey 
Got to be free, hey hey 
Turn me loose, hey hey 
New york city, hey hey
