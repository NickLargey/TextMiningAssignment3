Hey there, mister teardrop
Why do you keep falling?
Can't you see you only give me away

Hey there, mister teardrop
Why do you keep falling?
Will it always, always be this way?

I tell my friends, I'm glad she's gone
I tell them little lies
And then you drop in on the scene
And they see through my disguise

Hey there, mister teardrop
Why do you keep falling?
Go away so I can smile again

I tell my friends, I'm glad she's gone
I tell them little lies
And then you drop in on the scene
And they see through my disguise

Hey there, mister teardrop
Why do you keep falling?
Go away so I can smile again
