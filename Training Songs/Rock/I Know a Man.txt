It's been years, he's been here
And time just lingers and no one knows
He's got eyes, he's got ears
He's got all his fingers and all his toes
His is a life of observation
Maybe one day he'll get to translate this information
For twenty years he hasn't spoken a word
He's been silent since the accident occurred
While so many people taken tongues for granted
Taking the truth finding ways to slant it
I know a man who'd know what to do
So many people go day in day out
Just dreaming up things they can bitch about
I know a man who'd know what to do
It's a dream, but for him it's real
And it never goes away
And it never will
He's in touch with what he feels
Ah but he just can't say
Maybe it's better still
His is a life of endless frustration
He's got his pride, he's not exempt from humiliation
Can't lift a finger to stop what's wrong
He can't lift a leg to dance to a Beatles' song
While so many people taken spines for granted
Slither and squirm, taken what they're handed
I know a man who'd know what to do
So many people go day by day
Sitting on their hands constantly complaining
I know a man who'd know what to do
So many content to exist like sheep
Never scratching the surface
Of themselves too deep
I know a man who'd know what to do
So many people like you and me
Never realizing what our lives could be
I know a man who'd know what to do
