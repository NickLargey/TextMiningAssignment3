Sit around and watch TV
God I hate what I see
Lock me up and throw away the key
I'll spend my time chugging tea

But I can't, I can't, 
It's not fair, it's not fair
Think about it while getting gray hair

[Chorus: ]
It's just another phase that I'll go through
This time I'm sure I'll lose you
Place my bets on all the jacks and queens
The probability being that it seems
I'm blind, I'm blind

Throw my change down a machine
Buy a chocolate bar so I can dream
Another day goes down the drain
Wash away, I was away all the pain

[Chorus: ]
