Take this lightning off of me
Too wonderful for me to keep
All the stories of ancient greece
Agamemnon, great ulysses

Everybody talkin' bout the language of the dead
Antiquated murmurs maybe dylan might've said
Well I'm not so self assured
I can barely sing a word

Fads of the 60's and the 19th century
Leo tolstoy and robert e. lee
We got a war on in our duplicity
Suburban white blasphemy

Everybody talkin' bout the language of the dead
Antiquated murmurs maybe dylan might've said
Well I'm not so self assured
I can barely sing a word

You can skim through every book they read
You can dress a little smarter and claim your hit
But the weight you've been seeking, you lifted it
Plagiarize the twenties you never lived

Take this lightning off of me
Too wonderful for me to keep
Throw your idols into the sea
Dreamers, get your own dream

Everybody talkin' bout the language of the dead
Antiquated murmurs maybe dylan might've said
Well I'm not so self assured
I can barely sing a word
Well I'm not so self assured
But I don't need to lift a word
