You know that it's been such a long time, honey 
Since I've been ridin' next to you 
I ain't a-waitin' in no long line, honey 
You know I'm only passin' through 

[Chorus]
Well, I got here without warning 
Well, I'm leavin' in the mornin' 
You won't find me hangin' round your door tomorrow like your other men 
Hey darlin', squeeze me in 

I've been sleepin' by the road side, honey 
Holdin' my suitcase next to me 
You can't ignore me cause it's been tried, honey 
I'm gonna get you, wait and see 

[Chorus]

Darlin', squeeze me in
