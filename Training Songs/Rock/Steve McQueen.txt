Well I went to bed in Memphis
And I woke up in Hollywood
I got a quarter in my pocket
And I'd call you if I could
But I don't know why
I gotta fly

I want to rock and roll this party
I still want to have some fun
I want to leave you feeling breathless
Show you how the west was won
But I gotta fly
I gotta fly

Like Steve McQueen
All I need's a fast machine
And I'm gonna make it all right
Like Steve McQueen
Underneath your radar screen
You'll never catch me tonight

I ain't takin' shit off no one
Baby that was yesterday
I'm an all American rebel
Making my big getaway
Yeah you know it's time
I gotta fly

Like Steve McQueen
All I need's a fast machine
And I'm gonna make it all right
Like Steve McQueen
Underneath your radar screen
You'll never catch me tonight

Like Steve McQueen
Like Steve McQueen

We got rock stars in the White House
All our pop stars look like porn
All my heroes hit the highway
They don't hang out here no more

You can try me on my cell phone
You can page me all night long
But you won't catch this free bird
I'll already be long gone

Like Steve McQueen
All we need's a fast machine
And we're gonna make it all right
Like Steve McQueen
Underneath your radar screen
You'll never catch us tonight

Like Steve McQueen
All we need's a fast machine
And we're gonna make it all right
Like Steve McQueen
Underneath your radar screen
You'll never catch me tonight
