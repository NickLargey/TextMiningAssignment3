In the biblical sense and sensibility
Let me know you
I'll kiss that smile off your face
Just say when
(Just say when)

I'm not afraid to say I love you
Any more than I used to be
Babe, I am scared to death to fall in love

All these pick up lines from hell
Icebreakers infernal
From a heart so black and blue
Only for you
(just say when again)

I'm not afraid to say I love you anymore then
I used to babe
I am scared to death
I am scared to death to fall in love with you
With you

I'm not afraid to say I love you
Anymore then I used to babe
I am scared to death
I am scared to death to fall in love

I am not afraid to admit I adore you
Anymore than I was before babe
I am scared to death
I am scared to death to fall in love
With you
With you
With you
I'm scared to death
I'm scared to death
I'm scared to death

I am scared to death and you're sweet like poison
