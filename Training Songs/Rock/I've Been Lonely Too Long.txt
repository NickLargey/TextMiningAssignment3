I've been lonely too long
I've been lonely too long

In the past it's come and gone
I feel like I can't go on without love

I've been lonely too long
I've been lonely too long

As I look back, I can see me lost and searching
Now I find that I can choose, I'm free, oh, yeah
So funny, I just have to laugh
All my troubles been torn in half

I've been lonely too long
Lonely too long

In the past it's come and gone
I feel like I can't go on without love

Lonely too long
I've been lonely so long

Just see me now, makes it worth the time I've waited
She was all I need to make me see, oh, yeah
I keep hopin' with all my mind
Everything gonna turn out right

I've been lonely too long
I've been lonely so long

Now look at me gliding through this world of beauty
Everything I do brings ecstasy, oh, yeah
No wonder I could die
I feel like I'm 'bout ten miles high

I've been lonely too long
Lonely too long

Found myself somebody
Don't have to be alone no more
'cause I've been lonely so long
Don't have to be alone no, no, no more
