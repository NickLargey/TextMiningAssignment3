I don't wanna be an endless rollercoaster
Because I don't want to bring you up and let you down
I know there's always something wrong with me
This paranoia freezes
Circles...rolling over...run away from your embrace
Your hands gently kill me...i would never be the same
You were always one to take away the madness,
And I would be the one to bring it back around
You saw the water crashing over me...
We stream around into these circles...
Rolling over...run away from your embrace
Your eyes see right through me...i would never be the same
Circles...rolling over...i can feel them...run away
Your eyes crucify me...and I would never be the same
