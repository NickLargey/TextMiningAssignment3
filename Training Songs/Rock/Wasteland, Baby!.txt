All the fear and the fire
Of the end of the world
Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens grace
Happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here, too

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love
I'm in love with you

All the things yet to come are the things that have passed
Like the old enough hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns, in worth, in a fight felt too

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love
I'm in love with you
And I love too
That love soon might end
And be known in its aching
Shown in this shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend
You are unbreaking
Though quaking
Though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby

And the day that we watch the death of the sun
That the cloud and the cold and those jeans you have on
That you gaze unafraid as they saw from the city ruins

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love
I'm in love with you
And I love too
That love soon might end
And be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend
You are unbreaking
Though quaking
Though crazy
That's wasteland, baby

And the stance of the sea
And the absence of green
Are the death of all things that I've seen and unseen
Are men but the start of all things that are left to do?

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love
I'm in love with you
That's it
