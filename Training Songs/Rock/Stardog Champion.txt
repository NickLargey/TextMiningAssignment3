san francisco, where the flowers bloom in spring
fade to winter, and see what disease brings
augustiono, with his eyes once a shining sea
he's half a shadow, god don't let that be me
i'm a stardog champion
west virginia, thats where myu father lies
wartime hero, the kind that money buys
a diamond bracelet, for my mommy memory
thats all she wrote, all she wrote for me...
i'm a stardog champion
i'm a stardog champion
and the children use ta sing of love
with grace from the lord above
and the children use ta sing out loud
etc repeat chorus etc....
