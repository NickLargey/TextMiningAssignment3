Whistle down the wind
Let your voices carry
Drown out all the rain
Light a patch of darkness
Treacherous and scary

Howl at the stars
Whisper when you're sleeping
I'll be there to hold you
I'll be there to stop
The tears and all the weeping

Make it clear and strong
So the whole night long
Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I will not abandon you 
My precious friend

So try and stand the time
Then your ways abandon
Send a flare up in the sky
Try to burn a torch

And try to build a bonfire
Every signal that you send
Until the very end out there
So whistle down the wind
For I have always been right there

Howl at the stars
Whisper when you're sleeping
I'll be there to hold you
I'll be there to stop
The tears and all the weeping

Make it clear and strong
So the whole night long
Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I will not abandon
You my precious friend

Try and stand the time
Then your ways abandon
Send a flare up in the sky
Try to burn a torch

And try to build a bonfire
Every signal that you send
Until the very end out there
So whistle down the wind
For I have always been
Right there
