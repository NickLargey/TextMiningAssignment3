Woke up alone again
Stumbling around this cold hotel room
Yeah, I lost myself again
And my guitar's still out of tune

People tell me things, like I'll never get it
Tell me to give up, tell me to forget it
Save yourself - safe yourself

[Chorus 1]
It's just another crazy kind of day
I wouldn't want it any other way
It's gonna be like
Running to the sun, and back again
I'm never giving up, or giving in
Cause I don't wanna survive - I wanna live

Kiss me good, cause I
Don't know how long, this one's gonna take
I could fail, but I'd
Rather be a fuckup, than a fake

People tell me things, like I'll never get it
Tell me to give up, they tell me to forget it
Save yourself - safe yourself

[Chorus 1]
It's just another crazy kind of day
I wouldn't want it any other way
It's gonna be like
Running to the sun, and back again
I'm never giving up, or giving in
Cause I don't wanna survive - I wanna live

Don't you let up
Keep your head up
Need to get up
No going back again, no going back again, no
I'm not listening
So stop your preaching
And save yourself - safe yourself

It's all I ever wantedâ?¦ ooh

Don't pass me over
I've got old ghosts, of my own
I'm moving out today
Yeah, I finally going home

[Chorus 1]
It's just another crazy kind of day
I wouldn't want it any other way
It's gonna be like
Running to the sun, and back again
I'm never giving up, or giving in
Cause I don't wanna survive

[Chorus 2]
It's just another crazy kind of day (it's just another - crazy day)
I wouldn't want it any other way (I wouldn't want it, I wouldn't want it)
It's gonna be like
Jumping on a ride, that never ends (jumping on a ride, that never ends)
I'm never ever going back again
Cause I don't wanna survive - I wanna live
