Once upon a time it was easy
Everything kind of fell into place
Now this feeling won't leave me
We lost the power and we lost the pace
It's staring straight between the eyes
Something isn't right
The harder we try the more we realise
Something isn't right 
So bittersweet, this whole thing, so bitter sweet 

Caught in this struggle for power
Where only blood ever tastes sweet
Everything else is so sour
The numbing failures and defeats
The loner's not a western hero
With nerves of steel and heart of gold
But here alone in the disco, icy cold 
But there's always another morning
We're never dead till the last breath
So bittersweet, this whole thing, so bitter sweet
