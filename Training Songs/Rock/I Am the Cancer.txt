So long, Matthew
I will miss you
There is too much to do
Or I'd go with you
It's a bad time
I haven't got a dime 

So long, Alison
I now know where you've been
But I don't know where you're going
There's security in knowing
But I know some morning
without any warning
You'll be gone 

Oh, you've kissed me, kissed me
Now you're supposed to miss me 

So long, Andrew
I will miss you
I just wrote you
A long note
You'd better answer
I am the cancer
Removed from you 

Oh, you miss me, miss me
Now you've got to kiss me, kiss me goodbye 

So long, scarecrow
At least with you I know
You're going nowhere
What do you care?
There's nothing up your sleeve
You can never leave 

Why would you stay there, scarecrow?
Sorry I had to go
But I shall return
It was my turn
To get away
Someone had to stay
So I could go 

I miss you most of all
Kiss me, kiss me
I can't wait until you kiss me
Until you kiss me
I can't wait 'til you kiss me
Kiss me again
