I was a child
who wanted a love so wild
though tight as slow motion
But crazed with devotion

Babe, insane with devotion,
Just a whole other notion
I was fourteen and a half
and it wasn't no laugh

Love comes in spurts (oh no, it hurts!)
Love comes in spurts (oh no, it hurts!)
Love comes in spurts (it always hurts!)
Love comes in spurts (oh no!)

I just can't get wise
to those tragical lies
though I now know the facts
they still cut like an axe

baby, love comes in spurts
in dangerous flirts
and it murders your heart
they didn't tell you that part, baby!

Love comes in spurts (oh no!)
Love comes in spurts (oh no, it hurts!)
Love comes in spurts (oh no, it hurts!)
Love comes in spurts (it always!)

I just can't get wise

Love comes in spurts (oh no!)
Love comes in spurts (oh no, it hurts!)
Love comes in spurts (oh no, oh no, oh no!)

Love comes in spurts (it always hurts!)
Love comes in spurts (oh no, it hurts!)
Love comes in spurts (oh no, it hurts!)
Love comes in spurts (oh no, oh no, oh no!)
