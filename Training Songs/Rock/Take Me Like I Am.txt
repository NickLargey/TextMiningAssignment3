I'm a-livin' on the other side
Of the track, it's true
But like it or not,
I'm just as good as you
If I see you comin' with your head held so high
Don't you worry 'bout me speaking,
I'll pass you right on by

This world is full of money,
But I haven't got a dime
Had a million heart-aches,
But I'm happy all the time
I can be like a tiger,
Or as meek as a lamb
If you want to get along with me,
You'll take me like I am

You can talk about your fancy friends
And your millionaires
I may not have their money,
But I don't have their cares
You can live in a mansion,
Set up on a golden throne
But all these things you have in life
Are gonna vanish when I'm gone

This world is full of money,
But I haven't got a dime
Had a million heart-aches,
But I'm happy all the time
I can be like a tiger,
Or as meek as a lamb
If you want to get along with me,
You'll take me like I am

This world is full of money,
But I haven't got a dime
Had a million heart-aches,
But I'm happy all the time
I can be like a tiger,
Or as meek as a lamb
If you want to get along with me,
You'll take me like I am
