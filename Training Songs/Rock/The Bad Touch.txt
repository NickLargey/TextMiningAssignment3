Ha ha, well now!
We call this the act of mating
But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about

I'd appreciate your input

Sweat, baby, sweat, baby sex is a Texas drought me
And you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel
Nuts, yes, I'm Siskel, yes I'm Ebert
And you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch,
You want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered,
Like my Waffle House hash browns
Come quicker than Fed Ex, never reaching apex like Coca-Cola
Stock you are inclined to make me rise
An hour early just like Daylight Savings Time

(Do it now)
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
(Do it again now)
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
(Gettin' horny now)

Love, the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket
Like the lost catacombs of Egypt
Only God knows where we stuck it hieroglyphics
Let me be Pacific, I want to be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean,
Means small craft advisory
So if I capsize in your thighs, high tide, be minus five
You sunk my battle ship please turn me on,
I'm Mr. Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours I'll show you mine "Tool Time"
You'll love it just like Lyle
And then we'll do it doggie style
So we can both watch X-Files

You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
