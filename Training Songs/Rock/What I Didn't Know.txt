I complain, though nothing's even wrongThat's when I said I'll need, more than
you can offer me
I miss your face, as you can tell
Hope my absence makes you well
and you're ashamed, 'cause you're not quite that strong

Cause what I didn't know, is I was killing you
I said a lot of things, that I didn't mean to
but I am older now, and I am sorry too
so I can wait awhile, if I brings me back to you

I am shy, I never speak a word
And you are numb, from all the things you never heard
That's when I said I'll need more than you can offer me
And now I own an empty space
And I can't fill it with your face

Cause what I didn't know, is I was killing you
I said a lot of things, that I didn't mean to
but I am older now, and I am sorry too
so I can wait awhile, if I brings me back to you
