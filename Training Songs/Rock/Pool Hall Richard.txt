(rod stewart, ron wood)
Sweatin' hard, I didn't get a shower
All I did was stand around and get too hot
Knowin' all the people walkin' on my side
Losin' all my money and I'm killin' time
Ol' bill he come a-runnin' like he's gettin' some
Makes you kind of jealous but it sure is fun
I don't mind but he wants my lady too

You know the crowd gets bigger
As the word goes 'round
Pool hall king was playin' back in town
Minnesota fats standin' up at the back
Tryin' to hide himself in a plastic mack
You ought to hear the silence
When the kid walks in
His reputation's bigger than gasoline
I don't mind but he's tryin' to fill my lady too, ha ha

Pool hall richard
You're far too wicked we know, ha
Pool hall richard
Kid you're wicked, we know
You broke my heart
Same as you ... could ever do

With your yellow carnation
And your pink satin shoe
You make me jealous, but I worship you
One day soon I'm gonna beat you clean
Wipe that smile right off your chin
Everybody gonna drive from miles around
Cuein' up to see me take away your crown
Then you'll never never ever take my lady then

Get out

Pool hall richard
You're far too wicked we know, ha
Pool hall richard
Kid you're wicked, we know
You broke my heart
Same as you ... could ever do

Dig this

Bam goes the brown, that's another one down
Know they play much better when the sun goes down
Bang goes the green, you're so obscene
Your hands are dirty but your scent is clean

Bam goes the blue, lock away your cue
The pool hall king is hustlin' you
Bam goes the 8-ball, didn't see it spin at all
This kid can play, oh yeah

Bam goes the brown, ooh another one down
Know they play much better when the sun goes down
Bang goes the green, you're so obscene
Your hands are dirty, your scent is clean

Damn the pink, one more to sink
Gonna beat you someday
'cause you're makin' me sick
Down on the black, at the back of the pack
Aw, you nearly missed, you ain't so hot

Pool hall richard
Kid you're wicked, we know
You broke my heart
Same as you ... could ever do

You're breakin' my heart
But you're stealin' my tart, no no no
Shut up
