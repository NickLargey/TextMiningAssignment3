Sometimes when I lay down at night 
I swear I can see to heaven 
For it's in dreaming that the things 
I always knew 
are the only thoughts I have 
And when I look up at you, love 
Handsome as a magazine 
Wild as the sun, like nothing below 
could ever pull you down 

But it's a hard road that we follow 
The saddest cities, and the darkest hollows 

People cross this world 
Over and then back again 
Never even one time lift their eyes 
Or think of what they say 

But I hear it in your voice, love 
Like someone sweetly willing 
The hope of all these years, 
the prayer of a time 
that we don't even know 

But it's a hard road that we follow 
The saddest cities, and the darkest hollows 

But I hear it in your voice, love 
The strongest sound 
I've ever heard 
Like water from a well 
so deep in the ground 
I'll never thirst again 

But it's a hard road that we follow 
The saddest cities, and the darkest hollows 

And everything that's far away 
And was lost from me 
I see it all from here in you
