there are no flowers in his house 
there are no paintings hung on the wall 
there is no fire 

oh he is the loneliest man in the world 

he never knows what the time is 
or the day or the month of the year 
time means nothing to him 

there is no sunshine in his house 
he never draws the curtains at 
all he lives in his own world 
because he is the loneliest man in the world 

he doesn't have any friends 
nobody likes him at all 
he is so weird because 
he is the loneliest man in the world 

he is the loneliest man I've ever seen 
he doesn't speak at all 
but inside I know a voice must scream 
lLet me out, let me out
