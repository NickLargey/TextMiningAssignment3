But you're not the guilty one
I'll go back and pick another girl again
Close my eyes cos I know that they're all the same

At the love parade
At the love parade
At the love parade
At the love parade

We were lovers from the start
What's the point of it - What's the point of our love ?
But since then we've grown apart
What's the point of it - What's the point of our love ?
Nothing now can make us lovers and we know
What's the point of it - What's the point of our love ?
So the two of us are going to see just what's on show
What's the point of it - What's the point of it ?

At the love parade ...

It takes its time passing by
And gives a chance for the loving eye
So see a face and let the body try
To get them moving side by side

We were lovers from the start
