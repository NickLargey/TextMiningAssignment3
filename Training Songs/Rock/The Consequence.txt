Calm down, she said,
Consider this a warning,
A souvenir for the morning,
A headache that you can't fix.
I said I can talk my,
My way out of anything,
But I am struggling,
In this emergency.
This one's on your side,
I said this one's on your

Ambulance,
I'm calling you now,
Accidents,
Bring the house down.
Come on, come on,
You don't know me.
Come on, come on,
You owe me nothing.

Dry your eyes and,
Stick them on ice.
Give your chest a rest it's,
Been cold your whole life.
I'll have you know the table's,
Are about to turn and,
You're going to get,
What, what, what,
You deserve.

Ambulance,
I'm calling you now,
Accidents,
Bring the house down.
Come on, come on,
You don't know me.
Come on, come on,
You owe me nothing.

And is this it my love?
(Turn it up, turn it up, I wanna hear you scream)
Oh, is this it my love?
(Turn it up, turn it up, I wanna hear you scream)

Sing, I am my own worst enemy,
That's what she said to me.
And I am living out your dream.

So sing, I am my own worst enemy,
So we can just breathe,
A little more safely.

Ambulance,
I'm calling you now,
Accidents,
Bring the house down.
Come on, come on,
You don't know me.
Come on, come on,
You owe me nothing.

And is this it my love?
(Turn it up, turn it up, I wanna hear you scream)
Oh, is this it my love?
(Turn it up, turn it up, I wanna hear you scream)
Sing...
