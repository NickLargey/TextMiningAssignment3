I know tomorrow is a maybe.
It doesn't seem so guaranteed.
It seems for once we're finally happy, 
And blessed with everything we need.

So take the highway west again
Follow the Sundown
Try to hold on while we can
Follow the Sundown
It could be better in the end.
Follow the Sundown
But we're saving every second of today.
Let's follow the sundown.

Chances come and chances leave you
Stranded on the beaten path
I'm not looking for what's to good to be true.
I'd sure love to see you laugh.

So take the highway west again
Follow the Sundown
Try to hold on while we can
Follow the Sundown
It could be better in the end.
Follow the Sundown
But we're saving every second of today.
Let's follow the sundown.

You can't stop running, no you can't stop running. No you can't stop running now.

So take the highway west again
Follow the Sundown
Try to hold on while we can
Follow the Sundown
It could be better in the end.
Follow the Sundown
But we're saving every second of today.
Let's follow the sundown.
