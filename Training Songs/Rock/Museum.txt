I drink sweet wine for breakfast
I sleep but an hour or so
I smiled a little in the silence
Deciding on where to go 
Meet me under the whale 
At the Natural History Museum
I think that's where she said
A little bit sad about having to leave them
Yawning in the sun
It's like a child I run

Don't do it if you don't want to 
I wouldn't do a thing like that
No, don't do it if you don't want to 
I wouldn't do a thing like that

So little do you think of beauty 
Isn't it a shame what ho
Maybe you should go get your flowerin'?
And make all your troubles go 
There she stood in drag
A looking cool in astrakhan
She's huggin' a little white dog
Said I looked like Peter Pan 
And yawning in the sun
It's like a child I run

Don't do it if you don't want to 
I wouldn't do a thing like that
No, don't do it if you don't want to 
I wouldn't do a thing like that
Don't do it if you don't want to 
I wouldn't do a thing like that
No, don't do it if you don't want to 
I wouldn't do a thing like that
