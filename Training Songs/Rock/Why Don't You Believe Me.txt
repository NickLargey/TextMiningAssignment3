Please tell me why
Tell me why

Why don't you believe me
It's you, I adore
(Please believe, please believe)
(Please believe)

Forever and ever
Can I promise more

I've told you so often
The way that I care
(Please believe, please believe)
(Please believe)

Why don't you believe me
It just isn't fair

Here is a heart that is lonely
Here is a heart you can take
Here is a heart for you only
That you can keep or break

How else can I tell you
What more can I do
(Please believe, please believe)
(Please believe)

Why don't you believe me
I love only you

Why don't you believe me
I love only you
