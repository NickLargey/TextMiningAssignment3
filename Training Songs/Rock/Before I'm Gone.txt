Butter on a summer day
When she's around
I was on the tracks
When the gate came down
Suddenly I recognized
Those bloodshot rear view mirror eyes as mine

I heard that whistle call my name
I almost drove away
But Megan I had a feeling that you would be on that train
So I just waited there for you

Caught a ride to another town
Where the air was clean
And the sun never goes down
Everyone was standing in a line
Between the landing and the stairs

I heard somebody call my name
I almost climbed the stairs
But Megan I had a feeling that someday you'd meet me there
So I just waited there for you

Butter on a summer day
When I hear that name
It's a dream that never came true
Sat down on the tracks
And waited for a train to take me back to you

Somebody came and took my hand
I finally had to go
But Megan I just want you to know
That I waited as long as I could

Butter on a summer day when she's around
