Another obituary in the paper today
One more for the list of those who've already fallen
Another one of our comrades is taken down
Like so many others of our calling

We tweet our anecdotes, our commentary
Or we sing his songs in some sad tribute
While the tabloids are holding a story of kiss and tell
That he's no longer able to deny or refute

50,000 voices rising every time he'd sing
And every word he ever wrote reflecting back to him

How well I remember the stadiums we played
And the lights sweeping across a sea of 50,000 souls we'd face
A serious drug that you could never kick
Or one that you couldn't imagine you'd ever replace

We flew like kites on the wings of amphetamine
Secured only to a bass line and a snare drum beat
But really what did any of it mean?
When there's a higher philosophy in reflection and defeat

50,000 voices rising every time he'd sing
And every word he ever wrote reflecting back to him
Still believing that old lie, the one that your own face betrays
Rock stars don't ever die, they only fade away

Reflecting now on my own past
Inside this prison I've made of myself
I'm feeling a little better today
Although the bathroom mirror is telling me something else

These lines of stress, one bloodshot eye
The unhealthy pallor of a troubled ghost
Where did I put my spectacle case?
I'm half blind and as deaf as any post

50,000 hands are raised to a man that's just like you and me
We create the gods we can and gift them immortality
Still believing that old lie, the one that your own face betrays
Rock stars don't ever die, they only fade away
