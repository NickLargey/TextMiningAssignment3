The city street is hot
The heat is escalating
Every corner in the town, there's a paycheck waiting
Put a flower in your pocket
If you seem them boy you drop it and you run
Run
They may pretend they like you
But man's best friend will bite you just for fun
Fun

If they're gunning for you boy
You've already won

I had a dream today
About a hustle lost
He paid his dues
Then he paid the cost
Wish I knew back then
All I know right now
Things would be much different
The time has allowed
Put a flower in your pocket
If you seem them boy you drop it and you run
You run
They may pretend they like you
But man's best friend will bite you fust for fun
Fun
If they're gunning for you boy
You've already won

With tired eyes
And bills to pay
You gotta make it through
Another day
The streets can see
Into your soul
It ain't where ya been
But where you're gonna go

Put a flower in your pocket
If you seem them boy you drop it and you run
Run
They may pretend they like you
But man's best friend will bite you just for fun
For fun
If they're gunning for you boy
You've already won
