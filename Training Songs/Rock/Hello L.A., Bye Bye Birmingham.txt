I packed everything I own and I put it in a knapsack
I'm leaving Birmingham, yes, I am, and I ain't lookin' back
I bought me a guitar and I wrote a song
I played it for the DJ on the telephone

Going out to Hollywood, feeling good, yes, I am
Hello L.A., bye, bye Birmingham
Alright

Riding on a Greyhound bus 'cross the Tennessee borderline
Eating from a Po' Boy sandwich, taking drinks from a quart of wine
I got to get off at the very last stop
My ticket's only good to Little Rock

Going out to Hollywood, feeling good, yes, I am
Hello L.A., bye, bye Birmingham

I got mixed up with a big city woman in Little Rock
I had to spend a week one time in the county jail
I had to take a two-day job to get my guitar out of hock
That's the way it goes when you got no dough to make bail

I ran out of transportation funds, I had to hitchhike
I caught me a ride with a tattooed dude on a motorbike
People gonna know when I'm in town
Heads are gonna turn when they hear my sound

Going out to Hollywood, feeling good, yes, I am
Hello L.A., bye, bye Birmingham
Ow, uh

You know that I'm tired of going down
I believe I'm gonna leave this town
I'm leaving Birmingham, yes, I am
Yes, I am, yes, I am

Hello L.A., bye, bye Birmingham
Hello L.A., bye, bye Birmingham
Hello L.A., bye, bye Birmingham
Hello L.A., bye, bye Birmingham

Bye, bye Birmingham
Bye, bye Birmingham
Bye, bye Birmingham
Bye, bye Birmingham
Bye, bye Birmingham
