Sex
Sex is perverted and sick
Come with me, share the magic, live the dream
Let's go down to groovy street and catch the scene
We'll lose ourselves, get our kicks, embrace the beat
Forget what's real and burn out on a love so sweet
Fever's got me walking blind
I cannot see, I've lost my mind
I like to watch the way you walk
I live to hear the words you talk
I'd like to know the things you do
When no one's there to spy on you
I want to crawl inside your head
To kiss your mind and lips of red
I dig the things you do to me
You've lit the fire to set me free, oh baby
Underneath hot white light, give a scream
Takes us up into the sky, and sets us free
We'll lose ourselves, get our kicks, embrace the beat
Forget what's real and burn out on a love so sweet
Take all you need and leave the rest
Now follow me to take the best
