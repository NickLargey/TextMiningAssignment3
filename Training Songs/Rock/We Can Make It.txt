Started out today in the usual way. 
Then I saw your letter laying there. 
Hard love is tearing me down. 
Sometimes I feel like I'm done but looking back at all the things that we've got going. 
Hopefully, you'll be back around. 
I fall down on my knees. 
You and me could find a way now. 
I'm feeling quite ok. 
I said I was ok. 
Ever since I found you never left. 
I'll be ok to find you never left.
