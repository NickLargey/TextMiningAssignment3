The clash --- the crash
Of an aluminum chair against a human skull
Is something that I won't soon forget
A wooden beam around six feet tall
In the wrong place
At the wrong time
Beats against reddening flesh
I remember the feeling being pushed from behind
Abrupt - disturbing
Angrily, I turn to find
Innocent people panic to search
For refuse in whatever works
Enter my space and start to cry
Hello my friends I can't help you today
How frightening it is to be dealt with this way
Someday
This will all fade away
Someday
The face --- determination
People fighting for what they believe in
Sounds noble? Or just an excuse
The indoors of this crowded hall
Turned into solid prison walls
When hate and anger and all hell broke loose
