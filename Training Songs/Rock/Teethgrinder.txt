This feels good, nothing can stop me
Every nerve pumping hard through me
Every thought rushes at full speed
This false smile grates through babyteeth

(I'm a teethgrinder)
Teethgrinder
(In my sleep I grind my teeth)
(I'm a teethgrinder)
Teethgrinder
(In my sleep I grind my teeth)

Think to win, and I'm up on it
I can't lose, I've got nothing to
Try me now, I'll try anything
This is me, this is what I feel

(I'm a teethgrinder)
Teethgrinder
(In my sleep I grind my teeth)
(I'm a teethgrinder)
Teethgrinder
(In my sleep I grind my teeth)

(Losing his mind and he feels it going)
(Losing his mind)
(Losing his mind and he feels it going)
(Losing his mind)
(Losing his mind)

(I'm a teethgrinder)
Teethgrinder
(In my sleep I grind my teeth)
(I'm a teethgrinder)
Teethgrinder
(In my sleep I grind my teeth)

(I'm a teethgrinder, in my sleep I grind my teeth)
