Sand me down to the nerve 
Made to live on stouneground words 
Imagine that, you've done all that 
And I come back for more 
Imagine that, I lived on that 
And I will live for more 
 
I entered dancing and looked for my partner 
I thought the path could be a double road 
You played my heart like a drum beating warning 
Oh, I guess I'm gonna dance this one alone 
 
I'll go to the garden that follows the seasons 
Live in the field where the healing grass grows 
Go to the mountains where air's clear for breathing 
Clear is just another way to see 
I feel to know 
 
Cleanse in the ocean, bathe in the power 
Live with the sea and I rise for the tide 
Go to the place where the water will bring me 
I'm the rivers lover, but I'll be the oceans bride 
 
And they sand me down to the nerve 
Make me live on stouneground words 
Imagine that, you've done all that 
And I come back for more 
Imagine that, I lived on that 
And I will live for more
