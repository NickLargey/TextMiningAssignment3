Well, I got my friends
And I don't need more friends
I can count my friends on both hands
Came an evil man, cut off one hand
Now I count my friends on the other hand
On the other hand
Was an evil man, money on his mind
He don't want chump change
He want the big kind
He want the big kind
Well, I got my friends
And I don't need more friends
I can count my friends on both hands
On the other hand
But on the other hand....
