I go to sleep, before 
The devil wakes 
And I wake up, before 
The angels take 

All my worldly desires 
All my yardsticks of fear 

All my secrets untold 
All my motives unclear 

Hangin' down in the fire 
Burnin' them higher
Won't take them away from here

And long after we're gone
The light will stay on
The light will stay on

Watched the city, city of crows
Watched them fly, watched
'Em all flyin' low

Out above the flood plain
Just above the dirt road
They were hungry as winter, 
Hungry as us
Not afraid to be flyin', not
Afraid to be lost

And long after we're gone
The light will stay on
The light will stay on

And if you bury me, add
Three feet to it
One for your sorrow, two
For your sweat
Three for the strange
Things we never forget

And long after we're gone
The light will stay on
The light will stay on

And long after we're safe
The lights will not fade
The lights will not fade
