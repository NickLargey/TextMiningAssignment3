I'm walkin' out for love
I'm walkin' bad really down
Like a cool breeze
I'm gonna be late again
Driver, wait for me please!
I'm runnin' all in vain
Tryin' to catch
This fuckin' train
Time don't fool me no more
And I throw my watch to the floor
It's so lazy
Time don't do it again
Now I'm stressed and strained
With anger and pain
In the subway train

Now it's half past two
Long gone the rendezvous
Now it's half past three
Time made a foul out of me
Now it's half past four
Oh baby can't you see
No use in waiting no more
It's a timing tragedy
I think it's nine
When clock says ten
This girl wouldn't wait
For the out of time
Out of time man

Time don't fool me no more
And I throw my watch to the floor
It's so lazy
Time don't do it again
Now I'm stressed and strained
With anger and pain
In the subway train

Now it's half past two
Long gone the rendezvous
Now it's half past three
Time made a foul out of me
Now it's half past four
Oh baby can't you see
No use in waiting no more
It's a timing tragedy
I think it's nine
When clock says ten
This girl wouldn't wait
For the out of time
Out of time man

Now it's half past two
Long gone the rendezvous
Now it's half past three
Time made a foul out of me
Now it's half past four
Oh baby can't you see
No use in waiting no more
It's a timing tragedy

Now it's half past two
Long gone the rendezvous
Now it's half past three
Time made a foul out of me
Now it's half past four
Oh baby can't you see
No use in waiting no more
It's a timing tragedy

Now it's half past two
Long gone the rendezvous
Now it's half past three
Time made a foul out of me
Now it's half past four
Oh baby can't you see
No use in waiting no more
It's a timing tragedy

Now it's half past two
Long gone the rendezvous
Now it's half past three
Time made a foul out of me
Now it's half past four
Oh baby can't you see
No use in waiting no more
It's a timing tragedy
