Thing we do at night
Keeping it together
‘Til the morning light
When you’re nobody’s somebody
You want to be somebody’s somebody

Things we do at night
Keeping it together
‘Til the morning light
When you’re nobody’s somebody
But somebody forgot to say
Hey, where’s the party baby
All you have to do is show

I know
Wave goodbye
So loud
We can be one
So lay down
You caught my eye
So loud
Why can’t we be one

Things we do at night
Keeping it together
‘Til the morning light
When you’re nobody’s somebody
You want to be somebody’s somebody

Things we do at night
Keeping it together
‘Til the morning light
When you’re nobody’s somebody
But somebody forgot to say
Hey, where’s the party baby
All you have to do is show

So I say let that shit go and take control

She knows
Wave goodbye
So loud
We can be one
Let me show you what you mean to me
Baby you can take every piece of me
I know that I’m safe
When you look at me
Anything anything anything

Things we do at night
Keeping it together
‘Til the morning light
When you’re nobody’s somebody
You want to be somebody’s somebody

Things we do at night
Keeping it together
‘Til the morning light
When you’re nobody’s somebody
But somebody forgot to say
Hey, where’s the party baby
All you have to do is show

This is life
I know exactly what the f*ck I’m doing
Everyday I wake up
Knowing who and what I’m pursuing
I know my life is beautiful
Not far away
I’m trying to make it through the night
To get to this fucking day
