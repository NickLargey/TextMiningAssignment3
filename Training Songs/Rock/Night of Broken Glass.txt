Night of broken glass
It was a night of broken glass
It was the first
But it's not the last
It was a night of broken glass
It was a night of broken glass
It was the first
But it's not the last
It was a night of broken glass

And I
Don't wanna feel that way
Don't wanna go back there
Don't wanna feel that
Ever and ever and ever and ever and ever again
Don't wanna fell that way
Don't wanna go back there
Don't wanna feel that
Ever and ever and ever and ever and ever again

Night of broken glass
It was a night of broken glass
It was the first
But it's not the last
It was a night of broken glass
It was a night of broken glass
It was the first
But it's not the last
It was a night of broken glass

And I
Don't wanna feel that way
Don't wanna go back there
Don't wanna feel that
Ever and ever and ever and ever and ever again
Don't wanna fell that way
Don't wanna go back there
Don't wanna feel that
Ever and ever and ever and ever and ever again
