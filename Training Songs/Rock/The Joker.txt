I think I'm going back from where I came
There's something that I feel but can't explain
People running round and round
Putting one another down
The joker laughs the joker cries
He sees the world through weary eyes
People running round and round
Putting one another down

Too many people, they don't know where they're going
There are no haloes showing
"Peace and love", just greed and hate
It's not too late to see we're all the same
The joker sees a better way
But people laugh and turn away
