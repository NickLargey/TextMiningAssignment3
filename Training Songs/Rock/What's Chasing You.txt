Too late, too late to tell you I’m gonna build a world around you
Too far, too far away for me to pull you in and show you
Just what I can do with a lover who tries
To bend with me too

What’s chasing you? Ooh-ooh-ooh-hooo!
What’s chasing you? Ooh-ooh-ooh-hooo!

I don’t understand a single word that you say
Baby, are you talking to me?
Words are twisting 'round a wire again
Make you send in all the secrets of your heart

Oh, why do we do what we do when we lie?
We give shape to the struggle

What’s chasing you? Ooh-ooh-ooh-hooo!
What’s chasing you? Ooh-ooh-ooh-hooo!
Ooh-ooh-ooh-hooo!

Too late, too late to tell you I’m gonna build a world around you
Too far, you’re too far away for me to pull you in and show you
Just what I can do with a lover who tries
To bend with me too

What’s chasing you? Ooh-ooh-ooh-hooo!
What’s chasing you? Ooh-ooh-ooh-hooo!
What’s chasing you? Ooh-ooh-ooh-hooo!
Ooooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-hooo! Oooh-ooh
