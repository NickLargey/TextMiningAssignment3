Throw your hands up to the sky 
And scream out loud I'm free 
Cause wrong is the new right 
So we can cut loose tonight 
It costs a lot to look this cheap 

Fire makes it burn and water makes it turn 
We must still be here living on earth 
They keep telling me Jesus walked on water 
He shoulda surfed 

In 1918 the great bambino 
Kicked a piano into Willis Pond 
But Johnny Damon swung a bat 
Grand slam that was that 
An eighty six year curse is gone 

Throw your hands up to the sky 
And scream I'm not alone 
Is it irony or fate 
Don't become what you hate 
We've all got stardust in our bones 

Get it like you like it
