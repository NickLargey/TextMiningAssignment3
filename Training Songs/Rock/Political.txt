I was tired of being put right down
By myself for not being what you
Thought you had found
Pulled hard in two directions by a
Desire to learn
And my old affections

When I tried to share my world with you
You could not seem to tolerate
The people I had grown to love
They shrank under your scrutiny,
Became the ones you'd hate

Why did everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?
Everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?

I was feeling a little underwhelmed
About hanging around with you and
Feeling over cautious
Every word, every little look, every little sigh
Every little phrase
Put me deeper in your doghouse

You'd let me out to run across your world
I ran into a wall you told me I built it
Then you'd reel me in, ream me out, pick me up
Push me out again
And then repeat it

Why did everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?
Everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?
Everything, everything with you and me was

Too busy tripping on my tongue
To try and stand my ground
And I can still see myself crying in your lap
Asking you, are you happy with the man you have found?

I'm grateful for what you did for me
I can see things now I never would have seen
And today I thought about what could have been
But could never be for you and me

'Cause everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me had to be so political
Everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?
Everything, everything
With you and me was so political
Oh political
