united in a scream
we'll tell them you and me
we are the outcast
and we're proud to be
in this lost society
we were never meant to be
we are the rebels
and here to tear it down
 
the teachers the can't teach us
our parents don't understand
that we rule our own lives
and they've lost command
don't wont to grow old
our dreams won't be sold
we'll do it our way
no matter what they say
 
chorus:
we're gonna stay together
rise up and scream forever
we're gonna carry on
united in a scream
we're gonna cry out loud
'cause we're the future
  
don't' wait
live your dreams today
forget the rules
tomorrow will be too late
let'em think we're crazy
let'em think we're wild
they're just programmed to be
deaf, dumb and blind
 
we listen to our won voice
and follow the heart
we'll make our stand in every town
and they will never stop us
the young, the wild and free
we stand united in a scream
