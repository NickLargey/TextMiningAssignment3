Oh can't you, can't you see
Hesitation is a thing of the past, the past, this will never last
As long as we intend it

We are too young
We are too young

It took a long time to get here today
It took a long path to in your way
Ooh it's such a distance far from home

We will be pressed
I'm back from the dead
I'm back from the dead

Why don't you understand?
Our generation will be one of the last, the last, we'll become the past
As long as we are human

We're much too old
We're much too old

It took a long time to get here today
It took a long path to get in your way
Ooh it's such a far distance from home

We will be pressed
I'm back from the dead
I'm back from the dead

We will be pressed
I'm back from the dead
I'm back from the dead

Ooh
Ooh

I said, I said, you're believin'
I said, I said, you're believin'
