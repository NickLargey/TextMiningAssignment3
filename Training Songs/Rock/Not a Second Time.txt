You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you yeah
And now you've change your mind
I see no reason to change mine
My crying's through ooh ooh

You were giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then you're back again
Oh no no not a second time

You say you spoke too soon
And now you want to change your tune
Well I do too yeah
You want to try again
I got no reason to pretend
I ain't your fool oh oh

You were giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then you're back again
Oh no no not a second time

Not a second time, not a second time
Not a second time, not a second time

Not a second time, not a second time
Not a second time, not a second time

Not a second time, not a second time
Not a second time, not a second time
