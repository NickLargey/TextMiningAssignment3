Monday morning. 
 It feels like I'm going down.
 
 Every wasted day is
 Going through my head	

 Monday morning
 Know how it feels to be young
 And challenge everyone
 Do you know how it feels

 I run at nights till I drop
 I run at nights till I drop
 Cause I am astray in my head
 And that?s in everything I do
 I am astray in my head
 So I can?t hear a thing you,
 hear a thing you say

 Monday morning 
 Feels like I?m going down
 Every wasted day is going
 through my head

 Early evenings
 These are the times I love
 But every now and then
 it feels like I am dead

 I run at nights till I drop
 I run at nights till I drop

 Cause I am astray in my head
 And that?s in everything I do
 I am astray in my head
 So I can?t hear a thing you,
 hear a thing you say
