You know I got to show you
Nobody else before you
Ever gave me such a beautiful feelin'
Oh woman you touched a-my soul now
Honey don't a-let go now
Hold on baby just a little bit tighter
Hold on a-just a little bit tighter now baby
I love you so much and I can't let go no, no, no
Hold on a-just a little bit tighter now baby
Love is so surprising
Opened up my eyes and you
Reached out and took my hand
Baby you touched a-my soul now
Woman don't let go now
Hold on baby just a little bit tighter
Hold on a-just a little bit tighter now baby
I love yo so much and I can't let go
