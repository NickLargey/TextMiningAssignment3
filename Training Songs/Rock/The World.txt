Hatred from your closed mind, nothing you think is gonna change, 
your actions speak so loud, not gonna try a different way, we live together
We're worlds apart down on the streets because we're too proud, 
no one will ever admit defeat
The world is a smoking gun that is loaded, 
soon it's gonna blow you away but till now nobody has noticed 
but we're goin' to have our say

Where do we draw the line, nobody seems to have a clue, 
we're at each other's throats cause we don't share a point of view 
so what's the problem, can't see beneath the shade of skin, 
a vicious circle, a human race no one can win

The world is a smoking gun that is loaded, 
soon it's gonna blow you away but till now nobody has noticed 
but we're goin' to have our say

It's just a state of mind, it's not reality, 
it's all psychosomatic static inhumanity, 
a savage mental sickness that plagues the human race, 
it's goin' to blow up in your face, the world is a smoking gun that is loaded, 
soon it's gonna blow you away but till now nobody has noticed 
but we're goin' to have (our say)
The world is a smoking gun that is loaded, 
soon it's gonna blow you away but till now nobody has noticed 
but we're goin' to have our say
