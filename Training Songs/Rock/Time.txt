You come to see
What's been going on with me
Ain't got no doubts
As you sit down on my couch
Girl I feel low
Just thought you should know
So you blow your little smoke
Right in my face
Honey there's a lot of things
We should really, really say.
You know it takes time
But time doesn't notice
Not at all.
Got fired from my job
'cause I was lying to my boss
My shirts all got holes
I got no money, no control
My soul's getting down
She said to me as she started to frown
Don't go blowing your mind on things
You'll never, never know
Sadly she said, I think it's time for me to go
God, love, and money
Is baffling me
And even though I'm losing you honey
There's just so much more that I need.
