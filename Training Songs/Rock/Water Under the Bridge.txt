They baptized me one fine day 
Down at the river's edge 
All my sins are washed away 
Like water under the bridge 

I had a little girl and her eyes were blue 
She lived just over the ridge 
Her love ran deep and her love ran true 
Like water under the bridge 

Sailin' away on a paper boat 
As far as I can go 
All the way to New Orleans 
And the Gulf of Mexico 

River run clear river run clean 
River run rough sometime 
River run wild and it run serene 
Just like a friend of mine 

Tie my troubles in a gunnysack 
And throw em' over the edge 
Sailin' away and I won't be back 
Like water under the bridge 

You might be saint you might be sinner 
You might be Billy The Kid 
You might crap out or roll a winner 
It's water under the bridge
