When someday-ay, you wake up feelin' ba-ad
The best you had, was all used up yesterday
You need some way-ay-ay
To work out all your drea-eams
You need some place to wait for a better day

Well you can call on me-ee
You know where I'll be-ee-ee-ee
God knows you've been here before
And you can stop, turn yourself arou-ound
And lay it all dow-ow-own

And when you get days
Heavy with pai-ain
I'll give you my nights, ea-easy old lo-ovin
When all your hear-ear-eart fee-eels is the rai-ai-ain 
I'll help you to see the su-un up there shi-inin'

Well you can call on me-ee-ee-ee
You know where I'll be-ee
And God knows you've been here before-ore 
And darlin', you can stop
Turn yourself arou-ound
And lay it all dow-ow-own

And if my are-arms can comfort you
And help you throu-ough the lonely night 
(Help you through the night)
I'll lay out all of my love for you, girl
'Til the mornin' comes
'Til the mornin' co-omes arou-ound

And you can ca-a-a-a-all on me
You know where I'll be-ee
'Cause God knows you've been here before-ore
And darlin', you can stop
Turn yourself arou-ound
And lay it all dow-ow-own

Oh, oh, oh you can stop
Turn yourself arou-ou-ound
And lay it all dow-ow-own
And darlin', you can stop
Turn yourself arou-ound
And lay it all dow-ow-own...
