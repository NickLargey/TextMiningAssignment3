Ya make a guy feel humble
I make a fool of myself again
Ya make me trip and stumble
Just go dance by yourself again
I'll just watch
Cause that's all I want to do
But remember
That I'm here with your drink
At my table for two

And you're kinda kute baby, kinda kute baby
See you dance in your satin suit baby
When you move gotta sit right down
No competition with
This kinda kutie around

I see ya pass by my window
Have to run down the stairs again
I fix my hair around a corner
Catch you unawares again
And you laugh
And you move that way again
Just like last night, oh yea that's right
I'm the guy with the big feet
But plenty of nerve
