I am the constant chill
I am the versatile one
I am the constant chill
I am the versatile one
I am the god you loved
I am the addiction
I am the god you loved
I am the addiction
I am inside
I am constant chill

That moves up and down your spine
I am the versatile one
That moves in and out your mind
I am the dark abyss
That haunts before your prayers
And I am the nemesis
That haunts in your nightmares

You can feel when I am inside
And you know that
I control you
I enslave you
I destroy you and leave you comatose

I am the god you love
That moves in and out your veins
I am the addiction
That buries you in shame

You can feel when I am inside
And you know that
I control you
I enslave you
I destroy you and leave you comatose
I've wrapped these chains so tight
You can't break through

The smell of fear is so enticing
It's so inviting
There is nothing more that I love
Than to tear you apart

I am inside and you know that
I control you
I enslave you
I destroy you and leave you comatose
I've wrapped these chains so tight
You can't break through

I am the constant chill
I am the versatile one
I am the god you loved
I am the addiction
I leave you comatose
