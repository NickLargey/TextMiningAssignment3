The sky glows
I see it shining when my eyes close
I hear your warnings but we both know
I'm gonna look at it again

Don't wait, don't wait
The road is now a sudden sea
And suddenly, you're deep enough
To let your armor down
To let your armor down
To let your armor down

You get one look
I'll show you something that the night took
A bit to early for my own good
Now let's not speak of it again

Don't wait, don't wait
The road is now a sudden sea
And suddenly, you're deep enough
To let your armor down
To let your armor down
To let your armor down

Don't wait, don't wait
The lights will flash and fade away
The days will pass you by
Don't wait
To let your armor down
To let your armor down
To let your armor down
To let your armor down
To let your armor down
