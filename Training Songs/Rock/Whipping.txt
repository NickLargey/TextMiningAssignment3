Don't need a helmet got a hard hard head
Don't need a raincoat I'm already wet 
Don't need a bandage there's too much blood  
After a while seems to roll right off hmm  

Whipping ah they're whipping ah  
They're whipping ah they're whipping  

Don't need a hand there's always arms attached 
Oh don't get behind I can't fall back 
Why must we trust all these rusted rails? 
They don't want no change, we already have 

They're whipping, ah they're whipping, ah  
They're whipping, ah they're whipping  

Don't mean to push, but I'm being shoved! 
Oh, I'm just like you, think we've had enough 
I can't believe a thing they want us to oh  
Oh, we all got scars, they should have 'em too  

Oh, they're whipping, ah they're whipping, ah  
They're whipping, ah they're whipping  
They're whipping, ah they're whipping, ah  
They're whipping yeah they're whipping
