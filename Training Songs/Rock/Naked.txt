It's been seven days of constant rain
I miss you, oh I miss you
Feeling swept away, there's no barricade without you
What can I do

And everything protecting me has all been stripped away

'Cause I'm naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when I'm filled with doubt
And I feel naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
When I feel naked

I could try to change but nothing fits the way that you do
Oh yeah you do
From every stranger's eyes you're my best disguise
I need you, I still need you

And everything that covers me has all been stripped away

'Cause I'm naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when I'm filled with doubt
And I feel naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
When I feel naked

The moments we share are all that I wear
It's cold without you
Now I have to try to get through another night

Naked, I feel naked
'Cause I'm naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when I'm filled with doubt
And I feel naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
