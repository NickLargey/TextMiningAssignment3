Well now they started skinny minnie and it turned to ginny ginny
With the dizzy Miss Lizzy Blues
She smiled while we were strollin' and I knew that I was rollin'
Had to tell my big buddy the news

It's not the magic
It's not the music
It's not the moonlight
I don't know when I felt like this before
About ten years time ago
When the band was singin' shakin' all over
When the band was singin' shakin' all over
Well now they gave us Juicy Lucy and we did the watusi
In a rockin' pair of blue suede shoes,
What she don't know won't hurt her even though I might desert her
Got to tell my best buddy the news

It's not the magic
It's not the music
It's not the moonlight
I don't know
I think I've only felt like this one time before,
About ten long years ago
When the band was singin' shakin' all over
When the band was singin' shakin' all over

It's not the magic
It's not the music
It's not the moonlight
I don't know
I think I've only felt like this one time before,
So long ago that I can hardly remember
When the band was singin' shakin' all over
When the band was singin' shakin' all over
When the band was singin' shakin' all over
When the band was singin' shakin' all over
When the band was singin' shakin' all over
When the band was singin' shakin' all over
When the band was singin' shakin' all over
