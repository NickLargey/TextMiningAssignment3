Took the last train to St. Tropez
Had in mind to dance the night away
Experimented with a cognac high
When in france you give everything a try

Soon the crowd dwindled down to two
Not a soul around but me and you
You just smiled in french and took my hand
Spoke the words i tried my best to understand
You're tellin' me-

Viens chez moi
Ce soir va jamais terminer
On va rester toujours ensemble-you're
Tellin' me

Come with me
Tonight will last forever
We wiii stay together always
In love

Woke the next day and found her note
Love ya, goodbye that's all she wrote
And every night down at the place we met
I wait for her and those sweet words i
Can't forget
You're tellin' me-

Viens chez moi
Ce soir va jamais terminer
On va rester toujours ensemble-'cause
I want you to

Come with me
Tonight will last forever
We will stay together always
