Yeah!
I looked at myself in the mirror
Oh, I say "Not bad"
Feelin' really weird
It's so hard when you're sad
I been asking myself
For some time if I like
I been dealing heavy
Heavy, so down I could cry

First in my life I feel fear, I feel fear for me
I never, I never faced you, much less me
Well I can't believe that I'm fakin' inside
So many many misunderstandings I could die
I could die (I could die)

Look at me, look at me
I'm as helpless as I can be
Look at you, look at you
I bet you don't know what I was goin' through
Look at them, look at them
Yeah, I called you my friend
Look at us, look at us
Well it comes as such a bust
Comes as such a bust

Well I got me one night
And I really wanna thank you thank you
Yeah, I guess I really don't have to know
What you want I must do
I gotta get to myself, I can't breathe underground
I can't waste my time livin' in the lost and found
Lost and found

Look at me
Look at me, look at me
I'm as helpless as I can be
Look at you, look at you
I bet you don't know what I was goin' through
Look at them, look at them
I thought you were my friend
Look at us, look at us
Well it comes as such a bust
Comes as such a bust

Oh, oh yeah
