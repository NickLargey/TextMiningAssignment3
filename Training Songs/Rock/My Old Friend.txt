I thought we were gonna make that bridge, what did I know
Me and my expectations was always high
"Like a Rolling Stone" is playing on the radio
It made you cry
But we got by 

[CHORUS:]
My old friend
You make me feel young again
My old friend
You're just as pretty as you were back then 
A Corvair with no floorboards, a Gibson Hummingbird
Driving south to the mouth of the riversong 
Patchouli oil and motor oil
And you knew all the words
Now you're looking fine
In a hook-up line 

[CHORUS BRIDGE:]

You've got kids, I've got kids
And they all want to know
Just what is what like when we were young 
I tell them I'm no different now
Just late for the show
So grab your "Aqualung"
The loading has begun 

[CHORUS:]
 
My old friend
My old friend
My old friend
