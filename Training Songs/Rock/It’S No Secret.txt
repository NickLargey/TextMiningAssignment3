It's no secret, how strong my love is for you
 It's no secret, when I tell you what I'm gonna do

 Cause I love you, yeah I love you
 It's no secret, everybody knows how I feel
 It's no secret, when I say my love is real
 Cause I love you, yeah I love you

 I love you, yes I love you
 It's no secret, when you got me jumping up and down
 It's no secret, everybody knows how I feel
 It's no secret, cause my heart is chained and bound
 INSTRUMENTAL BREAK.

 As I get older the years they get heavy for you - oh
 yeah
 Is it any wonder why I feel like my whole life is through -
 When I stop feeling how strong my love is for you - oh
 Know I'll be empty wanting your love like I do

 It's no secret, when you got me jumping up and down
 It's no secret, cause my heart is chained and bound
 I love you, yes I love you
 It's no secret, everybody knows how I feel
 It's no secret, everybody knows how I feel, yeah (FADE
