Some say you'll never be gone forever
Some say there's music where you go
I've no faith in my heart, tell two apart
Ocean above from sky below

Where I am going you can't save me

Don't wake me honey for love nor money
I have no more I can pay 'til we're here alone
And the seeds have been sown
And night returns to break the day

Where I am going you can't save me
Where I am going you can't save me, yeah

Seed a dreamin', boxed a screamin'
The world to love, the right to know
Now I hear violence out from the silence
Don't want me love? Then let me go

Where I am going you can't save me
Where I am going you can't save me
Where I am going you can't save me, yet
