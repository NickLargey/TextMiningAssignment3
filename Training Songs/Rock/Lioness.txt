S.O.S.
I'm burned out.
I try to transmit from the dead star.
Solar flare, then black out.
I hope knowing hope won't go too far.

I know that the one who strays is the one who gets
The better half.
It's hard to ignore
Now that it's said.

You've been knocked off course.
Don't fear;
Someone will come for you.

Lioness.
Well, they only feed the
Ugly parts of you.
Lioness.
Well, you scarred them all in
Ways you never knew.

Resucitate.
Open eyes.
We start to pick through the wreckage.
Seconds late;
Right on time.
But can we decipher the message?

I know that the one who strays is the one who gets
The better half.
It's hard to ignore
Now that it's said.

You've been blown off course.
Sit tight;
Someone'll salvage you.

Lioness.
Well, they only feed the
Ugly parts of you.
Lioness.
Well, you scarred them all in
Ways you never knew.
Lioness.
When the meanness finally
Takes it's toll on you.
Lioness.
Lioness.

Lioness.
Well, they only feed the
Ugly parts of you.
Lioness.
Well, you've scarred them all in
Ways you never knew.
Lioness.
Well the very things of
Helping haunting you.
Lioness.
Lioness.
