I went to the marketplace 
They said they liked my face 
Better than a digital watch 
You got it, we're pros and we can spot it 
So I thought it was some disease 
But they were all on their knees 
Shakin' hands with my picture 
First we sterilize it 
Then we merchandise it 
Everybody tries 
Everybody buys it 
 
Well that's fine 
Put me on the slug line 
Punch a pretty hole in my mind 
Show me where to sign 
And put me on the slug line 
 
They told me how to behave 
Like any other public slave 
Keep a smile on the face of the consumer 
Or you'll become a rumor 
So I got a band of angry sons 
Now we're havin' so much fun 
Tearin' up the nation 
Weapons out of mic stands 
Bitin' on the glad hand 
They still don't understand 
That they were marketing a madman 
 
And that's fine 
Put me on the slug line 
Punch a pretty hole in my mind 
Show me where to sign 
And put me on the slug- 
Well that's fine 
Put me on the slug line 
Punch a pretty hole in my mind 
Show me where to sign 
And put me on the slug line 
 
You made one mistake 
You made me wait 
 
That's fine 
Put me on the slug line 
Punch a pretty hole in my mind 
Show me where to sign 
And put me on the slug- 
Well that's fine 
Put me on the slug line 
Couldn't lay a glove on my mind 
So show me where to sign 
And put me on the slug line
