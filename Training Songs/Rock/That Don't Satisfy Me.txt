Oh yeah, I got no time for spending at home
That ain't what I need
'Cause every time I get you alone
It makes me want the finer things, yeah

But you confuse me with a schoolboy
Feeling schoolboy shame

I can't shake it, that's my soul
That's spinning me round bringing me down
Just can't take this hot and cold
Open your eyes and see

That don't satisfy me, that don't satisfy me
Well, you got me hanging from a fever tree
That don't, it don't satisfy me

You're strapping me with a ball and chain
And there's got to be a reason why
And now the clock's tick ticking away
I know you ain't that shy

Don't like running in your rat race
We never slide into the finish line

Put your X here, drink my wine
You best to come down, beat on the ground
Thumbs up, sugar, rain or shine
Might be falling down for the count, yeah

That don't satisfy me, that don't satisfy me
Well, you're burning spices in my recipe
That don't, it don't satisfy me

Oh, yeah, I can't shake it, that's my soul
That's spinning me round, bringing me down
Just can't take this hot and cold, no
You got to open your eyes and take a look around

That don't satisfy me, that don't satisfy me, no
That don't satisfy me, that don't satisfy me
Well, you got me hanging from a fever tree
You're burning spices in my recipe

That don't satisfy me, that don't, it don't satisfy me
Come on now, yeah, satisfy me, oh, satisfy me
Satisfy me, satisfy me, satisfy me, satisfy me
Oh, satisfy me, satisfy me, satisfy me, yeah, satisfy me, satisfy me
