Oh yeah, oh yeah-ah, that gun is loaded

I know that I messed up a few times or watcha wanna call it
I know if I fell down, you'd change the way that I saw it
I put it on the line for this time only
(Is that what you really want?)

I can't see that I got red hands, I'm colorblind singing (day-oh)
Don't put the blame on me, child, the damn thing gone wild (day-oh)
Never wanted to be fooling you, can't believe I was wounding you-oo
(Is that what you really want?)

Oh yeah, oh yeah-ah, that gun is loaded

That gun is loaded, but it's not in my hand
That gun is loaded, but it's not in my hand
The fire burns, I'm not the one with the match, man
That gun is loaded, but it's not in my hand

Oh yeah, oh yeah-ah, that gun is loaded

I've seen it all before, you back out, and everything's changing
I needed something more, you stepped down, so what are you chasing?
I put it on rewind for this time only
(Is that what you really want?)

I realize that I got red hands, I wanna change this (day-oh)
Don't ask me why I choose to lie, I stay blind, oh (day-oh)
It's clear to me that you are human too, your accusations are burning through-oo
(Is that what you really want?)

Oh yeah, oh yeah-ah, that gun is loaded

That gun is loaded, but it's not in my hand
That gun is loaded, but it's not in my hand
The fire burns, I'm not the one with the match, man
That gun is loaded, but it's not in my hand

Oh yeah, oh yeah-ah, that gun is loaded

Oh yeah, oh yeah-ah, that gun is loaded
