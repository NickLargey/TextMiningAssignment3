Do you remember?
the laughter and the joy
do you remember?
Do you remember?
driving in our car
do you remember?
swimming in that lake
just the five of us
against the rest of the world
Guardian angel left us bleeding
Guardian angel left us screaming
Guardian angel?
Do you remember?
fireworks by the sea
Do you remember?
the exact time we went dry on gasoline
just the five of us
against the rest of the world
Guardian angel left us bleeding
Guardian angel left us screaming
Guardian angel?
Do you remember?
