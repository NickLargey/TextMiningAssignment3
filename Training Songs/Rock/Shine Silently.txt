Just another room, just another town
Same old crazy people, hangin' around
Still you shine silently
Strarin' down in space, comin' down alone
Feel like packin' all my bags, headin' home
Still you shine silently

Shine silently
I don't need no light, in the darkness
Shine silently
No I won't get lost while your love shines on me
Shines on me

People at the door, people on the phone
Same old story no time of my own
Still you shine, silently
Nothin' left to say, nothin' left to prove
When it's said and done there's nothin' left but you, babe
Shine silently

Shine silently
I don't need no light, in the darkness
Shine silently
No I won't get lost while your love shines on me
Shines on me

Shine silently
I don't need no light, in the darkness
Shine silently
No I won't get lost while your love shines on me
Shines on me
