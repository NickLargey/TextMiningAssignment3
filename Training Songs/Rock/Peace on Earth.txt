The day is blue, there`s nothing to do
But watch the sad review of life going by...
All the broken people in a world of hurt
And all the hungry people crying in the dirt
All the living people dying to be free
From all the suffering in between
I turn my eyes away from it all
But still a wall of pain resides in me
Turn on the news, the killing continues
And there but for the grace of God go I
All the worried people hiding in their cages
And all the homeless people lying on the pavement
All the desperate people clinging to their greed
While all the lonely people close their eyes to dream...
We`re living in a world of hurt
Living in a world of hurt
All the angry people fighting in the streets
While all the children pray
For peace on earth
