Well, I'm sitting in my window
Watching all the teenes
Cruising in the street
Showing their minies
And they shake what they've got
Up and down like a ball
But I know they'll stop shaking
When the rain falls...

Rain will fall...

So please don't tell me stories
Cause I know how it ends
They always say f*ck off
When I take off my pants
I've got no smell of chanel
And my car is too small
But its dry inside
So the rain can fall...

Rain will fall...

Yes I'm sure that the rain will fall...

Rain will fall...
