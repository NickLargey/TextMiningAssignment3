We were walking
Just the other day
It was so hot outside
You could fry an egg
Remember you were talkin
I watched as sweat ran down your face
Reached up and caught it at your chin
Licked my fingertips

Wasting time
Let the hours roll by
Doing nothing for the fun
A little taste of the good life
Whether right or wrong, makes us want to stay, stay, stay, for awhile

Later on the sun began to fade
Then the clouds rolled over our heads,
And it began to rain
Oh we were dancing mouths open
Splashing tongue taste
For a moment this good time would never end

You and me
You and me
Just wasting time
I was kissing you
You were kissing me love
From good day into a moonlight
Now a night so fine
Makes us want to stay stay stay stay for awhile

Wasting time
I shall miss these things
When it all rolls by
What a day
Want to stay stay stay stay for awhile

Hey love
Oh just groping you
Rolling in the mud
Stay a while
Come on love
Want to stay stay stay stay for awhile
