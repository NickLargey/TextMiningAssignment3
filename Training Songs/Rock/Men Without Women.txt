I worked all day and all night too
I just can't see enough of you
But the things men without women do
You just don't understand

I went out last night and played the fool
It's different when it's me and you
'Cause the things men without women do
You just don't understand

I've been on the outside so long
I don't know how to treat you
Keep the tears out of your eyes
It's hard for me to admit that I'm wrong
Cause baby, I
Never learned to compromise
I never have learned to apologize

I do just what I want to do
I want everything and I want you, too
I wish I could explain to you
But the things men without women do
You just don't understand
