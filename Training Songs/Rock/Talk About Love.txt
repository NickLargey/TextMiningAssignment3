The moon falls on the railway yard
We walk together arm and arm
Faith and blind devotion
Come glide upon the rusted edge
Never question straight ahead
Right out in to the darkness of the hours that life can
Bring
I'll stand beside you hold you close
When you're in need of comfort most
Especially when you make no sense

This is what we mean
When we talk about love
This is what we mean
When we talk about love

I've found myself a Hinterland
It's perfect for a short time
I think you'll find it likeable
Please wait your hurry
Not too fast
Just hold out while the moment lasts
I know I used to wander
But I promise you that I'll stay
And if you make some strange mistake
Fall down hard and break your neck
I'll hang in here just right beside you

This is what we mean
When we talk about love
