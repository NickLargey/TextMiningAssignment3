Afraid to say that you need jumpstarting
Or anything to get you off of that cross
If you feel like your friends are parting
I can be your rock

Afraid to say that there are no more chances
They're all yours to lose, to lose
If the world doesn't leave you enchanted
I'll be there for you

Well if they really don't know
Well if they really don't care
Well if they don't know or care or care

It seems to me like you're feeling so sorry
Like a string of rosary beads
Tucked away and be forgotten, now be your beliefs

I know you're made from the darkness solely
You think you need them no matter what the cost
The hands on the clock don't seem to be moving
But you can't find time to get lost

Well if they really don't know
Well if they really don't care
Well if they don't know or care or care, care

Well if they really don't know
Well if they really don't care

Well if they really don't know
Well if they really don't care
Well if they don't know or care or care, yeah

Well if they really don't know
Well if they really don't care
Well if they don't know or care or care, care

Afraid to say that there are no more chances
They're all yours to lose, to lose
If the world doesn't leave you enchanted 
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
