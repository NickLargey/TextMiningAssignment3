love, there was so much love
enough, to last a hundred years
laughs, we had so many laughs
how come, they turned into tears

since you've been gone
life just sort of carries on
but it's not that much fun

the rain is falling
and i've tried calling
but i just can't get through
to say i'm missing, missing you
wow, i guess it's over now
you won't be coming home
but i don't blame ya
divorce, is like the final straw
do we need another Kramer versus Kramer

you and your friend
can have the kid at weekends
it's only fair that we share him

the kids are crying
the dog is dying
and i just got the flu
oh how we're missing
missing you

the food is burning
but we are learning
to get by without you
although we're missing
missing you

the dog is howling
the kids are growling
what are we to do
we're on our ownsome
alone and blue

the rent needs paying
and we're are praying
that you will come back soon
because we're missing
missing you

the snow is falling
it's christmas morning
it might as well be June
because we're missing
missing you

the rain is falling
but i've tried calling
but i just can't get through
to say i'm missing
missing you
