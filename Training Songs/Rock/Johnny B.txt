The Hooters - Johnny be	
It's a sleepless
night she's callin' your name
It's a lonely ride I know how you want her
Again and again you're chasin' a dream yeah
But Johnny my friend she's not what she seems

CHORUS
Johnny be	 how much there is to see
Just open your eyes and listen to me
Straight ahead a green light turns to red
Oh why can't you see oh Johnny be	

And when you drive her home is she sittin' real close
Does she make you weak well that's the way that she wants you
You're strung out again she's taken you over
You've been here before why can't you let go

REPEAT CHORUS
And when she calls your name my sweet Johnny be	
You can drive all night and you know she'll be waiting
To love you again her kiss is her poison
Forever inside you wherever you go

REPEAT CHORUS
Oh why can't you see
