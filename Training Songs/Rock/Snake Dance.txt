Hey-ya Hey-ya Hey-ya 
There'll come a time 
When your bones get weak
Your lungs get wheezy 

And your knees start to creak
Your hands won't do what you tell them to
And your heart gives in to the beat of
Why-not-slow-down-and-die

But the breath of death may never come
If you tune in to the serpent hum
Visualize the cool blue light
Live again on the other side

Break the doors of perception down
No drugs required Eternal Now
The danger point brings out your best
Refuse to rest

And you will never die
Hey-ya Hey-ya Hey-ya Hey-ya
Snake Dance of the Old People 
There's a secret There's a trick

Preserve your body and never get sick
Love from lust and joy from pain
Raise your sex up to the top of your brain
The highest point inside your dreams

Where the silence begins to scream
Live again on the other side
You're immortal
You will never die

And 1 and 2 and ebb and flow
And 3 and 4 and wax and wane
And 5 and 6 and be reborn
