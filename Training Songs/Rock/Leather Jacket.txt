You and your lady are the king and the queen
Rock and roll circus, it's the best I've ever seen
All your leather jackets and your faded jeans
All you have left of your rock and roll dreams

Whoa, put your leather jacket on
Now it's time to be movin' on

You know your lady's like a movie star queen
She's late for her mornings, never wakes from her dreams
I gave her love and I gave her my money
I said, "No thanks, I can't get hooked on ya honey"

Put your leather jacket on
Now it's time to be movin' on

You think you're funky and you think your so tough
Sometimes you're disgusted 'cause you just can't get enough
Think your gonna go back to sunny California
Ride the waves on the cool blue water

Put your leather jacket on
Whoa, yeah, put your leather jacket on

All your leather jackets and your faded jeans
All you have left of your rock and roll dreams

Whoa, yeah, put your leather jacket on

And you move through your world as if it was a dance
You never keep your fortune that you made in the south of France
All your leather jackets and your faded jeans
All you have left of your rock and roll dreams

Put your leather jacket on
Now it's time to be movin' on
Whoa, yeah, put your leather jacket on
Now it's time to be movin' on
Whoa, yeah, put your leather jacket on

All your leather jackets and your faded jeans
All you have left of your rock and roll dreams
