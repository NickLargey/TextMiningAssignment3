This is the end, my friend
The end, my friend, the end
I hope to see you again, my friend
Again, my friend, again

And I didn't want to hold you back
And I didn't want to see you off now
Down the wrong track

Elusive personality
I think you know as much as me
No secrets that you're hiding

Count 4 and we'll begin again
We'll begin again
This time, release, my friend
Release, my friend, the end

And I didn't want to hold you back
And I didn't want to see you off now
Down the wrong track

This time, it makes so sense at all
I'm standing still while others fall
Keeps shrinking every second

Hello
The end, the end
The end
