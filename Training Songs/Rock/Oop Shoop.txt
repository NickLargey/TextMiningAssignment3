Bow bow bow, um do that again, bow bow bow

Have you ever heard of a wish sandwich?
A wish sandwich is the kind of a sandwich
Where you have two slices of bread and you
Hee hee hee, wish you had some meat

Bow bow bow, um
The other day I had a ricochet biscuit
A ricochet biscuit is the kind of a biscuit
That's supposed to bounce back off the wall
Into your mouth, if it don't bounce back, you go hungry

Bow bow bow, um um um
The other day I had a cool water sandwich
And a Sunday-go-to-meetin' bun

Bow bow bow, hee hee hee hee
What da ya want for nothing?
A rubber biscuit? Bow bow bow
