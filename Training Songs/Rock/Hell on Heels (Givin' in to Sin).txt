Sets her eyes on me 
Like I'm blasphemy
I'm on the edge of divine
Gets down on her knees
Outlawed and obscene
Wanna make her mine

Can't resist her spell
My soul I would sell
For just one night
In her presence I dwell
Like a love prison cell
It just feels so right

'Cause she's hell on heels
(She's hell on heels)
Got looks that kill
(Got looks that kill)

'Cause she's hell on heels
(She's hell on heels)
Looking for thrills
(I'm looking for a thrill)
And I'm giving in

She set her eyes on me
They're filled with greed
Got me hypnotized
She dances on me
She makes me believe
That she could be mine (she could be mine)

I should have known from the start
She was after my heart
Now I'll never be free
And I'm falling for her and
I'm going in deep
She's got the best of me

'Cause she's hell on heels
(She's hell on heels)
Got looks that kill
(Got looks that kill)

'Cause she's hell on heels
(She's hell on heels)
Looking for thrills
(I'm looking for a thrill)
And I'm giving in

She was hated, so jaded
Devils reject now she's x-rated
She was hated, so jaded
Devils reject now she's x-rated

'Cause she's hell on heels
(She's hell on heels)
Got looks that kill
(Got looks that kill)

'Cause she's hell on heels
(She's hell on heels)
Looking for thrills
(I'm looking for a thrill)
And I'm giving in

'Cause she's hell on heels
'Cause she's hell on heels
