There's  a  face  in  the  mirror
And  you  close  your  eyes
Much  easier  to  turn  away
Than  to  take  a  look  inside
So  you're  thinking  it's  over
Walking  away
Let  your  little  world  crash  and  burn
Oh  what  a  price  to  pay
Didn't  anybody  tell  you
It's  not  who's  right  or  wrong
Hold  the  line
Is  this  what's  going  on
Where  you  goin'  now
WHen  your  world's  tutrned  inside  out
Isn't  the  love  what  it's  all  about
Where  you  goin'  now
When  you  get  to  the  top  of  the  hill
Gonna  be  there  yes  I  will
There's  a  crack  in  the  mirror
There's  a  hole  in  the  sun
Full  moon  in  the  midnight  sky
And  youo  feel  like  you  want  to  run
So  you  blow  out  the  candle
And  you  turn  out  the  light
Then  you  stumble  into  darkness
Do  yo  believe  that  love  is  blind
Didn't  anybody  tell  you
It's  never  too  late  to  try
Hold  the  line
Before  you  say  goodbye
Where  you  going'  now
When  your  world's  turned  inside  out
Isn't  love  what  it's  all  about
Where  yo  goin'  now
When  you  get  to  the  top  of  the  hill
Gonna  be  there  yes  I  will
Gonna  be  there  yes  I  will
Gonna  be  there  yes  I  will
