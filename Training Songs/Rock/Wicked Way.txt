Well I just want to take you out and get you drunk
So I can have my wicked way with you
I'm just being honest 'cause I know
The other guys are thinking just the same way too
And I'm not gonna lie and say that I will take you out to dance
There's just no chance
'Cause I don't even like the same music you do
I just wanna have my wicked way with you

Girl, don't you fight it
'Cause I know you're gonna like it
Show me some skin I might bite it
Ooh, I wanna have my wicked way with you

So I'm not gonna come over and meet your mom and dad
They know that I was bad
I don't want to meet your friends or just pretend I like you
And I don't want to talk about what happened on your favourite TV show
I just want to get you close enough so I can take off all your clothes
And I'm not gonna make you cry or break your heart
Girl we don't have the time
I'm just thinking of three hours or more
So I can have my wicked way with you

No, don't you fight it
Don't knock it 'til you've tried it
Show me some skin I might bite it
Ooh I wanna have my wicked way with you
My wicked way with you
My wicked way with you.
