I don't believe in competition
Ain't nobody else like me around
I don't need your imposition
It ain't that hard to figure it out

Give it up now
Play cool
Give it up now
Play cool

All the rules
That you use and abusin'
No one knew
She could take this confusion

Give it up now
Don't let me down

Don't think too much of my disposition
You already know what's going down
Don't wanna be your exhibition, no
I don't want nobody hanging around

Give it up now
Play cool
Give it up now
Play cool

All the rules
That you use and abusin'
No one knew
She could take this confusion

Give it up now
Don't let me down

Give it up now
Play cool
Give it up now
Play cool

All the rules
That you use and abusin'
No one knew
She could take this confusion

Give it up now
Don't let me down

Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool

Give it up
Give it up
Give it up now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
