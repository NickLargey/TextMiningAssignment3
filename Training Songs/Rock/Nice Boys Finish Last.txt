My mother used to tell me
That nice boys don't play rock 'n roll
And I guess she was right
'Cause I'm a crazy f*ck who's on the Rolley
We're gonna play it rough
We're gonna play it hard
The Rock 'n Roll Rebels
Got the winning card

Nice boys finish last

They call us society's rejects
Who don't have a chance in life
Call us the wild ones
Whatever you want
To be a winner is our only strife
We don't play by the book
And we don't play by the rules
By cheating in the game called life
We conquer all the fools

Nice boys finish last

We're always the first
To cross the line
We always leave the good guys
Twenty miles behind
We're gonna play it rough
We're gonna play it hard
The Rock 'n Roll Rebels
Got the winning card

Nice boys finish last
