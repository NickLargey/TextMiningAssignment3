Nothing's going to shake me
Nothing's going to bring me down
Nothing's going to shake me
Nothings going to make me change
That's the way I am and I'll always be the same
Yea oh
Nothings going to shake me
Nothings going to make me change
That's the way I am and I'll always be the same
And it's 1 2 3 4 everybody out the door
Let's go everyone everbody's got a gun
1 2 3 today is so easy
It's just a little bit of that simple simplicity ow
Everything is shimmering
(1 2 3 4 everybody out the door)
Let's go ? fast
(let's go everyone everybody's got a gun)
And everything that happened to me
(1 2 3 today is so easy)
Happened to me for the best
(it's just a little bit of that simple simplicity)
Ow
I got an action packed extravaganta
I got a sweet haiku
I got the cash to cover the action
I got the soul food
There's a flag I wanna fly
A mountain that I put in time
I was always on my way
Nothing's going to shake me
Nothing's going to make me change
That's the way I am and I'll always be the same
