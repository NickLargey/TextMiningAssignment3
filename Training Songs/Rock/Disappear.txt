I was asking for a drink last night
Never noticing that things just weren't quite right
For the bartender said you look queer
So disappear
Before I realized what I'd be through
A girl came up to me and said "I love you"
But I whispered gently in her ear
To disappear
What is wrong with everyone in this town
That's what I am asking me
And to my reply it's bound to be
Something I'll never forget
That alone it would happen again
But if it did, I'd know right there and then
I would pack everything I have here
And disappear
