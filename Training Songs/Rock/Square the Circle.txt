You lean your back against the wall
Push your hands in your pocket
You look down

Pacing the floor
You look out the window
Beyond the view

Shake your body
As if against the cold
Your mind wanders

Tell me what you're trying to say
Tell me what you're trying to say
I won't stop
Loving you

We sit down together
You start to draw a ring
Square the circle
Then draw some lines

Push the paper
But keep the pen you hold
You need your hands occupied

Tell me what you're trying to say
Tell me what you're trying to say
I won't stop
I won't stop
Loving you

Let your fingers intertwine
Put your hands behind your head
Lean back
And close your eyes
And tell me

Tell me
What you've got on your mind
Tell me
Tell me
