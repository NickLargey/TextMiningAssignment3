Something slowly, Tremble in vain
The window is open, it's pouring rain
Thunder and lightning, a Heated night
Sneaky intentions with certain delight

(Lessons)
Lessons to learn, fire tonight
(Reason)
Reason uncertain, we're leaving tonight
(Promise)
Promise refusal, the fashion degree
(Follow)
Follow desire, Wicked pain

Lay me down!
I'm listening
I've already seen a true romance, and it don't look like that

Tell me now, 
I'm begging
I've already seen a true romance, and it don't look like that

(Hold it)
Does it distract you, pillar of flesh
(Feel the)
Silver almond, colour in death
(For years)
Foolish desire, needless pain
(Fire)
Fire with fire, Lightless day

Lay me down!
I'm listening
I've already seen a true romance, and it don't look like that

Tell me now, 
I'm begging
I've already seen a true romance, and it don't look like that

[Repeat: x2]
Give me the light of opinion
Just give me a goal
Swallow your pride and stop thinking
And give me a goal

Lay me down!
I'm listening
I've already seen a true romance, and it don't look like that

Tell me now, 
I'm begging
I've already seen a true romance, and it don't look like that

I've already seen a true romance and it don't look like that
I've already seen a true romance and it don't look like that
