Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I can lead by example, but you find it of crime.
Is it best for you I don't get no weirder?
I can leave my possessions
Take you home on the rise,

From a love all best gone get?

Thinkin' bout you every day
Nothing can replace the love in your eyes.
Stickin' around the cemetery, it never really gets to me,
I don't go out, I don't go out

What comfort was there
While we're waiting for the Reaper to come
Come on!
Truth, torture or dare
And we're waiting for glimpse of the sun

Some of the places I know, some of the places I've seen, well.
They would never try face the devil in me.
Some anekatips of the places I know
Most others I haven't been to.
Listen while you get what you get

I can dance to perfection, I'm the father of time.
Is it obvious I ain't go no rhythm
But I lead with intention
And I swagger with style.
This is best for you
You're gonna get what you get.

Thinkin' bout you every day
Nothing can replace the love in your eyes.
Stickin' around the cemetery, it never really gets to me,
Stickin' around the cemetery, it never really gets to me.

What comfort was there
As we're waiting for a glimpse of the sun
The sun, so

Some of the places I know
Some of the places I've seen, well.
They would never try face the devil in me.
Some of the places I know
Most others I haven't been to.
Listen while you get what you get.

In the sun, in the sun
Where the damage is done
I'm looking forward to the moon tonight

(sun)
Some of the places I know
Some of the places I've seen, well.
They would never try face the devil in me.
Some of the places I know
Most others I haven't been to.
Listen while you get what you get.

(In the sun, in the sun)
Best for you
You're gonna get what you get
(In the sun, in the sun)
