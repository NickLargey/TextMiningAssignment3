Would it kill you to breathe
Easy only 17 miles lay between you and me
I could make it if I had to
I don't break easily
You've got my counsel, thick as thieves
If there's a crime we'll keep it secret
For there's only trace amounts left in your blood
You may be a sinner
But you may be justified

Just keep your mouth shut
Keep your guard up
I swear I'll make it right

Will it kill me to breathe
Not as easy as you think it is between you and me
I could fake it if I have to
I don't break easily
I need your counsel, thick as thieves
I have no crime to keep a secret
It was hers, it was not mine
Well I may be a sinner
But it wasn't me this time

Just keep your mouth shut
Keep your guard up
I swear I'll make it right

Listen to yourself
There is a hemorrhage in your mouth
It won't stop bleeding
Well you may be the traitor
I will hold the smoking gun
You'll get away clean
I'll keep your secrets til the grave has swallowed me
And I will never tell a tortured soul they are burning by my side
That I am a sinner
I am a savior
I am a lie

So keep your mouth shut
Keep your guard up
I swear I'll make it right
