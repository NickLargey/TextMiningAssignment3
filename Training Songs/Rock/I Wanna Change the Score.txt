I want to be in another place
Some other body and someone else's face
Don't want to be in here
I need a space I can disappear
I want to play me a different part
Another feeling in someone else's heart
Don't want to cry out loud
Don't want to show you I'm too damn proud.

You can change the words you say
Stop the things you do
Throw away your yesterdays
You'll still be stuck with you
But don't be sad
Get a hold upon yourself before you get too far
No matter what you have to learn to live with who you are.

I want to live in a different time
Another reason in someone else's mind
I want to change the score
I don't want to be me no more
I want to play in a different game
Another player in someone else's name
Don't want to be the fool
Don't want to show you I can lose my cool

You can stop the world you're on
Change the song you sing
Choose defection, wrong direction
That won't change a thing
But that's so good
No time to wish your life away, follow your star
Be glad of what you have my friend, be glad of who you are.

I want to be like a different man
I want to set me free if I can.

I want to be in another place
Some other body and someone else's face
Don't want to be in here
I need a space I can disappear
I want to play me a different part (different part)
Another feeling in someone else's heart
Don't want to cry out loud
Don't want to show you I'm too damn proud.

I want to live in a different time (different time)
Another reason in someone else's mind
I want to change the score
I don't want to be me no more
I want to play in a different game
Another player in someone else's name
Don't want to be the fool
Don't want to show you I can lose my cool
