I miss you already and you're not even gone
The time has come you're telling me goodbye and I know I can keep it if I try
I've had too many chances now I'll have to set you free

I watch you go too late I know how much you mean to me
I miss you already I don't know how I'll go on
I miss you already and you're not even gone

So kiss me once again and please don't cry I'll promise there'll be no more alibis
I'll have to find myself a way to face this loneliness
I was untrue mistreated you I've lost my happiness
I miss you already...
