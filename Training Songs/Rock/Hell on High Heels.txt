Bashful Betty, such a bondage brat
Dressed in latex and coated in sewer rat
A serpent's tongue calculating mind
Gets top billing for her hip shake divine

Look to the sky
No rain in sight
Better wear your rubber boys
If Betty is your date tonight

Honey, it's how ya makin' money
Boys call ya
Hell on high heels
Baby, the way ya walk it talk it
Town calls ya
Hell on high heels

Sexy Suki, little geisha girl
Given every samurai a twirl
An HIV v.i.p.
Backseat panties down around her knees

She's got no money
Can't pay the rent
It's a sunny day now baby
Every night on her back that's spent
Honey, it's how ya makin' money
Boys call ya
Hell on high heels
Baby, the way ya walk it talk it
Town calls ya
Hell on high heels

Honey, it's how ya makin' money
Boys call ya
Hell on high heels
Baby, the way ya walk it talk it
Town calls ya
Hell on high heels

Honey, it's how ya makin' money
Boys call ya
Hell on high heels
Baby, the way ya walk it talk it
Town calls ya
Hell on high heels

Honey, it's how ya makin money
Boys call ya
Hell on high heels
Baby, the way ya walk it talk it
Town calls ya
Hell on high heels
