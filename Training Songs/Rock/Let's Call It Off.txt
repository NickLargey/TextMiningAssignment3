When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before
It just didn't sparkle it just didn't glow
Some things are not better inside of the store

Did you agree we should let it bee
And did you agree
It's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
Will you still have enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
Will you still have enough of us

I know many people who act the same way
Relations that lasted for more than one day
But I don't wanna know why we couldn't do more
Some thing are not better to leave unexplored

Did you agree we should let it bee
And did you agree
It's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
Will you still have enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
Will you still have enough of us
