Woke early this morning at the crack of dawn 
Wiped the clouds from my eyes 
Couldn't sleep a wink  cause the things you said 
Were hangin' heavy on my mind 
You turn and walk away  when I've got talkin' to do 
You think you know it all  well I got news for you 

You can be the branch  I'll be the tree 
You give me your advice  then tell me it ain't free 
You believe in you now baby I'll believe in me 

Never had a doubt 'till you come my way 
Now I'm feelin' borrowed and blue 
Wouldn't know your ass from a hole in the ground 
You could learn a thing or two 
You tell me that you're right, when I know that I am 
You bend the rules, just to break them time and again 

You can be the candle, I'll always be the flame 
Don't tell me that I can't, didn't ask you if I can 
You believe in you now baby I'll believe in me 

You turn and walk away when I got talkin' to do 
You think you know it all, well I got news for you
