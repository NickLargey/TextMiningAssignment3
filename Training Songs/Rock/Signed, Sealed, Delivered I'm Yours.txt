Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours
Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry

[Chorus:]
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours
I'll be yours
Here I am baby
(Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours) Oh here I am baby,
(Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours) Baby

Done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, yeah
Oo-wee babe you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my one desire

[Chorus]

Done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
I could be a broken man but here I am
(Here I am)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours),baby
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
[Repeat]
