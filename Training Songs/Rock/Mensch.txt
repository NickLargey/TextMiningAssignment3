Every second has a reason
As the time slides away
Changing with the season
I'm just following the race
No need to be final
I'll put my thoughts on hold
Daydreams at the water
As the tide ebbs and flows

And it's
And it's all OK
I'll take it day by day
This is summertime
Nothing across my mind
And man's called man
'Cause we forgive and understand
We forget and we deny
We loose and still we try
'Cause we love
'Cause we live
I miss you

Skies blue wide and open
Not a shade or trace of grey
And telephone gas electric
Unpaid what can I say
Let us share the silence
What on earth can occur
I am not looking for commitment
Just give me your word

And it's all OK
Take it day by day
This is summertime
Nothing on my mind
And man's called man
'Cause we forgive and understand
We forget and we deny
We loose and still we try
'Cause we love
'Cause we live
I miss you
'Cause we love
We live
Miss you

Oh it's all OK
I take it day by day
This is summertime
Nothing across my mind
And man's called man
'Cause we forgive and understand
We dance into the storm
And keep hurt from our homes
'Cause we are
'Cause we life
I miss you

Oh it's all OK
The pain's fading away
This is summertime
Nothing on my mind
And man's called man
We forgive and understand
We forget and we deny
We loose and still we try
'Cause we are
'Cause we live
I miss you
