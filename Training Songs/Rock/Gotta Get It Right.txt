I remember the first time
It was one of the worst times
You lied right to my face

Oh the way that you stood there
You gave me a dead stare
The kind you cant erase

When the angels break their wings
They crash and stumble
Just like we struggle
If we could have this one night over
We gotta get it right
We gotta get it right this time

Cause we were young and indestructible
(Gotta get it right this time)
With any luck we'll be unstoppable
(Gotta get it right this time)
And we could last forever

I remember the last time
More than all of the past times
And how you crawled away

You fought with a passion
Such over reaction
But you never fought to stay

When the angels break their wings
They crash and stumble
Just like we struggle

If we could have this one night over
We gotta get it right
We gotta get it right this time

Cause we were young and indestructible
(Gotta get it right this time)
With any luck we'll be unstoppable
(Gotta get it right this time)

And there's a chance for use tonight
And there's a chance to make it right

Cause we were young and indestructible
(Gotta get it right this time)
With any luck we'll be unstoppable
(Gotta get it right this time)

And we could last forever
