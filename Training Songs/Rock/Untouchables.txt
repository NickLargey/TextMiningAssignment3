You and me 
Hung around, to escape 
In the days of gold fire, 
Drugs and desire
Past the nights 
Syncopated sound
Then its time we got along
Where the skins aren't out

But it was okay
Yeah it was all right
We were, we were
The untouchables at night

You and me while we're 
Waitin' on a corner 
Share a pack and a joke
With only fools to save us
We laughed and cried, 
Split our sides
At what they told us

That it would be ok
That it would be alright
We were, we were
The untouchables at night

I've colored my life, 
With voodoo and ice colors 
All my life
But time strikes against us
It takes some of us home
Will make my soul
Turn up in you, 
What set me free

Oh friends young and new
What'll I do, when you're gone too
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh 
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah,
Ah-ha-ha-ha, haha-haha

It'll be alright
It'll be ok
If I believe tonight
If I believe, we're right

And then we'll be
We will clearly be
The untouchables at night

Whoa-oo ho-oo-oo
Whoa-oh-ho
Whoa-oo ho-oo-oo

The untouchables at night
Whoa-oh-ho
Whoa-oo ho-oo-oo
Whoa-oh-ho

The untouchables at night
Woo-oh-ho
Woo-oo ho-oo-oo
We'll know that color
We'll meet then

Oh-woah-oo
