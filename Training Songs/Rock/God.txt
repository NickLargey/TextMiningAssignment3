The time is over
The day is gone now
I spent the day with her
To spend an hour with god
My dream is over
And now I'm sleeping

I heard there was no god
But I just spent the day with him

Oh, with him
Oh
Oh oh

They're not spinless
And grass is greener
I walked the moon with her
To spend an hour with god

I heard there was no god
But I just spent the day with him

Oh, with him
Oh oh

(Oh oh oh)
