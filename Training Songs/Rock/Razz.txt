Just like the girlies back at corner store
Wash my bugle boy a watching my throne
Sweet mutilation of a sold to nothing man
Lord have mercy shake is falling through your hand
Razz the kid
Because she love me I'm the chosen one
These are the days to not be having fun
I listen back to what you told me before,
Just tell me where to come, I'll knock down the door
Razz the kid
Razz the kid
Razz the kid
Razz the kid
Razz the kid
