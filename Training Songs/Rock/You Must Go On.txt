You can't look back 
But you can look on ahead 
There's no sense of ease, no-one to please 
But you carry on 
You can't look so sad 
You can't look down your nose 
There's nothing to believe, no use in being 
But you carry on 

So cherish the days when we searched for caves 
And paddled our feet in the midday heat 
Your mother would scream if she heard you'd been 
Well it's just as well we carried on and on and.......... 

This can't look so bad 
Just 'cos you're on your own again 
You're losing sleep, you don't know how to breathe 
But you carry on 
You can't look back 
You can look on ahead 
There's nothing to believe, all you do is weep 
But you carry on 

So cherish the days when we searched for caves 
And paddled our feet out on the heath 
My mother would scream if she heard you'd been 
Well it's just as well we carried on and on and
