When you walked into the room
I saw their faces
You made it seem like time was standing still
And I felt fascination
Though I knew you just casually

So I slowly made my way to where you were standing
The hounds were gathered near
I didn't care
And you sensed desperation
My heart gave me away

And then you said
You're what I look for
Je pense que je t'adore
You're what I look for
Lately

When our eyes met in conversation
Oh, I tried to smile, you looked the other way
You made situations seem like love affairs

And then you said
You're what I look for
Je pense que je t'adore
You're what I look for
Lately

Now it's over
(It's over)
It's over
(It's over)
Oh, it's over
(It's over)
Oh, oh, oh

You're what I look for
You're what I look for
You're what I look for
Lately

Oh, you're what I look for
You're what I look for
You're what I look for
Lately

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
