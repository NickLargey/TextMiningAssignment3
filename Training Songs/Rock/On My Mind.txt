Baby I've got you on my mind, honey you won't ever know
How much I need you by my side, promise you won't ever go
I won't take no from you this time
Baby I've got you on my mind

'Cause honey I've got to show (I won't wait for another day)
Just what I can do (My heart died when you loosed the chains)
Because I think I know (I won't wait for another day)
What you're going through (My heart died when you loosed the chains)
I hope you feel it the way I feel it, I hope you feel it the way I feel it too

So if I had this all my way, honey you won't ever know
I'd be there through every night and day, promise you won't ever go
Baby I've got you on my mind
