I live
Infinitus sleep has ended
And I live again

Beyond race
Beyond religion
Beyond man's fears

I am the end

Now is release
Now comes revenge
Now is the pain

You think you've known pain
You've known nothing

Feel my touch
Feel its pulsing surge
Know the meaning of

My gift
Welcome it

I live
