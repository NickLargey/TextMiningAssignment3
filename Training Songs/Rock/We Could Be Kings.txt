Believe me
I'm not scared of anything
But being you could break me
Drain my heart and wrench my spirit
What do I do
That's so enchanting you can't bear to leave me
I deserve hell
So take me do your worst and do it proper
The shell must break so

We could be kings
This planet is ours
We've love on our side
The keys to my car
We'll storm through the city
Let's drive
Hold tight

Believe me
It's time to tell my friends I love them
They deserve more
Than hasty delivered words of kindness
I'm sure you know that

We could be kings
This planet is ours
With luck on our side
The keys to my car
We'll storm through the city
Let's drive
Did I hear you cry

Will you hold me like a child
Will you catch me when I fall
Can you hear me when I call
Can you love me?

When I'm hungry and I'm cold
Will you feed me from your palm
And shelter me from harm
Can you love me?

When I'm ailing and I'm tired
And my years are running out
Can you take away all doubt
Can you love me?

Will you understand my cries
Protect me when I lie?
I need all your time
For I am lonely
