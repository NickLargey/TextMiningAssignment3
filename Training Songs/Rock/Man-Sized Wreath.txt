Turning on the TV and what do I see?
A pageantry of empty gestures all lined up for me, wow!
I'd have thought by now we would be ready to proceed
But a tearful hymn to tug the heart
And a man-sized wreath, ow!

[Chorus]
Throw it on the fire
Throw it in the air
Kick it out on the dance-floor like you just don't care, oh

Give me the sound

Wave the palms, steal the alms, fists in the air
A motorcade up benign shows the people that you care, ow!
Nature abhors a vacuum but what's between your ears?
Your judgment clouded with fearful thoughts
A headlights and a deer, ow!

[Chorus]

Look at what I've found

Everybody look around
Everybody looking like they just don't care, oh
Give me the sound

Well I'm not deceived by pomp and odious conceit
But a tearful hymn to tug the heart
And a man-sized wreath-ow!

[Chorus]

Look at what I've found
Everybody look around
Everybody looking like they just don't care

[Chorus]

Give me the sound
Give me the sound
Give me the sound
