Aha shake taper jean girl with a motel face
Aha shake bury your eyes in a secret place
Aha shake black as night on a Sunday

Cunts watch their bodies
No room for make up
I think he's tasted
Tasted the watcher

Heartbreak knocking them down like the seventh grade
Heartbreak cigarettes and songs with a winters chafe
Heartbreak keep like my daughter and run away

Cunts watch their bodies
No room for make up
I think he's tasted
Tasted the watcher

Aha shake taper jean girl kiss me

Cunts watch their bodies
No room for make up
I think he's tasted
Tasted the watcher
