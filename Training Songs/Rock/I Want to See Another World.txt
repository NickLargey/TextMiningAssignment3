I want to see another world 
For me and my child 
My old lady, too 
Maybe you 
If we can 
If we get to 
I want to see another world 
I want to see another world. 

I think you might see a great ship up in the sky 
Like an eagle, like a stallion 
Might be a burning silver wheel 
Let you know you can fly 
Look up in the sky 
Look up through the darkness 
I think it might be love. 

I want to see another world 
For me and my child 
My old lady, too 
Maybe you 
If we can 
If we get to 
I want to see another world 
I want to see another world 
I want to see another world 

When all the sky is darkness 
When all the ground you know is gone 
How the solar wind she blows 
Snowy silver dragon sings the songs 
Flying straight up to the sky 
Great singing engines sigh and 
Drive this metal fragment into time. 

Let's try to get along with each other 
Sister and brother 
Father and mother 
Everyone's a lover. 

I want to see another world

Let's try to get along with each other 
Sister and brother 
Father and mother 
Everyone's a lover. 

Get along with each other 
Sister and brother
