All my life I've been digging Polish black coal
It wasn't much but you know I could play that role
They laid me off and so I kept my pail
And now I wade in bushes down by the rail

Raider man, got no choice about it
Raider man, jumpin' up there on it
Raider man, gonna' take a little bit now

They hired me back and traded my pail for a stick
Now I chase the ones with a pail and a brick

Raider man, got no choice about it
Raider man, jumpin' up there on it
Raider man, gonna' take a little bit now

Raider man, got no choice about it
Raider man, jumpin' up there on it
Raider man, gonna' take a little bit now

I chased my cousin, it wasn't no big deal
I lost my legs when I slipped beneath the coal train wheel
My cousin tries to put something in my bowl
And now I wish, I never left that darkened hole

Raider man, got no choice about it
Raider man, jumpin' up there on it
Raider man, gonna' take a little bit now
