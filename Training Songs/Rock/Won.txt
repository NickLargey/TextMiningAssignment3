Vibes 
All I a bingee oots - (?) 
Wssh 
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do 
Two can be as bad as one 
It's the loneliest number since the number one 
Cinematic synergy 
A whole lotta energy 
Virtual reality 
Doomsday scenery 
Grab artillery - (?) 
Cinematic synergy 
A whole lotta energy 
Virtual reality 
Doomsday scenery 
Grab artillery 
Burn the flag steadily 
Depression 
Driving a brand new Chevy 
Water erase a liquid sunflower 
Verbal abuser underneath the stone shower 
Power in the hour 
Moon in the flower 
For alone one is a glorious number 
In the darkest days 
Touch our brightest ways 
Raincloud penetrating gray sun rays 
Electric rain 
Virtual mud 
East the river Nile 
Babylonian flood 
Won't stay in the shadow 
I'm asking for food on plate 
Unborn face still behind heaven's gate 
For universe sake drink soda grape 
High indigo skies wrapped in homicide scene 
Blondie said the tide is high 
Bobby-dee don't cry just dry your eye 
With the bamboo sticks and the Georgia sky 
Black goo bubbling on blueberry pie 
The praying mantis grasshopper flew 
Everything old is everything new 
Nightmares first degree murder deja vu 
This is what you know 
What you don't know is the clue 
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do 
Two can be as bad as one 
It's the loneliest number since the number one 
New york rats running all around mars 
How many nightmares imprisoned in scars 
Doctor Zhivago's cream creates wars 
Insecurity melts skulls in stores 
Inhale your thoughts and exhale your wishes 
Before I trace the vocals I gotta do the dishes 
 
Want to see music through the eyes of Stevie
