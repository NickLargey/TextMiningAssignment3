Be gone, Prince of Darkness
Be gone, Prince of Darkness
You have no power
You have no power
Be gone
Be gone

I woke from a dream to a rumble of thunder
Not heard but perceived from within
A feeling inside that just can't be denied
Says the countdown is soon to begin

But in the darkest hour the human spirit
Sings ancient songs to me
The tyrants will gather to worship their master
But he will be brought to his knees

[Chorus]
Be gone, Prince of Darkness
You have no power here
Be gone, Prince of Darkness
You have no power here
You have no power, you have no power here
You have no power, you have no power here
Be gone

We speak with the voice of ten million souls crying
This war that you make is not ours
You sit at the left hand of those who are lying
Seducing with hypnotic powers

But now your stone cold heart has started rumbling
A song has risen free
And we shall not stop with the laughter and singing
'Til you have been swept to the sea

[Chorus]

We run with the spirit that moves through the city
The heart of the jungle is whole
The seekers of truth with the hot blood of youth
Together we're never alone

When every heart has finally found the courage
To love with all its might
The chains will be broken, the doors will burst open
And we shall know the power of the night

[Chorus]
