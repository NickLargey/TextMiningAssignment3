What makes me love you this way? 
Oh what makes our love grow each day? 
What makes the sun shine so brightly? 
It's you, you you you 

Who tells the flowers when to grow? 
Oh & who melts away the winter snow? 
Whose love for me will always soar? 
It's you, you you you 

When I'm feeling sad & blue 
& I don't know what to do 
I think about our love & you 
Who turns the nighttime into day? 
Oh it's you, you you you 
It's you, you you you
