ev'ry thumb song's a sad song they say..
that's because i'm a sad guy, ok?!
i can't write about how great i feel all day, 
when at the end of the day nothing's ok!
i'm like you out there i can't describe it, we're 
seeing this world with our own eyes and i bet
you can't decide what you're purpose in life is..
you cannot take anymore, so don't fight it..
we're lost in this world, where nothing can feel right..

are you down.with me?
-do you feel..like me?
-are you down,lostall alone like me?
are you down.with me?
-do you feel..like me?
-are you down,lostall alone like me?

ev'ry thumb song's an angry song you know?!..
that's because i'm so angry its gotta show..
in the words that i'm writing to let it go..
all my anger released, see, i told you so!

we're all crazy'cause we live in it too!!
pain, hate, fear and yealosy
feed my sadness and my agony..i'm in a spot, 
where nothing can feel right.

-do you feel..like me?
-are you down,lostall alone like me?

-do you feel..like me?
-are you down,lostall alone like me?
