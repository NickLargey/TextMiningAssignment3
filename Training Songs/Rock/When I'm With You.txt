I'm takin' my time,
I'm trying to leave the memories of you behind, 
I'm gonna be fine, 
As soon as I get your picture right out of my mind, 

I want to feel the way you make me feel when I'm with you, 
I want to be the only hand you need to hold on to, 
But every time I call you don't have time, 
I guess I'll never get to call you mine,

For nothing at all, 
I know there's a million reasons why I shouldn't call,
With nothing to say, 
I could easily make this conversation last all day,

I want to feel the way you make me feel when I'm with you, 
I want to be the only hand you need to hold on to, 
But every time I call you don't have time, 
I guess I'll never get to call you mine,

Another lesson I didn't get to learn
Your my obsession
I've got nowhere to turn

I want to feel the way you make me feel when I'm with you, 
I want to be the only hand you need to hold on to, 
I want to feel the way you make me feel when I'm with you, 
I want to be the only hand you need to hold on to, 

I want to feel the way you make me feel when I'm with you, 
I want to be the only hand you need to hold on to, 
But I guess I'll never get to call you mine
