I go home at night about half past four
All that knocking on my door

I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
Man don't you know, don't you know

I love these women, gonna treat them right
Ain't gonna fuss and ain't gonna fight

I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
Man don't you know, don't you know

I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
Man don't you know, don't you know

- guitar and harp soli -
You beg me now baby and not before
I'm gonna come round and kick your door

I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
Man don't you know, don't you know

I don't want to fuss, i don't want to fight
Ain't gonna do nothing but treat you right

I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
Man don't you know, don't you know

I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
Man don't you know, don't you know

I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
I got the mad man blues
Man don't you know, don't you know
