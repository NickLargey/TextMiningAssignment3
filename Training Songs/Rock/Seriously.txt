I've got a life in my hands
I barely know what I'm doing
She doesn't quite understand
This is not like the movies

Where everything fades to black
And it's all happy endings
But that's just pretending
'Cause the world doesn't work like that
It's always changing
But she's sick of waiting

Her patience is over
'Cause she can see the other side tonight
Her head needs my shoulder
But I don't have the heart to tell her

She takes me way too serious
I'm just someone who's out of his league
She takes me way too seriously

You'd think by now she would know
That I'm hardly deserving
My kind of love doesn't always show
'Cause it's under the surface

Where everything tends to stay
I can never be lonely if nobody knows me
But I wish that it wasn't this way
I'm thinking of changing
But she's sick of waiting

Her patience is over
'Cause she can see the other side tonight
Her head needs my shoulder
But I don't have the heart to tell her

She takes me way too serious
I'm just someone who's out of his league
She takes me way too seriously

I didn't mean to lead you on
I never meant to start a fire
But everything I do is wrong

I take myself too seriously

Her patience is over
'Cause she can't see the other side tonight
Her head needs my shoulder
But I don't have the heart to tell her

She takes me way too serious
I'm just someone who's out of his league
I can't be all I've wanted to be
She takes me way too seriously
