Born in the age of altamont
Mommy was a hippie and daddy was a drunk
They really believed all you need is love
While they we're looking for god
The streets we're runnin' with blood
Now there ain't no one to trust
You're a 60's baby
And nothin's alright
Born in the age of disco junk
Mommy liked reptiles daddy was a punk
They said there'll be no future for you
They did too much drugs
And made sure it came true
Now you're really born to lose

You're a 70's baby
And nothin's alright
Born in the age of take what you can get
Mommy and daddy was a tv set
All they left to you remember them by
Is some poisoned water
And a hole in the sky
And russian roulette sex
You're a 80's baby
And nothin's alright
You're a 60's baby
You're a 70's baby
You're a 80's baby
And nothin's alright
