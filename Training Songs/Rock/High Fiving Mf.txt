You high-fiving motherfucker, you high-fiving motherfucker
You high-fiving motherfucker, you high-fiving motherfucker

You're just a walking billboard for all the latest brands
You've got no taste in music and you really love our band
You're haircut is atrocious, it's been the same since '83
Your glory days are over and so's your stonewashed jeans

You crass fat-ass, you stupid steroid f*ck
I'll bet you even named your grand prize monster truck
You want me, you can't pay, you want me, you can't pay
You want me, you [Incomprehensible]
