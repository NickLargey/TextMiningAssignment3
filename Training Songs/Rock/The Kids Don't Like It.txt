Got some words, I don't know gonna sing'em
Here I go wan try not to be lame
Want to make you feel the same. I just want to be someone

Don't you know we tried to do something new
It may sound real good,
But I don't think we're getting through because

[Chorus]
The kids don't like it, no no
The kids don't like it, no no no
The kids don't like it, no they don't like it at all 
I said
The kids don't like it, no no
The kids don't like it, no no no
The kids don't like it, no they don't like it at all 
Anymore

Had a hit, famous, no
Easy come, easy go, should be 
Happy with what I got,
Should be happy but I'm not
I just want to be someone

Don't you know we tried to do something new 
It may sound real good, 
But I don't think were getting through because, 

[Chorus]

I thought there'd come a day 
When I'd run out of things to say 
But now I know it's true no one 
Listens anyway yeah! Common common yeah!

All we wanted was to do somethin' new 
It doesn't sound so good and I know were not
Getting through because 

[Chorus]

I said
The kids don't like it, no no
The kids don't like it, no no no
The kids don't like it, no they don't like it at all 
Anymore
