We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll, built this city
We built this city on rock and roll, oh

Say you don't know me, or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place
Knee-deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight
We got too many runaways eating up the night

Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city, we built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll, built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Someone's always playing corporation games
Who cares, they're always changing corporation names
We just want to dance here, someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible, write us off the page

Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll, built this city
We built this city on rock and roll, built this city
We built this city on rock and roll, built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

It's just another Sunday in a tired old street
Well, if you got the toco, oh, then we just lost the beat

Who counts the money underneath the bar?
And who writes the wrecking ball in two wild guitars?
Don't tell us you need us, 'cause we're just simple fools
Looking for America, coming through your schools

Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll, built this city
We built this city on rock and roll, built this city
We built this city on rock and roll, built this city
We built this city on rock and roll, oh
