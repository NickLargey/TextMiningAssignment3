I saw a cigar shaped flying ship
It landed outside on my lawn
You poked your head out of a door
And said, "Hurry up get on."
I've never seen the sight before
The world became a shrinking ball
I asked where you were taking me
You said, "Shut up and you will see."

CHORUS
Waves of time they rock us back and forth
There's no telling if we'll stay on course

We raced across the galaxy
Away from all our ugliness
I felt beautiful and free
Out where the devil can't exist
I felt a burst of energy
Hot white light poured from your eyes
We sped into infinity
I felt beautiful and free

CHORUS

Now I'm no longer in my life
I've left all my friends behind
Now letters don't get past my door
I can't really read them anymore
You took me to another world
Where time ceases to hold sway
And computers contain the missing key
To life's most sacred mystery

The secret of life is no secret at all
For secrets hold death and
Lies only build walls
