Old James Dean Monroe
Hands out flowers at the Shop-N-Go
Hopes for money but all he gets is fear
And the wind blows up his coat
And this he scribbles on a perfume note
"If I'm not here, then you're not here"
And he says, "Call me Miscreation
I'm a walking celebration"

And it's hard to make a stand, yeah
And it's hard to make a stand, woo
Yeah, it's hard to make a stand

My friend, oh, Lordy
Went to take care of her own body
And she got shot down in the road
She looked up before she went
Said, "This isn't really what I meant"
And the daily news said, "Two with one stone"
And I say, "Hey there, Miscreation
Bring a flower, time is wasting"

And it's hard to make a stand
And it's hard to make a stand
Well, it's hard to make a stand
You know, it's hard to make a stand
Yes, it is

We got loud guitars and big suspicions
Great big guns and small ambitions
And we still argue over who is God
And I say, "Hey, there, Miscreation
Bring a flower, time is wasting
I say, "Hey, there, Miscreation
We all need a celebration"

And it's hard to make a stand, yeah
And it's hard to make a stand
Oh, it's hard to make a stand
Yeah, it's hard to make a stand, oh
I think it's hard to make a stand (okay)
