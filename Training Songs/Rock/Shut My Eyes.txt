Hey, look around; looking down,
You'll never see me.
I'm standing right by your side.
You'll never hear me.
What did you say?
Did you mean that I was dying?
I can't explain what I've been.
I'm shaking.

[Chorus]
Lay in dust around me.
Shut the eyes that never found me.
Loneliness won't hear you when you call.
Took my time to see it.
Hide the face and don't believe it.
Could you be the only one to fall?

I'm looking out; looking in,
You'll never see me.
Cry, don't know why.
Could I try to make believe it?
I take a rest, take a breath,
And take what's mine.
But I don't know why.
I don't know why.

After all, there's nothing left to say.
Words are never free.
Sleep beneath the thought of yesterday.

[Chorus x 2]

Shut my eyes.
Shut my eyes.
Shut my eyes.
Shut my eyes.
Shut my eyes.
Shut my eyes.
Shut my eyes.
Shut my eyes.
