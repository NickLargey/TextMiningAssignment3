That Monday morning choo choo
Is leaving with my shoe shoe
Taking all my everything away, today
And that Monday morning sunshine
Might as well be night time
Cause I'm feel so sad and I'm going to end that mood.

All I feel like crying
All I feel like dying
Ohhh ohh

I guess I'm destined to be
Plain neglected and rejected
Tell the whole wo world about you

Of that Monday morning choo choo
Is leaving with my shoe shoe
I'm standing on track nine
Those are the lunchtime blues

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Oh oh

I guess I'm destined to be
Plain neglected and rejected and tell them whole wo world about you

Of that Monday morning choo choo
Is leaving with my shoe shoe
I'm standing on track nine
Those are the lunch time blues

Do do do do do dooo do
Do do do do do dooo
Do do do do dooo do doo doo dooo do dooo
