You pack your case and you're leaving 
You live your life in a different place 
So many miles in between us 
Give anything just to see your face 
When you come home I'll be waiting 
Imagination's gonna pull me through 
Yeah yeah 
I will send you 
All my love 
In a postcard 
All my love 
I spend my time thinkin' of you 
My nights and days turned into grey 
I can't hold moments together 
Winters come since you've been away 
My heart is yours now forever 
I feel my love must be a part of you 
Yeah yeah 
I will send you 
All my love 
In a postcard 
All my love 
I realize why I miss you 
It seems so strange everything's unchanged 
I feel I'm caught in a silence 
I feel my life has been rearranged 
When you come home I'll be waiting 
When you left you took my heart with you 
Yeah Yeah 
I will send you 
All my love 
In a postcard 
All my love
