Knew he was a misfit
Since the age of seventeen

He had to do it his way they said
He should be quarantined 
He went looking to the East
He went looking to the West
He was looking for the courage
To see which way was the best.

Can't turn back
Oh no

Look out on his right
He would look out on his left
He would look out in the distance
Where he could see the wilderness
When the thunderhead approached
He would pull off to the side
And when the sun broke through
He would get back out and ride

'Cause you can't turn back...

Try to see the forest for the trees
The wind storm for the breeze
No one ever said that it would be that easy
You make your way through the debris
Cling to your beliefs
Even though the world might say your crazy

He always had the feeling
He would get back out alive
But the more that he sees of it
Then the less he fantasizes
Though he's lost a bit of freedom
He has traded it for love
Knows that he'd fight for it
If that push came to shove

'Cause you can't turn back...
