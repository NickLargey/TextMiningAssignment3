A thought that never changes
Remains over time
It's always been just the same
No hearing, no breathing
No movement, no colors
Just silence

Rise and fall of shame
A search that shall remain
You asked me where I am
I said I didn't care

Sound formed in a vacuum
May seem a waste of time
It's always been just the same
No hearing, no breathing
No movement, no colors
Just silence

Rise and fall of shame
A search that shall remain
You asked me what you'd seen
I said I didn't care
