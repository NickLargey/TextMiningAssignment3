Fill my head with your nonsense 
You breathe my breath 'till I turn red
Close your eyes try to follow me
If you close your eyes you can become me
You can park your shoes on my front step
Then gently walk barefoot through my sunken chest
I'll shade my eyes from the burning sun
But feel confident 'cause we're as bold as love
And laughter

Wake me up when the day is late 
So I can watch the sunset and go back to bed
And dream so real the fantastic state
Psychodramatic means to uncertain ends
I'll scare you blind with my confidence
As cool as Jesus and his twelve best friends
The reason we can do these things is that the Earth has told of an outrageous spring....
Remembered

We'll meet for breakfast in the sunroom
The feeling in my soul as sweet as good perfume
Leave your sex at the door come in 
There's ecstasy for all, no need to leave your name
Pirouettes we will make in game
On the ceiling movies of our lives will play
The reason we can do these things 
Is that our minds are clouded 
And we can't see straight

Maybe I've played my part
But it's a players art 
Me and my friends we were all just living... playing
I've heard the sound that silence makes
And I realize the world can break 
From the inside out and outside in 
On a breath of wind
