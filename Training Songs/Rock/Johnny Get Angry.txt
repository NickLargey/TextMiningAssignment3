Johnny, I said we were through
Just to see what you would do
You stood there and hung your head
Made me wish that I were dead

[Chorus:]

Oh, Johnny get angry, Johnny get mad
Give me the biggest lecture I ever had
I want a brave man, I want a cave man
Johnny, show me that you care, really care for me

Every time you danced with me
You let Freddy cut in constantly
When he'd ask, you'd never speak
Must you always be so meek?

Every girl wants someone who
She can always look up to
You know I love you, of course
Let me know that you're the boss

Johnny, get angry, Johnny
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
