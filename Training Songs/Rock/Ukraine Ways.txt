I can hear Brazilian love songs, more every day
They seem stronger on the wind--you don't seem so far away
Someday I'm going to be there, someday I'll be
Standing on your highest mountain looking out across the sea

No longer here so cold and tired
I'm getting out today from Ukraine ways

From my childhood I've seen pictures, don't say a word
Decadent scenes of smiling people half the way across the world
When you live each day in colours of stone and gray
Feelings start to rise within you--steal the chance and get away

Much stronger now, I feel so inspired
I'm getting out today from Ukraine ways

I can feel your rhythm deep within me
I can see your people dance
Here I stand in the ice and snow
Warm where the cold winds blow

Colours that flash through my mind when I'm dreaming
Soon will be seen with these eyes of my own
Tropical days are the things that I live for
No more Ukraine ways

Instrumental

I can feel your rhythm deep within me
I can see your people dance
Here I stand in the ice and snow
Warm where the cold winds blow

Colours that flash through my mind when I'm dreaming
Soon will be seen with these eyes of my own
Tropical days are the things that I live for
No more Ukraine ways
