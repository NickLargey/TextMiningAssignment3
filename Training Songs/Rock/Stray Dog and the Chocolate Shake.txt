Supervisor guy turns off the factory lights,
So the robots have to work in the dark.

And there's a car load of kids, with beer and cigarettes,
Burning out and doin' lawn jobs in the park.

And there's a shitty limousine parked in front of the bar,
It never got to drive, any movie stars.

But the guy in the drivers seat don't care,
With his weird cologne and his magic hair, its magic!

The sofa and the fringe are on the car, 
But they're not strapped down,
And we are drivin' all over town.

And the used up krylon cans that the farmer found,
Were used to paint the foot-hills brown.

So there's a high school football coach sittin' on the couch,
With a tooth pick in his mouth.
And the stray down won't forget the day,
He tricked him with a chocolate shake, a little trick!
