Her eyes are light and clear
And fearless like Chicago winds in the winter time
And her hair is never quite in place
And the knees in her jeans have seen better days
And she's no beauty queen but you love her anyway
She's a wildewoman

She's gonna find another way back home
It's written in her blood, oh it's written in her bones
Yeah, she's ripping out the pages in your book
She's gonna find another way back home
It's written in her blood, oh it's written in her bones
Yeah, she'll only be bound by the things she chooses

Her smile is sneaky like a fiery fox
It's that look that tells you she's up to no good at all
And she'll say whatever's on her mind
They're unspeakable things and she'll speak them in vain
And you can't help but wish you had bolder things to say
She's a wildewoman

She's gonna find another way back home
It's written in her blood, oh it's written in her bones
Yeah, she's ripping out the pages in your book
She's gonna find another way back home
It's written in her blood, oh it's written in her bones
Yeah, she'll only be bound by the things she chooses
Yeah, she will only be bound by the things she chooses

Oh we're gonna find another way back home
It's written in our blood, oh it's written in our bones
Yeah, we're ripping out the pages in your book
Oh we're gonna find another way back home
It's written in our blood, oh it's written in our bones
Yeah, we'll only be bound by the things we choose
Yeah, we'll only be bound by the things we choose

We will only be bound by the things we choose
