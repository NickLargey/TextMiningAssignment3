She mixes you up and makes you come down
And I'm gone enough to fall for that now
She's only cool tonight and I've lost your sight
But that lullaby can never get me home

I've seen a few things I think you could say
My words fail me now and it's better that way
She's only cool tonight and I've lost your sight
But that lullaby can never get me home

Each night that I spend away is one more I have to behave
But she makes it seem so cool not to cave
She's only cool tonight and I've lost your sight
Still that lullaby can never get me

She's only cool tonight
But that lullaby can never get me home
