Five crooked lines meet at five different times
To make a star that shines so bright
it just might lead us to eternal life
The door was open wide and it was more than surprising 
And we swore the world'd be ours in time
But just like that the star fell from the sky

Into a lake of flames
Born of a fiery rain
Now it's all replaced
So watch it fall again
Into a lake of flames
Born of a fiery rain
Now it's all replaced
So watch it fall again
And again as the dreams erase
