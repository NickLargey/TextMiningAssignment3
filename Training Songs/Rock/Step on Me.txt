Oh I think you're standing 
On my left foot 
It's hurting but that's OK 
'Cause I'm in your way 

You'll break that foot that 
You're standing on 
I'll walk with the other one 
Do what you want to do what you want to 

Be what you want to be what you want to 
Go on and step on me 
You're free to have everything 
You can see all that you want from me 

Free to be all that you want to be 
Do what you want with me 
Oh, I think you're spinning 
Inside my head 

I think of you all the day 
'Cause you're in my way 
Oh, I think you're holding 
The heart of mine 

Squeeze it apart, that's fine 
Go ahead and step on me
