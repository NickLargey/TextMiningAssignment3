Make no mistake here
It's the love I fear
Look but don't watch dear
Want to when you're near
Same hot cold fever
Same nothing's ever clear
That man called again baby
Told him that you weren't here

Your sea's so far away (no way to know, no way to know)
Ya you seem so far away (no way to know, no way to know)
Where'd you go my love again
Today?

Off in the distance
There's no resistant strain
The future's soft touch
Could make me feel no pain
But I can't get there
My mind is elsewhere
Keep turning over
To find that you're not here

Too late your time has come
Walk straight, tell everyone
Wet behind the ears
You know you should have won
Gets between the sheets
Of all we've said and done

Your sea's so far away (no way to know, no way to know)
Ya you seem so far away
Oh your sea's so far away
Where'd you go my love again
Today?
