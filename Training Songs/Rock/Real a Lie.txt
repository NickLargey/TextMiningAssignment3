So free and so f*ck, so aroused
So alone I try to find the lie,
That lies beneath you, I try
Like a wave, I'm self-acclaimed

Real a lie, you're truly mine..

Real a lie, you're truly mine
I am that kind, living blind
Real a lie, I am that kind
Living blind, for a lie

Real a lie, you're truly mine
I am that kind, living blind
Real a lie, I am that kind
Living blind, for a lie

Behind closed doors your folded blind,
You're truly mine, from behind
Closed doors you meet me,
Like a wave, I'm self-acclaimed

Real a lie, you're truly mine..

Real a lie, you're truly mine
I am that kind, living blind
Real a lie, I am that kind
Living blind, for a lie

Real a lie, you're truly mine
I am that kind, living blind
Real a lie, I am that kind
Living blind, for a lie

Deep and so far, low down
Growing green, far above the waves
Got a lie, you and I
Wave, wave, wave

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo (4x)

Real a lie, you're truly mine
I am that kind, living blind
Real a lie, I am that kind
Living blind, for a lie
For a lie..
