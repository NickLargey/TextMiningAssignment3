Sha, la, la 
Sha, la, la 

Walking out quite late one night 
Not feeling happy or feeling down 
In the dark I stumbled over something on the ground 

As I got to my feet 
I heard a strange voice singing low 
Shout out a song I won't forget 
Until my dying day I know 

She said 
Sha, la, la 
Sha, la, la

When I heard her singing 
Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la

First my impulse was to run 
But then the magic caught my ear 
An unforgettable refrain 
A song for all the year 
 
 Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la

Well then I heard her singing 
Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la

In despair I cried out loudly 
Begging for her to come out 
Suddenly has it began 
The sha la song died out 

At last I realized who had sung it 
Quite amazed I turned to see 
The tall trees waving me goodbye 
The sha la song and me 
They sought me 

Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la

And then I heard her singing 
Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la
