Train rolls in at ten am
Kill the lamb for the lions, find some water for the elephants
Monkey on his shoulder, is a monkey on his back
Could I bum a cigarette, I done smoked my last pack
Throw up the big tent, throw down some sawdust
We don't open till the 'morin, step right up

We got beer for the bearded lady
And the Siamese twins are into opium
The trapeze guys are all high on cocaine
That they bought from a guy that used to drive the train
We got water for the elephants
Everybody knows the greatest party on earth
Is the circus down on Ringling Road

Well, the tattoo man is making out with snake lady
Just to piss off the human cannonball that she been dating
Clown got wasted and he's throwing a shoe
At a bear on a bike with a bottle of booze
Tightrope walker is to damn high
Welcome, everybody, to a freakshow Friday night

We got beer for the bearded lady
And the Siamese twins are into opium
The trapeze guys are all high on cocaine
That they bought from a guy that used to drive the train
We got water for the elephants
Everybody on earth know that the greatest party on earth
Is the circus down on Ringling Road

We got beer for the bearded lady
And the Siamese twins are into opium
The trapeze guys are all high on cocaine
That they bought from a guy that used to drive the train
We got beer for the bearded lady
And the Siamese twins are into opium
The trapeze guys are all high on cocaine
That they bought from a guy that used to drive the train
We got water for the elephants
Everybody on earth know that the greatest show on earth
Is the circus down on Ringling Road

Down on Ringling Road
Down on Ringling Road
