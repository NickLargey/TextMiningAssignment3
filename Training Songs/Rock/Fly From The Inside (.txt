Is the weight of the world on my shoulders?
Is the weight of the world on my shoulders?
On my shoulders
All alone I pierce the chain
And all in all the sting remains
And dying eyes consume me now
The voice inside screams out loud

I am focused on what I am after
The key to the next open chapter

Cause I found a way to steal the sun from the sky
Long live that day that I decided to fly from the inside

Every day a new deception
Pick your scene and take direction
And all in all I search to connect 
But I don't wear a mask and I have no regrets

I am focused on what I am after 
The key to the next open chapter

Cause I found a way to steal the sun from the sky
Long live that day that I decided to fly from the inside

I can't escape the pain
I can't control the rage
Sometimes I think that I'm gonna go insane
I'm not against what's right 
I'm not for what's wrong
I'm just making my way and I'm gone

Is the weight of the world on my shoulders?

Cause I found a way to steal the sun from the sky
Long live that day that I decided to fly from the inside

Cause I found a way to steal the sun from the sky
Long live that day that I decided to fly from the inside
