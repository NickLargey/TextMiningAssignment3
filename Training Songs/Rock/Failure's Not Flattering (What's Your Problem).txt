What's your problem
Can't you see it
And you go and blow it
Like everyone knows you will

Don't leave this rock unturned
Cause you could like what you find
A sure shot hit
With your name attached to it
Will you keep me in mind
I will cast the first stone
Obey the first mother
And rally the lasting impression
You believe what you want
And you said what's been said
And I do hope you learn a lesson

What's your problem
Can't you see it
And you go and blow it
Like everyone knows you will

Don't look too hard for what you want
Cause it could be on the tip of your tongue
You're holding back
Like there's nothing left to it
Could this be a false alarm
I will cast the first stone
Obey the first mother
And rally the lasting impression
You believe what you want
And you said what's been said
And I do hope you learn a lesson

What's your problem
Can't you see it
And you go and blow it
Like everyone knows you will

Why don't you get it together now
Failure's not flattering
When will you show yourself
When will you show yourself
Ah, I do hope you learn a lesson
You'll never learn your lesson

What's your problem
Can't you see it
And you go and blow it
Like everyone knows you will
