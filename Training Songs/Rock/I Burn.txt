Driftin' upward
Gently lifting
Lazy on the wind

Rollin' over
Turnin' slowly
Beginning and the end

Fire is bright
Fire is clean
Never so alive

Smoke is freedom
Flame is mercy
I am free tonight

And I burn
I burn

Stoke the embers
Cleanse the spirit
A prayer in every spark

Feel the lick of
Bad religion
The finish and the start

In the beginning
We were smarter
And the flame was heaven-sent

Through the ages
We got stupid
Now we must repent

And I burn
I burn

Sift the ashes
For reminders
Stony things remain

Tooth and bone
Unimpressive
I have left these things

Because fire is bright
Fire is clean
Efficient and divine

Tooth and bone
Charms and dolls
I am free tonight

I'm on
The air
You breathe

I'm on
The air
You Breathe

I'm on
The air
You breathe

I burn
I burn
I burn
