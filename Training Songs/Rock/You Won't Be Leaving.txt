The hour is very late,
And I can see you're getting worried
Coffee's finished, candles low
And soon you'll be asleep.

Long walk on the night is chilly
And my room is cozy
I've got a feeling,
You won't be leaving tonight.

Never thought to ask you
Why you really came to see me
Was it just the picture pinned
So neatly on the wall?

Candle lights place shadows
Of your figure on the ceiling
I've got a feeling
You won't be leaving at all.

I don't try to fight it, baby
I see the lovelight in your eyes
Just hold me tight then baby
You'll see that I'm not tellin' lies.

Never thought to ask you
Why you really came to see me
Was it just the picture pinned
So neatly on the wall?

Candle lights place shadows
Of your figure on the ceiling
I've got a feeling
You won't be leaving, at all.
I've got a feeling
You won't be leaving, at all.
I've got a feeling
You won't be leaving, at all.
I've got a feeling
You won't be leaving, tonight.
