Wake my love, what's my love like
What's my world love how do I pass that
Hope my life so I might see her so I be with her
No matter what it takes
Take that life so hard
Take that life so hard
Take that life so hard

Keep that world right
Take that love, what's my love like
What's my world life how do I ask that
Hope my love so I might see her so I be with her
No matter what it takes
Take that life so hard
Take that life so hard
Take that life so hard
Keep that world right
