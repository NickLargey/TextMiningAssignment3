I know that what's in front of me is a reflection of what is inside of me
I see that 
I need to be myself because it's so lonely in the eyes of someone else 
I feel  
Oh I feel 
Ya I feel and I always will 
I starve to leave fee from fear 
To free myself, before I disappear 
I am forever more than just surviving 
This is my life and this life is my diamond 
My time
Your time
Our time is running out
