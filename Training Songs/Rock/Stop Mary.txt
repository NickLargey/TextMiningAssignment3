It's too late
I'm starting to wonder
You're broken up inside

Too young
Not to be laughing
Sorrow can crawl on you another day

Everything that I have to give
I give it all to you
But I'm dancing with myself
The queen of hearts is bound to lose

Stop, oh Mary
It's time to go outside
'Cause we should be lovers
And take it easy

Oh Mary
You're keeping it inside
But it's gonna be alright
Take it easy

Infernos burning around you
Have stolen the fire hiding deep inside
Stand up
Scream your heart out louder
'Cause I can't love, oh, this way
