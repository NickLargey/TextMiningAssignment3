I could be discontent 
And chase the rainbows end
I might win much more but lose all that is mine

I could be a lot 
But I know I'm not
I'm content just with the riches that you bring 

I might shoot to win 
And commit the sin
Wanting more than I've already got
I could runaway 
But I'd rather stay
In the warmth of your smile lighting up my day
The one that makes me say

'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened 
To me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened 
So don't go away

I might be a king 
And steal my peoples things
But I don't go for that power crazy way
All that I could rule 
I don't check for fools
All that I need is to be left to live my way
So listen what I say

'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened 
To me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened 
So don't go away

Listen to what I say

'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened 
To me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened 
So don't go away

I could chase around 
For nothing to be found
But why look for something that is never there
I may get it wrong sometimes 
But I'll come back in style
For I realize your love means more than anything
The song you makes me say

'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened 
To me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened 
So don't go away

You're the best thing that ever happened 
To me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened 
Now don't go, I said don't go, no no don't go away
