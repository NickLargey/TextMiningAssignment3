I found it one day
Buried in some ancient African cave
Wrapped in a piece of leopard skin
The Zulu Death Mask
They would say we'd rule the world in 30 days
Ah, you'll never know, the Zulu Death Mask and me
Zulu Death Mask and me

In 7 days or so, we ruled most of Africa
The rest of the world cowered in fear
They sent in 50,000 troops to stop us

I held the mask to the moon and the sun, and in a second I destroyed every one of them, haha...
Now they don't mess with me, the Zulu Death Mask and me
