We don't ask for a lot but we get even less
Dirty child playing in a rubbish dump dress
Rich in heart but poor in practice
Always last in your perfect rat race
Always last in your perfect rat race
Please kind sir spare a tuppence for me
This isn't a cry for sympathy
Homeland wasteland desecrated trashcans
Disgust and hatred smile on your face
'cause we're always last in your perfect rat race

Sorry sights statutory rights
All go with the same old way of life
Sticks and stones rags and bones
All the trouble and the strife

Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
No need to know about it
Problem solved

Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
No need to know about it
Problem solved

Long lost outcast society
Of people who ain't free to be free
Tell stories of the things we've seen
Disgust your children with obscenities
Of the tales of all the places that we've been
