From diamond mine to the factory
Everybody's doing what you've got to keep on doing for society
Make this world a good place to be
Let livin' be but don't work for free
Playing isn't paying so work is what I'm saying
Working for the world go round
The battle cry don't mess with me
I've travelled the world for eternity

Warriors of the wasteland
Sailboats of ice on desert sands
Warriors of the wasteland

It seems to be that the powers that be
Keep themselves in splendour and security
Armoured cars for megastars
No streets, no bars, your wealth is ours
They make the masses, kiss their assets
Lower class jackass, pay me tax take out the trash
Working for the world go round
Your job is gold, do as you're told
The pay you less the run for congress

Warriors of the wasteland
Sailboats of ice on desert sands
Warriors of the wasteland
I'm working for the world go round, go round

Diamond mind to the factory, yeah
Make this a world, a good place to be

Warriors what a waste, man
