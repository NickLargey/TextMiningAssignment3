She says your money's safe
You needn't keep your head down
Who's kidding who?
Her picture's all over town

I always knew that she was on the run
I read the paper and it said so
I know you like them to be troublesome
Take it to the maximum

She's a murderer, murderer
She likes to go for the jugular
Murderer, murderer
That woman of yours is a killer

I heard his breath escape
She left the gun on the floor
He left his key with me
I hadn't been there before

I always knew that she was on the run
I read the paper and it said so
I know you like them to be troublesome
Take it to the maximum

She's a murderer, murderer
She likes to go for the jugular
Murderer, murderer
That woman of yours is a killer

She says she's innocent
She says she's your 'baby face'
Who's kidding who?
Your things are in a suitcase

I always knew that she was on the run
I read the paper and it said so
I know you like them to be troublesome
Take it to the maximum

She's a murderer, murderer
She likes to go for the jugular
Murderer, murderer
That woman of yours is a killer

You know the games she played
You'd better keep your head down
I hear a woman scorned
Can turn the world upside down
