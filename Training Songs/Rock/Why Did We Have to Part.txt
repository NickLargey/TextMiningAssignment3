Why did we have to part, my love?
Why couldn't life just stay the same?
It was over and I didn't know it
Living without you feel so strange
I remember the night when we met each other
It was a very long time ago
We both have changed for the better
We are so much kinder I know

Why did we have to part, my love?
Why couldn't life just stay the same?
It was over and I didn't know it
Living without you feel so strange

The night you said you loved another I simply could not take it in
What would I do without your love?
So cold and lonely each begin

Why did we have to part, my love?
Why couldn't life just stay the same?
It was over and I didn't know it
Living without you feel so strange

We are very good friends, my love
We have passed away all the pain
But you know I'll never come back again

Why did we have to part, my love?
Why couldn't life just stay the same?
It was over and I didn't know it
Living without you feel so strange

Why did we have to part, my love?
Why couldn't life just stay the same?
It was over and I didn't know it
Living without you feel so strange

Why did we have to part, my love?
Why couldn't life just stay the same?
It was over and I didn't know it
