Run, run, look and see
Run, run, look and see

I thought I saw you yesterday
I could have sworn you'd passed my way
But it was too good to be true
And there was nothing I could do

[Chorus:]

My heart says:
Run, run, look and see
Are my eyes just fooling me?
While I'm running, I keep praying
All the time my heart keeps saying:
Run, run, look and see
Run, run, look and see

Each time I hear our favorite song
I can't believe you're really gone
I hear your voice, I see your face
But then you're gone without a trace

Each time I see a crowd I stare
Just hoping someday you'll be there
My heart says:
Run, run, look and see
Run, run, look and see
