Oh oh, oh oh
You liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
Well I hate to say but pop ain't going solo
You liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
But now I'm just too mainstream for you, oh no

You liked me 'til you seen me on your TV
Well if you're so low below then why you watching
You say good things come to those who wait
Well I've been waiting a long time for it

I remember the days
When I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less then I was 
Just to prove I could walk beside you

Now that I've flown away 
I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day 
I decided to stay true to myself

You say your quest is to bring it higher
Well I never seen change without a fire
But from your mouth, I have seen a lot of burning
But underneath I think it?s a lot of yearning

Your face, the colors change from green to yellow
To the point where you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what you'd expect from me, like that's what I'm about

It's so much easier to stay down there 
Guaranteeing you're cool
Than to sit up here exposing myself 
Trying to break through

Than to burn in the spotlight
Turn in the spitfire
Scream without making a sound
Be up here and not looking down 
Because we?re all afraid of heights

Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
