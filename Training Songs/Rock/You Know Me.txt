If a man could be his own fantasy then to only breed in captivity
Is pointless
I've been doing what I like,
When I like, how I like it's joyless
Only you know me

What a waste of war this peace, baby steps and two more sleeps
Till I get to say sorry
I get hysterical, historicals, of love it's just chemical
Give us something to stop me
Only you
Know me

Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday
You don't know 'cause you're not there
You simply found the words to make all modern feelings fade away
Only you
Know me

I'm doin' fine and the sun often shines
What are you thinking?
I done bruised up my mind with this thunderbird wine
Baby, I'm drinking
Only you
Know me

Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday
You don't know 'cause you're not there
You simply found the words to make all modern feelings fade away
Only you
Know me
Only you
Know me

Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday
And you don't know 'cause you're not there
You simply found the words to make all modern feelings fade away
Only you
Know me
Only you
Know me
Only you
Only you
Only you
Know me (Only you know me)

All the way
Waitin' for you,
All my life
Waitin' for you
All my life
Waitin' for you
