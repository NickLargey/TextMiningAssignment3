He woke to the sound of the birds in the morning
Felt charged with a new lease of life
Time to break out of his present surroundings
A mother, a child and a wife
He'd not said good-bye to his last thread of childhood
It lay just beyond his front gate
So he packed just a few things
And he packed in his job
And he prayed he'd not left it too late

He turned and he said
"Well we always have time,
Time on our side
And there's time for this boy to turn back"

Joy held his heart
As he took to the road
Cast all his sorrow
To the breeze
Knew in his heart
It was the right thing to do
For he had to search out
His belief
Spring came and fall went
The year ran away
Love, hate and heartache ran too
Felt himself drift
Into memories of home
And the loneliness he lived on through

He turned and he said
"Well we always have time,
Time on our side
And there's time for this boy to turn back"

And he'd learnt about life
But he'd lost out on love
He was no longer only a boy
There were lines on his face
From the sun and the wind
But no lines there through
Laughter or joy

Shoes full of holes
But with fire in his soul
He walked down the dirt beaten track
Mother was gone
But his wife and child were living on
And they cried
"It's the boy who came back"
Goodbye through the evening
Goodbye through the night
Goodbye through the dreams
Through the sleep
Goodbye to our yesterdays
Hello tomorrow
It seems we were destined to meet

He turned and he said
"Well we always have time,
Time on our side
And there's time for this boy to turn back"
