I WROTE MY MOM A LETTER AND THIS IS WHAT I SAID...
WELLA WELLA WELLA WELLA 
WASHED ALL THE DISHES AND I DID A LOT MORE,
I EVEN BOUGHT THE DINNER AT THE GROCERY STORE.
AND NOW, MOM, YOU`LL FIND THE KEY NEXT DOOR,
THIS LITTLE GIRL`S GONE ROCKIN`.
I LEFT SOME BISCUITS FOR THE PUP,
I PUT FRESH WATER IN HIS CUP.
AND NOW I`M OFF, I`M GONNA LIVE IT UP,
THIS LITTLE GIRL`S GONE ROCKIN`.

WELL, I`LL BE HOME ABOUT TWELVE TONIGHT,
AND NOT A MINUTE MINUTE MINUTE LATER,
DON`T FORGET THE FRONT DOOR LIGHT,
THAT`S ALL FOR NOW, I`LL SEE YOU LATER, MATER.

YOU`LL FIND EACH THING THAT YOU WANTED DONE,
I`M OFF TO MEET THAT SPECIAL ONE.
AND BOY OH BOY WILL WE HAVE FUN,
`CAUSE THIS LITTLE GIRL`S GONE ROCKIN`.
