There's something you don't know, I've walked you off to keep you on your toes
There's something you didn't know, I've grown some bones, so I can walk you off

Tonight, tonight, everything's alright tonight, tonight

If I were in your shoes, I'd run a thousand miles just to tell you
If I were in your room, using just my eyes I would tell you
And I would tell you

There's something you didn't know, you've got your teeth sunk in me and it hurts,
And I'm a lie away from saying what I really think, is this the bottom of a bottle saying swim or sink and you don't even need me now

Tonight, tonight, everything's alright, tonight, tonight,

If I were in your shoes, I'd run a thousand miles just to tell you
If I were in your room, using just my eyes, using just my eyes,I would tell you

If I were in your shoes, I'd run a thousand miles just to tell you
If I were in your room, using just my eyes I would tell you

If I were in your shoes, in your shoes, in your
And I'm a lie away from saying what I really think, is this the bottom of a bottle saying swim or sink and you don't even need me now
