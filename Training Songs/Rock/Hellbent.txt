Yeah
I was hellbent to burn up the world with a beautiful girl I created
Then my god said, "take a powerful pill like a fool on the hill"
And I waited.

Everybody wants to hang around
Everybody wants to bring me down
This simple prayer I say without a sound
Get me off the ground

Man I lost it
I was losing my mind
I was dying to find a salvation
But I"m changing

I am making her mind and I'm trying to be a sensation
Everybody wants to hang around
Everybody wants to bring me down
This simple prayer I say without a sound
Get me off the ground
Yeah.
