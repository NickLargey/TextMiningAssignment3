Good evening
Philadelphia
I can't believe what I just said
I got up again
Like a monkey
And I raged right through the set
We went outside
Into an autumn wind
Running scared from the crowd
Headed out for an all night cafe
Where the waitresses got off on singing loud

I'm just a small town noise
I'm just a
Small town noise
I'm just a small town noise
I'm just a
Small town noise

Easy does it
Washington D.C.
What a state you're in
Looks like you've cracked
A hundred hallelujahs
Through
Fifty nights of sin
You get hungry for some leg over easy
Or packing someone`s pistol in the hood
It doesn't mean
You're not as fucking boring
As some dirty dark river that don`t move

[Chorus]
I'm just the village voice
I'm just the
Village voice
I'm just the village voice
I'm just the
Village voice
I'm just the village voice
I found out that

I realize
I need you
More than you need me
I realize
I need you
More than you need me

Goodbye
Denver Colorado
Goodbye Portland Maine
So long
Baden Baden
So bad they named you once again
We'll be breezing through the
Windy city
For the
Last time you`ll see
The only way the traffic`ll stop
Is if some angel flies down and touches me

[Chorus]

I realize
I need you
More than you need me
I realize
I need you
More than you need me
