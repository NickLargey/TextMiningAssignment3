Lisa picks her coffee up
And takes a small sip from her cup
She flashes with her blue eyes
Over at the counter
Where the spanish boys are talking loud
And hiking up their trousers proud
She feels herself expiring
Like the ticket on her windscreen

While Janni sits there all alone
All alone with his Walkman on
And he taps the rhythm gently
With his fingers on the table
And he's trying not to sing along
Sing along to his favourite song
He doesn't want to be play like that

He just wants to make her eyes see
That he can make her body tremble
He's sure she'd make his fingers tingle
Every time they touched her skin
He just wants to be with her
He just wants to lay down next to her
He just wants to go deeper
Deeper than any boy has been

Then she pads her lips with a serviette
Christ knows why they're never wet
And anyway he knows
She'd be back again tomorrow

And there's one thing wrong with the afternoon
It always comes around too soon
He sees her slip her magazine away
Walk over to the door

But he knows how to keep his cool
And he knows how to make it
He can stop himself from falling
But he has had to learn to fake it
Anyway, she's made today
A better day than yesterday

At least he feels alive today
And he could do the same for her
If he could make her eyes see
That he can make her body tremble
He's sure she'd make his fingers tingle
Every time they touched her skin
He just wants to be with her
He just wants to lay down next to her
He just wants to go deeper
Deeper than any boy has been

He knows how to keep his cool
And he knows how to make it
He can stop himself from falling
But he has had to learn to fake it
Anyway, she's made today
A better day than yesterday

At least he feels alive
And he could do the same for her
If he could make her eyes see
that he can make her body tremble
He's sure she'd make his fingers tingle
Every time they touched her skin
And he just wants to be with her
He just wants to lay down next to her
He just wants to go deeper
Deeper than any boy has been

Than any boy has been, than any boy has been
Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper
