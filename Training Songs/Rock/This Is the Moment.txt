She said, "what went wrong?"
I said, "I loved you all along."
She said, "how could you love me and hurt me like you do?"
Oh, no. I said, "don't say good-bye. don't go. please don't let us die."

This is the moment we could close the door,
Or hold on and fight for the chance at something more.
This is the moment, and if we hang in,
It's when we'll really begin.

She said, "I'm so scared."
I said, "just think of what we've had."
She said, "that was then, how can I feel that again?"
Oh, no. I said, "don't walk away. don't go, it's hard as hell to stay,

But I know, you'll understand someday, in times like this
We find out what we're about."
This is the moment we could close the door
Or hold on and fight for a chance at something more.

This is the moment we've got to hang in,
That's when love really begins.
Oh, help me, please help me, hold us together.
I promise that we can still have forever.

Oh, no. I said, "don't say good-bye. don't go. please don't let us die."
This is the moment we could close the door,
Or hold on and fight for the chance at something more.
This is the moment we've got to hang in,

It's when we really begin.
This is the moment we could close the door,
Or hold on and fight for the chance at something more.
This is the moment we've got to hang in,

It's when we really begin.
This is the moment we could close the door,
Or hold on and fight for the chance at something more.
This is the moment we've got to hang in,

It's when we really begin.
