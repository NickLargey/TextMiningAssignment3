It don't hurt we can feel our hearts
It gets brighter there
And we know how to start

In a box we get furious
For a while we share our time
We're layabouts for a start

Our industrial souls are gone
And night falls here
There's no time for mope and whine
And you know how it goes
It will be alright

Don't you know there's no barriers now
We can float downstream
We provde the lifelike line

And it grew with our latest crush
Made a shine this year
We're layabouts for a start

And you know how it goes
It will be alright
