I wish I had a different star
I wish I had a different silhouette
You decrease me, you seclude me, aggravate me and you made me
What I am today

This is the way forward
You are the way backwards
I chose the way forward
And left you all behind

I wish we could communicate
Despite the fact she hates me anyway
You seduce me, you abuse me, you frustrate me and amaze me
What is wrong with me?

This is the way forward
You are the way backwards
I chose the way forward
And left you all behind

It's bad enough that you could, could say that it's bad enough
It's bad enough that you could, could say that it's bad enough

I wish that I could trade these eyes
Cause now they only despise my own lies
You sedate me, elevate me, incarcerate me and you hate me
Neptune in the sea

This is the way forward
You are the way backwards
I chose the way forward
And left you all behind

It's bad enough that you could, could say that it's bad enough
It's bad enough that you could, could say that it's bad enough
