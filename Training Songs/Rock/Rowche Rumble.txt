Rowche Rumble*
Rowche Rumble
It's valium
Valium
Valium
Roche Rumble
That's rumble
For thousands of wives around the world
Are given out by doctors, to feed their little girls
The doctors need prescriptions
The wives need their pills
So Rowche Rumble
Menopause wives are hard to handle
No culture or love, no gamble
The dope addicts are especially smashed
On Rowche Rumble
Rowche Rumble
Physician, heal thyself
Our government's built an expense account
Once in, never out
A step to Rowche
A force feeding
What are the people around you taking?
Rowche Rumble
Now I've tried crazy things
Abusing my body to a great end
But I'll never never never never do it again
I said I'll never never never never do it again
Rowche Rumble
Physician, heal thyself.
Musician, heal thyself.
Hey mister, heal thyself.
And loads of people across the land
Who do a prescribed death dance
While condemning speed and grass
They got an addiction like a hole in the ass
Rowche Rumble
Rowche Rumble
I send 70 pounds instead of 70 p to
Pharmaceutical company Rowche AG
The lorry arrived the next day
Swiss gnomes dealing out potions
Lend a hand
What is the fear for?
Whose do you think your body is?
Rowche Rumble
It's valium
That's rumble
[ Play on the name of the giant Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche. ]
