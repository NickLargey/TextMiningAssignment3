I gotta broken mirror and a black cat bone
I gotta super mojo, too
I'm gonna mix them up with a wooden stake
And baby, then I'm gonna give it to you

I shoot a silver bullet right through your vein
I sprinkle love dust on the floor
I burn a candle on down to your name
And baby, then I'm gonna burn some more

'Cause I'm
(Doctor Potion)
Doctor Potion, I'm comin' after you
(Doctor Potion)
Doctor Potion, I'm comin' after you

Gotta broken ladder up to the moon
Just so I can look at you
I make a super howl like a wild dog
I'm jumpin' through a ring of fire for you

Gotta chicken's leg and a rabbit's hoof
A little secret book of charm
I take a little sip from the wooden cup
And baby, I wouldn't do you no harm

(Doctor Potion)
Doctor Potion, I'm comin' after you
(Doctor Potion)
Doctor Potion, I'm comin'

Gotta broken mirror and a black cat bone
I gotta super mojo, too
I'm gonna mix them up with a wooden stake
And baby, then I'm gonna give them to you

I shoot a silver bullet right through your vein
I sprinkle love dust on the floor
I burn a candle on down to your name
And baby, then I'm gonna burn some more

'Cause I'm
(Doctor Potion)
Doctor Potion, I'm comin' after you

(Doctor Potion)
Doctor Potion, comin' after you
(Doctor Potion)
Doctor Potion, I'm comin after you
