Come on spin the bottle
Let it turn
And if it points to you
I'll make you burn
Spin the bottle
Let it turn
And if it points to me
I'll promise you nothing comes for free

This, is a one way dead end street
The only place where we will meet
We're on a one way dead end street
All alone and no way home all chances blown

Let's drink another
Or what it takes
To help me coverall of your fakes
So, that no one sees how desperate we are
Far out heading one way to the stars

Chorus
