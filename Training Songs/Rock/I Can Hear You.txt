Leaky faucet dripping in the kitchen
Rubber squealing - watch out in the alley
Mr. Marley's probably late for work again
Birdie singing - telling me to get up
Such a soothing sound floating on the wind
I just keep listening

Funny how You speak to me
In such mysterious ways

[Chorus]
I can hear You
I can hear You
It's so amazing how Your voice keeps breaking through
I can hear You

There's a church bell ringing out the hour
Like an old friend calling through my window
With the laughter of the children playing down below
You've got a way of getting my attention
In the rhythm of life, everywhere I go
Somehow You let me know

If I'll only stop to listen
You're in everything

[Repeat Chorus]
I can hear You
I can hear You
I can hear You
I can hear You

[Repeat Chorus]
