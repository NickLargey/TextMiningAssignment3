A moment sits suspended in time what I a time I had with you
Living in your fantasy world, well there ain't much of a view
I rarely stepped outside of myself, always caught up in between
Some place I thought was good for my health and the place I've always been
So let me tell you now

Oh, you better stop your crying
'cause you're feeling so damn happy
You try to make me feel like dying
Oh, you better stop your crying
'cause the tears that are running down your face
They don't make me feel like dying

I guess I never wanted to crash in the wave of your emotion
I walked away from all of the trash looking for a perfect ocean
But lately I've been finding myself fighting upward int he stream
And who could tell that I'm living in hell? lord, I must be dreaming

Oh, you better stop your crying
'cause I don't listen to you anymore even when you know you're lying
Oh, I see the story on your face
Stop your crying, 'cause you can't make me feel like dying

So now the party's come to and end and to end a perfect time
I send you love and all of the best, and all the rest is mine
And I'd rather sit and talk to myself after all is said and done
What happens next, hey no one can tell, and I ain't tellin' no one

Oh, you better stop your crying
'cause the tears that are running down your face
They don't make me feel like dying
Oh, you better stop your crying
You ain't even trying, you better stop your crying
