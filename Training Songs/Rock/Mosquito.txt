She was so small. 
She thought she knew it all. 
She said she loved me from the inside out. 
She whispered in my ear: "You're so sweet!".
I didn't know what she meant until she kissed my cheek. 
Mosquito, I'm going away. 
I know you love me but I can't stay. 
She's always around, singing her favorite song.
Why can't we just get along. 
Baby, baby, baby, can't you see? 
What you call love is sucking the life out of me.
