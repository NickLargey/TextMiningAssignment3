I'll dream your arms around me, your heartbeat next to mine.
A dream of love to guide me, I'll dream your hand in mine once again.

A dream to hear you calling.
A dream to touch your heart.
A dream of love to follow.

I'll dream your lips on mine once again, because i love you darling.

All your dreams collide.
All your nightmares cold and stranded.
Let love decide and let love take the day the right way.
