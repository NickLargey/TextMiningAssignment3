So she said, "Everyone's going to the party.
Won't you come if I come with a friend for your friend?
I'd be so pleased to see you outside of the classroom
Wearing the smile that I'll bring you
I was hoping to learn a few things, like...

Do you, do you like dishing the dirt on the whole class?
Or talking the big smack?
Or playing the fool?
Or wearing all of the latest fashions?
Or bucking the new trends and wearing your old threads?
Or if you like coffee in the evening
These are a few things that I'd like to know
That I'd like to know."

So I say, "I've been scheduled to work but I'll call in.
And my friend isn't busy.  He'd be happy to join me.
And maybe my friend and your friend will hit it off.
Or maybe we will.
I'm dying to know...

Do you, do you like dreaming of things so impossible?
Or only the practical?
Or ever the wild?
Or waiting through all your bad, bad days
Just to end them with someone you care about?
And do you like making out?
And long drives?
And brown eyes?
And guys that just don't quite fit in?
Do you like them?

So, yes I'll see you there."
