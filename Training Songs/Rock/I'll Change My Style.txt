I'll change my style
Even change my smile
If the beatin' in my heart
Is too slow for you
Tell me, darlin', tell me
I'll change that too

I'll change my ways
Each night and every day
If there's something 'bout my lovin'
That don't please you
Tell me, darlin', tell me
I'll change that too

I'll change my walk
Even change my talk
If there's something 'bout my kisses
That don't please you
Tell me, baby, tell me
I'll change that too

I'll change my style
Oh, baby after a while
If the beatin' in my heart
Is too slow for you
Tell me, honey, tell me
I'll change that too

I'll change my way
Every night and every day
If there's something 'bout my lovin'
That don't please you
Just tell me, oh, tell me
I'll change that too
