There goes the year
In doctor's bills and sleeping pills
Too many years
Have I been interned
I miss the flames
In which I was burned

When I say I miss you
When I say I miss you
Do I scare you?
Do I scare you?
Do I? I probably do

I rest my case
The child dies at thirty-five
I could be lying here
In the time it takes you to arrive
I could be crying, I could be dying
Oh, I could be lying

When I say I miss you
When I say I miss you
Do I scare you?
Do I scare you?
Well, do I? I probably do

You gave me nothing
I asked for nothing
And you gave me nothing
But myself

Didn't know what I was thinking
But you didn't really care
I'm gonna find that gun you bought me
The one I'm holding just the way you taught me
Hey, mister, I say listen mister
That's my finger on the trigger

When I say I miss you
When I say I miss you
Do I scare you?
Do I scare you?
Do I? I probably do
I probably do
