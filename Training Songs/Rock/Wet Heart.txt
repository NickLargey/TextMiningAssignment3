It seems like nothing long or sharp
Enough to press on your wet heart
Little girl somehow was struck so wide
Don't think she's dry behind the eyes

Stiff-walking like a seeing eye
Your hand too dry to hold
What disappointed you
To make you act so old?

She doesn't like to compare scars
I shrug and say "It's your wet heart."
She wants to be a mystery
I'm sorry there's no way to be
I guess I'll go on wondering
If she was hiding anything
