Sunrise, I'm still dancing Girlfriend, she's my champion
Swing low, pull me over
Hey - be my savior

Blood, Skin
Show me the book
Don't understand the language that they spoke

Don't pity me
Have pity on yourself
You might know Jesus but you'll all join in hell

Shine On Sister!
Don't need a book to put your hand in the fire
Shine On Sister!
Come on in cause it's cold outside

Kiss Me!
Kiss Me!
I can tell your name by the markings on your face

U. B. Jesus
Makin' my way & I'm lovin' my life
Kiss Me! 
Kiss Me!
Swing so crazy like the way you ride

Maybe I'm gonna fry in hell
But I feel good when I burn myself
In a smokey place, In my girlfriends car
Threw out the map when we drove to far

Jesus is big
Jesus is strong
Jesus'll kill you if you don't get along

Jesus can swing
Jesus has skills
Go on & try it if you don't believe he will

Jump Back, Jump Back
Givin' me a heart attack
Fall down, Fall down
Sweeter than a cherry bomb

Sweet Thing, Sweet Thing
Steppin' on your violin
Space Boy, Fly Girl
Living in the underworld

Shine On Sister!
Don't need a book to put your hand in the fire
Shine On Sister!
Come on in cause it's cold outside

Jesus is cool
Jesus is scared
Baby you are the only car I drive

Foolin around
Foolin myself
Baby you are the only car I drive

Easy to touch 
Easy to find
Baby you are the only car I drive

Melts in my mouth
Melts in the hand
Baby you are the only car I drive

Outta my skin
Outta my life
Baby you are the only car I drive
The only car I drive
