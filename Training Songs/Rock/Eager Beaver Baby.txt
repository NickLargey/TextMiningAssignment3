I don't know how it started, I don't know what I did
But there's a gal who's chasm' me who really flipped her lid
I call her my eager beaver baby, ooh eager beaver baby
Well what am I gonna do with that eager beaver baby of mine
She's always there beside me, no matter where I stop
She follows me at the movies, even to the barber shop
I call her my eager heaver baby, ooh eager beaver baby
Well what am I gonna do with that eager beaver baby of mine

She gets me in her parlor and switches off the light
Before I know what's happened she's a-huggin' me so tight
I call her my eager beaver baby, eager beaver baby
Well what am I gonna do with that eager beaver baby of mine
She loves to mess my hair up and loosen up my tie
And when she starts a-kissin', I'm a real gone guy
I call her my eager beaver baby, ooh eager beaver baby
Well what am I gonna do with that eager beaver baby of mine
