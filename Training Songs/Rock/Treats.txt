I don't want to remember this
You've left no future for your kids
Promised change, said we'd be okay
We're suffocating, I feel let down

I don't want the world like this
I don't want the world left like this
Our lives matter, hear me now
We're going under, you beat me down

Our lives matter, hear me now
We're going under, you beat me down
Our lives matter, hear me now
We're going under, you beat me down

I want someone to treat me right
I want someone to treat me right, right

How many times 'til you will see
I hate I disagree
With every lie you spit to us
Can't justify, I feel let down

I don't want the world this way
I don't want the world left this way
you beat me down

Our lives matter, hear me now
We're going under, you beat me down
Our lives matter, hear me now
We're going under, you beat me down

I want someone to treat me right
I want someone to treat me right
I want someone to treat me right
I want someone to treat me right

I want someone to treat me right
I want someone to treat me right
I want someone to treat me right
I want someone to treat me right, right
