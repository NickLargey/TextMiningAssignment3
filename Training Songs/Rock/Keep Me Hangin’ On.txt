It's all over between me and you
I wanna tell you I still love you but it wouldn't be true
I know it hurts like hell but what else can I do?
You said I wasted your time but that was my time too
Living a lie, I was a liar, I lied
Too much of a coward to admit I wasn't satisfied
I know I caused you pain deep down inside
But the sweet love between us has died

Please forgive me if you can forget the things I've done
Understand that I am just a man
And I've fallen in love
With a woman

This is me leaving, this is me closing the door
I don't wanna be a part of you and me anymore
I've had enough now baby, I loved you before
But I can't even remember what I used to adore

Gone, I bet you didn't think I'd dare
You had me locked up in a tower now I'm letting down my hair
My broken heart is not beyond repair
I was drowning now I'm coming up for air

Please forgive me if you can forget the things I've done
Understand that I am just a man
And I've fallen in love
With a woman

Please forgive me if you can forget the things I've done
Understand that I am just a man
And I've fallen in love
With a woman
With a woman
With a woman
With a woman
With a woman
