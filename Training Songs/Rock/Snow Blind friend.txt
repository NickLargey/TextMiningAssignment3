You say it wsa this morning when you last saw your good friend 
Lying on the pavement with the misery on his brain 
Stoned upon a potion he found upon the wall In some unholy bathroom in some un godly hall
He only had a dollar to live on til next Monday, But he spent it on comfort for his mind- you say you think he's blind.
Someone should call his parents a sister or a brother, And they're bound to take him back home on a bus
But he'll always be a problem to his poor and puzzled mother
And he'll always be another one of us

He said he wanted heaven but prayin' was to slow So he bought a one way ticket, on an airline made of snow
You say you saw your good friend flyin low, dying slow, flying low,dieng slow flying low
He only had a dollar to live on til next Monday But he spent it on comfort for his mind you say you think he's blind
He said he wanted heaven but prayin was to slow
