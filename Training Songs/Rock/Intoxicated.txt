Yeah, you know I am the poison you need
I'll be the smoke, take a hit off of me
I'm like the Devil with my tongue
Give you that dirty kind of love
One taste and you can't get enough
You be the vein, I'll be the drug

That's the way that I make
You want it 'til your body's shaking
That's the way that I make
You push it, pull it, give in, take it
Use 'til you're intoxicated

Double the dose and I'll triple the high
Shoot me up, let's go for a ride
Putting it on to tear it off
Take every drop until it's gone
Even if I could, I won't stop
I'm all you want, I'm all you've got

That's the way that I make
You want it 'til your body's shaking
That's the way that I make
You push it, pull it, give in, take it
Use 'til you're intoxicated

Yeah, you know that I'm the poison you need

That's the way that I make
You want it 'til your body's shaking
That's the way that I make
You push it, pull it, give in, take it
Use 'til you're intoxicated
Use 'til you're intoxicated
Use 'til you're intoxicated
