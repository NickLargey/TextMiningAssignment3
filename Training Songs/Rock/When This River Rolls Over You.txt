â€˜Ain't it a shame babe how your words fall in an empty place
No one to follow or to trace
No wonder you are like you do
Holding your change out you're wrapped up within all your cares
The waitress is stacking the chairs
And holding the notes to the tune,
And all your precious stones
They won't help keep you afloat
Don't say you ain't been told
When this river rolls over you
Haven't you heard babe how the speechless are storming the stage
Carrying the cards that you've made
And lifting the tone of the room
Ain't it the way how when the cavalier is blocking the road
Resisting all things he's been told
And luring us out to the moon
And all the seeds you've sewn
Under this wait creek and groan
Don't say you ain't been told
When this river rolls over you.
