Like taking candy from a little girl
It's not hard to make me cry
There is no Santa Claus or Tinkerbell
Making magic in my life

(Can you be content where you are?)
I wanna try everything at least once in my life
(Don't you think you've gone a bit far?)
Well, never mind, in a little while

You know I might change my mind
(Nothing's changing my life)
I think I'd better change my mind
(Nothing's changing my life)

'Cause I feel a bit left behind
Nothing's changing my life
But they're changing the times
Nothing is changing mine

I have no patience for the common man
But that isn't you or me
The commonplace I've heard of secondhand
And that's where we'll never be

(Don't you think you've gone a bit far?)
I wanna be truly open for once in my life
(When you fall it's gonna be hard!)
I disagree. I've been hoping
If I get the chance I won't think twice

Nothing's changing my life)
I think I'd better change my mine
(Nothing's changing my life)
'Cause I feel a bit left behind

Nothing's changing my life
But they're changing the times
Nothing is changing mine
Don't say that it's all I deserve

Someday I'm gonna summon the nerve
To face you unafraid and call a spade a spade
And not just stand and wait
Expecting a serve
