I saw this year a man
Can't forget to smile
Looking for something he would never
He's got a girl, blisters, tries to understand
She's in love with a complicated man

We were all in, never find it so hard
No, I never was a good deal
'cause I will never find anyone so absolutely fun
As I found in you

It might seem silly but I'm sure
I just wanna be loved, just wanna be loved
It might be easy but I know
I simply wanna be sure, just wanna be sure

I knew a man in complicated times
And it's so difficult to decide
We should be out there, how low we should be
In the words of the sick it will come

It might seem silly but I'm sure
I just wanna be loved, just wanna be loved
It might be easy but I know
I simply wanna be sure, just wanna be sure

I just wanna be loved
Simply want to be loved
Loved, loved
Just wanna be loved
Simply want to be loved
