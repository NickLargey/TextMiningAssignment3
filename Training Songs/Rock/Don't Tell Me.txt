I've got an empty feeling
Losing out so try to understand
I played a thousand games of cards
And never won a single hand
That's probably all I am
They say you win and loose
I hope I win some day 

It seems no matter what you try to do
You step on someone's toes
And it gets harder every day
To recognize your friends from foes
Well I'm not feeling sorry for myself
But it might sound that way
But friends are all I got
To get me through each day

I've followed every rule they say
I made up lies, I stayed in bed
I tried to compromise instead
Don't tell me
Don't tell me why

I never thought I'd try to win 
And loose it all some day
I never thought I'd try to see 
I hope it's not too late

I've followed every rule they say 
I made up lies I stayed in bed
I tried to compromise instead
Don't tell me
Don't tell me
Don't tell me
Don't tell me why
