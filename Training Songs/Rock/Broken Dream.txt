One more illusion shattered, one more broken dream
Oh, that the morning brings the sun
Gone are the days when I could bounce right back again
See how the tears flow down like sweet summer rain
Where does it leave me now?
I find myself so free again

Even the smallest traces of your sweet perfume
Open the floodgates and I'm helpless
Now, as the moonlight shadows, cast across my room
Only the whispered words are heard in the night
Only a silent prayer, I love you still, I always will

Out of the dark, I stumbled into the light
Only my fear has tumbled, I think, I always knew
That I would run to you

Somewhere there's children playing, somewhere far away
Running with open arms to greet me
Over the hill, the sunset dies and fades away
I turn and I close the door with one last goodbye
I will return no more, I'll take my heart and let it fly
