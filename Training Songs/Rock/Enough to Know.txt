Something else is keeping you, keeping you from knowing me
And something else will keep you locked away
Against the grain your star to fade
Sunken eyes have more to say
And something else will keep you locked away

And I'll say I feel enough to know
Always waiting for more
I feel enough to know

Janitors who read the lines can tell you where the sun will rise
Invitation of another day
Paint it black, this sugar shack
So everyones inclined to stay

Somethings keeping me from knowing you ...
