Talk about meanwhile back at the ranch. 
The ugly ducklings learn to dance. 
Spirits rising, might be more. 
Gonna blow this whole town out the back door. 
Give 'em hell tonight. 
Go west young man?
All right. 
We'll burn the bridges if we please.
Or forever you can hold my peace.

A little taste I can't stop, tastes as sweet as soda pop. 
All dressed up and ready for the top.

[Chorus]
Yes I, got to have it, got to have it, got to have it and that's my bottom line.
Got ta have it, got to have it, got to have it,
have it one more time. Got to have it, got to have it, got to have it and that's my bottom line.
Got to have it, got to have it, got to have it baby.

You want to feel 100 proof? 
I got news for you. 
I seen some folks fall and a couple fly. 
And some of them just die.

Ain't nothing's once upon a time, got a rosy future and a big behind. 
Might get lucky, never mind. 
I hear beginners do it all the time.

[Chorus:Repeat x3]
