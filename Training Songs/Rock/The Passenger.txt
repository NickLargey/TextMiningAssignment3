I am the passenger 
And I ride and I ride 
I ride through the city's backside 
I see the stars come out of the sky 

Yeah, they're bright in a hollow sky 
You know it looks so good tonight 
I am the passenger 
I stay under glass 

I look through my window so bright 
I see the stars come out tonight 
I see the bright and hollow sky 
Over the city's a rip in the sky 
And everything looks good tonight 

Singin' la la la la la-la-la la 
La la la la la-la-la la 
La la la la la-la-la la la-la 

Get into the car 
We'll be the passenger 
We'll ride through the city tonight 
See the city's ripped insides 

We'll see the bright and hollow sky 
We'll see the stars that shine so bright 
The sky was made for us tonight

Oh the passenger 
How how he rides 
Oh the passenger 
He rides and he rides 

He looks through his window 
What does he see? 
He sees the bright and hollow sky 
He see the stars come out tonight 
He sees the city's ripped backsides 
He sees the winding ocean drive 

And everything was made for you and me 
All of it was made for you and me 
'cause it just belongs to you and me 
So let's take a ride and see what's mine 

Singin' la la la la la-la-la la 
La la la la la-la-la la 
La la la la la-la-la la la-la 

Singin' la la la la la-la-la la 
La la la la la-la-la la 
La la la la la-la-la la la-la 

Singin' la la la la la-la-la la 
La la la la la-la-la la 
La la la la la-la-la la la-la 

I am the passenger 
and I ride and I ride

Singin' la la la la la-la-la la 
La la la la la-la-la la 
La la la la la-la-la la la-la 

I am the passenger 
and I ride and I ride

Singin' la la la la la-la-la la 
La la la la la-la-la la 
La la la la la-la-la la la-la 

I am the passenger 
and I ride and I ride and I ride...
