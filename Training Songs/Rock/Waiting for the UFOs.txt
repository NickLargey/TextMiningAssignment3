No-one can hide it anymore we know it's not imagining
Even the skeptics are unsure when they stop to think
People are not worth their life now they are obsolete
We're dying to be invaded and put the blame on something concrete

Waiting for the UFOs Waiting for the UFOs
We are waiting for the UFOs We know that they're there

We're just a joke they sometimes crack, they'll get away with anything
The government is holding back, they won't say a word
Now is that a light in sky or just a spark in my heart?
Can I accept this as evidence or will that tear the whole act apart?

This new obsession is turning us alien too too
Much more resounding my heart just stopped pounding for you

Waiting for the UFOs Waiting for the UFOs
We are waiting for the UFOs Waiting Waiting
