Something just ain't right,
As I turn out the light
And go to bed.
Pictures of you in my head.
 
Beneath the hazy, purple sky,
You incidentally lied.
I Gotta say,
I'd be better off dead.
 
Through
The good news and the bad,
The happy and the sad,
I was always true.
How come I feel I'm losing you?
 
I wish it was yesterday,
'Cause today pulls me under.
Place your bets on tomorrow's game.
I wish it was yesterday.

I need a lucky number.
Well, something's gotta change.
I wish it was yesterday,
Today.
 
If I could only find a way,
To make you stop and say: you won't let go,
As you walk out that door.
 
Tuesday morning blues.
I'm workin' on the clues, and you know
I feel worse than before.
 
As I hand dry the roses that you sent.
This only just began.
How come it feels like the end?
 
Something just ain't right,
As I turn out the
Light and go to bed,
 
Pictures of you in my head.
