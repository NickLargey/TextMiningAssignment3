It only takes the slightest touch from you to send me
Like the softest of a  midnight walk thru moonbeams
So many nights I had the sweetest dreams about you
So many reasons I can't live without you
How can the moon tell the stars when to shine

They already  glimmer  the night
They're shining much brighter
With your heart close to mine 
That's how you know love's right

It always comes from the place you don't expect it
No one ever set my heart on fire like you did
And all my life I never knew what love could bring me
Until it happened to you and me that moment
How can the moon tell the stars when to shine

They already  glimmer  the night
They're shining much brighter
With your heart close to mine 
That's how you know love's right
