Every day I get complaints from you
Starts me thinking, baby, I'm your fool
Broken dreams all on the floor
You can't back it up any more

'Cause I found out, love just ain't enough
I need devotion to back it up
(Back it up, baby)
I found out, love just ain't enough
(Back it up, now)
I need devotion to back it up

(Back it up, baby)
Back it up, baby
Right back to the top
(Back it up, now)
You've been demoted 'til the pain has stopped
(Back it up, baby)
 Back it up, baby

Roll it over twice
(Back it up, now)
Don't give a ? about the something nice

Said don't give a 

Hold on now, it's a shady day
You've been cheating on me, friends say
That little ugly laugh at me
'Cause I'm so far even you can't see

(Back it up, baby)
I found out, love just ain't enough
(Back it up, now)
I need devotion to back it up
(Back it up, baby)
I found out, love just ain't enough
(Back it up, now)
I need devotion to back it up

(Back it up, baby)
I need devotion and you do too
(Back it up, now)
Come on and give it like I gave it to you
(Back it up, baby)
I know, I know you've been cheating on me
(Back it up, now)
You're going to pay for it, wait and see
(Back it up, baby)
Before I turn you loose

(Back it up, now)
You'll feel good but that ain't no excuse
(Back it up, baby)
I believe it, sure enough
(Back it up, now)
We all need devotion to back it up
(Back it up, baby)
Well, all right
