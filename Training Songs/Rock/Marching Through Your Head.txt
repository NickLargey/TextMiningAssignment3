Do you feel it all the time? 
The way she preys upon your mind? 
She's a fiend for you love and that's all 
Body's aching all the time 
The way we feel that old red wine 
It's a squeeze and you feel it 
Living another day in someone else's fantasy 
Makes it harder than it was before 
And though you've changed over time you need help 
to realize nothing you do is ever ever set in stone 
And it's been marching through your head 
Wake up tired in your own bed 
When she turns to you and says 
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, I want it all

And then you promise everything 
Finest diamonds on her ring 
Years of sadness this will bring 
Truth always comes out in spring 
And it's been marching through your head 
You think of all the things she said 
And all the times that you regret 
You've been untrue to your own heart 
And it's been marching through your head 
You think about it day and night, my friend 
I know you do, I know you far too well to let you go with her 
Oh I think about your lover 
And all the time she's done you wrong 

I know you could do better 
Oh yeah, but you've been waiting far too long 
Oh yeah, you think about it marching through your head 
You think about it day and night, my friend 
I know you do, I know you far too well to let you go with her 
Oh yeah, you think about it marching through your head 
You think about it day and night, my friend 
I know you do, I know you far too well to let you go with her
