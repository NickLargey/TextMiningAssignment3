I have reached the end, and I don't know
(What I believe in anymore)

There's something crazy runnin' wild inside my brain
I have seen the truth become my lie
(Relive my shame, swallow my pride)

I have crossed the line and I know there's no turning back!

You kiss away all of my pain!
You wash away these bloody stains
You are to blame my suffering
(My, my, my suffering)

You kiss away all of the pain!
You wash away these bitter stains
You are to blame my suffering
(My, my, my suffering)

I've seen the devil in a smile
(I found salvation in a vial)
My happy ending exists only in my dreams!

You kiss away all of my pain!
You washed away these bloody stains
You are to blame my suffering
(My, my, my suffering)

You kiss away all of the pain!
You washed away these bitter stains
You are to blame my suffering

(My Suffering)

You kiss away all of my pain!
You washed away these bloody stains
You are to blame my suffering
(My, my, my suffering)

You kiss away all of the pain!
You washed away these bitter stains
You are to blame my suffering

You kiss away all of my pain!
You washed away these bloody stains
You are to blame my suffering

(My, my, my suffering)
My suffering
(My, my, my suffering)
My suffering
(My, my, my suffering)
My suffering (My suffering)
