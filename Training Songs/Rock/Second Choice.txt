You begin your education on a nursery school floor
Now you're a little older and you want some more
Everything you say and do is wasted on my ears
Soon it'll be too late for me turning back the years

A simple life is all I need
Two shots of fantasy and one of make-believe
I never tried too hard to make this succeed
You're the only one I need
I never felt the need to cry or rejoice
I never felt the need to raise my voice
I only wanted to be one of the boys
Now you made me second choice

Now look behind you, baby, well, he's doing it again
He is going to get you but he won't say when
Stop, look and listen when you open up your door
Or he'll be in there with you, you'll be lying on the floor
