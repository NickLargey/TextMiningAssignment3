You're waiting (you're waiting)
On miracles (on miracles)
We're bleeding out (bleeding out)

Thoughts (thoughts)
And prayers (prayers)
Adorable (crisis)
Like cake in a crisis (in a crisis)
We're bleeding out (bleeding out)

While you deliberate
Bodies accumulate

Sit and talk like jesus
Try walkin' like jesus
Sit and talk like jesus
Talk like jesus
Talk talk talk talk
Get the f*ck out of my way

Don’t be the problem, be the solution
Don’t be the problem, be the solution
Don’t be the problem, be the solution
Problem, problem, problem, problem

Faith without works is
Talk without works is
Faith without works is
Dead, dead, dead, dead

Sit and talk like jesus
Try walkin' like jesus
Sit and talk like jesus
Try walkin' like jesus
Try braving the rain
Try lifting the stone
Try extending a hand
Try walkin' your talk or get the f*ck out of my way
