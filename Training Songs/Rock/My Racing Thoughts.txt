She's a black cat hanging 'round my doorstep
I'll need all day tomorrow to recover from today
I was boxing with my shadow at a stoplight 
When the clocks changed, yeah
It was midnight I was mixed up 
When she called to drag the lake

I think I'm running short on inspiration
She's running long on borrowed time 
We break with speed
That girl can read my racing thoughts
She asks the questions,
I take the floor, she takes her shots
Taught her a lesson about a forced confession 
We break with speed
That girl can read my racing thoughts

My racing thoughts
My racing thoughts

So I'll try to keep her steady now 
But steady's not her strong suit
I was raised going to church
But couldn't practice what they preached
And so I'm hiring a DJ for the 
Eve of our destruction, yeah
It was midnight I was mixed up when 
She found me on the beach

I think I'm running low on inspiration 
She's running long on borrowed time 
We break with speed
That girl can read my racing thoughts
She asks the questions
I take the floor, she takes her shots
Taught her a lesson about a forced confession 
We break with speed
That girl can read my racing thoughts

My racing thoughts
My racing thoughts

I think I'm running short on inspiration,
She's running long on borrowed time 
We break with speed, 
That girl can read my racing thoughts
She asks the questions
I take the floor, she takes her shots
Taught her a lesson about a forced confession
We break with speed 
That girl can read my racing thoughts

My racing thoughts
My racing thoughts
My racing thoughts
My racing thoughts
My racing thoughts

(She can read my, she can read my, 
She can read my racing thoughts)

Whoa, oh
(She can read my, she can read my, 
She can read my racing thoughts)

Whoa, oh
(She can read my, she can read my, 
She can read my racing thoughts)
