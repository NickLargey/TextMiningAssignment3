Truth shimmers like palaces in the sun
And your inventions will never be too far flung
Imagination's worthwhile taking
And gravitation, cause I don't want you to fall

I'll surprise you
Gliding through
I'll surprise you

Unbounded by languor or longitude
Everywhere is the center of someone's world
Panorama getting calmer
Senses warmer
I don't want us to fall

We'll be true
Never blue
We'll be true
