Take some beer and I
Take my girls
Come over to mine
Where you aint misunderstood.

Take my tunes and some
Crazy love
We’ll here all of it
Till morning dawns

And I’ve got my friends!

In the little house
In the little house
In the little house
It’s got me my home
It’s got me my time
Take me inside
It’s got me my home
In the little house

Love in the kitchen oh
Love on the floor
Drink after drink
Craving for more

Warm whiskey rocks
In a bowl
Where are the cups
That somebody sold

And I’ve got my friends!

In the little house
In the little house
In the little house
It’s got me my home
It’s got me my time
Take me inside
It’s got me my home
In the little house

Now I’ve got my
Piece of mind
It’s about time
For my unwind

Six o’clock or
Is it seven?
Who gives a shit?
Were in constant heaven
