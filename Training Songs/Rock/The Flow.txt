When a dream survives the longest night
And the vision takes a hold
When a breath inspires it's a sign of life
You're the string, and I'm the bow
Jump in the flow
Just get carried by the flow
Where the bank defines the water's edge
The river in my spine
As we circulate, maybe we shall collide
You're the space, and I am the time
Jump in the flow
We get carried by the flow
Through a sleep I ride
Feel like a night that shines
With a memory of long ago
We drank to them
Said goodbye as friends
We survive, we survive it so
Back in the flow
Carried by the flow
Just look how far you've been
Look how far you've come
All the things you've achieved
Don't try and find any reason
Get carried by it
Jump in the flow
