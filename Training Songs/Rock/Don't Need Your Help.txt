You're so fucking quick, to lend a hand, to take my side.
Now what do you know about me?
Just want to be a part of everything.
And I don't need your help, I'll do this shit myself.
When I was down and out, I never heard from any of you.
So I picked myself back up,
And my few true friends pulled me through.
You'll never take from me, you'll never gain from me.
So what the f*ck is in your heart?
That shit was empty from the start.
