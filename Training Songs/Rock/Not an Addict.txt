Oohoo (19x)
Breath it in and breath it out
and pass it on it's almost out
We're so creative and so much more
We're high above  but on the floor
Chorus1: It's not a habit  it's cool
I feel alive
If you don't have it your on
the other side
The deeper you stick it in your vein
The deeper the thoughts there's no more pain
I'm in heaven  I'm a god
I'm everywhere  I feel so hot
Chorus2: It's not a habit, it's cool
I feel alive
If you don't have it your on
the other side
I'm not an addict (maybe that's a lie)
Oohoo (8x)
It's over now, I'm cold, alone
I'm just a person on my own
Nothing means a thing to me
Oh, nothing means a thing to me
Chorus2
Free me, leave me
Watch me as I'm going down
Free me, see me
Look at me I'm falling
And I'm falling.........
It is not a habit, it is cool
I feel alive I feel.......
It is not a habit, it is cool
I feel alive
Chorus2
I'm not an addict, I'm not an addict, I'm not an addict.
