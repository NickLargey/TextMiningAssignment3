Some days won't end ever and some days pass on by
I'll be working here forever, at least until I die
Damned if you do, damned if you don't
I'm supposed to get a raise week, you know damn well I won't

Workin' for a livin'
(Workin')
Workin' for a livin'
(Workin')
Workin' for a livin', livin' and workin'
I'm taking what they're giving 'cause I'm workin' for a livin'

Hey I'm not complainin' 'cause I really need the work
Hittin' up my buddy's got me feelin' like a jerk
Hundred dollar car note, two hundred rent
I get a check on Friday, but it's all ready spent

Workin' for a livin'
(Workin')
Workin' for a livin'
(Workin')
Workin' for a livin', livin' and workin'
I'm takin' what they're givin' 'cause I'm workin' for a livin'

Whoa whoa, workin' for a livin'
Whoa whoa, takin' what they givin'
Whoa whoa, workin' for a livin'
Whoa whoa whoa

Bus boy, bartender, ladies of the night
Grease monkey, ex-junky, winner of the fight
Walkin' on the streets it's really all the same
Sellin' souls, rock 'n' roll, any other day

Workin' for a livin'
(Workin')
Workin' for a livin'
(Workin')
Workin' for a livin', livin' and workin'
I'm takin' what they're givin' 'cause I'm workin' for a livin'

Workin' for a livin', livin' and workin'
I'm takin' what they're givin' 'cause I'm workin' for a livin'
Workin' for a livin', livin' and workin'
