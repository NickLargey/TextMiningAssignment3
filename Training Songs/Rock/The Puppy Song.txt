Dreams are nothing more than wishes
And a wish's just a dream
You wish to come true, woah-oh

If only I could have a puppy
I'd call myself so very lucky
Just to have some company
To share a cup of tea with me
I'd take my puppy everywhere
La, la, la, la, I wouldn't care
Then we'll stay away from crowds
With signs that said "no dogs allowed"
Oh we, I know he'd never bite me
Up, la, la, la, la, la, ooh
We, I know he'd never bite me
Up, la, oh

If only I could have a friend
Who'll stick with me until the ned
And walk along beside the sea
To share a bit of moon with me
I'd take my friend most everywhere
La, la, la, la, I wouldn't care
And we'll stay away from crowds
With signs that said "no friends allowed"
Oh we, we'd be so happy to be
Up, la, la, la, la, la, ooh
We, we'd be so happy to be together

But dreams are nothing more than wishes
And a wish's just a dream you wish to come true
Whoa-whoa-ooh, ah, ah, ah
Dreams are nothing more than wishes (your wish will come true)
And a wish is just a dream (your wish will come true)
You wish to come true (your wish will come true)
(Your wish will come true, your wish will come true)
Woah-woah, ooh (your wish to come true, your wish will come through)
Dreams are nothing more than wishes (your wish will come true)
And a wish is just a dream (your wish will come true)
You wish to come true
(Your wish will come true, woah-woah, ooh)
