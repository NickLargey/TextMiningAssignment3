Everything I try to give you
Everything I try to do
There's no pleasing you
You want the stars in the morning
And the sun dead of night
You place immovable objects
In my plain sight

Well I'm giving you your freedom
Though I never owned you
Nor wanted to
Hey hey hey hey

You're free
Now enjoy your freedom
Don't call me up
For cheap advice
You're free
Make your own decisions
You live your life
And let me live mine

Never held out on affection
Gave you most material things
There's no pleasing you
You called me your lover
Did I treat you that bad
You really want me to suffer
But I can take so much

Well I'm giving you your freedom
Though I never owned you
Nor wanted to
Hey hey hey hey 

You're free
Now enjoy your freedom
Don't call me up
For cheap advice
You're free
Make your own decisions
You live your life
And let me live mine
Please
