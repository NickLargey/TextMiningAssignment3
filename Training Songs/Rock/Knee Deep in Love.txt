Hello sweet Joan so glad you're home
Just called to say goodbye
I'm leaving town I'm bent and bound
Don't try to change my mind
You ask me why I'm leaving
But we both know the reason

(chorus)
You're knee deep in love
Guess it's over and done for us, you and me
You're knee deep in love
But I'm not the one
I'm not the one I know

Isn't it strange how people change
And slowly drift apart like you and me
It had to be I've known it from the start
You're trying not to show it
But in my heart I know it

(chorus)

It's in the way you hold me
And in the lies you've told me
Everything I do seems to
Annoy you and displease you
You never share your laughter
And on the morning after
You try to sweep me under your rug
You don't have to say it

(chorus)
