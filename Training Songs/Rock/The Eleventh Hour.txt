Trace the shape of my heart, till it becomes more familiar to your eyes.
I've been lost without you, cold without your love.
It's taken days and nights to make me realize.

Rescue me from waiting on this line.
I won't give up on giving you the chance to blow my mind.
Let the eleventh hour quickly pass me by.
I'll find you when I think I'm out of time.

Take the place of my heart, till I become a stranger to my life.
I've been down without you, wrong without your love.
In time will I be what you're thinking of?

In time will I be what you're thinking of?
