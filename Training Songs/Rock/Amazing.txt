I feel sweet
Do you feel sweet?
It's amazing
I have no skin
And I feel everything
It's amazing
I feel good
When you feel good
I knew I would
And it's amazing
I've wanted this for so long
Now the deed has been done
We shall rise with the sun
And spend our time as one

Now there is no sin
In anything
And it's amazing
I love life
I hope you do too
'Cause I love everything
It's all amazing
I feel you
Do you feel you?
I understand
When they say we're born again
'Cause I feel born again
I'm born again
And it's amazing
And it's the best thing
And it's glorious
It's life changing
This feeling
Is amazing
It's the best thing
It's glorious
It's life changing

This feeling

This feeling
Oh lord this feeling
It's amazing
It's in the stars
In the sun
It's everywhere
In everyone
And it will be every day
From now on
From now on
We are one
And it's amazing
It's in the stars
In the sun
It's everywhere
In everyone
And it will be every day
From now on
From now on
We are one
And it's amazing
It's in the stars
In the sun
It's everywhere
In everyone
And it will be every day
From now on
From now on
We are one
And it's amazing
