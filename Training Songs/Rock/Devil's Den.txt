There is no color in the King 
And he is softer than the Queen 
Confusion reigns, sometimes it reigns. 

Now a colored sky never makes anybody cry 
But a grey cloud always makes it rain, sometimes it rains. 

He only has the moves of a knight 
But he wants the absolute freedom of a Queen 
Too bad the only money he's got is coming in 
Colored American green. 

You know it's worthless paper you can spend or save 
Go ahead and count that by yourself but look out 
Somebody's looking 
You're supposed to do that by yourself - count it 
He says he's not doing anything wrong he thinks 
He's just another part of the royal story 
But does it always have to start that way 
Always ending someday 
With no man's warning. 

Don't talk back, some ruler says, or everything 
You need will go away 
Every answer you think you've ever said is just a guess 
And the King of clocks just slowly locks up every day. 

Clocks strikes damn near perfect at night 
But it moves so slow in the morning light 
King says a crown doesn't make the man 
But we all know, yes we all know, he thinks he's born to glory. 

Until he dies by the divine right of Kings 
No one down here wants to give that man any golden wings 
And man must fly, man must fly 
Is that grey man sane 
No color, no name.
