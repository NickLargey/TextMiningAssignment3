There's a light on that covers the blue,
And I want to be closer to you,
And she's smiling and waving goodbye.
Who'd have thought that I'd ever ask why?

And she's waving goodbye with that photograph smile,
Under the heavenly blue.
I'm never gonna be closer again.
I'll never know...
I'll never feel you, ever again.

And I wait, sitting here by the phone,
With the hope that your heart isn't stone.
And I wish that you'd call me and cry,
So I'd know how you feel deep inside.

And she's waving goodbye with that photograph smile,
Under the heavenly blue.
I'm never gonna be closer again.
I'll never know...
I'll never feel you, ever again.

Heavenly voice, won't you guide me?
Help me, I'm falling too deep.

And she's waving goodbye with that photograph smile.
I'm still in love with that photograph smile.
Please don't deny me;
I've waited so long.
Waited so long...
I want to feel you; feel you again.
