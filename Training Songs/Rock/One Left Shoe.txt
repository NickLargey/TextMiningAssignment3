Tennis shoe strung 'cross the telephone wire
The sun creeps up on my empire
Tin foil castle, bubble gum crown
Me and my minions make the rounds

I'm lonely without you
Just like one left shoe
I'm lonely
Without you

Under the spotlight a neon kiss
Carnival barkers preen and twist
Three for a quarter, one for a dime
This broken heart general store is open all the time

I'm lonely without you
Just like one left shoe
I'm lonely
Without you

I'm a little cocoon just blooming for you
I take a deep breath, the day is new
I'm brave, I'm a hero
The world's bright and clear
But my insides shrivel when you're not here

Newspapers piled on my front porch
The sun's winding up, it's starting to scorch
The air is dust, my lung's are hot
I keep making love to what is not
I'm lonely without you
Just like one left shoe
I'm lonely
Without you
