I was talking to Larry
The scene was really hairy
We were sitting in the dark
What you don´t see you don´t know
He said this town is getting kinda scary
Pretty soon comes the big fall
He said he´s gotta get away
Go Larry, get away
I just saw Suzie by coincidence
I thought she looked really healthy
She said she´s feeling pretty queasy
She said she hasn´t been very lucky
Her life is all fucked up
She said she´s gotta get away
Go Suzie, get away
Have you seen Mitchell
Got a call from him in jail
He asked if I could post the bail
Busted and strung out
He said he´s feeling really sick
Really sick
He said he´s gotta get away
Go Mitchell, get away
Go go get away
