Hear me now like you did back then
With an underground feeling and a solid goal -oh
So feel me now like you did back then
With an overgrown healing tried sealing my soul
Got so scared got so tired
Doin everything wrong doing everything right
Got two guitars to play my songs
Got many rights to kill my wrongs
Got a smile that'll knock you down
I got friends who will follow me
And I don't own responsibility 
And I know what I am
And I know that I'm right
Yeah yeah yeah
My arms are reachin out to let you go
I tried to rock you but you only can roll
The ink you spilt across my skin (yeah)
Is sinkin deeper within
I was wrong to put you up there
With a ton of dead heroes
And a ton of dead songs
But you came to me like a casual dream
Slow to begin
Put a smile on my skin
Got a head full of new ideas
I got music bleeding from my ears
And people who believe in me
I got miles and miles of things to see
Nothin relates to you and me
And I know what I am 
And I know that I'm right
Yeah yeah yeah
My arms are reachin out to let you go
I tried to rock you but you only can roll
The ink you spilt across my skin (yeah)
Is sinkin deeper within
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(1 2 3 4)
My arms are reachin out to let you go
I tried to rock you but you only can roll
The ink you spilt across my skin (yeah)
Is sinkin deeper within
(repeat)
