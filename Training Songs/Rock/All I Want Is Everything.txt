There is a drug on the market
They claim will satisfy
But I tried them already
And they just don't gratify

There ain't no drug ever made
Ever gonna pacify me
'Cause all I want is everything
All I want is everything
All I want is everything, everything

Forty-second street has so many devices
But very little I haven't tried
Newspapers drool at a mouthful of vices
Headlined in the classifieds

They say there's a limit to endurance
I know that I haven't reached mine
All I want is everything
All I want is everything

And I know that it's just my obsession
Makes me scurry like a rat in a maze
And I know it's becoming an addiction
I Need it now, right now, right now

Strong arm tactics have come into fashion
The muscle boys are back in style
They shatter the bones of descension
And never crack a smile

Well, if that's the way breaks are gotten
You know I'm gonna give it a try

All I want is everything
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
All I want, all I want, all I want is everything
Just give me everything
I don't want much, I just want it all, want it all
Everything, everything, everything, everything
