Winter's slowing down
Nothing is really earned or gained by prolonging this
I'm high above the ground
On a windmill pointing out the sights of the country
In a corner of the barn, the pickup rusted out
By too many years
I can see your mouth is moving
You are saying something
Probably asking us to come down

There is something so nice about
Driving down here with you
Please just a few more hours
I don't wanna drive back to town just yet
'Cause the sun sets late this time of year
And I've been deprived of it for so many months
I'll bet my face will burn
But I ain't even concerned about it
No, no, no, no, not one bit, 'cause we're

Walking under green leaves at last
Walking under green leaves at last

There's something so nice about driving down here with you
Please just a few more hours, I don't wanna drive back to town yet

Day is winding down
Nothing is really earned or gained by denying this
Thanks for the few more hours
You sleep now, I'm feeling alright to drive
'Cause the sun sets late this time of year
And I've been deprived of it for so many months
It's leaving me again
I don't wanna miss one minute of it
No, no, no, no, not tonight

Chorus
