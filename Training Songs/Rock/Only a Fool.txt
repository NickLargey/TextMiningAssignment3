Called you up on the telephone
Friday night and you're not alone
You're not alone
Well that's fine for you
What am I supposed to do
Hang around and wait for you
I'll wait for you
Like so many times before
  
Only a fool would let ya get away
With the things you do
And the things you say
Only a fool
Only a fool like me
 
Growin' up's been hard for you
I should know, growin' up with you
I've been there too
Me and you
Spent a year in Hollywood
Checked it out but it ain't no good
In Hollywood
What did you expect to find
 
Only a fool would let ya get away
With the things you do
And the things you say
Only a fool
Only a fool like me
 
And hey, I don't believe
Most of what I hear
Sometimes I don't believe what I see
But maybe if we try
A little bit harder
Time and circumstance
Will conspire in our direction

Only a fool would let ya get away
With the things you do
And the things you say
Only a fool
Only a fool like me
