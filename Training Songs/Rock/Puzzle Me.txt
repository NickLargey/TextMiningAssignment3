There it is, I can see
The little picture perfect me
I have tried, using force
But it always ends up tragically
So I stay the way I am
Just a crooked little outline
I'm whole, then not, and back again
Wondering when I'll ever find
Someone who will take the time

Puzzle me
Spread my heart out on your floor
The pieces now are yours to put in place
Rearrange, 'cause I'm scattered, undefined
Hanging on by borderlines
'Till you complete
You puzzle me

Pick me up, lay me down
Your touch, it has turned me round
Over time, patiently
All the little clues you found
Have sharpened up to show
You've pulled me together
We fit and we both know
Everything is better now
Everything is better

Puzzle me
Spread my heart out on your floor
The pieces now are yours to put in place
Rearrange, cause I'm scattered, undefined
Hanging on by borderlines
'Till you complete
You puzzle me

And everything about me, suddenly made clear
The empty spaces disappear

Puzzle me
Spread my heart out on your floor
The pieces now are yours to put in place
Rearrange, cause I'm scattered, undefined
Hanging on by borderlines
'Till you complete

Puzzle me
Spread my heart out on your floor
The pieces now are yours to put in place
Rearrange, cause I'm scattered, undefined
Hanging on by borderlines
'Till you complete
You puzzle me
