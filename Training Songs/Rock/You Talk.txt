You talk, you talk a good game
I wish I could talk the same
And a song is just a game
I'm getting good at cheating

That's how you talk
Ah yes, you talk a good game
Won't you teach me the same?
I would love to explain
I love to show your hand and all about

Oh well, I know, I know, I know
I know it's wrong and so and so
So what, I suppose it's got to go out

I never ever said it was clever
I just like getting leathered
Looking for the light
Light behind your eyes

Well, you talk, you talk a good game
I wish I could talk the same
And a song is just a game
I'm getting good at cheating

Utah, remember Utah in the rain
And those little red shoes
And some kid with the blues
Who gets right on your tits
You just grin and bear it

Yeah, I know, I know, I know
I know it's wrong and so and so and so
And so it's got to go out

I never ever said it was clever
I just like getting leathered
I'm looking for the light
Light behind your eyes

Bevan, he drops stones from heaven
L O are D forever
And the love, the love behind your eyes

You talk, you talk a good game
You talk, you talk a good game
You talk, you talk a good game
You talk, you talk a good game

Well, I never ever said it was clever
I just like getting leathered
Looking for the light
Behind your eyes

Bevan, he drops stones from heaven
L O are D forever
And the love behind your eyes
