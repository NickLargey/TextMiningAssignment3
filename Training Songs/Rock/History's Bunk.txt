What I'd like to hear desert people's history
Not the styles of strategic combat
We could lose our bent we hear about
They weren't the ones to get it in the neck
Fighting it out for some other's causes
They're invisible they didn't exist!
History's bunk our government
In the future will they make more junk?
What I'd like to hear tales of people's history
Fighting it out for some other's causes
They're invisible they didn't exist!
There are no lessons in the past x6
