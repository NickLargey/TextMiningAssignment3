I always believed that if I ran off to India
Wore sandals and shaved my head
And used Body shop conditioner, and incense like crazy
I could call myself a spirit head
But I only went to India to look on top
I wore sandals cause I'd smoked all my money
And I shaved off all my hair cause I had the fleas
I'd been sleeping all over
And the Body shop conditioner was a present from a friend
And the incense used to hide the smell
Of the drug den that I lay in

And so I ask myself what my motives are
For this lying need to look so free
And if I tell myself real honestly
What more can I admit to, open up a door
He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for
He said I'd find out soon
I got too much Saturn and not enough Moon

I always believed that if I never missed a Yoga class
Read my horoscope in the dailies
And recycle bottles, and know a Red Indian
I could call myself a spirit man
But I was only doing Yoga cause I fancied the teacher
And stars cause it looked good on paper
And I only went to church cause my granny gave me money
When confession was over
And I only knew the Indian cause his brother's a dealer
And bottles had a price on their return
So I could go and play, Oh my my

And so I ask myself what my motives are
For this lying need to look so free
And if I tell myself real honestly
What more can I admit to, open up a door
He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for
He said I'd find out soon
I got too much Saturn and not enough Moon

So now that you know why I don't love you
And now that you see that I'm so scared
Am I a good man ?
Am I a deep deep man ?

What more can I admit to, open up a door
He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for
He said I'd find out soon
I got too much Saturn
How can I admit it, open up a door
He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for
He said I'd find out soon
I got too much Saturn and not enough Moon
