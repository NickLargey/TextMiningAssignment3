I be a man, kinda mystery man
Be a doll, be a baby doll
It can't be fun, not anyway
It can't be found no way at all
A distant man can't sympathise
He can't uphold his distant laws
Due to form on that today
I got a feeling then I hear this call

I said neat neat neat
She can't afford no cannon
Neat neat neat
She can't afford no gun at all
Neat neat neat
She can't afford no cannon
Neat neat neat
She ain't got no name to call
Neat neat neat

No crime if there ain't no law
No cops left to mess you around
No more dreams of mystery chords
No more sight to bring you down
I got a crazy got a thought in my mind
My mind's on when she falls asleep
Feelin' fine in her restless time
Then these words upon me creep

I said neat neat neat
She can't afford no cannon
Neat neat neat
She can't afford no gun at all
Neat neat neat
She can't afford no cannon
Neat neat neat
She ain't got no name to call
Neat neat neat
