I want the people to know
 That He saved my soul
 But I still like to listen to the radio
 They say that rock and roll is wrong, we'll give you more chance
 I say I feel so good I gotta get up and dance 
 I know what's right, I know what's wrong and I don't confuse it
 Why should the devil have all the good music
 I feel good every day
 'Cause Jesus is the Rock and He rolled my blues away 
 Well now they say to cut my hair
 They're driving me insane
 I grew it out long to make room for my brain
 But sometimes people don't understand
 What's a good boy doing in a rock and roll band 
 There's nothing wrong with playing blues licks
 But if you got a reason tell me to my face
 Why should the devil have all the good music
 There's nothing wrong with what we play
 'Cause Jesus is the Rock and He rolled my blues away 
 Roll 'em away now! 
 I ain't knocking the hymns
 Just give me a song that has a beat
 No I ain't knocki8ng the hymns
 Give me a song that moves my feet 
 Jesus told the Truth
 Jesus showed the Way
 There's one more thing I'd like to say
 They nailed Him to a cross
 And they laid Him in the ground
 But they shoulda known they can't keep a Good Man down 
 And I feel good every day
 I refuse to lose it
 All I want to I know from all of you is
 Why should the devil have all the good music
 ''cause I been filled I feel okay because Jesus is the Rock and He rolled all my blues
 Jesus is the Rock and He rolled all my blues
 Jesus is the Rock and He rolled all my blues
