Well now baby's gone out of control 
Body and soul 
She got to cut loose living only for the sound 
Of the baddest sounds around 
And baby's spent all of her dough 
On countin' on clothes 
Every look every fashion that comes on strong 
Baby just wants to belong 
She can't dance 
She can't sing 
But she's got to be part of that pop music thing 
Well now baby's only trying to lose 
All of her blues 
Down in her heart 'cause she's only seventeen 
And she means to cause a scene 
She can't dance, she can't sing 
She can't dance, she can't sing 
But she's got to part of that bang bang head bang music 
She moves to the radio 
Every night and day I can hear her say
