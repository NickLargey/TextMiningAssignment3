Down in the jungle
Feeling very fat
You better hit the floor
and give me twenty
And the girls sing
Shackshoowowboomlaggalagga
Boom lagga boom sha boom
Do it til you're sore
Shackshoowowboomlaggalagga
Boom lagga boom sha boom
I know what you're looking for
Heavens where you find it
So sit back and relax
I wouldn't be so sure
'Cause we need plenty
And the girls sing girls sing
Shackshoowowboomlaggalagga
Boom lagga boom sha boom
Do it til you're sore
Shackshoowowboomlaggalagga
Boom lagga boom sha boom
I know what you're looking for
Rough stuff when a man's got to do
What a man's got to do
What a man's got to do oh yeah
Rough stuff when the time is right
And the place you go to whale
You gotta put something down
How far can you get
And still come back alive?
You never hear the shot
The shot that gets you
And the girls sing girls sing
