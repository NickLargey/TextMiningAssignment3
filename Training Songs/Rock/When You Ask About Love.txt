Don't cry on my shoulder
Rely on someone who's older
I don't know what to tell you
When you ask about love.
I think I know what's wrong with you
I've been going steady too long with you
I don't know what to tell you
When you ask about love
What you feel for me is infatuation
And it all started back during summer-vacation
Someone else needs my attention
And I can't go steady with you no more
Don't cry on my shoulder

What you feel for me is infatuation

Don't cry on my shoulder

I think I know what's wrong with you

I don't know
Don't know what to tell you
I don't know
Don't know what to tell you
