Head into the sun, you ain't the only one 
To miss the last train back to your life 
Head into the sun all that the night has done 
Will fade if you hang on really tight 
There's always reasons from down the road 
Every time it snows 
You know it's so easy to take the time to grow 
You know this flight is 

Heading into the sun riding a little bit higher 
We are one (we are one)
Just begun song of the sun 

Head into the sun, you ain't the only one 
To blow the first few bars of the tune 
Head into the sun all that the night has done 
Will fade if you move on really soon 
There's always reasons for putting on the wheels 
Every time it's real 
You know it's easy to get into the feel 
You know this flight is 

Heading into the sun riding a little bit higher 
We are one (we are one) 
Just begun song of the sun
