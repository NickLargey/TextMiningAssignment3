Oh, pretty baby. Why do we fight?
Oh, we tear it apart, every night.
Give me one reason. One reason to stay.
While we search for words that we will never say.

Take me to your jungle baby, we can be alone.
Our love is precious. It ain't no battle zone.
We were tamin' the wild nights. 
We put it all out on the line.
We were gonna get it right.
If it took the rest of our lives.
There was only one reason.
One reason to fight.
We were tamin' the wild nights.

Oh, sweet heartache, exciting the flame.
Oh, we could put it out but we'd never be the same.
Give me one reason. One reason to stay.
While we search for words that we will never say.

Take me to your jungle baby, we can be alone.
Our love is precious babe. It ain't no battle zone.
We were tamin' the wild nights. 
We put it all out on the line.
We were gonna get it right.
If it took the rest of our lives.
There was only one reason.
One reason to fight.
We were tamin' the wild nights.

Make no apologies when your body's in my hands.
Why do we tear it out? I'll never understand,
'Cause it feels good! Yeah!

We were tamin' the wild nights. 
We put it all out on the line.
We were gonna get it right.
If it took the rest of our lives.
There was only one reason.
One reason to fight.
We were tamin' the wild nights
