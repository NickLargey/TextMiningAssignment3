More things than you have time for
More dreams than you can use
They fill up all the sky
And fall into your eyes
Which ones today?

It looks like somebody here is dreaming
Funny things hanging in the air
Some have names
Some have numbers
Some are empty
And it's hard not to stare

More things than you have time for
More dreams than you can use
They fill up all the sky
And fall into your eyes
Which ones today?

It's getting pretty crowded here just lately
They pile up to the ceiling, wall to wall
Some are games
Some are phrases
Some are crazy
Why you keep your dreams to yourself?

More things than you have time for
More dreams than you can use
They fill up all the sky
And fall into your eyes
Which ones today?

Look out, here they come
More, more, more
More love
More, more, more
More money
More, more, more
More everything
More, more, more
More love
