There's a taste in my mouth that I never had before
To be a cheater, defeater, are things I won't ignore
Like a rat in a trap your head got in the way
Nothing left of you but a memory of a bad lay

[Chorus]
Heads gonna roll (heads gonna roll)
I'm back in control (back in control)
It's a jungle out there it's gonna eat you up and strip you bare
I'll swallow you whole (swallow you whole)
Then spit out your soul (spit out your soul)
I want to make this clear, my dear that heads will roll

There's a look in your eyes, am I the one you dread?
You make me wonder what's going on inside your head (inside your head)
You lie and you slither like a cold-blooded snake
I'll make you pay for your big mistake

[Chorus]

When I think of you, I think of this
And then it turns to bitterness
I'm praying for amnesia, I beg for anesthesia

Forget the lies, and numb the pain
If this don't stop I'll go insane
The more I hurt, the more I'll curse your name

[Chorus]
