There she goes, on down the beach
Just like the moon, she's out of reach
Losing my mind, already lost my girl
Blew the top right off my pretty world

CHORUS
Oh, she used to be mine
She used to be mine
She used to be mine
She used to be mine
‘Til I saw her with another man (‘nother man)
‘Til I saw her with another man (hand in hand)
‘Til I saw her with another man (‘nother man)
‘Til I saw her with another man (hand in hand)

Oh, there she goes, on out of my life
She's my ex, thought she'd be my wife
Kept my ring, my wedding band
Keeps it on the same finger but on the other hand

CHORUS

I can taste her mouth
Taste her tears 
I can hear what she used to say
She'd be looking up from her coffee cup
And through the steam I can see her glance away
I miss her hand on my hip
Tongue on my lips 
Lips on my cup of tea
I miss the way she'd lie
And the way she'd sigh 
When she'd lie right down
Just next to me

CHORUS

She used to be mine [x8]

She used to be mine
Oh, oh she used to be mine
Ooh, oh oh, yeah-eah
Saw her with another man, saw her with another man
Saw her with another man, saw her with another man
Saw her with another man, saw, till I saw her with a
Till I saw her with another man hand in hand
