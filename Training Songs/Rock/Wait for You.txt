Come tomorrow, one day closer to your heart
Lost around me, is time in itself when you're near
Take the time, I'll show you the lover for you
You're too young, to know what it is that I feel

All that I can do is wait for you just wait for you
All that I can do is wait for you just wait for you

Full of sorrow, your eyes are too wide and too new
Though I know these feelings I get when you're near
Even I, I can't give you love without fear
You're too young, I don't know what's keeping me here

All that I can do is wait for you just wait for you
All that I can do is wait for you just wait for you

All that I can do is wait for you just wait for you
All that I can do is wait for you just wait for you
All that I can do, ohh, ohh
