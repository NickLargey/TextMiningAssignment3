Never before have I turned on you
You looked too good to me
Your beady eyes, they can cut me in two
And I just can't let you be
It's a free-for-all and I heard it said
You can bet your life
Stakes are high and so am I
It's in the air toni-i-ight

I see you there with your Cheshire grin
I got my eyes on you
Shake your tail feathers in my face
And there's no tellin' what I'll do
Well looky here, you sweet young thing
The magic's in my hands
When in doubt I whip it out
I got me a rock 'n' roll band
It's a free-for-all

Here we go, look out below

I'm on the prowl tonight
When it's said and done I have my fun
I can chew anything I bite
Come one, come all to a midnight ball
The invitation's there
I come alone and I'm drivin' home
I'm healthy, I do declare
It's a free-for-all

Never before have I turned on you
You looked too good to me
Your beady eyes, they can cut me in two
And I just can't let you be
Well, it's a free-for-all and I heard it said
You can bet your life
Stakes are high and so am I
It's in the air tonight
It's a free-for-all!
