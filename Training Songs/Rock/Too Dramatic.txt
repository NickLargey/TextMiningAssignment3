On my black feet, I
Run with all my heart
To black shores and rivers
In spite of all I fear

You're too dramatic
I don't understand it

Don't listen when you're weary, oh but
I wanna talk about it
You and me weren't made for that
I'm sure
Not in my house
It doesn't stop for you
It doesn't stop for

'Cause you're too dramatic
I don't understand it
Out of this static
'Cause you're too dramatic

You know I couldn't live here that way
You said it before
He left Cincinnati just 16
Had his fill, boy
And though I guess
That there's nothing honest
Honest
All that matters
Is that

'Cause you're too dramatic
I don't understand it
Out of this static
'Cause you're too dramatic

But the people I knew
Don't matter to me anymore

'Cause you're too dramatic
I don't understand it
You're too dramatic
I don't understand it
Out of this static
'Cause you're too dramatic
