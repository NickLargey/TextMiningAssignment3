Why won't you listen,
When I speak?
Why won't you listen, 
When I stamp my feet?
You don't belong where the humans eat
You don't belong, 
Don't belong to me.

I have been working
All fucking day,
You lie there sleeping
Your life away.
You don't belong where the humans eat,
You don't belong,
Don't belong to me.

I just fed you 
And your fat brother,
So why are you now still 
Yelling at me?
You don't belong where the humans eat
You don't belong 
Don't belong to me,
You don't belong where the humans eat
You don't belong,
Don't belong to me.
