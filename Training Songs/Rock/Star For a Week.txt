Anxious mother pleads, come home, dino
I can't believe that's my boy they're talking about
His dreams are in his motor-cycle
Swears he's gonna sort 'em out
He's going barefoot like the man with no name
Gonna break into a bank, if he surrendered
Imagine the shame

I just wanna be someone, anyone, but I wanna be a
Star for a week or two
Just wanna be someone,anyone
I'd be complete if I could be a star for a week

Across the country he's been stealing cars
Playing cat and mouse like a hero on d-day
Shoeless boy, this is shotgun baby
Running from the law like it's a holiday
He's a good boy in his heart, but a fool
Don't wanna be a fugitive, he'd rather be at home
Or in school

I just wanna be someone, anyone, but I wanna be a
Star for a week or two
Just wanna be someone,anyone
I'd be complete if I could be a star for a week

Everywhere, he reads give up, dino
We wanna know what's this death-wish
You're talking about
He's cold, he's hungry and he's scared
He's got his father in his mind, and this message to get
Out, I wanna steal, wanna give, wanna die, wanna live,
Wanna find my own identity like any other teenage kid

I just wanna be someone, anyone, but I wanna be a
Star for a week or two
Just wanna be someone,anyone
I'd be complete if I could be a star for a week
