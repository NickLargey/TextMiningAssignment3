One thing I never can get
Can't put my fingers on it
Always forgetting my lines
One thing I never can get
Displacing logic in the memory banks of my mind 

I find myself in the strangest places
My head's got a mind, said a mind of it's own
I find myself in the strangest places
I wake up I've been sleeping in somebody's shoes 

This is the last of all my songs
Got to get, to get you in the back of the room
You're one thing I never can get
Can't put my fingers on it
Always forgetting my lines 

I find myself in the strangest places
My head's got a mind, said a mind of it's own
I find myself in the strangest places
I wake up I've been sleeping in somebody's room 

I find myself in the strangest places
My head's got a mind, said a mind of it's own
I find myself in the strangest places
I wake up I've been sleeping in somebody's shoes 

I find myself in the strangest places
My head's got a mind, said a mind of it's own
I find myself in the strangest places
I wake up I've been sleeping in somebody's shoes 

I find myself in the strangest places
My head's got a mind, said a mind of it's own
I find myself in the strangest places
I wake up I've been sleeping in somebody's shoes
