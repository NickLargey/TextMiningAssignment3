They cried the tears, they shed the fears,
Up and down the land,
They stole guitars or used guitars
So the tape would understand,
Without even the slightest hope of a thousand sales
Just as if, as if there was, a Hitsville in U.K.,
I know the boy was all alone, til the Hitsville hit U.K.

They say true talent will always emerge in time,
When lightening hits small wonder 
Its fast rough factory trade,
No expense accounts, or lunch discounts
Or hyping up the charts,
The band went in, 'n knocked 'em dead, in 2 min. 59

- No slimy deals, with smarmy eels - in Hitsville U.K.
Lets shake'n say, we'll operate - in Hitsville U.K.
The mutants, creeps and musclemen,
Are shaking like a leaf,
It blows a hole in the radio,
When it hasn't sounded good all week,
A mike'n boom, in your living room - in Hitsville U.K.
No consumer trials, or A.O.R., in Hitsville U.K.,
Now the boys and girls are not alone,
Now the Hitsville's hit U.K.
