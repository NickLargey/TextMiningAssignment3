Hey Matilda Matilda Matilda
She take my money and run Venezuela

Five hundred dollars friends I lost
Poor man even sell my cab and horse
Matilda she take my money and run Venezuela

Well the money was to buy my house and land
Then she got a serious plan
Matilda she take my money and run Venezuela

Well the money was just inside my bed
Stuck up in the pilow beneath my head
Matilda she take my money and run Venezuela

Well my friends never to love again
All my money gone in vain
Matilda she take my money and run Venezuela
