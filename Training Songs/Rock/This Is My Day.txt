Look at the starry skies
To see what we can find
You never know just what
Just what we left behind
But when you know for sure
Will you help me out?

This is my day
The only day
The only night i stay
This is my day
The only day
The only night i stay

Look at your starry eyes
The beauty of your mind
If i kissed you once
Love will make you blind
But when you know for sure
Will you help me out

This is my day
The only night
The only night i stay
This is my day
The only day
The only night i stay
This is my day
The only day
The only night i stay
This is my day
The only day
The only night i stay

Look for me when you dream
Or when you're all alone
Let's look at where we've been
The future is unknown
But when you know for sure
Will you help me out

This is my day
The only day
The only night i stay
This is my day
The only day
The only night i stay
This is my day
The only day
The only night i stay
This is my day
The only night
The night you let me stay
This is my day
Let me stay
