How long can we wait
To say goodbye?
The words once they're spoken
Our words that we can't take

Back to where we were before
Things got in the way
Life gets so confusing
When you know what you're losing

You, me, why can't we see
That there's more to love
Than we'll ever know?
Sometimes you're closer
When you're letting go

I wish the best for you
I wish the best for you

We'll both regret the hurting
That we will do
You'll learn to forget me
And I?ll try, I?ll try to forget

You, me, why can't we see
That there's more to love
Than we'll ever know?
Sometimes you're closer
When you're letting go

I wish the best for you
I wish the best

If you ever need a place
That you can run to
I?ll be here, I?ll be here

You, me, why can't we see
That there's more to love
Than we'll ever know?
Sometimes you're closer
When you're letting go

I wish the best for you
I wish the best for you
