Come a little closer
Baby it's alright
Maybe we can start 
A little fire tonight
Pull the shades, lock the door
Don't waste my time girl,
You'd better be sure

Cause I know what I want
And I know how to get it 
So baby if you're ready to play

[Chorus:]
Let's get naughty naughty
Dirty dirty
Naughty naughty
Oh, I like it that way

That dress you're wearing 
Makes you look so cute
But girl you'd look better 
In your birthday suit
Take my hand, feel my love
Tonight's the night we're gonna 
Shake it up, shake it up

Cause I know what you want
And you're gonna get it
So baby if you're ready to play

[Chorus]
Let's get naughty naughty
Dirty dirty
Naughty naughty
Oh, I like it that way

Cause you know what I want
And I'm gonna get it
So baby if you're ready to play
Step this way

[Chorus]
Let's get naughty naughty
Dirty dirty
Naughty naughty
Oh, I like it that way

Let's get naughty naughty
Dirty dirty
Naughty naughty
Oh, I like it, I like it
I like it that way
Hey, hey, hey
I like it that way
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, naughty naughty
