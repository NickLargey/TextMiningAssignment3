The best and the worst of me at the same time.
Make a tin can with strings to you.
Let you know I really mean it all.
And the more I say it the more I just sound
Like a carnival barker yelling, selling art.

Just don't worry about looking dumb.
I do it all the time, it's actually pretty fun
And whatever, it's overblown, as relative as
Hot and cold and good and bad and young and old.

Do anything, there's no wrong it's all right.
This is what I've wanted to say this whole time.

I wish for you what I wish for me.
The flashlight, the means, the reason, the medium.
I will say this, will you listen?
If you don't listen, I don't mind.
I'll still say it if you don't listen.
If you don't listen, I don't mind.
This is what I've wanted to say this whole time.
