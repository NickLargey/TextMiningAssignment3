Now Keely waits it out
Well she's only young enough for somethings
Healing the sick and dumb
In low on the radar, the smoking gun
Weâ€™re moving fast enough to function
Fast enough to function
Maybe it's me 'cause
I seem to think in twos and threes

So find your open door
In through the skin-tight sound
And keep that love underground

Busy scenery
So transfixed on transparent things
An eye for her tiger a bee for her bloom
She crosses her fingers and crosses the room

So catch your salted tears
Before they hit the ground
And keep that love underground
