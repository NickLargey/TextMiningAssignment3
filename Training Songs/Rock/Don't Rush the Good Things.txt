Bought me a bottle of wine
We're gonna share it tonight
It's my favorite vintage
Gonna make us feel all right

(chorus)
Don't rush the food things
Don't rush the good things in life
It's a slow job falling in love
Don't rush the good things tonight

You & me baby, no need to hurry tonight
We've got all the time in the world
To get it right, get it right, get it right
I'm gonna sip it slowly
Not gonna knock it back
I'm no historian, but I've learned on thing from the past

(repeat chorus)
