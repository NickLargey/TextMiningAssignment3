I was walking down the street the other day
Who did I meet?

I met a friend of mine and he did say
"Man, I can smell your feet a mile away."

Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away

I met a friend of mine and he did say
"Man, I can smell your breath a mile away."

Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away
Smile away...
