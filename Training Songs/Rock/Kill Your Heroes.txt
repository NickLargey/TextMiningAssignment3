Well I met an old man dying on a train.
No more destination, no more pain.
Well he said one thing, before I graduate
"Never let your fear decide your fate."

I say ya kill your heroes and fly, fly, baby don't cry.
No need to worry 'cause, everybody will die.
Every day we just go, go, baby don't go.
Don't you worry we love you more than you know.

Well the sun one day will
Leave us all behind.
Unexplainable sightings
In the sky.
Well I hate to be
The one to ruin the night.
Right before your, right before your eyes.

I say ya kill your heroes and fly, fly, baby don't cry.
No need to worry 'cause, everybody will die.
Every day we just go, go, baby don't go.
Don't you worry we love you more than you know.
