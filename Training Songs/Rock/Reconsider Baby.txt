Oh I hate to see you go.
So long,
Oh I hate to see you go.
And the way that I will miss you,
I guess you will never know.

We've been together so long

To have to separate this way.
I'm gonna let you go ahead on now baby,
Pray that you'll come back home someday.

But now I guess you've changed your mind.
You said you once had loved me,
But now I guess you've changed your mind.
Why don't you reconsider baby?
Give yourself just a little more time.
