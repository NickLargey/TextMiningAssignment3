You don't know love like you used to.
You don't feel love like you did before.

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh!

You ran with the dead today,
With the moles from the CIA,
They see more than you ever see.

Headlights in your rear view mirror,
A panther's eyes as he preys on fear,
You hunt for love, you electioneer.

Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!

You ran with the dead today,
Through the cemeteries where ghosts still play,
The more you ran, love got further away.

One look an I sore inside,
Every little thing you've died to hide,
You were the truth when you lied.

Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!

You don't know love like you used to,
You don't feel love like you did before.
You don't feel love like you used to,
You don't feel love like you did before.

Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhhhh!

You don't know love like you used to,
You don't feel love like you did before.
Ahh You don't know love like you used to,
You don't feel love like you did before.
Ahh You don't know love like you used to,
You don't feel love like you did before.
Now you don't know love like u used to,
You don't feel love like you did before.

You don't know love like you used to.
