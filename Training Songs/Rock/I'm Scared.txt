I'm scared, Lord I'm scared, I'm terrified
Never been much on religion
But I sure enough would like to hear the call
Said I'm scared Lordy Lord, I'm shakin', I'm petrified
Never been much on religion
But I sure enough just fell down on my knees

Heard the choir singin'
Something about good will toward men
And even sleepin' in heavenly peace
Stopped by to see Saint Thomas
On a cold and dreary New York afternoon
Something in the air was oh so rare
I don't know what it was
But I know that it's still right there

And I'm scared...

Living in confusion
Searching for truth that I never found
I needed something to really believe
Looked toward the heavens
On a dark and stormy winter afternoon
Something in the air was oh so rare
I'm not really sure what it was
But I know for sure that it's still right there

And I'm scared...

I'm scared, you know I'm shakin'
I'm layin' awake thinkin' about it now
I'm terrified
Never been much on religion
But I sure enough just fell down on my knees
