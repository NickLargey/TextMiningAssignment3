Well, it don't matter to me what you say, what you say
And it don't matter to me what you're doing alright, alright 

Because I've heard it all so many times before
Just what you're saying 
And I don't really want to hear it all no more, no more
Don't want to hear it no more

'Cause there's no way that you can run
'Cause I'm gonna find you
And there's nobody that you can turn to
'Cause I'll be behind you just to remind you

That it don't matter to me, yeah, what you say, what you say, say, say, say
Well it didn't matter to me what you're doing alright, alright, alright 

It seems to me it's been too easy for you for too long
So you'd better climb down before you fall and hurt your pride, your pride
You're gonna hurt your pride 

'Cause there' nowhere that you can run to
'Cause I'm gonna find you
And there's no place that you can stay
'Cause I'll be behind you just to remind you
