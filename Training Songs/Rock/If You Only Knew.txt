I'd give you anything, 
Everything, 
To have you be mine. 
I'd give the stars above, 
And all my love, 
How can you be so blind? 

So blind? 
I'm going out of my mind, 
All the time, 
For you, 
Yes it's true. 

[Chorus]
If you only knew, 
That I'm crazy for you, 
Then you'd understand. 
If I only knew, 
What you're goin' through, 
Then I'd understand. 

Now I know that I, 
Have no chance, 
Oh to make you mine. 
If I ruled the world, 
Would you be my girl, 
How can you be so blind? 

So blind? 
I'm going out of my mind, 
All the time, 
For you, 
Yes it's true. 

[Chorus]

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
