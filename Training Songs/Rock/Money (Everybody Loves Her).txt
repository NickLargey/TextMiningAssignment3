So you walk away from an open door
With no sympathy from a man who knows
Somebody's lost somebody cries
Where were you standing
How could you fall for all the lies
Looking back in time do you see the truth
It's so easy to find
Somebody's weak somebody's strong
Thought that I'd stumble
You got it all wrong

Look back in anger look back in shame
Somebody told you somebody's losing out again

CHORUS:
Inside outside love
Inside outside love

All the feelings gone
You're just a face in the crowd
And I wonder why
You don't walk so proud
Somebody's lost somebody's found
I'll watch you climb up only to fall down

I see a stranger that I used to know
Look to the future
Somebody's seen it all before

CHORUS:
Inside outside love
Inside outside love
(Can you save your soul tonight?)
Inside outside love
(You don't realise what you've got till it's gone)
Inside outside love
(You can tell the world)

Was the truth applied
Where you criticised
Did you lose your pride
Were you dignified
Did your hopes slide
Was it worldwide
Were you satisfied
Are you qualified
Did your heart decide
You can never hide
Are you outside love
Are you outside love
Are you outside love
Are you outside love

Were you critcised
Was the truth applied
Was it worldwide
Did you lose your pride
Were you dignified
Did your hopes slide
Are you satisfied
Were you qualified

You don't walk so proud
Just a face in the crowd
You don't talk so loud
After all these years
Can you see through the tears
There's nothing you can do
To save your soul tonight
To save your soul tonight
How does it feel
How does it feel
