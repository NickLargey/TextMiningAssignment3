Don't know what's wrong but I can't sleep at night
When it's time to eat I have no appetite
But if it's love that's worrying me
I hope you'll set me free

My heart is aching, ain't that a shame
I didn't think my heart could stand the pain
But if it's love that's worrying me
I hope you'll set me free

My eyes are swept with tears, can't you see
This awful feeling got the best of me
But if it's love that's worrying me
I hope you'll set me free

My heart is aching, ain't that a shame
I didn't think my heart could stand the pain
But if it's love that's worrying me
I hope you'll set me free

Don't know what's wrong but I can't sleep at night
When it's time to eat I have no appetite
But if it's love that's worrying me
