Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around and it's time to go to town, where do you go?
To rock and roll

The old folks say that ya gotta end your date by ten
If you're out on a date and you bring it home late it's a sin
There just ain't no excusin', you know you're gonna lose and never win
I'll say it again

And it's all because your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around and it's time to go to town, where do you go?
To rock and roll

You pull into a drive-in and find a place to park
You hop into the backseat where you know it's nice and dark
You're just about to move in, thinkin' it's a breeze
There's a light in your eye and then a guy says "out of the car, Longhair!"
"Louise, you're comin' with me and no more movies"

And it's all because your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around and it's time to go to town, where do you go?
To rock and roll
Where do you go?
To rock and roll
Where do you go?
To rock and roll
