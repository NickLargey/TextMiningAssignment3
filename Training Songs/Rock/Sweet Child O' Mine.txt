He's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see his face
He takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love o'mine

He's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

His hair reminds me
Of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by

Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love o'mine
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love o'mine

Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go
Sweet child
Where do we go now

Where do we go
Where do we go sweet child
Where do we go now [Repeat until end]
