Some go down on a borderline 
Another one die in a neighborhood 
Someone cheers, a mother cries 
Evil versus good 
So welcome to the world's arena 
Where love, power, and war 
Where blood, sweat, and tears 
Gets an encore 

And there's another one behind that one 
And behind that one lies another one 
And still growing up there's a youngest son 
And he don't mind dying 
And we sing 

Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
It's a glory, hollow hallelujah 

Yeah, there's another one behind that one 
And behind that one lies another one 
And still growing up there's a youngest son 
And he don't mind dying 
And we sing 

Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
It's a glory, hollow hallelujah 
Hollow hallelujah 
Glory hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah
