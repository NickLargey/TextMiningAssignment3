Pat is the guy with a record shop
And John sells fruit but wants to be a cop
And Paul deals speed in a celtic top
But I'm just a drunk in a band
Joe does tele-sales and martial arts
And Jim pushes patients 'round the public parks
And Nancy makes sculptures out of Hoover parts
But I'm just a drunk in a band
Danny puts the cones on the motorway
And Donna dances tables in her lingere
And Jerry, Dave, and Billy, man, they're putting on a play
But I'm just a drunk in a band
Pat is the guy with a record shop
And John sells fruit but wants to be a cop
And Paul deals speed in a celtic top
But I'm just a drunk in a band
I could be a soldier, I could drive a van
Guide rivers of paint into little red cans
Walk rich folks dogs bring 747s in to land
I'm just a drunk in a band
