It's my time to riot
It's bleak and I'm quiet
Take you to the top of the pile
There's been way to much time
And now the shit's on the line
I'm coming down to claim what's mine
Take me 
It's gonna be here just to waste me
I'm rounding it up
And in spite all your love
It still shakes me
Imitate 'til you bleed
It'll take all you leave
And it's my time, it's my time to riot
It's my time to riot
It's bleak and I'm quiet
Take you to the top of the pile
There's been way to much time
And now the shit's on the line
I'm coming down to claim what's mine
Take me 
It's gonna be here just to waste me
I'm out of your reach
But it's all that you take to erase me
Imitate 'til you bleed
Imitate 'til you bleed
And it's my time to riot
