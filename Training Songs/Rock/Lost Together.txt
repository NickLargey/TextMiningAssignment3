You always said to listen to your heart-Maybe you were warning me
All that I remember is your sirens call...and crashing on your beach
I was in pursuit of sunken treasure...drifting so far off my course
I should've seen the red sky, in the morning light...and followed my true north
Somewhere we got lost together
And on this island, found each other
In a million years, if ever
I could never want another
Be careful what you think you're wishing for...'cause you know it might come true
And happily ever after is an ending, only written for a fool...by a fool
(solo)
Somewhere we got lost together
And on this island, found each other
In a million years, if ever
I could never want another
Stranded on this shore..always wanting more...than I could ever give to you
Somewhere we got lost together
And on this island, found each other
In a million years, if ever
I could never want another
I could never want another
I could never want another
