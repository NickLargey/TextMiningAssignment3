Something's rotten, things got [complete] outta hand
Too far gone, someone's gonna understand
She controls my mind, makes me do things I don't want to
She's the dangerous kind, there was nothing I could do
I'm standing all this playing games, but this time she pushed me too far
Oh-oh, the damage is done
 [Chorus:]
Now that there is nowhere to run, need an alibi
Now that there is nowhere to run, need an alibi
She's the one to blame, she's got my soul
I just can't seem to leave her alone
Far too late, I found out what you were up to
As if hypnotized, I played criminal to please you
And totally paralyzed, now there's nothing I can do
I don't want to live like this, but now it seems there ain't no way back
Oh-oh, I'm caught in a trap
(chorus)
She knows just what to do to turn me on, she makes me do whatever she wants
(Solo)
(chorus)
She knows just what to do to turn me on, she makes me do whatever she wants
(chorus repeats out)
