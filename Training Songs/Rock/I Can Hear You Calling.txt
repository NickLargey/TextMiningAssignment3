I can hear you callin', callin' my name out loud.
Know that makes me wonder; used to be so proud.
Sudden realization goin' need me now, that's why.
I can hear you callin' me and so I'm tellin' you goodbye.
Don't expect no answer I'm tellin' you goodbye.
I can hear you callin'.

We can't get together, think you're just too good.
You can keep on callin' me till it's understood. Yeah.
You got to learn the hard way, I think you know it's true.
You got to get to get to get what you got comin', I know it's true.
Don't call out you're sorry, there's nothing I can do.
I can hear you callin'.
I can hear you callin'.

I can hear you callin', I know that's all right.
You can keep on callin' me till you see the light.
I don't need aggravation you've given me all along.
You, you do all the taking somehow I think that's all wrong. 
Call me if you want to, realize that I'm gone.
I can hear you callin'.
I can hear you callin'.
I can hear you callin'.
I can hear you callin'.
I can hear you callin'.
I can hear you callin'.
I can hear you callin'.
