Oh, some evil spirit, oh, some evil this way comes 
They told me how they fear it 
Now they're placing it on their tongues
For to see it with my own eyes 
For to see it with my own eyes
No food or water for the better part of ten months 

Quietly he sat between the folds of a tree trunk
For to see it with my own eyes 
For to see it with my own eyes
All the men of faith and men of science had their questions 
Could it ever be on earth as it is in heaven?
For to see it with my own eyes For to see it with my own eyes
