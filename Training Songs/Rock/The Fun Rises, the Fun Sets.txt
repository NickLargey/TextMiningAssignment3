We were having fun

Summer gifts and like a kid
I took it and ran
A moment leaves and later reveals
A one-night stand, A one-time deal

We were having fun
Oh, that's when she said, "It's that time of month
You can't go on red"
The fun rises, the fun sets
So I begged, "Can you kissed me on my head?"
She said, "I'll do it when you come
Next year"
Oh, the fun rises, the fun sets, hey

Strangers become friends and then
Strangers again
But no guilt trips on our field trips
No expectations and no regrets

We were having fun
Oh, that's when she said, "It's that time of month
You can't go on red"
The fun rises, the fun sets
Your strong legs wrapped around my chest
Sex is rough when it's best
Till you're out of breath
Oh, the fun rises, the fun sets, hey

Hey!
We were having fun

We were having fun in those swimming trunks, summer triumph
It never reaches
The fun rises, the fun sets
Life is dead but none of this was ever meant to be remembered
No postcard love
Oh, the fun rises, the fun sets, hey
We were having fun
