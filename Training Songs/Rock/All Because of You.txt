I can remember the day when I had nothing to say
Just look at me now I'm shouting
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, I feel good, oh, I feel good

It's all because of you, baby
All because of you, woman
But ain't no doubt about it
All because of you
All because of you, baby
You don't know what it's like (hey hey hey)
You don't know, you don't know
To be happy again to have so many friends
Just when I thought it was the end.
Hey, hey, hey
And it's all because of you, baby 
You got me, you got me, you got me
Ah, ah, ah, ah
I remember the day
When I had nothing to say
Just look at me now I'm shouting (hey hey hey)
But ain't no doubt about it.
Ooh, I feel good, oh, I feel good
And it's all because of you, baby 
And let me hear you shout it (hey hey hey)
I wanna hear you shout it (hey hey hey)
Shout, shout it shout it (hey hey hey)
Come on, come on shout it (hey hey hey)
I wanna hear you shout it (hey hey hey)
I wanna hear you shout it (hey hey hey)
Come on and hear me shout it, now (hey hey hey)
Shout, shout it shout it (hey hey hey)
Shout, shout it shout it (hey hey hey)
I wanna hear you shout it (hey hey hey)
