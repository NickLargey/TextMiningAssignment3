This is the golden age
It's hard to imagine
From the way I feel today
This is the golden age
The golden age

Somewhere I failed
And somewhere I lost you
In a black crowd of crows and shiny things
I can't remember

This is the golden age
This is the golden age
The golden age

It seems like I'm high
But baby, I'm crawling
Through the unbearable days
I threw away
But I should have savored
The flaxen light
Off of the dying wheat
Your rye whiskey mouth
And your dandelion teeth

This is the Golden Age
This is the Golden Age
This is the Golden Age
