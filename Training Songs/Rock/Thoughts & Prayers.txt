(No thoughts, no prayers)
(Can bring back what's no longer there)
(The silent are damned)
(The body count is on your heads)

Smile for the camera
Another politician bought
I swear I heard another shot
Cash another payment
Bled all on the canvas
There's murder on the campus

Another press conference
Nothing gets accomplished
The shooter's an accomplice
Money is the motive
The wars in the street
Watch history repeat

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your heads

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your heads

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your heads

Bow before the violence
It's a governmental shakedown
Welcome to my breakdown
Bulletproof backpacks
They want to arm the teachers
I think I saw the reaper

Fear's good for profit
Deregulate the casket
They're lyin' to the masses
How much will it take
'Till you get buried in the coffin that you make?
Heaven's sake

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your heads

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your heads

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your heads

Turn off all the lights nobody make a sound
Ashes to ashes, we all fall down
Are we out of time when we turn this song around?
Are we out of time when we all fall
(We all fall down)

The body count is on your heads
The body count is on your heads

No thoughts (Nobody)
No prayers (Nobody)
No thoughts (Nobody)
The body count is on your heads
No thoughts (Nobody)
No prayers (Nobody)
No thoughts (Nobody)
The body count is on your heads (on your heads)
