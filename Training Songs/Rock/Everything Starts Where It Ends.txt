If you are the cloud, then i am the snow
If you are the rain, then i will not grow
All of the asperity you have sewn

If you are the voice inside of my head
That's fine with me
I'll turn down the bed
You cannot control me from the other side
No, you will not control me from the other side

Here we are again, love
Here we go again
By your side i can't pretend anymore
Now everything starts where it ends

When nobody wants you in their life
When nobody wants you in their life
When nobody wants you in their life
It's alright, it's gonna be alright

Do you feel what i feel coming?
All the oxen freed us now
Hiding in the tree life, kids come out at dusk light
Don't go home, it's tip toe time

All these threes are my trees
All these dreams are my dreams
Cool it Mr. Ice Cream sun!
Now cool it Mr. Ice Cream.

Here we are again, love
Here we go again
By your side i can't pretend anymore
Now everything starts where it ends

Do you feel what i feel? 
Our heart is slowing down
No one will love what you love to defend
It all will start where it ends

Now do you see what i see?
Your calm is breaking the sound
Do not fear what i fear to pretend 
All this will start where it ends

Wake up, you're alive
We're on your side
Wake up, you're alive
We're on your side
Wake up, you're alive
We're on your side
Wake up, you're alive

Here we are again, love
Here we go again
By your side i can't pretend anymore
Now everything starts where it ends
