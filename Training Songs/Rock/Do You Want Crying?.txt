So long now - since you walked and left me.
Why did your love grow cold ? Don't you think you need me ?
I see that smile
It's your face. I feel you holding on and on.
I hear your voice
It's saying: bye bye love.
I count my teardrops as they fall.
Do you want crying? Look
I'm crying.
Do you want crying? Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh.
You've got me crying
You've got me crying.
Don't you want crying?
So long now - since you walked and left me.
Why did your love grow cold ? Don't you think you need me ?
Don't you want crying ? Look
I'm crying...
Do you want crying? You've got me crying...
Do you want crying?
Do you want crying? Look
I'm crying...
Do you want crying? Look
I'm crying.
Do you want crying? Look
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh.
