Rainy day
Stormy night
She couldn't stay
It wasn't right
She never cried
She's very strong
Always tried
When it went wrong

It's nothing new
When you loose
And getting through
It's no pleasure cruise
She never lied 
I heard them say
Just hit the slide
And fell away

It must have been love
That let her down
It must have been love
That pushed her around
Looking for love
She never found
It must have been love

She spend her time 
In an endless search
It's a crime
Keeps getting hurt
She never learns 
Takes it day by day
She gets burned 
And turned away

It must have been love
That let her down
It must have been love
That pushed her around
Looking for love
She never found
It must have been love
