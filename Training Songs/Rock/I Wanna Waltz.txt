Well, we used to waltz and a go out dancin'
Now you look like a cat a prancin'
I just stand looking at the floor
While you swing out and they holler for more

I wanna waltz but I can't waltz
Without you I'd be so blue

Well, you gotta bop, a you ain't happy
Till they play you somethin' snappy
All you wanna do is go cat go
All I wanna do is slow down slow

I wanna waltz but I can't waltz
Without you I'd be so blue

I can't understand while the bop keeps a goin'
When the music stops you're puffin' and a blowin'
Looks like somethin's bitin' you
When you cut loose on the be bop a loo

I wanna waltz but I can't waltz
Without you I'd be so blue

Well, you gotta bop, a you ain't happy
Till they play you somethin' snappy
All you wanna do is go cat go
All I wanna do is slow down slow

I wanna waltz but I can't waltz
Without you I'd be so blue
