If at some point we all succumb
For goodness sake, let us be young.
'Cause time gets harder to outrun,
And I'm nobody, I'm not done.
With a cool, cool breeze and dirty knees,
I rest on childhood memories.
We all got old at breakneck speed,
Slow it down, go easy on me.

Go easy on me.

Put a wetsuit on. Come on, come on.
Grow your hair out long. Come on, come on.
Put a t-shirt on. Do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong.

If it's up and after you,
What do you suppose that you would do?
You're all whacked out from lack of sleep,
You blame it on the friends you keep.
Well, you wanna do things differently,
Go do them independently.
We all got old at breakneck speed,
Slow it down, go easy on me.

Go easy on me.

Put a wetsuit on. Come on, come on.
Grow your hair out long. Come on, come on.
Put a t-shirt on. Do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong.

Put a wetsuit on. Come on, come on.
Grow your hair out long. Come on, come on.
Put a t-shirt on. Do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong.

Does holy water make you pure?
Submerged, your vision's just obscured.
You're a lot like me, in up to our knees.
In over your chest is way too deep.

So, put a wetsuit on. Come on, come on.
Grow your hair out long. Come on, come on.
Put a t-shirt on. Do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong.

Put a wetsuit on. Come on, come on.
Grow your hair out long. Come on, come on.
Put a t-shirt on. Do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong.
