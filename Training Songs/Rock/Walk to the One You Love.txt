I will let you walk to the one you love
I will let you walk to the one you love
But who is the one you love?
But tell me who is the one you love?

Who when bashed and bruised will tend your wounds?
Who will aid you with their point of view?
Oh tell me who is the one you love?
Oh tell me who is the one you love?

I would hate to see you walk away
But I won't cry or beg for you to stay

If you would use the one you love
You're gonna lose the one you love

Who will take you down to up above?
Who will greet you with leather gloves?
Oh, tell me who is the one you love?
Oh, tell me who is the one you love?

I would hate to see you walk away
But I won't cry or beg for you to stay

If you use the one you love
You're gonna lose the one you love

I will let you walk to the one you love
I will let you walk to the one you love
