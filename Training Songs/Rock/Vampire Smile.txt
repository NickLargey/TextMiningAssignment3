Baby you need to leave,
'Cause I'm getting drunk on your noble deeds.
It doesn't matter that they don't get done,
When I feel this cold they're like the fucking sun.

Baby I need a friend,
But I'm a vampire smile, you'll meet a sticky end.
I'm here trying not to bite your neck,
But it's beautiful and I'm gonna get

So drunk on you and kill your friends.
You'll need me and we can be obsessed.
And I can touch your hair and taste your skin,
The ghosts won't matter 'cause we'll hide in sin.

Baby you have a choice,
'Cause you burn my ears with your magic voice.
I'm a paper doll, you can tear me up,
We'll be the broken lovers with the poison cup.
And we'll draw in breaths like we don't have air,
Oh god, look at me, don't you even care
That I'm dying in the cupboard underneath the stairs?
Steps stamp on above my head.

Baby you're cruel to me,
But you see I love it when you make me plead.
I want a scar that looks just like you,
'Til then I gotta learn to be a wiser fool.

Baby you need to leave,
And I know you know
That's why you keep ignoring me
Because if you don't,
Gonna run me down, let myself go
