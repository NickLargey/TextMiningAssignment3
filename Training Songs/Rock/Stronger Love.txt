You won't let me meet all your friends
You say, it's for the best
But my instincts, I always follow
I believe, you're jealous

You use words like a weapon
You want to, cut me down, cut me down
Your affection leaves an emptiness
I need stronger love, stronger love

I want stronger love
Don't want a union made of jealousy
Don't want clinging love
Just want somebody who will take care of me

You get possessive and I get jumpy
I want it simple, I don't want no complication
You get possessive
And I get scared

I want stronger love
Don't want a union made of jealousy
Don't want clinging love
Just want somebody who will take care of me

You won't let me be by myself
You're scared, I won't think of you
But you're wrong, I think of you

All the while your charm is my prison
You smooth take me into staying
But I don't want this clinging love
I need a stronger love, different love

I want stronger love
Don't want a union made of jealousy
Don't want clinging love
Just want somebody, just want somebody

You don't have to fight me to keep me
Here by your side just be kind
I'll stay with you all the while

I want stronger love
Don't want a union made of jealousy
Don't want clinging love
Just want somebody who will take care of me
Take care of me

Stronger love
Don't want a union made of jealousy
Don't want clinging love
Just want somebody who will take care of me
Take care of me, take care of me
I want stronger love

Take care of me, take care of me
I want stronger love
