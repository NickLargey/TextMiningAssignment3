When I come up I want to see 
Out of my hips all inside me 
Should I hold on 
Before it's almost over 
Gave to me a famous cold shoulder 
I jump for you table for two

I kiss the mouth we made for him 
So happy sad I'm everything 
He shuts his eyes to hear me sing 
He's getting tired for the day 
When I come up I want to see
