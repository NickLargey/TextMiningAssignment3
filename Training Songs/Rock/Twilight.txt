Like the sky before the dawn
While the night is holding on
Sun and moon together in the gray

So my soul is shared by two
The worst of me, the best of You
Saint and sinner mingle in my veins
And I pray, You'll end this

Twilight, twilight
I'm torn inside my soul tonight
The dawning day, the dying night
Oh rid my soul of twilight
Oh rid my soul of twilight

Good I love but evil's done
Good intentions come undone
Good to know I know the One
Who saved me from myself and

Twilight, twilight
I'm torn inside my soul tonight
The dawning day, the dying night
Oh rid my soul of twilight
Oh rid my soul of twilight

Oh Lord, paint my heart a solid hue
The shade of You
Oh Lord, break this dreadful in between
Inside of me
Oh let it be morning

Twilight, twilight
I'm torn inside my soul tonight
The dawning day, the dying night
Oh rid my soul of twilight
Oh rid my soul of twilight
Oh rid my soul of twilight

I know the sun is coming up
Oh the sun is coming up
Yes the sun is coming up
In me, in me
