I wanna trip so hard
I wanna see an insect dream
I wanna fill you up
With all the states you've never seen

Those wolrds so shiny
That crutch so tiny 
All that work and still you're never done

I've gotta find human
Gotta find kindness hidden
I wanna let you know
We're gonna make our all time low

Those worlds so shiny
That crutch so tiny
All that love and still your never done
The stars can't save you

I've got the focus today
And a plan out of the blue
I thought you might understand
Cause I see it run through you
It's what you want them to think
I thought you said what you think
It's not what they wanna know
Oh, no, no

One insect asleep
One sacrificial dream
Won't fill my head in
With what thoughts had looked so clean

I've got the focus today
And a plan out of the blue
It's what you want them to see
They'll see it run through you

I've got the focus today
And a plan out of the blue
I thought you might understand
Cause I see it run through you
It's what you want them to think
I thought you said what you think
It's not what they wanna know
No, no, no
