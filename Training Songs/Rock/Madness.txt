Madness, madness, they call it madness
Madness, madness, they call it madness
It is plain to see, that is what they mean to me
Madness, madness I call it gladness

Madness, madness, they call it madness
Madness, madness, they call it madness
I'm about to explain, that someone is using his brain
Madness, madness, they call it gladness

Propaganda ministers
Propaganda ministers
I've got a aim in view
I'm gonna walk all over you

'Cause madness, madness I call it gladness
But if this is madness
Man, I know I'm filled with gladness
It's gonna be rougher, it's gonna be tougher
And I won't be the one who's gonna suffer
Oh, no, I won't be the one who's gonna suffer
You are gonna be the one?
