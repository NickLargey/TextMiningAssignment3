I’ll take you back to the beginning
I was awoken in screams
The day that I realized
There was a devil in me

Who gives a f*ck if I’m a sinner
Can see by the flames you know I’m like
A little conception inside

We started
Broken hearted
Falling apart at the seams
Don’t blame me
For your problems
You should fix yourself up
Before you’re gonna fix me

Stand back as your world decays I can’t explain why you’re falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain
I’m not the reason that you’re insane

Feels like I’m living in a madhouse
With smoke and mirrors you see
The devil in me shivers
Every time that you breathe
We’re going mad
Go take your pills and get out
I don’t understand what the f*ck you’re screaming about

We’re falling
Downwards spiral
Please just let me
Be released
Don’t blame me
For your problems
You should save yourself up
Before you’re gonna save me

Stand back as your world decays I can’t explain why you’re falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain I’m not the reason that you’re insane
Yea I know we’ve seen some better days
Now that explains why we’re falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain I’m not the reason that you’re insane

Hey, hey, hey hey, hey,
I’m not the reason that you’re insane!

Stand back as your world decays I can’t explain why you’re falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain
I’m not the reason that you’re insane!
Yea I know we’ve seen some better days
Now that explains why we’re falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain
I’m not the reason that you’re insane

Hey, hey, hey hey, hey,
I’m not the reason that you’re insane!
