Ohh, ohh

I'd move a mountain
If you want me to
Though it's hard, so hard
It's, oh, so hard

I love you
I need you so much
(So much)

I'd swim the ocean
If you want me to
Though it's hard, so hard
It's, oh, so hard

I love you
I need you so much
(So much)

Where did you go, oh
Where did you stray
What must I do, my dear
To make you stay, oh

I pray every night, dear
For your return
For your tender kiss, dear
(My dear)
Woah, oh

I'd give you my heart
If you want me to
Yes, I will
(Yes, I will)
Yes, I will
(Yes, I will)
You know I will

'Cause I love you
I need you so much
(So much)

Oh, so much
(So much)
Oh, so, so much
