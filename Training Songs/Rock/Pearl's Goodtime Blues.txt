Just a smile sit down awhile 
with her feathers and her brandy 
we're just movin' how ya' doin' 
how ya' doin' daddy 
come on honey this one goes on mine 

Pearl you know she could steal the show 
get ya' feelin' crazy 
get it on with you all night long 
and make you feel amazing 

Rag Mamma rag 
ya' got me off my feet 
my heart just skipped a beat 
won't you rag Mamma rag ... Mamma 

Feathers flyin', she lookin' fine 
she just feelin' dandy 
she got her man and she holdin' hands 
and she just called him “Pappy” 
and she can sing the blues 
   right off your mind 

Pearl you know she could steal the show 
if she gets the notion 
rockin' on with ya' all night long 
man, she got some locomotion 

Rag Mamma rag 
kick away my blues 
I just kicked off my shoes 
won't you rag Mamma rag 

Her eyes are wide 
she's runnin' scared 
was it something she was seeing 
but in a flash 
then it passed 
to somethin' she was needin' 
or was it something she was 
   feeling at the time 
something she was 
   feeling at the time
