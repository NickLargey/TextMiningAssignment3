Ever since I first saw you
I never seem to get you of my mind
When I tried to say hello
You tried to go, I made you stay behind
Now your always hangin' round
You never touch the ground
You make me feel so small
Wish I was ten feet tall.

Remember when I lost my cool
Shouted at you, you nearly hit the ceiling
Your trying to make me feel like a fool
Ignoring me you really hurt my feelings
Now your always hangin' round
You never touch the ground
You make me feel so small
Wish I was ten feet tall.

I'm gonna bring you down to my size
One of these days I'm gonna make you fall
I'm gonna bring you down to my size
Smash your head against the wall.

Now your always hangin' round
You never touch the ground
You make me feel so small
Wish I was ten feet tall.

I'm gonna bring you down to my size
One of these days I'm gonna make you fall
I'm gonna bring you down to my size
Smash your head against the wall.

Ever since I first saw you,
I never seem to get you off my mind
When I tried to say hello,
You tried to go I made you stay behind
Now your always hangin' round
You never touch the ground
You make me feel so small
Wish I was ten feet tall.
