Sure got my piece of Heaven
An angel in disguise
Gone wild
But I thought you were a man
Who knew right from wrong
That's why I really don't understand
Why he's with her
It's killing me
What has she got that I don't have?
Is it the way she looks at you
Laughs with you?  Can she
Does she make you beg for more?
This is hurting
What has she got that I don't have?
I tried to call him
Anytime anywhere
But he's never there
So I went to his place
And waited all day
So he would explain it to me
And this is what he said:
There is nothing left to say
I had my fill; I went away
Your crying eyes won't change a thing
It was just a fling
Well, how could an angel break my heart?
He said: We could still be friends
Are you kidding me?
What has she got that I don't have?
Is it the way she looks at you
Talks to you?  Can she
Does she make you beg for more?
This is hurting
What has she got that I don't have?
But twice every year
When he's in tears
When he loses his mind
And can't help but cry
He'll call me, and then
I am better then
I am
