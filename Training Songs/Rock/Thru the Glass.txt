I want to take a walk, rain cloud, coat on
And the wind is blowing from the south
I want to climb a rock from bottom to top
And nothing's getting left behind
I want to hear your voice call me, call out loud
When you talk to me I'll hear you out
I want to space it out, too close, move on out
It's all around for you to see
Yeah, it's all I want to see
But there's such a lot of baggage
You got us into this, so get us out of this

Get us out of this, get us out of
You got us into this, so get us out of this
Get us out of this, get us out
Oh, get us out of this
Oh, get us out of this
Oh, get us out of
I want to lose control, look down, scream out loud
Let the others sort it out
I want to be impressed with everyone, yeah
Everyone give all the best
