See you on the avenue
And I know you're gonna be
Hearing secret harmonies, yeah, yeah
It's a very fine line, a trembling leaf
'Tween the heaven here on earth
And mystery you've witnessed in your own dreams

As the stars shine with magic illusion
And the sirens sing up from the streets

Phoenix rising, Phoenix rising, Phoenix rising
Hear the beat, feel the heat
Phoenix rising, Phoenix rising, Phoenix rising

Blue is what you make it, babe
No one else can make you cry
While seasons mark your proud beliefs, yeah
And the passion fills your eyes with sodium light
And the secrets that you hold within you
Should be mine and mine alone now, yeah

Well, it's love not illusion, that's what I want
And the music that flows from the streets at night

Phoenix rising, Phoenix rising, Phoenix rising
Hear the beat, feel the heat
Phoenix rising, Phoenix rising, Phoenix rising

Take the rhythm now
For it rolls on all through the town
Close your eyes, take your prize

Just as I stumble through the heat and I remember
As I wander through the streets, I remember ancient beats
Though the sidewalk burns my feet, I surrender

As the stars shine with magic illusion
And the sirens sing up from the street

Phoenix rising, Phoenix rising, Phoenix rising
Hear the beat, feel the heat
Phoenix rising, Phoenix rising, Phoenix rising

Take the rhythm now
For it rolls on all through the town
Close your eyes, take your prize
Find your space, take your place, yeah
