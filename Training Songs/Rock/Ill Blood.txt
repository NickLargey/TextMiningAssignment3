You can tell me what you think of me
And run your mouth for your friends
Living a lie, you try and make a difference
I'm gonna leave my mark while I have the chance
You're never more wrong than this time
I'll take a good look at you
So I know exactly how I don't want to be
ALWAYS! - Keep the future in mind
ALWAYS! - Fighting to make it right
ILL BLOOD drawn with the slip of a tongue
Doesn't matter to me 'cause I've already won
Sometimes these words are all I feel inside
This hate, this pain, this fuckin rage has clouded my mind
You want the world to see that you hate me
But I couldn't care less about you
I try to keep my head but I'm seeing red
My vision is blurred no matter where I turn
ALWAYS! - Keep the future in mind
ALWAYS! - Fighting to make it right
ILL BLOOD brewin' with the slip of a tongue
Doesn't matter to me 'cause I've already won
Ill Blood!
COWARD - Afraid to face the world
YOU'RE RUNNING
Time to admit defeat
TRAPPED - By what you think you know
TIME BOMB - When will it explode
