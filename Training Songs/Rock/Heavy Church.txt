Light my way with incensed candles ooh.
Rug so soft beneath my sandals, ooh.
I've never been in here before
Like to feel the glory.

Mercy, mercy on the love defenders
Have pity on the pretenders
A little help from all lifes losers
A little truth from the mind abusers
Ooh I need them playing in the Heavy Church

If you judge the way they're living ooh,
Try to see the truth their giving you
They only want to touch your hand with understanding.

Mercy, mercy on the love defenders
Have pity on the pretenders
A little help from all Lots losers
A little truth from the mind abusers
Ooh I need them playing in the Heavy Church

Mercy, mercy on the love defenders
Have pity on the pretenders
A little help from all lifes losers
A little truth from the mind abusers

Mercy, mercy on the love defenders
Have pity on the pretenders
A little help from all lifes losers
A little truth from the mind abusers
Hear them, hear them, hear them, hear them
Run and see the truth they're giving you
Hear them, hear them
Run and see the truth they're giving you
Hear them, hear them
Run
Hear them, hear them
Run and see the truth they're giving you
Hear them, hear them
Run
