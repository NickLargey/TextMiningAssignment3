There's been times when I'm shaken
Now I'm stronger I can't fall
Don't you know you were my haven
Through life's mess I had to crawl
Watching you watching me now
You're the one that's made me true
And if you hadn't been my backbone
I would have died in front of you 
Hold on to me
Hold on to me

[Chorus]
You're the one who pulled me back again
Showed your love and your strength as a friend
You're the one who pulled me back again
Showed your love and your strength as a friend

Everybody come back from the edge
Everybody's lesson shouldn't hurt so bad
Everybody listen what's been said
If you never learn you're gonna be misled

Thank you love for your wisdom
Thank you love for your time
Just between us you're my answer
You're the lifeline of my mind

Hold on to me
Hold on to me
Hold on to me
Hold on to me

[Chorus]
Everybody come back from the edge
Everybody's lesson shouldn't hurt so bad
Everybody listen what's been said
If you never learn you're gonna be misled

[Chorus until fade]
