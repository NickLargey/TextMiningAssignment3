They used to tell me that I was just a fool
Dreaming away my time
But they soon found the more they put me down
The more I blocked them from my mind
I used to get my teacher so uptight
He'd always have to ask his questions twice

I'd be a million miles away
Drifting through time and space
I was a million miles away from any place
I was a million miles away
In a world of my own
A million miles away to parts unknown
I'd be gone

My end-of-term reports would always show
I did pretty well at school
But I kept them hid from all the other kids
I didn't want to seem uncool
My homeroom teacher didn't understand
The reason why I never raised my hand

I was a million miles away
In a world of my own
A million miles away in parts unknown
I'd be gone

I've flown across the galaxies
And been to Berkeley Square
I've passed the time with Sophocles
But never left my chair

But I'm a million miles away
Drifting through time and space
A million miles away from any place
A million miles away
I've built a world all my own
A million miles away to parts unknown
I'd be gone
A million miles away
