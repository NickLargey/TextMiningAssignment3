I can taste it in my mouth
I am hanging upside down
All the faces gathered round
To wait and see, to breath relief
To call my name for the first time

Cry your eyes out
Fill your lungs up
We all hurt
We all lie
And nothing stays the same
Oh, oh, oh dear life
Oh, oh, oh
I can face it just about
I'd rather hurt than live without
But I will rage and scream and shout
A love, a life, it's dark and bright
It's beautiful and it's alright

To cry your eyes out
Fill your lungs up
We all hurt
We all lie
And nothing stays the same

Let your guard down
Get your heart pounded
We all bleed
We all breathe
And nothing stays the same
We hold out
For someday
And nothing stays the same

Oh, oh, oh

We all believe in something that'll rip us into shreds
We all know why it stings to open up your chest
We all show signs of greatness that we hope that someone sees
Our broken teeth are scattered but we're smiling underneath
A thousand bruising muscles still we're running on and on
We all know names that ring like thunder rattling our walls
Everyone is yearning for a reason for a cause
Somewhere deep inside we're hold on for dear life

Oh,oh,oh dear life
Oh,oh,oh dear life
Oh,oh,oh dear life
Oh,oh,oh

Cry your eyes out
Fill your lungs up
We all hurt
We all lie
And nothing stays the same

Let your guard down
Get your heart pounded
We all bleed
We all breathe
And nothing stays the same
(Yeah) we all hurt
We all learned
That nothing stays the same
