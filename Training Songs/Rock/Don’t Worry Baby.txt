Everything I've tried to do for you has always turned out wrong 
It took a lot of love inside of me to keep me here this long 
It's too late to dim the lights again expecting me to call 
'Cause tonight I'm gonna leave you, and I'm leavin' standin' tall 

If I could see inside your mind, I wonder what I'd find?
There's somethin' there that's made me come so close to losin' mine 
The tallest tree will sometimes bend, oh, but that won't make it fall 
I'm packin' it up to leave you, and I'm leavin' standin' tall 

Now I'm pickin' up the pieces of the heart that you've been breakin' 
And I'm down on my knees just to try and find them all 
And when I get up one long last look is all that I'll be takin' 
'Cause tonight I'm finally leavin', and I'm leavin' standin' tall 
Yeah, tonight I'm gonna leave you, and I'm leavin' standin' tall
