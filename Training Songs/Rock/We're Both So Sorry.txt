I know you didn't mean it and you're sorry that I left
I'll go right on pretending I've got nothing to regret
Except all of the times we wasted getting only second best
You always seemed to lose the spark when I was only half undressed
I drove across a sea of ice to find my own command
The distance paid a lonesome price to see its motherland
Now if you would unbuckle sir, receive your reprimand
And hey I'm sorry 'bout so much baby but I know you'll understand
I'm sorry 'bout so much baby but I know you'll understand

How can I ever apologize? I meant you no such harm
I never knew I could possess that fatal kind of charm
I just wanted to be good to you but I found I was disarmed
By a lifetime of disillusionment and the distraction of the stars
I abdicated now I'm just a prince without a land
My subjects all adore me but for this I have been banned
Now could I trade my guilt for a good flogging by your hand?
And hey I'm sorry 'bout so much baby but I know you'll understand
I'm sorry 'bout so much baby but I know you'll understand

I can't understand why you refuse my one request
Just to press against my weaponry and then lay bare your chest
Challenges like these can be won or lost or laid to rest
Now we both agree to separate from the lonely castle steps
The kingdom is destabilized, the watchtower unmanned
The bedroom lies abandoned and the future is unplanned
But we've got the past to remind us of what's chivalrous and grand
And hey I'm sorry 'bout so much baby but I know you'll understand
I'm sorry 'bout so much baby but I know you'll understand
