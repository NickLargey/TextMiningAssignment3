And another thing
I've been wondering lately
Oh, baby, 
Tell me where have you been? 
Now the stage is set 
Where's my Juliet, baby? 
Is it maybe 
My Midsummer Night's Dream? 
What's my scene? 

Like a talent scout
I'm always checking out new blood
Oh, I'd do good
If you tell me your game.
Playing Solitaire
Doesn't get me where you would
And, honey, you could
Play by any rules that you care to name.
What's my scene? (I gotta know)

They say, yeah, they say 
Making love, you can make it pay. 
They say, yeah, they say, 
But we know there's a better way 
Any day. 

And another thing 
I've been wondering lately 
Am I crazy 
To believe in ideals? 
I'm a betting man 
But it's getting damn lonely. 
Oh, honey, it only 
I could be sure what I feel. 
What's my scene? (I'm dying to know) 
I'll never know. 
Well, I concede 
I've been caught in someone else's scene (but that's not me). 
Where, oh where, oh where can my scene be? 
Please answer - me 
What's my ..?
