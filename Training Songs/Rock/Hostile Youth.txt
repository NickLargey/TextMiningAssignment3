I can feel you now deep inside of me.
I was blind but now all the pain I see.
We don't like our homes. 
It's nothing but a joke.
We won't do what we're told.
Leave us all alone.
God is dead, you see.
All you need is me.
Kill off those who deny.
You are king tonight.
I can feel you falling faster.
Your life is on the wall.
No more laughter, no more rules.
Catch me if I fall.
