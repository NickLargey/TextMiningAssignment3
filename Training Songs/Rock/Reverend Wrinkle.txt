Stuffed man laying in the yard
There's a black dog by the car
Reverend Wrinkle drinking his tea
Lord, can't you see? Yeah

Moonlit man got it all in his head
He can find the beauty in the things that are dead

He, he is the one, he is the only one
The only one who knows, knows the way
He knows the only way back home

Bone dust on his chair, silence fills the air
Get me to the church
Can't believe what I've seen here
What I've seen here

Moonlit man got it all in his head
He can find the beauty in the things that are dead

He, he is the one, he is the only one
The only one who knows, knows the way
He knows the only way back home

Moonlit man got it all in his head
He can find the beauty in the things that are dead

He, he is the one, he is the only one
The only one who knows, knows the way
He knows the only way back home
Back home, back home, back Home
