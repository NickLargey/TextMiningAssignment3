Reckoner
You can't take it with yer
Dancing for your pleasure

You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all human beings

Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
In rainbows
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore

Reckoner
Take me with yer
Dedicated to all human beings
