I listen all day for a sound that never comes
I watch for you in God's clouds floating by
Twelve minutes later I come around
Words leave me dazed and I see they're no use to me

I never listen to what you say
It's not important anyway
I never listen to what you say
So why do I hate you?
Why do I hate you?
Why?

I watch you all day for a sign that never appears
I see in your eyes what I want it's son very clear
Eighteen months later I'm still there
Trapped in my head I spin I spin 'til you're a dream

I never listen to what you say
It's not important anyway
I never listen to what you say
So why do I hate you?
Why do I hate you?
Why?

I never listen to what you say
It's not important anyway
I never listen to what you say
So why do I hate you?

I never listen to what you say
It's not important anyway
I never listen to what you say
It's not important anyway
I never listen to what you say
