Hey, yeah!
I said I'm walking down ??
??

???
??
This ain't the same old song

Can you hear what's in
My life ????
We live our lives
And fight the night

Chorus:
Livin' On the Edge

????
I pay my dues
And work my job

????
I'd rather play
And sing my songs

Can you hear what's in
My life ????
We live our lives
And fight the night

Chorus
Solo

Verse 1
Bridge
