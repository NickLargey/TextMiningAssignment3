Every day, you make me want to lose myself
I forget the time, I forget my health
I keep a lot of things under my bed
But I really wish you were there

Starcrossed on my face, on my head

Every day, I really need to get control
I forget my pills and I get real low
I hide a lot of things under my hair
But how I really wish you were there

Starcrossed on my face, on my head
Starcrossed
Starcrossed

Every night, I really try to get the best
But I want you fingers and I want your neck
I keep a lot of things under my skin
But I really wish you were there

Starcrossed on my face, on my head
Starcrossed
Starcrossed
