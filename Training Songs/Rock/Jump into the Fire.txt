You can climb a mountain, you can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire but you'll never be free
You can shake me up or I can break you down
Oh, oh

We can make each other happy
Oh, we can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
Oh, we can make each other happy

You can climb a mountain, you can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire but you'll never be free, no no
You can shake me up or I can break you down
Oh, oh

We can make each other happy
Oh, we can make each other happy
Oh, we can make each other happy
We can make each other happy, oh

You can climb a mountain, you can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire but you'll never be free, no no
You can shake me up, I can break you down
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
Aah
