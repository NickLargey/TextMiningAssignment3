Hot sticky night
In the heart of the city
Backseat romance
Givin' up some titty
Daddy's little girl
Wants some Friday night fun
If he could see her now
Daddy'd get his gun
But with heels to the sky
And a smile on her face
What's one man's pride
Is another's disgrace 

She's hot for love
She's on the make
Daddy's little angel's got what it takes
Betcha double or nothin'
She's down on somethin'
She's on the make
She's hot for love 

Lookin' so naughty
With her knickers 'round her knees
She'll bend over backwards
If that's what it takes to please
Now what she's doin' to her family's good name
How the neighbors talk
It's a cryin' shame
Lickin' her lips
Like a kitten with cream
What's papa's nightmare
Is a schoolboy's dream 

She's hot for love
She's on the make
Daddy's little angel's got what it takes
Betcha double or nothin'
She's down on somethin'
She's on the make
She's hot for love 

Wasn't long ago
On her daddy's knee
She was warned about
Boys just like me
So she tried to maintain
Like mama said she should
'Til she found out bein' bad
Felt so damn good
Lickin' her lips
Like a kitten with cream
What's papa's nightmare
Is a schoolboy's dream 

She's hot for love
She's on the make
Daddy's little angel's got what it takes
Betcha double or nothin'
She's down on somethin'
She's on the make
She's hot for love
