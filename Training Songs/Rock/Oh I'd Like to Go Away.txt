Oh, I'd like to be in Ireland
Or maybe even Iceland
Take a trip to Norway
Ooh, I'd like to go away

I can't stay in Tennessee
That's some other place for me
I know what you're gonna say
Ooh, I'd like to go away
(Ooh, I'd like to go away)

I'll pack my bags and leave this evenin'
I can't stay another day
When you told me you were leavin'
We both knew I couldn't stay

Maybe I should fly to China
Or drive to North Carolina
It doesn't matter which way
Ooh, I'd like to go away
(Ooh, I'd like to go away)

Ooh, I'd like to go away
(Ooh, I'd like to go away)
Ooh, I'd like to go away
(Ooh, I'd like to go away)

Mmm I'd like to go away
(Ooh, I'd like to go away)
Ooh, I'd like to go away
(Ooh, I'd like to go away)
