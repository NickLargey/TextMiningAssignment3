Who wants to buy this diamond ring ?
She took it off her finger now
It doesn’t mean a thing

This diamond ring doesn't shine for me anymore and
This diamond ring doesn't mean what it did before
So if you got someone whose love is true
Let it shine for you

This stone is genuine like love should be
And if your baby’s truer than
My baby was to me

Than this diamond ring can be something beautiful and
This diamond ring can be dreams that are coming true
Than your heart won't have to break like mine did
If there’s love behind it
