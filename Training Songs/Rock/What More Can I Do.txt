What more can I do
You know I'd gladly 
Lose myself to you
But something always 
Holds me back
I wish I knew 
What it is that stops me
From loving you 
The way it should be
Oh ! oh! oh! oh!

what I more can I do
I'm trying hard
I know I could believe in you
But something always keeps a hold on me
And just won't let me go
Such a burning bully inside
While I'm trying to hide
That I want you to own me, own me
Own me, oh yeah

what more can I say
I said it all now
Got such a lovely losing price to pay
If you ignore me
What more can I do'
What more can I do'
What more can I do'
