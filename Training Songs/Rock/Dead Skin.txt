You, you're so god-damn hard to please 
You confuse and frustrate me, 
Why must we both go through it?
I said you, it isn't so hard to see 
Those things that you did to me, 
Why must you keep them secret?

Break through those clouds 
See the stars shine down find solid ground 
And peel off all that dead skin
And peel off all that dead skin
You can leave it all behind

Because I, can't seem to get through to you
Your past is something I can't undo, 
It's so clear you've been wounded 
So why, must I pay now for his deeds 
I'm not the one who steals and cheats, 
What must I do to prove it?

Break through those clouds 
See the stars shine down find solid ground 
And peel off all that dead skin
And peel off all that dead skin
And peel off all that dead skin
You can leave it all behind

I will not bend, I am not him! 
The past has spoken
You're not dead and broken

Break through those clouds 
See the stars shine down, find solid ground 
Forget all what has been
Past scars and sins
Peel off all that dead skin
And peel off all that dead skin
And peel off all that dead skin
And peel off all that dead skin you can leave it all behind
