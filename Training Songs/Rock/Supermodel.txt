I don't care what my teachers say
I'm gonna be a supermodel.
Everyone is gonna dress like me,
Wait and see

When I'm a supermodel
And my hair will shine like the sea.
Everyone wants to look like me
Me

[Chorus: x2]
Cause I'm young and I'm here and so beautiful,
I'm gonna be a supermodel

I wish that I was like Tori Spelling,
With a car likes hers and dad likes hers.
And I show them how how it was done.
That be fun, that be fun.

And I write my school report,
Why I love my jeans, why I love my jeans.
And oh, on my locker door it is the coolest thing
That you have ever seen.

[Chorus: x2]

I didn't yesterday,
I'm not gonna eat today
I'm not gonna eat tomorrow
Cause I'm gonna be a supermodel

[Repeat: x4]
So beautiful, I'm gonna be a supermodel
Cause I'm young and I'm here and so beautiful,
I'm gonna be a supermodel

I'm gonna be a supermodel
I'm gonna be a supermodel
