Let's shake this town baby
Come with me
I need a little lovin' company
C'mon now
I know where we can go
This is the time
T'stay out all night
I've gotta fire
Like a heavenly light
C'mon baby
Let's take a drive

C'mon baby
Let's do it right
Time to dance
In the magic light
Of the desert moon

Come on honey
Let's get it right
Make romance
In the magic light
Of the desert moon

Let's lay it down
Under a cactus tree
Give a little lovin' ecstacy

C'mon now
It's time to go
Little baby
You're a beautiful sight
I've got the love
And we have the night
C'mon baby
It's time to fly
