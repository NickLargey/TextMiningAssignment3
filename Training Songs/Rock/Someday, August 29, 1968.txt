Would you look around you now
And tell me what you see
Faces full of hate and fear
Faces full of me
Do you feel the rumblings
As your head comes crumbling down
Do you know what I mean 

Run, you better, run you know
The End is getting near
Feel the wind of something hard
Come whistling past your ear
As they try to get you
Where it will upset you
Down
Now you know what I mean 

Someday you will see how long
We've waited for the time
To show you how we've died
To get together with you all 

Twist and turn your head around
'Till everything's unclear
Twist and turn your arm around
Until it is not there
And they'd love to burn you
Or at least to turn you around
Now you know what I mean 

Can you look around you now
And tell us what's to be
Can you look inside yourself
And tell us what you see
As you feel the rumblings
As your head comes crumbling down
And you know what I mean
Someday you will see how long
We've been waiting for the time
To show you how we've died
To get together with you all
