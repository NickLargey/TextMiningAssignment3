She's insane
Living on a different plane
Spinning til she dizzy again
Just look at her go - fizz-pop-whizz-bang!
She's obsessed
You can tell by the way she's dressed
What she want is anybody's guess
She lives in a dream, oh she
[chorus 1:]
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't see the water for the stormy seas
She don't understand, she got a one track mind
A one track mind
Deep in your heart, there are some parts
Sharing her loneliness
Whoa-oh-oh
Sleep(?) for desire, love is for hire
All she thinks about is sex
One track mind...
There he goes
Following the end of his nose
He's following her on tippy-toes
Oh just watch him go - fizz-pop-whizz-bang!
One of the few
Possesses a very loose ?
I'm(?) only good(?), one part of you
He thinks he's my broges(?)
[chorus 2:]
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't see the water for the stormy seas
He don't understand, he got a one track mind
A one track mind
Deep in their hearts, there are some parts
Sharing their loneliness
Whoa-oh-oh
Shake and define, there is no line
This is one hell of a mess
Whoa-oh-oh
Live for desire, love is for hire
All they think about is sex
One track mind...
One track mind...
One of a kind, clearly defined, one track mind
She got a one, one, one track mind
It's spinning around, lost and found, one track mind
A one track mind, a one track mind, a one track mind, a one track mind.
A one track mind.
