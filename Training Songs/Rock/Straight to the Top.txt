You say you like to have a good time 
You're no different than the rest 
And you know it's not the first time 
That you've given it your best. 
But for some unknown reason 
There's no quest straight to the top 
And I can see no reason 
Why it's ever gonna stop. 
Straight to the top 
It ain't never gonna stop 
It ain't never gonna stop 
Goin' straight to the top 
It ain't never gonna stop 
Straight to the top 
And it feels like forever 
Is right there in my hand 
No more playin' never, never 
With those one night stands 
Oh, my temperatures risin' 
The thermometer's gonna pop 
And I can see no reason 
Why it's ever gonna stop 
Straight to the top 
It ain't never gonna stop 
It ain't never gonna stop 
We're goin' straight to the top, baby. 
It ain't never gonna stop 
Straight to the top 
Hey, well just you and me, baby. 
There's room at the top and we're on our way there. 
So don't try to drag us down, because we're gonna stay there. 
Just you and me 
'Cause that's all I ever want it to be, yeah! 
Straight to the top! 
Straight to the top! 
Straight to the top! 
Oh there's never any question 
When you know she's the one 
Yeah, and it's all so plain and simple 
Lookin' back at what you've done 
Yeah, looking at the future 
It sure looks sunny, and bright. 
And it's such a good, good feelin' 
When you're doin' something right. 
It ain't never gonna stop 
We're goin' straight to the top, baby. 
It ain't never gonna stop 
Oh, straight to the top, baby 
Straight to the top 
Oh Straight to the top. 
Straight to the top 
Straight to the top 
It ain't never gonna stop 
Goin' straight to the top, yeah. 
Straight to the top. 
Straight to the top. 
Just you and me, baby, 
It ain't never gonna stop. 
Straight to the top, whew! 
Straight to the top 
Straight to the top 
Goin' all the way, baby 
It ain't never gonna stop. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ow! Yeah, yeah!
