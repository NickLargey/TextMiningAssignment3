Guess who's working on the fiddle
Tell me who works on the fiddle
I'll tell you who works on the fiddle
Oooo ooo Idle gossip
Guess who's just come off the pill
Tell me who's come off the pill
Oooo ooo Idle gossip.

They must be thick, it's everywhere you go
It makes me sick, I just don't wanna know
About who's in the latest news, oh no.

[Chorus:]
Everybody wants to know the rumours
Everybody wants to know the scandle
Idle, idle,......... gossip.

Guess who can't pay their gas bill
Tell me who can't pay the bill
I'll tell you who can't pay the bill
Oooo ooo idle gossip
Guess who I slept with last night
Tell me where you slept last night
Oooo ooo idle gossip
[Chorus]
