Never  again
You  say  the  words  and  let
The  sunshine  in  again
You  can  close  your  eyes
And  know  it's  safe  inside
To  sing  you  lullaby
(Now  I  lay  me  down)
You  brok  the  chains
And  you  won't  be  silent  anymore
Oh  no!  Now  you're  gonna  shout  about  it
No!  No  more!  Yeah  yeah  this  is  the  end
The  silence  is  broken  now
It's  over  now
The  words  have  been  spoken
And  with  every  word  you  say
You  blow  away
The  tears  of  another  time
Face  to  face
Anyone  can  see  you're  not
The  child  you  were  before
(Now  I  lay  you  down)
You  take  your  place
No  one  can  take  away  your  heart
Oh  no!  There  can  be  no  doubt  about  it
No!  No  more!  Yeah  yeah  this  is  the  end
The  silence  is  broken  now
It's  over  now
The  words  have  been  spoken
And  with  every  word  you  say
You  blow  away
The  tears  of  another  time
The  silence  is  broken  now
It's  over  now
The  words  have  been  spoken
And  with  every  word  you  say
You  blow  away
The  scene  of  another  crime
