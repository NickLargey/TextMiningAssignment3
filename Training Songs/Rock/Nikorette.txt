I'm just trying to stay a human being
Sitting in the sun eating ice cream
Texting my friend about a bad, bad dream
Just had to tell someone who knows me

But I don't got time for this cuckoo clock
And I don't wanna go to your Mason lodge
There's nothing more sad than a lynching mob
Full of rational men who believe in God

But nothing makes sense when the wave rolls through
Nothing makes sense when the wave come through
So it could've been me or it could've been you
Whatever's in me is whatever's in you

My neighbor dreams big 'cause his house is small
Says all he needs now is some capital
It's a pirate world, it's a free-for-all
Just take your bright ideas and they make them dull

Now everyone I see I think I've known before
From the opera house to the grocery store
My love for them I cannot ignore
Like a human voice in a quiet morgue

But I don't wanna wear no dead man's suit
I don't wanna wear no dead man's suit
I don't wanna wait until the moon gets blue
I don't wanna wait until the moon turns blue

It's all just a fix, just one little hit
You'll hold it in

Sitting on a plane chewing Nicorette
Paradise lost, haven't found it yet
Will you talk me down if I get upset?
Be the cool washcloth to my fevered head

Because I don't wanna dream if it won't come true
I don't wanna dream if it don't come true
If there's something in me then I guess it's in you
If there's somewhere in me then I know it's in you
Little baby stone

Well, it's all just a fix, just one little hit
You're holding in, you'll hold it in
You're holding in, you'll hold it in

I don't wanna dream if it won't come true
I don't wanna dream if it don't come true

If there's something in me then I know it's in you
If there's somewhere in me then I know it's in you
Whatever happens to me it's going to happen to you
Whatever happens to me it's going to happen to you
