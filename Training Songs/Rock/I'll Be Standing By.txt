(I'll be standing by)
Whenever you need me, baby
(I'll be standing by)
Whenever you want me, honey
(I'll be standing by)
Whenever you call me, sugar

Whenever you need me, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there

Let the fore winds blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
As hard as they can
If dust gets in your eyes
My baby, don't you cry
'Cause I'll be standing by

(I'll be standing by)
Whenever you need me, baby
(I'll be standing by)
Whenever you want me, honey
(I'll be standing by)
Whenever you call me, sugar

Whenever you need me, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there

Let the hard rain fall
Let it fall, let it fall
As hard as it needs
Don't run under a tree
Let your shelter be me
'Cause I'll be standing by

Come on now

(I'll be standing by)
Whenever you want me, honey
(I'll be standing by)
Whenever you need me, baby
(I'll be standing by)
Whenever you call me, sugar

Whenever you need me, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there

(I'll be standing by)
Come on, come on, hear me, baby
(I'll be standing by)
Oh, say you want me, honey
(I'll be standing by)
Come on, come on, call me, sugar

Whenever you need me, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there

(I'll be standing by)
Oh, need me, need me, baby
(I'll be standing by)
Oh, say you want me, honey
(I'll be standing by)
