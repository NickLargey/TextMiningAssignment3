The hated journey on the train,
Always been the same,
Looking out windows,
Second class and second best,
What a waste of time,
Sleep for five stops in a row,
Prepare yourself to go,
Waterloo station,
Bought a '69 Capri,
failed the M.O.T.,
What a waste of time,

The Worker, the worker,
The worker, the worker.

Always kiss the wife goodbye,
Often wonder why,
At seven in the morning ?
Think it's time for a change,
Wouldn't that be strange,
What a waste of time.

The worker, the worker,
The worker, the worker.
