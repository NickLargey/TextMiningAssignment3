TV party tonight
TV party tonight
TV party tonight
TV party tonight!

We're gonna have a TV party tonight
All right!
We're gonna have a TV party, all right
Tonight!

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Everybody's gonna hang out here tonight
All right!
We'll pass out on the couch, all right
Tonight!

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Don't talk about anything else
We don't want to know
We're dedicated to our favorite shows

That's incredible!
Hill Street Blues!
Dallas!
Fridays!

We sit glued to the TV set all night
And every night
Why go into the outside world at all
It's such a fright

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

TV news shows
What it's like out there
It's a scare
You can go out if you want
We wouldn't dare

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Don't talk about anything else
We don't want to know
We're dedicated to our favorite shows

Saturday Night Live!
Monday Night Football!
Jeffersons!
Vegas!

I wouldn't be without my TV for a day
Or even a minute
Don't even bother to use my brain any more
There's nothing left in it

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Hey, wait a minute, my TV doesn't work!
It's broken!
What are we gonna do tonight, this isn't fair!
We're hurtin'

We've got nothing left to do
Left with no TV just a couple of brews

What are we gonna talk about?
I don't know!
We're gonna miss our favorite shows!

No That's Incredible!
No Monday Night Football!
No Jeffersons!
No Friday!

No TV party tonight!
