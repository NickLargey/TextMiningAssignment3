When the fire burns
'Neath a zombie moon
Ya feel the winds of change
Oh the drums will tell the tune
And you know it's true

Can ya feel the heat
Of the setting sun
Burning up the streets
This beat has got mixed blood
And I know it too

But now her mama's got the eyes
Like she's workin' on a heart attack
A fella never can tell
And I'm about to go bananas
With the "when ya comin' back?"

So we're hittin' the road
And we're pumpin' thunder
Mama look out for down below
Get the show on the road
I's the feeling we're under
You can feel it right down
to
Yout
Knucklebones

One of these dark nights
As the saying goes
There's some dirty work
To be done down by the crossroads
Ans I know it's true

Ain't no use waitin'
For your invitation
King Kong never had it so clean
We'll do the Fat Cat Shake
We'll have our cake and eat it too
You could never, no, no, no, never, beat this squeeze!

Because we're hittin the road
And we're pumpin' thunder
Mama look out for down below
Get the show on the road
It's rally no wonder
You can feel it right down
To
Your
Knucklebones

Must be the heat
Stop dreamin' and start drivin', Stevie

Because we're hittin the road
And we're pumpin' thunder
Mama look out for down below
Get the show on the road
It's rally no wonder
You can feel it right down
To
Your
Knucklebones
