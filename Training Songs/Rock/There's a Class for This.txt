What ya got now, gotta gotta give up

We keep ourselves a mystery
But we provide, provide the clues
So the rest is up to you
And don't forget to check the obvious
We are so serious
So I guess it comes down to how curious you can be

What ya got now, gotta gotta give up
What ya got now, gotta gotta give up
What ya got now

Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back
I may be ugly, but they sure love to stare
Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back
I may be ugly, but they sure, but they sure,
Love to stare

And you check labels more than the FCC
And these calories are, are killing me
But this is a sticky situation
So keep your chest in the game
And drop your jaw and coax me

What ya got now, gotta gotta give up
What ya got now, gotta gotta give up
What ya got now
What ya got now

Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back
I may be ugly, but they sure love to stare
Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back
I may be ugly, but they sure, but they sure

This is a party without the people
This is a show without the sound
This is a dance without the steps
Now I gave you the clues so find what I found
This is a party without the people
This is a show without the sound
So I gave you the clues
So find what I found

Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back
I may be ugly, but they sure love to stare
Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back
I may be ugly, but they sure love to stare
