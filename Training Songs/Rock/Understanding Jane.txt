I've been so lonely she can't understand the way I feel
I'm holding on, I'm walking home alone
I'm here without her
It seems that all the boys appreciate her
All the girls speak highly of her energy
D' you think that it could work for Jane and me 

[Chorus]
'Cos I still want her, I still remember summer
Way back when, we both felt the same
And I still love her, I can't stop thinking of her
I'm having trouble understanding Jane 

One by one my marbles left me
Jane would smile but never hold me
One night at the pool hall
Asked her if she'd hold my cue
Can't impress her with no fancy car
Resigned to lean here at the bar
I'll lose my mind
Shiver in responsibility 

[Chorus]
