Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin' baby, it's you I hate to lose

Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Talking 'bout worries and problems people, oh you know I've had my share

Everyday, everyday, yea, now everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday, yea
Everyday now, everyday I have the blues
