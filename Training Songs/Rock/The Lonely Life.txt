What if I did not love you?
Where would that leave me
Would I wonder through the avenues
Under a pall of misery

Would I be face down in the gutter
With cheap whiskey on my breath
The lonely life of a writer
Whose words could not pay his debts

Singin' please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I've been blinded completely
Please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I am pleading for your mercy

What if we became strangers?
Would you notice my face in a crowd?
And could you hear the sorrow in my voice?
Helplessly crying your name out loud

Would I be searching for a savior?
Burned and burning with regret
The lonely life of a writer
Only if one last desperate request

Singin' please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I've been blinded completely
Please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I am pleading for your mercy

I've been on the lam
Being hunted, somethin' fierce
They say time and tide, it waits for no man
But I was just hopin'
These storm filled skies would clear

Please don't, please don't pass me by
(Please don't, please don't pass me by)
Please don't, please don't pass me by
(Please don't, please don't pass me by)
Please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I am pleading for your mercy
