IÆll Stop at nothing    See that boy who just walked by   Well heÆs the one my heartÆs set on  For me heÆs the only one I need      Because IÆll stop at nothing until I get the boy I love  Because IÆll stop at nothing until I get the boy I met    You donÆt know how hard IÆve tried  IÆve tried hard as I cant be   Someday heÆll be mine      I wont give up trying  Until his heart is mine  Even though it may take quite a while  And in the end IÆm sure everything would be fine  ThatÆs why when he says no I just smile    HeÆs all the world to me  I need his love so badly IÆm in love madly
