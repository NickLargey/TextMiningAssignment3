You never hear about it 
It's not the thing you talk over with friends
You never see it comin' until it begins

But something stepped in between us 
It's taken all of our time alone
In a heart broken maze
But it still is shown

So why does she cry herself to sleep at night
Why do I have to work so hard to make things right 
To fall in love came nat'rally
To make it last is so hard you see
I'm caught in between the two sides of love

A kiss goodbye, a kiss hello
You wonder why she gets lonely 
You've got to show her no doubt
She's your one and only, yeah

A kiss goodbye, a kiss hello
You wonder why she gets lonely 
You've got to show her no doubt
She's your one and only, yeah

We make promises, promises
And late at night you make big plans
Someday we'll run away 
And leave the love demands, yeah

Two sides of love
Two sides of low
Two sides of love
