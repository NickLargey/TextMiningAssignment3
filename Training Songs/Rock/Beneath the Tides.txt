Setting sail from a crushed rooftop
Fathoms deep, shallow as a raindrop
Attempt to feel 20/20 now
React like gasoline cornered by a house fire

You can't come clean
You can't come clean
You can't come clean

Beneath the tides of the washout
Beneath the tides of the washout

Cut from the filthy cloth
A sucking would left in our chests
Being burned around the heart
The boil under your flesh

Hidden at home
Chasing a tucked tail now
Acting on the instinct
Of self haphazard yet

You can't come clean
You can't come clean
You can't come clean
You can't come clean

Beneath the tides of the washout
Beneath the tides of the washout
Beneath the tides of the washout

The saving down, the saving down, the saving down
In milligrams with a gun in your hand
Directionless, directionless
Memories of combat on your head

Rain can't soak what is not there
Rain can't soak what is not there
Rain can't soak what is not there
Rain can't soak what is not there

The first thrill demands another
Consequence, the trigger of the operative
Playing Russian roulette with a full chamber
Miserable outcome, one and the same want to know

You can't come clean
You can't come clean
You can't come clean
You can't come clean

You can't come clean
(Beneath the tides of the washout)
You can't come clean
(Beneath the tides of the washout)
You can't come clean
(Beneath the tides of the washout)

In the washout
Beneath the tides of the washout
In the washout
Beneath the tides of the washout

You couldn't ever come clean
Beneath the tides of the washout, washout
