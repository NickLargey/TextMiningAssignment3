I've always wondered
What it would be like
Just you and me baby
Nothin' else
We meet again
Both of us by circumstance
Stay with me
We might never get the chance to 

Hold on to love
Just one night
Don't try to fight about it
Take me I'm yours
For just one night 

Don't be alone
And think of what
We could have had,
You'll wonder why
You ever let this moment pass
You can't deny
We see it in each other's eyes
Close the door
Leave this lonely world outside to 

I, I, I
I, I, I
We might never
Get this chance
Hold on to love
Don't try to fight about it
Take me I'm yours
Just one night 

Hold on to love
Just one night
Don't try to fight about it
Take me I'm yours
For just one night
