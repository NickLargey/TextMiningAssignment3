I'm another king and a robber
I'm a brother trampling on your dreams
Before they stand in the way of mine
He's a fighter with hunger for disaster
A desire changing the fate of the world
But words are left unheard

Feel the weight on your shoulders
Is there anyone anymore
To slow our fall
Yeah
All those people
All that power
Is there anyone anymore
Is there anyone anymore 

Shes a lover true love mocker
And every dollar she earned at the cost of those
Who believed enough to let it show
In the mirror
You will see a winner
A celebrated sinner standing in line with the wind
In a self appointed modern day saint

Feel the weight on your shoulders
Is there anyone anymore
To slow our fall
Yeah
All those people
All that power
Is there anyone anymore
Is there anyone anymore 

It's not about conformity
It's the views of individuality
It's insanity
It's reality
It's the promised land of hypocrisy 

Feel the weight on your shoulders
Is there anyone anymore
To slow our fall
Yeah
All those people
All that power
Is there anyone anymore
Is there anyone anymore
