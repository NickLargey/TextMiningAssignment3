The window's dirty
The mattress stinks
This ain't no place to be a man
Ain't got no future
Ain't got no past
And I don't think I ever can.

The floor is filthy
The walls are thin
The wind in howling in my face
The rats are peeling
I'm loosing ground
Can't seem to join the human race.

I'm living in a hell hole
Don't want to stay in this hell hole
Don't want to die in this hell hole
Girl, get me out of this hell hole.

I rode the jet stream
I hit the top
I'm eating steak and lobster tails
The sauna's drafty
The pool's too hot
The kitchen stinks of boiling snails.

The tax man's coming
The butler quit
This ain't no place t be a man
I'm going back to where I started
I'm flashing back into my pan.

[Repeat: x2]
It's better in a hell hole
You know where you stand in a hell hole
Folks lend a hand in a hell hole
Girl, get me back to my hell hole
