Maybe I have
No grounds to feel jealous
But I'm just a guy
Who's got to tell it like it is
I must be sure of your love
On that I exist 

Is there someone
To whose heart you belong
Just tell me now
Darling I will be gone
But if he is stealing from me
Then that would be wrong 

I stand my ground
Against any man
Who would try to take you from my arms
If you know me at all
You know I don't let go
As long as you want me
That's all I need to know 

I've never been 
What they call the fighting kind
But I'm a man
Who'll defend what is mine
I've built my world around you 

If you know me at all
You know I don't let go
As long as you want me
That's all I need to know

I don't back down
When I've got my feet on the ground
I'm a peace loving man
But I'll take the blows
As long as you want me 
That's all I need to know

I don't back down
When I've got my feet on the ground
I'm a peace loving man
But I'll take the blows
As long as you want me 
That's all I need to know

I don't back down
When I've got my feet on the ground
I'm a peace loving man
But I'll take the blows
As long as you want me 
That's all I need to know
