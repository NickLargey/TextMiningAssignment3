Ten miles east of the highway
Hot sparks burnin' the night away
Two lips touchin' together
Cheek to cheek sweatshirt to sweater
Young love born in a back seat
Two hearts pound out a back beat
Headlights, somebody's comin'
Got to move
Keep a runnin' with the hot rod hearts
Out on the boulevard tonight
Here come those hungry sharks 
Up from the bottom for another bite
 
School girl brushes her hair back
Blue jeans can't hide the bare facts
Bad boy knows where to find her
Runs the light, sneaks up behind her
 
Here come those hungry sharks 
Up from the bottom for another bite
True believers livin' on the borderline
They're just dreamers killin' time
Killin' time, killin time
 
Times are hard for those hot rod hearts
Out on the boulevard tonight
Here come those hungry sharks 
Up from the bottom for another bite
Girl with the hot rod hearts tonight
Girl with the hot rod hearts tonight
Keep runnin' with the hot rod hearts 
Out on the boulevard tonight
Hot rod hearts out on the boulevard tonight
