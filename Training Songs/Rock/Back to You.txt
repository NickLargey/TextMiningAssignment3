When she says she's alone 
Don't believe her at all 
Stay away from the run 
She could dump you for fun 

No! She says, she's a liar 
Oh! She says, now you tell her 
All that you do, and all that you say 
Will be sent, back to you

She can't have no regrets 
'Cause what she does she forgets 
She says "Please forgive me at last 
All the things I've done in the past" 

No! You say that's a lie 
Oh! She says, now you tell her 
All that you do, and all that you say 
Will be sent, back to you

Now she has a romance 
With someone she met in France 
She tries to give love a chance

But she prefers to dance 

No! She says that's a lie 
Oh! She says, now you tell her 
All that you do, and all that you say 
Will be sent, back to you
