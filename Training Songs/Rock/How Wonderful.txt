how wonderful life can be
How happy is another day
All you know is all you feel
Till it?s passed you by
How wonderful life can be
How come you walked this way?
All you know is all you feel
Sometimes it makes me cry

The kids are in the street
The sun is in the sky
I?m still their old fool
They?re the apple of my eye

The dog barks at the gate
The rain pretends to fall
I?m still in love with you
The fear?s not there at all

How wonderful life can be how happy is another day
All you know is all you feel
Until it?s passed you by
How wonderful life can be
How come you walked this way?
All you know is all you hear
Sometimes it makes me cry

The colors of the season
Changing day by day
The leaves already falling
A cold win?s on it?s way
And how I have a reason
To settle back and say
How wonderful life?s become
Just living with the ones I love.
