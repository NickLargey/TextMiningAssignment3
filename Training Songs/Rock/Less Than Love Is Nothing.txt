I give you love but you won't take it
You flip your collar as you leave
The bicycles on cobblestones
The corner cafe all alone
They whisper, they whisper

"Don't let him take your love for granted
Don't think that he's the only one
There's more to love than keeping time
More to reason than the rhyme
So listen, just listen;

Less than love is nothing
And nothing is not enough
And more than anything
I wish you love
Less than love is nothing
And nothing is not enough
And more than anything
I wish you love, wish you love"

Cause there might be love around the corner
These streets have seen it all before
They've seen every up and down
Every callous lucky clown
Mistaken, and sorry now

Cause less than love is nothing
And nothing is not enough
And more than anything 
I wish you love
Less than love is nothing 
And nothing is not enough
And more than anything

I wish you well I wish you might
I wish you were alone tonight 
I wish that I could leave the past behind
For once, I wish that love would last

Cause nothing is not enough
And more than anything 
I wish you loveâ?¦.
Less than love is nothing, less than love is nothing, less than love is nothing
