Bracing myself for that tough spot
Just when I'm sure about what I got
No time to be wasted on the back stroke
I'm looking back on all the things that you broke
So far, so good, so what for?
It's slacking up, but you might not cut it
So far, so good, so what for?
It's growing up, you just can't slow it down
And that's a sure thing
Use what you learned to get up and face another day
Taking your time to get your feet wet
Sometimes you gotta jump in or you'll never see, never
Win
You want to go,
You move to slow
Saving up for nothing that you show or never know

So far, so good, so what for?
It's slacking up, but you might not cut it
So far, so good, so what for?
It's growing up, you just can't slow it down
And I don't know what's in store
But it's so good, so far
And that's a sure thing
And that's a sure thing
Take your time, 'cause you wanna make it
Turn up right in everyway
Make a choice if you're gonna make it
Not for nothing,
You've just gotta reach out your hand
And it's there
You've just gotta reach out your hand
