Yeah, you're abandoned,
so sorry, you're just a waste of their time,
yeah, you've been lied to once again,
yeah, well, they've paid you no,
where are we, where are we now?
Where are we, where are we now?
Old woman, have you seen your better days,
are you feelin' so alone,
well, the times they all have changed,
forgotten,
hungry and cold,
veteran, are you satisfied with life,
are you sleepin' on concrete,
are you forgotten and alone,
poor, homeless in this country,
where are we, where are we now?
Where are we, where are we now? 
Hey senior, have you been taken past your prime,
have you been taken advantage of,
are you forgotten,
tired and poor by the ones you've voted for,
yeah, you're abandoned,
so sorry, you're just a waste of their time,
yeah, you've been lied to once again,
yeah, well, they've paid you no mind,
yeah, you're abandoned,
so sorry, you're just a waste of their time,
yeah, you've been lied to once again,
yeah, well, they've paid you no mind

The slavery of poverty,
no one should be hungry in this country,
enough to feed,
to medicate,
to clothe the backs and housin' for families,
the cuts in care and Medicaid leads me believe our government just doesn't care,
we send our aid,
our misspent funds,
Americans hungry livin' in the gutter
