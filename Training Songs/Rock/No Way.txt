You say you want to stay 
No way, no way, no way
Go, you better go your own way
Hey, don´t need you one more day
`Cause I´ll be fine 
Without you 

Hey baby
Did you really think that I
Would take you back baby
All you ever did was lie

I don`t want you in my life
And I don´t need you by my side
So baby don´t you even try

Time wasted 
You never did me any good
Oh baby just face it
You never loved me like you should
I don`t want you in my life
And I don´t need you by my side
So baby don´t you even try
