All by myself in the morning
Yes, I'm all by myself in the night
I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there playin' solitare.

All by myself I get lonely
Watchin' the clock on the shelf
I love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
'Cause I hate to grow older all by myself.

All by myself I get lonely just sit there
And watchin' the clock on the shelf
I love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
'Cause I hate to grow older all by myself.

Yes, I hate to grow older all by myself
