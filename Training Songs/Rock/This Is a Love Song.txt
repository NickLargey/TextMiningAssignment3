There's too many people around here that haven't 
Seen anything like this before
This is a love song
This is a love song
Feeling the love anymore?
You're not my only faithful lover anymore
I've only been here for a day and a half, but
I haven't been here for no one
This is a war song,
This is a war song
Feeling my love anymore?
You're not my only faithful lover anymore
So come on baby
This is only
Come on lose something more
Ya feeling my love, feeling my love, feeling alone?
You're not my only faithful lover anymore
You're not my only faithful lover anymore
