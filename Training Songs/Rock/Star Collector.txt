Take a letter, keep on going
Where ever it is, she's goin', too.
Give her my autograph and tell her
It's been nice knowin' you.

[Chorus]
She's a star collector (collector of stars)
She only seems to please young celebrities.
She's a star collector (collector of stars)
How can I love her, when I just don't respect her?

When everything is goin' my way,
She wants to be close at hand.
She moves to some other doorway
When things don't go the way she planned.

[Chorus]

It won't take much time before I get her off my mind

[Chorus: x2]
