You should hear the things that they say about me
They're saying "she's no better than she needed to be"
They don't know that he was kind and warn and tender
And soon it's gonna be another unwanted number
Unwanted number
How can I tell them? How can I express?
How it felt to step out of this life and into his embrace

How can I tell them? How can I explain?
All the love that I never had I found in him

There may be a stain on the family name
But if my father was here I think I know who he'd blame
Mother says that he just doesn't care to remember
And all he thinks of me is another unwanted number
Unwanted number

What can she tell me what can I expect ?
Of all the painful lessons that she learned she never earned respect

What can she tell me? What can I believe?
That she really didn't hear me cry
Whenever he would leave

There's a local game where they whisper my shame
They said "he gave his child, he wouldn't give her his name
They would torture me from January to September
And I would give my love to another unwanted number
Unwanted number
Unwanted number

I would give my love to another unwanted number
Oh oh 
Unwanted number
Unwanted number

And I give my love and I give my love 
I give my love to another unwanted number
Oh unwanted number
Unwanted number
And I give my love, no I give my love 
I give my love another unwanted number
Unwanted number, unwanted number, unwanted number
