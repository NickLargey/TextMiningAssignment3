Between these sleepless nights, working all goddamn day aw shit
Success has come with a price so when you’re contemplating fame you should take my advice
Listen- you’ve gotta be yourself, you’ve got to break the mold, personalities are valuable
Every single day and every single night, jealous people will try to bring you down

Hold it down go hard always stay bitch-free
Never let a motherfucker try to get in the way
And if they ever try to stop you slap ‘em in the face

Banging down south but I can’t guarantee

Racks in the back seat, hoes on their knees
Saying i’m their guilty pleasure but their boyfriend hates me
