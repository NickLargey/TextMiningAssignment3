Whatever happened to the crazy dames
With the red ruby lips
Whatever happened to the burning flames
With the swing on the hips
She makes you turn when she passes you by
With a cool kind of look in her eye
She's like a flash from a movie show
Playing up to "Marlowe".
Stiletto heels clicking on the sidewalk
Tight skirts and ruby red lips
Stiletto heels are bound to make the boys talk
About her legs and her wiggeling hips
She doesn't need to speak a word at all
For her figure kind of says it all.
They talk about her in the neighbourhood
For good looks get around
She's always dropping into HolIywood
With the gents of the town
She likes to flirt with the right kind of man
But she can turn them into clay in her hand
And with the sound of her tiny feet
She'll turn heads on main street.
