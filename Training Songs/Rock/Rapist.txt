He's a dirty and evil man
And no one wants to know
He could be living in your town
The sign of the Rapist doesn't show
Young girls come to me
Stalking victims in the street
When it happens no-one sees
You're just dragged down off your feet

[Chorus]
Capital Punishment
A stronger Government

Plastic mask and hairy wig
You're too scared to show your face
You're acting like a dirty pig
You're a cancer of the human race
Filth of society should all die
We need a stronger government
All you gotta do is hang 'em high
We want capital punishment

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x4]
We need a stronger government
Bring back capital punishment

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x4]
Hang 'em, hang 'em, hang 'em high
You watch those fucking bastards die

[Chorus]
