I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this moment all my life
But it's not quite right

And this real
It's impossible if possible
At whose blind word
So clear but so unheard

I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this silence all night long
It's just a matter of time

To appear sad
With the same old decent lazy eye
Fixed to rest on you
Aim free and so untrue

Everyone's so intimately rearranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine

Everyone's so intimately rearranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine

Lost and loaded
Still the same old decent lazy eye
Straight through your gaze
That's why I said I relate
I said we relate
It's so fun to relate

It's the room, the sun, and the sky
The room, the sun, and the sky

I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this moment
