Over baggage baby's dead weight
I can't drag no more.
Restraining orders and phony callers,
You're still stalking.
Baby better back the f*ck off!

When will you learn you lost your turn?
I ain't no show piece, and I never was!

Hate to be loved
(Hate to be loved)
I hate to be loved!
(Hate to be loved)
Don't care for me babe,
'Cause I don't care for you.
'Cause I don't care for you.

Back off baby I got better things to do
Then hanga hanga hang around with you.
One on one and to the world,
You're still talking.
Baby better shut her fucking mouth!

When will you learn you lost your turn?
I ain't no show piece, and I never was.

Hate to be loved
(hate to be loved)
I hate to be loved!
(hate to be loved)
Don't care for me babe,
'Cause I don't care for you.
'Cause I don't care for you.
'Cause I don't care for you.
'Cause I don't care for you.

I'll take a homeless night in the snow.
I'd rather lose it all than deal with your shit.
Don't care for me now, baby.
Don't care for me!
Don't care for me now, baby.
Don't care for me!

Hate to be loved
Hate to be loved
Hate to be loved
Hate to be loved

Hate to be loved
(Hate to be loved)
I hate to be loved!
(Hate to be loved)
Don't care for me babe,
'Cause I don't care for you. 
'Cause I don't care for you.
