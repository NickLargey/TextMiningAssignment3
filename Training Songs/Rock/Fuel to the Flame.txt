When I met you I sad
we would hang out everyday
Now I upset you
from a payphone on Queens West and Bay

She's saying:
The words I'm saying have lost their meaning
Wen I'm so far from my aim
But trying to tell me I'm only dreaming
Is like adding fuel to the flame

When I told you I'd buy a brband new car, first rate
That was a lie to you when I got a Civic from '88

Even though I upset you
I think we make a really good team
I think it's coz I love you
that i've been living in a dream
And it's you who are that dream
and you've already come true
