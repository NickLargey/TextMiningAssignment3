You know we're falling to zero
Hurtin' much more than it did before
I'm always playin? the hero
Cleanin? your mess as you walk out the door

I'm counting things'll change now
Taking it back where it all began
Don't like this merry-go-round
Gotta believe, believe we can

We're coming home, we're coming home
You know it's now or never
No afterglow this time I know
But I'm feelin' kinda better

We're coming home, we're coming home
You know it's now or never
This time I know, this time I know
It's going on forever

I'm counting down to zero
Diggin' my heels in the dirt again
You're not a superhero
Savin? the world to the bitter end

I think it's time that you knew
I'm seein? it all now in black and white
I'd do it all to save you
Changin? the world ain't gonna make it right

We're coming home, we're coming home
You know it's now or never
No afterglow this time I know
But I'm feelin' kinda better

We're coming home, we're coming home
You know it's now or never
This time I know, this time I know
It's going on forever

See me walk away
You know it's now or never
See me walk away
I'm feelin' kinda better

See me walk away
You know it's now or never
See me walk away

We're coming home, we're coming home
You know it's now or never
No afterglow this time I know
But I'm feelin' kinda better

We're coming home, we're coming home
(See me walk away)
You know it's now or never
This time I know, this time I know
(See me walk away)
It's going on forever

I'm feelin' kinda better
