Do you love me like I love you
Or is this good bye bye bye bye
I should have known better than to fall in love with you
Love with you
Well I guess I'll spend my whole life loving you
Loving you
One kiss so warm and tender one kiss and I surrender
My love to you forever more.

But do you love me like I love you baby
Say you'll always love me
Ooh like I love you
And do you need me like I need you baby
You know that I'll always be in love with you.

I should have known better than to give my heart away (heart away)
Well I know true love will always have it's day
Your love can last forever
In love we'll be together
Sharing our love forever more.

But do you love me like I love you baby
