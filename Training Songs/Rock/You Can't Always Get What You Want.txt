I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she was going 
To meet her connection
I could tell 
By her blood stained hands

You can't always get 
What you want
You can't always get 
What you want
No you can't always get 
What you want
But if you try sometimes
Well you might find
You get what you need

I went down 
To the Chelsea drug store
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line 
With Mr. Jimmy
And man 
Did he look pretty ill
We decided 
That we would have a soda
My favorite flavor vanilla cream
And I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
And he said one word to me 
And that was dead

You can't always get 
What you want
You can't always get 
What you want
No you can't always get 
What you want
But if you try sometimes
Well you might find
You get what you need

I went down 
To the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Saying we?re gonna vent 
Our frustration
And if we don't we?re gonna blow 
A fifty amp fuse
