Wasn't meant to be
So long in silence
But it took so long
To belong
I'm bored out of my tiny mind
If this is all it is
Then you're gone to heaven
Race you to the high
Openings
I never knew of
This Is My Time
This Is My Time

Wasn't meant to be
So down underground
Now I see the sun
And I feel like something good is gonna happen
It could always be
That you're there
And I'm here
We'll play around
And then
Sleep until the nightime comes

This Is My Time
This Is My Time

You wanna high
You wanna fly
Your feet are in the underground
And different is indifference and
Nobody's going to hear you boy
But scream on dream on

Wasn't meant to be
So long in silence

This Is My Time
This Is My Time
This Is My Time
This Is My Time
This Is My Time

Coming home
Coming home
