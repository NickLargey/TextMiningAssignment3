She loved rings and string
Like music rite of spring
She'd often choose it
She spoke like greetings soaked in time
Her autumn colored hair was fine
She wore cottons quite a lot
She loved dark tea and coffee pot
She lived with a dog and cat
Forever yours and after that

I remember that to holly everyone was good
No one has ever loved the way holly could
She never cared about herself the way she should
No one will ever treat you like holly would

She collected dolls up dressed
And always spoke of her friend Yasmine
She was fond of poetry
Durelvion Cummings, E.E.
She loved riding in a train
And catch me was her favorite game
She loved the yard, Bernard and Clay
She only ate one meal a day

I remember that to holly everyone was good
No one has ever loved the way holly could
She never cared about herself the way she should
No one will ever treat you like holly would

I remember that to holly everyone was good
No one has ever loved the way holly could
She never cared about herself the way she should
No one will ever treat you like holly would
