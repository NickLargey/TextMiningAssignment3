So surprised, 
I fought windmills. 
So surprised, 
I saw angels. 
I know my place in this

So surprised, 
I had visions. 
So surprised, 
You were in them. 
I found my place in this world. 

It's you I swear, 
it's you I swear, 
I delight in your despair. 
(I'll wait for you) 
It's you I swear, 
it's you I swear, 
Giving me the right 
(I'll wait for you) 
It's you who lied, 
it's you who lied 
When you had to swallow pride 
(I'll wait for you) 
It's you I swear, 
it's you I swear

So surprised, 
Thoughts escaped me. 
So surprised, 
Words escaped me. 
I know my place in this
