When love's in vain, love can be so strange
There ain't nothing I can take to kill this pain
Set me free
Why don't you, Rosa Lee?

She is a dream, but she's so hard to please
She moves around like an Egyptian queen
Set me free
Why don't you, Rosa Lee?

I'm so afraid of losing you
But there's only so much that a man can do
For Rosa Lee
Why don't you set me free?

When I hit the road the time goes slow
Thinking about the places I used to go
With Rosa Lee
Why won't you set me free?

They're trying to close the Tu y Yo
The Latin playboy and the sky room shows
Rosa Lee
Why don't they let them be?

I can't get used to losing you
But there's only so much that a man can do
For Rosa Lee
Why don't you set me free?

People say that you were made for me
I knocked my head [?]
But they'll never know the hurt it takes to be
Rosa Lee

When love's in vain, love can be so strange
But I never thought I'd wear a ball and chain
Set me free
Why don't you, Rosa Lee?

Set me free
Why don't you, Rosa Lee?
Why don't you set me free
Why don't you Rosa Lee, yeah

Why don't you set free, why don't you set free
You got to set me free
You got to, you got to, you got to set free, baby, ah, yeah, ooh
