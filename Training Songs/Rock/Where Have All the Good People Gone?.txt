Oh the Milky Way has gone a little sour
The leaves dried and the flower fell away
I've been sitting, I've been waiting for a sign
Inhuman beings taking up all of my time

Want to leave but I've got to stay
And I'm wondering more everyday 
Montreal to Hong Kong
Where have all the good people gone?

Traffic jam but I'm on the shoulder
Took ten cops to pull me over
Bangkok to Babylon
Where have all the good people gone?

I haven't met a friend in a long long while
They don't check my head but they check my style
The modern world is a cold cold world
And all I meet are cold cold girls

Want to leave but I got to stay
And I'm wondering more every day
Montreal to Hong Kong
Where have all the good people gone?

Traffic jam but I'm on the shoulder
Took ten cops to pull me over
Bangkok to Babylon
Where have all the good people gone?

And it's always the same
We all just turn away
We are stealing from ourselves
We are feeding off ourselves

But we were born in the flames
We need a cool breeze and a summer rain
We are stealing from ourselves
We are feeding off ourselves

Oh the Milky Way has gone a little sour
The leaves dried and the flower fell away
Want to leave but I've got to stay
And I'm wondering more everyday 

Montreal to Hong Kong
Where have all the good people gone?
Traffic jam but I'm on the shoulder
Took ten cops to pull me over

Bangkok to Babylon
Where have all the good people gone?
Time's up and we're running long
Where have all the good people gone?
