Baby can you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be mad

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood

Baby sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
With other times it seems that all I have to do is worry
And then I know you're bound to see my other side

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood

If I get mad at you I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get my share
But that is one thing I would never do 'cause I love you
Oh whoa whoa, don't you know I'm human
I've got my faults just like any one
Sometimes I lie awake long regretting
Some foolish thing, some sinful thing I've done

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood
