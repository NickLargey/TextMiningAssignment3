Is it the faggot in you that's doing the talking,
why can't you accept what you see ?
Could it be you're afraid that you're not quite as straight
as you've been making yourself out to be.
'Cos you talk about it like it's
A disease in desperate need of a fast remedy.
You keep on telling us all how you feel so damn sorry
for their pain and all their agony

The male that's inside of you
is rejecting the female inside of you
find the faggot in you

Tell me one thing why can't you realize it's not something a person can plan
It's not like you wake up and get out of bed and decide to
fall in love with a man. It's there or it's not, and there's no right
or wrong and there's no big decision to make, 
cos' we are what we are and and we feel what we feel and that's something you'll just have to take

The male that's inside of you
is rejecting the female inside of you
find the faggot in you

In you're so certain that you can't fall in love
with a man then what is there to fear
It could well be that the truth of the matter
is in fact that you're actually queer

If you're sure and you feel secure about yourself and your reality
then why do you need to reject and refuse where other people stand sexually ?
you've got a problem if you have got a problem with seeing two people embrace 'cos regardless of sex race color or creed,
it's something you'll 
just have to face

The male that's inside of you
is rejecting the female inside of you
find the faggot in you
