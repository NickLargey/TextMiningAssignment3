Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)

I'd paint a picture for you here
But I would sooner disappear
Than let you know what's on my mind
But then I'd leave myself behind

And I know
That I can't, I won't
I'll tell you that I don't
But I need you on my side
And I'll stay, I'll go
I'll tell you I may know
But I need you on my side

Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh ooh

How do you give yourself to me?
I send you my words silently
I have been tongue-tied for a while
'Cause I can't go that extra mile

And I know
That I can't, I won't
I'll tell you that I don't
But I need you on my side
And I'll stay, I'll go
I'll tell you I may know
But I need you on my side

Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)

I'm expecting something
When my hands are cold
And I can't fight this feeling
Or what I've been told
'Cause everything I'm asking of you
Just too much to hold

'Cause I can't, I won't
I'll tell you that I don't
But I need you on my side
And I'll stay, I'll go
I'll tell you I may know
But I need you on my (side)
I need you on my
I need you on my

I can't, I won't
I'll tell you that I don't
But I need you on my side
And I'll stay, I'll go
I'll tell you I may know
But I need you on my side

Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh ooh)
