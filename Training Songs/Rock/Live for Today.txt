Standin' in the pourin' rain
Watchin' all my years
Feelin' all the pain
Gonna take some time 
For this heart of mine to find
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose
Its time for you to choose

Live for today
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
Why spend your time bein' somewhere you don't want to be
Rely on faith to get you through your sorrow
Nothing can stand in your way
So live for today

Lovers seem to fade away
Like a promise made 
It's the price you have to pay
It's gonna take some time
For this heart of mine to shine

Sometimes you win sometimes you lose
Its time for you to choose

Live for today
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
Why spend your time bein' somewhere you don't want to be
Rely on faith to get you through your sorrow
Nothing can stand in your way
So live for today
So live for today

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose 
It's time for you to choose

Live for today
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
Why spend your time bein' somewhere you don't want to be
Rely on faith to get you through your sorrow
Nothing can stand in your way
So live for today
So live for today

Live for today
Don't wait until tomorrow
Live for today
Live for today
