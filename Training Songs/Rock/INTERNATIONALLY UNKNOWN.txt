I'm internationally unknown, I'm internationally unknown
I'm internationally unknown, I'm internationally unknown

I don't know where we're gonna go
I'm internationally unknown

I was born lost, last in the family
In a town where they never, ever planned me
Just like the others, thank f*ck we found each other
Sittin', smokin' spliffs, 16 undercover, 'til
'Til under covers when I met my first lover
She broke my heart when she ran off with my brother
I showed no tears throughout my teenage years
'Cause sellin' bales with my peers is better than now 'cause

I don't know where we're gonna go
I'm internationally unknown
I don't know where we're gonna go
I'm internationally unknown
(I'm internationally unknown)

Screamin', real music ain't ever on the radio
Rippin' up my cigarettes, pullin' out tobacco
Don't let 'em know it's hid under my pillow
Lookin' back, now it don't seem too long ago
At the time, I thought they were the worst times
Right now, I think they were the best, 'cause
Now I'm alone with my conscience on my chest
My life, ain't lookin' forward to the rest, so

I don't know where we're gonna go
I'm internationally unknown
I don't know where we're gonna go
I'm internationally unknown

Raised on a diet of free porn and stale bread
Always started on by the boys on the mopeds
Out late, we never went to bed
No street cred, I might as well have been dead, so
Walk ahead, talkin' shit in the back shed
I wouldn't flip for five scenes, rather die instead
Misled by government in the power
Now I work a dead end job, minimum by the hour

I don't know where we're gonna go
I'm internationally unknown
I don't know where we're gonna go
I'm internationally unknown
(I'm internationally unknown)
I don't know where we're gonna go
I'm internationally unknown
(I'm internationally unknown)
I don't know where we're gonna go
I'm internationally unknown
