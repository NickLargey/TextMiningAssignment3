Kickin' it out

Your dream vacation
Small hostage refuge
A work in progress
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile
I beg to differ
Make me an offer
Warm summer rain
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile

Hey, are you okay?
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward
Do you feel okay?
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah handsome awkward)

Your market value
Your resurrection (your resurrection)
Your shallow concept; help yourself
I hope you choke and you die
I know you meant it
Nice fucking disguise (so hollow)
Embrace the burn
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile

Hey, are you okay?
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward
Do you feel okay?
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward

You look pretty low
You look pretty low

Your dream vacation
Small hostage refuge
A work in progress
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile
I beg to differ
Make me an offer
Warm summer rain
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah handsome awkward)

Hey, are you okay?
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward
Do you feel okay?
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward

Do you feel okay (okay)?
You look pretty low
Pretty low, pretty low
Pretty handsome awkward

Do you feel okay?
You look pretty low
Pretty low, pretty low
(Handsome awkward)
Pretty handsome awkward

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, kickin' it out
Yeah, yeah, pretty low, yeah, yeah, kickin' it out, pretty low!)
