What can I say
My claim to fame
Won't come in the shape
Of hearts and flowers

What will it take
Everything that I know
And all the things that I've learned
To overcome what's next around each turn

How come I've been walkin' in circles
Believin' that the things that I love
They will always be perfect and around

How come I've been needing a purpose
Assuming that the world even cares
If we all live or die

Or die
Or die
Or die
If we all live or die
If we all live or
If we all live or
If we all live or die
If we all live or die

What can I say
I have no shame
I can't complain
But I will anyway

What will it take
I gave it all that I had
Everything I ever give
I even gave her my heart
And she left with him

Or die
Or die
Or die
If we all live or die
If we all live or
If we all live or
If we all live or die
If we all live or die

We watch
Everyone walkin' in circles
So many turns
That it might seem like I'm hurtful
But the truth is
I'm really just lookin' for ways
That we could all be makin' a change
Fly together like one in the same
Ride together like a charm and chain
But that won't happen 'cause we're d-d-deranged
So addicted to watchin' you laid
Dark ass wanna be strange
Like me live only days
Like we best of friends
But reality kicks me a message
And I guess I learned a lesson
From the test that I was given
Just like all the rest is nothin'

If we all live or die
If we all live or
If we all live or
If we all live or die
If we all live or die

What can I say
I'm livin' today
I'm feelin' alive
But death is creepin'

What will it take
My love is dead in a grave
And now I'm smillin' in court
And they keep askin' my what your secret again

Or die
Or die
Or die
If we all live or die
If we all live or
If we all live or
If we all live or die
If we all live or die
Or die
Or die
Or die
If we all live or die
Or die
Or die
Or die
If we all live or die
