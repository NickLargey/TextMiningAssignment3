Well I jumped a plane for the Greek Isles
Ouzo and moonlight had me all smiles
A villa, a yacht and a private beach
I thought happiness was in my reach
Jackie O she like my tan
Jackie O said I was her man
Then one night I walked in the door
I looked in the mirror this is what I saw

This town is boring this town is dead
This town ain't what it used to be
This town ain't the place for me

So I travelled to London and points in between
And everywhere else that I ain't been
I felt everything that there was to feel
Made my money on the roulette wheel
I did a hundred things I hadn't done before
Looking for something and something more
I was getting tired of messin' about
One night in Soho I just had to shout

This town is boring this town is dead
This town ain't what it used to be
This town ain't the place for me

Now New York is New York on Seventh Avenue
People and places and things to do
Where the rat race reaches its peak
Ten million people playing hide and seek
So I was surprised when someone said to me
What's it like in your town I'm goin' there you see
Ain't nothin' happenin' in this dirty old town
I need some excitement I gotta get down

We all gotta get up and go to work
Go home and cook the dinner
And if you're in Tangiers or Kathmandu
That don't mean you're on a winner
In Manhattan or Paris you can hear people say
This town is boring I gotta get away
If I had the money I'd leave today
This town is boring and I can't stay

This town is boring this town is dead
This town ain't what it used to be
This town ain't the place for me
