Now's the time 
Just come with me 
Gonna show you 
Everything I've seen 
Have you ever 
Had a dream 
Never be alone 
Just come with me 

All around the world 
With every need 
Just look in my eyes 
and you'll find me near 

All around the world 
What ever you do 
Just share with me 
I'll walk with you 

I'll walk with you
