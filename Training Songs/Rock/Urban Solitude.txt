I've got a bug in my head 
And a jumping heart 
No time to spare 
Turn left turn right step on it 
Stopped by the traffic light 

And all that honking screaming 
The cabdriver is dreaming 
Of the beach and babes 
Leaning back easy as the sun goes down 
But I'm already late 
No time to spare, couldn't care less about it 
If the sky was falling down 
No I don't care you can stare while the whole world is crumbling around me 

Urban solitude breaking me down 
Keeps me dreaming 
Urban solitude shaking me down 
Keeps me dreaming 

So you've got a lot of stuff on your mind 
Or a bleeding heart when nobody cares 
Step in, step out of the rain 
Head for the flickering lights, just head for the flickering lights 
There's always somebody dancing, taking a chance 
You can find a little romance, someone will give you love 
Although it's just enough to get you through the night 
Well alright now 
No I don't care you can stare 
I don't care about it 
No I don't care you can stare, while the whole world is crumbling around me 

Urban solitude breaking me down 
Keeps me dreaming 
Urban solitude shaking us down 
Keeps me dreaming
