On the train to another town trying to make our way to the football ground.
Every weekend another game, everywhere we go itÂ´s always the same.
A few hours later itÂ´s over again a 4-1 less we didn't have a chance.
WeÂ´re leaving the stand weÂ´re on the move out on the streets all hell breaks loose.

Everywhere we go

WeÂ´re invading the town, this city is ours, tearing down fences and smashing up bars.
The smell of teargas is in the air, the riot squad is coming but we donÂ´t care.
Police try to stop us but they never will, the firm is too strong and we kick to kill.
Never surrender! WeÂ´re going all the way, the city is on fire we had a hell of a day!

Everywhere we go
