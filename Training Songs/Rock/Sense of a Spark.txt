Let other words fail
I don't find it fair.
But anyway
This little string keeps on pulling
So I gotta pull myself down some different path
Inside my mind
Needs out
I wanna trip myself away
But I better wait I better wait I better wait

I get the sense of a spark so I follow
"I don't believe that she knows something I know"
I tell myself as I stay in the shadow
I tell myself not to go, but I go
Needing to see
Whichever way she's going

If there's any way
So far from here
There's little fear
Her words could ever hurt me
I Don't want to wait.
Don't want to wait.
Don't want to wait I...

Don't look don't talk don't yell
Just close your eyes
This may or may not come
As some surprise
I've found obsessions
Which to live and die by
Don't look don't talk don't yell
Just close your eyes
