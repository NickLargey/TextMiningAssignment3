Real, almost real 
I could feel the life flow into my veins 
Done, now it's done 
I have fallen for the final time I can't get up again 

Love's a mystery, I don't understand 
Love's supposed to make you glad 
Tell me why I feel so bad 
Love's a mystery, I don't understand 
I won't see you anymore 
And if that's what love is for 
Then I don't understand 

Free, now you're free 
You don't need me and you don't want what I give 
Baby, here is my heart 
Please, help me please 
'Cause if life is made for hearts in love then how am I to live 

Love's a mystery, I don't understand 
It's so hard to be alone 
When the one you love is gone 
Love's a mystery, I don't understand 
You won't stay another day 
And if that's all you can say 
Then I don't understand 

Love's a mystery, I don't understand 
I won't see you anymore 
And if that's what love is for 
Then I don't understand
