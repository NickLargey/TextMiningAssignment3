Landslide of love
Tonight to stars are shining
But inside I feel I'm dying
And there's no whisper in the wind
In my room I'm all alone
Waiting on the telephone
But I know it ain't gonna ring
That ain't the way it's meant to be
Every hour so long and empty
But I know that it ain't everything

Landslide of love you thrill me
Landslide of love you could kill me
Landslide you hit me from above
Landslide of love you keep calling
Landslide of love I keep falling
But I can never get enough
Landslide of love

A thousand times I've spared a thought
To all those whose hearts are torn
But it's so far way from home
Right until the bitter end
Who believes it would fall on them
'Till it cuts you to the very bone

Tragedy ain't for me
I was born to be free
But there's no escaping these chains
These chains of love
That will defy me
Like a power from above
These chains of love

Landslide of love you thrill me
Landslide of love you could kill me
Landslide you hit me from above
Landslide of love you keep calling
Landslide of love I keep falling
But I can never get enough
Landslide of love of love
