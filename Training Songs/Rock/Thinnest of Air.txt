How promising the start
Of the letter being read until the captain proclaimed
"Dying is my heart"
Then a hush befalls the crowd as the theatre exclaimed
"Now our hero's part is played"
And they continue as the lights come on and they get up to go:
"And we are all betrayed
For our champion he screams and cries like us"
Do they deserve to know that

Yes I'm unprepared
And in the face of it all I guess I get just the littlest bit scared
Yeah me
I feel around the darkness of an empty house and there's nothing there
Just a terrified chameleon hiding out in the thinnest of air

Should the love inside me die
Come save me, I'll be drowning
Just a few feet from the beach
Please give it your best try
Though I may do my best to
Distance you and keep your arms from reach

I'm really asking you to stay
But the only way that I know how
Is by riddle or by game
It seems no one wants to play
And as I float on out to sea
I never really sink, I just drift and say that

Yes I'm unprepared
And in the face of it all I guess I get just the littlest bit scared
Yeah me
I feel around the darkness of an empty house and there's nothing there
Just a terrified chameleon hiding out in the thinnest of air

If ever I can ease your pain
Well I don't think I'd release you
I'd spin fairy tales instead
Or else you'd never need me again
And though I know that hold's pathetic
It's letting go that I greater dread

Call it a joke to hide a dream
It takes a great deal more than joking
To make any dream come true
So rock & roll and kick & scream
For what it's worth I can't
Resist this flame and fire to finally
Say to you that

Yes I'm unprepared
And in the face of it all I guess I get just the littlest bit scared
Yeah me
I feel around the darkness of an empty house and there's nothing there
Just a terrified chameleon hiding out in the thinnest of air
