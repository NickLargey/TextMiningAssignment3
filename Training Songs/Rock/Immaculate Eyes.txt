You're impatient
I get bored when there's no conversation
I lose desire 'cause you're not what you appear to be
Not what you appear to be

Imperfection has left no trace upon you
Your reflection -- you depend upon it
You might be beautiful but what's behind it?
You have a pretty face but what are you hiding?

I'd rather stare at the stains on my window
Than look into those immaculate eyes
I'd rather gaze at the dust on my pillow
Than look into those immaculate eyes

Invitation
Signals you are sending
Hesitation like a neverending vertigo inside of me
Vertigo

No doubt I could look at you for hours
But it's no good when good looks overpower
You might be beautiful but what's behind it?
You have a pretty face but what are you hiding?

I'd rather stare at the stains on my window
Than look into those immaculate eyes
I'd rather gaze at the dust on my pillow
Than look into those immaculate eyes

If there's more to you than meets the eye
Why can't I find it?
You laugh sweetly
When I ask you if your beauty's skin-deep

I'd rather gaze at the dust on my pillow
Than look into those immaculate eyes
Your immaculate eyes
