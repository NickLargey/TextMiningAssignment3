(Save the mantaray!)

Don't show me, I'm always wrond
Off and on and off and on
TV show don't bring me joy
Teaching me how to destroy
Paper walls are paper thin
God, I really hate you, Tim
Let that woman out your flat
Don't stand in the way like that
Sitting
Waiting
Thinking
What is it you're looking for?
Talking
Barking
Pushing
What?

When the words don't work anymore
And you're talking to yourself on your knees on the floor
What will you do, what will you do, what to do?

Feed the mantaray, feed the mantaray
Feed the mantaray (save the mantaray!)
Feed the mantaray, feed the mantaray
Feed the mantaray (save the mantaray!)

Teeth are breaking in my mouth
The earth is shaking in my house
Scratch until there's nothing left
Take what's best and leave the rest
Paper walls are paper thin
I don't really hate you, Tim
Let that woman out your flat
Don't stand in the way like that
Calling
Walking
Running
Leavers
Lying
Cheating
People
Oh

When the words don't work anymore
And you're talking to yourself on your knees on the floor
What will you do, what will you do, what will you do, what will you do?
What?
(Save the mantaray!)
What?
What?
(Save the mantaray!)

Feed the mantaray, feed the mantaray
Feed the mantaray, save the mantaray
Feed the mantaray, feed the mantaray
Feed the mantaray, save the mantaray

What?
What?
What?
What, what, what, what, what, what?
