Wah wah one and one is two
We got a drama
I'm watching TV and I don't need you
Bring on the drama
I'll tell you something and you know it's true
You're full of drama
My piss is yellow and the sky is blue
W got a drama

Spare me
You're draining me

Wah wah one and two is three
Bring on the drama
There's something wrong yeah I agree
We got a drama
I'll tell you something that you're choking me
With all you're drama
Life stinks and the grass is green
We got a drama

Spare me, you're draining me
Draining me, draining me, draining me
You're draining me

Spare me, you're draining me
Draining me, draining me, draining me
