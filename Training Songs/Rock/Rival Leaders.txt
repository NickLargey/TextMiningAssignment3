The countdown has started to go
Computers are locked on their foes
The president is on his way
Down to live another day
10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1
Here we go
The fail safety mechanism is off
The baby lies sleeping in its cot
The mother reads her magazine
Her son's in the kitchen eating ice cream
10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1
Here we go
The 4 minutes warning starts to go
Soon you'll be dead you'll never know
It's started to lift off its pad
It's on its way isn't that sad
10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1
Here we go
The countdown has started to go
Computers are locked on their foes
Thatcher is on her way
Down to the bunker for another day
