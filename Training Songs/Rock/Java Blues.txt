Stopped by a diner, and the blond behind the counter
 Asked if she could help in any way
 I could tell by her smile, her number I could dial
 If I was in the need of company
 I asked her for some Java
 Instead she brought a cup of chickory

A taste of Java is like a volcanic rush
 Nobody's gonna stop me from drinking too much
 Costs many more than you care to pay
 But money is nothin, compared to a fired-up day
 Don't try to cheat, it's impossible to beat
 The only pick-me-up that's here to stay

Java Blues... coffee's got me
 Java Blues... coffee coffee coffee
 Java Blues... well the coffee's got me
 Java Blues... coffee coffee coffee

You know that I'll stay high
 Drinkin coffee till I die
 Java blues

Won't you boil me water, fill up my cup
 You know it takes a lot to keep me up
 Down in Bolivia, the people are insane
 They want as much for Java as they do for cocaine
 Don't try to cheat, it's impossible to beat
 The only pick-me-up that's here to stay

Java Blues... coffee's got me
 Java Blues... coffee coffee coffee
 Java Blues... you don't know what it does to me
 Java Blues... coffee coffee coffee

You know that I'll stay high
 Drinkin coffee till I die
 Java Blues...
