Well I'm standin' on a corner  with a bucket in my hand
I'm waitin' for a woman that ain't got no man
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
It won't hold no beer

Well, there ain't no use of me workin' so hard
When I got a woman in the boss man's yard
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
It won't hold no beer

Well, I went upon the mountain I looked down in the sea
I saw the crabs and the fishes doin' the be-bop- bee
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
It won't hold no beer

Well I'm standin' on a corner with a bucket in my hand

Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
It won't hold no beer
