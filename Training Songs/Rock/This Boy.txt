It seems this boy's bathed in ridicule
Too forward, way too physical
It's time that I had another
I'm always wanting more, if there's another one
Give me some more, I'll have another one
I'll have a slice of your mother

This boy's quite spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
I want a car
I want a car

I sees losers losing everywhere
If I lose it'll only the damn I give for another
I am complete, invincible
If I have one set principle
Then it's to stand on you, brother

This boy is so spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
I want a car
I want a car

If I like cocaine, I'm racing you
For organic fresh Echinacea
One kick's as good as another
If I'm tired, I'm tired of telling you
I'm never tired, I'm always better than you
Bye-bye boy, run to your mother

This boy is so spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
I want a car
I want a car
