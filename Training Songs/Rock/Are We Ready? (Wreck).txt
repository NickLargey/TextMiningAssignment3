Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

We are the sacred cow
Stand up, take a bow, you're wonderful
You should be comfortable, don't think at all
Just don't think at all, think at all

Now, now you're digging around
What will you write about?
How did you find that out?
You get paid, don't need any respect
Senses fading, she's no lady

Oh, we've made a mistake
We've lost our minds
We've lost our memory
Oh, what's it gonna take?
There's always something else
Waiting on the shelf

You could be president
You never paid the rent but I don't mind
You got no reason to learn what came first
It can't be good enough, good enough

Now, now you're throwing the stone
You never simplify
Somebody stretch your eye
What will you say with that mind of your own?
Are we ready, hold it steady

Oh, we've made a mistake
We've lost our minds
We've lost our memory
Oh, what's it gonna take?
There's always something else
So occupy yourself

I saw the world today
It comes in green and gray
Refrigerator humming, chewing gum and instant karma
The wars are whoring, all the stores are bored with all your money
We follow what's to come
That's what they sold to me

Now, now you're throwing the stone
You never simplify
Somebody stretch your eye
What will you say with that mind of your own?
Are we ready, hold it steady

Oh, we've made a mistake (now, now you're throwing the stone)
We've lost our minds (you never simplify)
We've lost our memory (somebody stretch your eye)
(What will you say) oh, what's it gonna take? (with that mind of your own)
There's always something else (are we ready) waiting on the shelf (hold it steady)
