Gravity keeps pulling me down
Gravity keeps pulling me down
Gravity keeps pulling me down
Gravity keeps pulling me down
Gravity keeps pulling me down
Gravity keeps pulling me down
Gravity keeps pulling me down

I want to go to Houston, I want to fly to the stars
But I may not have the "right stuff" to make the trip to mars
'cause it's so hard for me to get my weight off the
Ground
Yes, it's that gravity it keeps pulling me down

I want to climb mount Everest, and find my shangri-la
Learn the secrets of the universe from the wise man in Nepal
But it's so hard for me ? that mountain's so steep
I know my nose will bleed, 'cause gravity don't sleep
It don't sleep?

I'm floating? I'm floating? Above the crowd
No tensions? No pressures? I touch the clouds

I'm flying? I'm flying? In ecstasy
My problems can't find me zero gravity

Gravity keeps pulling me down
That gravity keeps pulling me down

I want to be a driver at the Monaco grand prix
Have the fastest car in Europe, and meet the royal family
But it's so dangerous ? it's not the speed that I fear
It's just so difficult to get my motor in gear

I want to be a millionaire, and own a baseball team
Have a private jet for shopping trips, and a
Chauffeured limousine
And pay no income tax, and be healthy and sound
But it's my gravity it keeps holding me down
