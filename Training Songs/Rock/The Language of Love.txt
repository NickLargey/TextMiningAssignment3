She says no 
When she means yes
And what she wants, you know that I can't guess
When we want more, you know we ask for less
Such is the language of love....

I say leave 
When I mean stay
But she don't see and so she moves away
What we really want, you know we rarely say
Such is the language of love

It's tooth for tooth & eye for eye
We hide our hearts & then we won't say why
It's truth for truth & lie for lie
Such is the language of love

One cries foul
And will not speak
The other claims a little victory
And all the time
You know we fail to see
This is the language of love

When a love begins to wander
No one ever knows
But we feel it deep inside us 
Long before it shows
Long before it shows

We hem & haw
We balk & bluff
Our words don't ever seem to say enough
But a simple smile 
A tender touch 
Speaks the true language of love
