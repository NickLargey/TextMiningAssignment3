I think it's time we talked this over
I think you've taken this too far
I never wanted to be different
Didn't ask to be nobody's star
Try to take control of it, 'cause
What you see is what you get
Try to take control of it and not me

You say there's talk of revolution (so what's new?)
You say there's fighting in the air
You think that I've got the solutions
But do you really think that's fair?
Try to take control of it, 'cause
What you see is what you get
Try to take control of it and not me

All right, now

Don't wanna be nobody's hero
I don't wanna be nobody's star
Don't wanna be nobody's hero
Get up, get out, be what you are

You think it's time you took me over
To do what you can't do yourself
But don't let heroes get your kicks for you
It's up to you and no one else
Try to take control of it, 'cause
What you see is what you get
Try to take control of it and you'll see

Don't wanna be nobody's hero
Don't wanna be nobody's star
Don't wanna be nobody's hero
Get up, get out, be what you are

You think you're nobody
And I have all the fun
But no one is a nobody
Everyone is someone

Don't wanna be nobody's hero
I don't wanna be nobody's star
Don't wanna be nobody's hero
Get up, get out, be what you are

Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
Be what you are
