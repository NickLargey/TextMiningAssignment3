I see your breath
Your words in frozen space tonight
I hear a distant bell and you appear
Like some ancient one I'd never really seen

There's a light falling from your hair
A photograph I thought I'd lost somewhere
You're all of this to me my dream
And a universe of you I've never seen

And now it seems not long ago
I was emptiness and you arose
And as the day fades to night
May we ever love fade into light

I feel the stillness of your eyes
And shadows fall away
The promise of a spring is waiting there
Underneath it all
Underneath it all

The sky is crying heavens raining tears
The flood of sorrow runs a million years
But across this universe or just next to me
You are calling

And now it seems not long ago
I was emptiness and you arose
And as the day fades to night
May we ever love fade into light

And as the day fades to night
May we ever love fade into light
