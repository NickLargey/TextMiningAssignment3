That's a stupid hat you're wearing 
It doesn't really match your hair 
Did I ever tell you that your breath is worse 
Than what you wear 

That's exactly what she told him 
At least that's what he told me 
So I guess we could conclude 
They're not a happy family 

Love's not what you see between the legs of the majority 

That's a lovely dress you're wearing 
Too bad your figure can't make it work 
When I hear the things you say 
I wonder if your brain can work 

That's exactly what he told her 
At least that's what she told me 
I scream my calls, I lock my doors 
I'm suddenly filled with apathy 

Love's not what you see between the legs of the majority 
Although, I'd like to add the game in bed is a necessity 
To make me happy 
Make me happy 
Love's not what you see between the legs of the majority 
Although, I'd like to add the game in bed is a necessity
