Lisa, one more time for old time's sake
Come save me, from this crazy world I'm in
My dreams are weak and falling into this
Hole inside my bed
Where the pieces of this life we put together
Oh can't you see it in my eyes
Lisa, you're the dancer to the song
Without your music
All the words just seem so wrong
And like a picture you keep fading
Your colors running dry
Save the pieces of this life we put together.
Oh Can't you see it in my eyes?
Oh won't you save a place for me tonight,
Find a space for me and light
this corner of my lonely life
Lisa, my beginning and my end
I need ya
You're my lover and my friend
My future would be brighter if you'd only answer yes
And help me put these pieces back together
Can't you see it in my eyes
And won't you save a place for me tonight
Find a space for me and light
this corner of my lonely life 

Can't you see it in my eyes
Lisa, One more time for old time's sake
Lisa, save me from this world I'm in
Lisa, my beginning and my end
Lisa, you're my lover and my friend
Lisa, Lisa
Lisa, Lisa
