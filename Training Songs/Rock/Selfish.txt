(Lisa Lindebergh/Andreas Karlegard)

Impossible vain
You told me I was totally without shame
I thought to myself
This kind of luck is my middle name
Boy you need to know
Sometimes I think I'm out of my head
The bigger the words
The stranger I feel
So give me a chance to explain
And erase all bad things
I've said

You tell me I'm selfish,delirious
That's not what I am
I tell you I'm speechless,Do do do do
You know who I am
I've got a little sparkle,Do do do do
Inside of me
And you tell me I'm selfish,delirious

In between days
I wanna paint a rainbow
To cover all the gray
In between days
I wanna kiss and tell to end
This game we play
I wish you could read my mind

You tell me I'm selfish,delirious
That's not what I am
I tell you I'm speechless,Do do do do
You know who I am
I've got a little sparkle,Do do do do
Inside of me
And you tell me I'm selfish,delirious

Tell me do you cry
I cry all the time
Tears that are turning to ice
I cry
Sparkle come alive
Sparkle that melt I

I wish you could read my mind

You tell me I'm selfish,delirious
That's not what I am
I tell you I'm speechless,Do do do do
You know who I am
