One too many times I fell over you
Once in a shadow I finally grew
And once in a night I dreamed you were there
I cancelled my flight from going nowhere

It's all I can do
To keep waiting for you
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

One too many times I twisted the gate
When I was crazy I thought you were great
I kept my renditions of you on the wall
Where holiday romance is nothing at all

It's all I can do
To keep waiting for you
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

You wait in the wing like a Saturday flirt
Protecting the judge, you don't want to get hurt
Once in a moment it all comes to you
As soon as you get it you want something new

It's all I can do
To keep waiting for you
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

It's all I can do
To keep waiting for you
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

It's all I can do
To keep waiting for you
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

It's all I can do
To keep waiting for you
It's all I can do
It's all I can do
