Lowly deserter, sing that old song
And sing a new one for the men
Still in battle, far from heaven
Raise your voice up and sing to them

Lowly, lowly, it must be lonesome
Take a hard look at yourself
And your brother still in battle
Sing his praises, or don't sing again

When that question comes to find you
Don't deny you never ran
And when that feeling comes to take you
Take you walking the streets of hell

When that question comes to find you
Don't deny you never ran
And when that feeling comes to take you
Take you walking the streets of hell
