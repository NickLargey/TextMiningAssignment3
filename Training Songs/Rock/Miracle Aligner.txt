Tell him what you want and baby he can find you anything you need
Tell him what you’re needing, hey, oh
Come on miracle aligner
Go and get 'em tiger
Get down on your knees
Get down on your knees again oh

Fifty feet tall and revved up too high
All of our exchanges are by candle light
I just realized
He'll walk through the walls and creep up behind
Make sense of the maze that you were stuck outside
Cover your eyes

Often the humble kind but he can't deny
He was born to blow your mind
Or something along those lines, tonight

Tell him what you want and baby he can find you anything you need
Tell him what you’re needing, hey, oh
Come on miracle aligner, go and get ‘em tiger
Get down on your knees, get down on your knees again, oh oh

So what’s the wish, he’ll make it come true
Simple as a line out of a doo wop tune
He’ll make the moves

Often the humble kind but he can’t deny
He was born to blow your mind
Or something along those lines 
Tonight

Tell him what you want and baby he can find you anything you need
Tell him what you’re needing, hey, oh
Come on miracle aligner, go and get ‘em tiger
Get down on your knees, get down on your knees again, oh oh
