There ain't nothing you can do
to love somebody and they don't love you
there is nothing you can say
you don't want to go but you're leaving anyway 

Her beauty took me be surprise
she was the woman of my dreams
could not see beyond her eyes
she turned around 
and left me somewhere in between

There ain't nothing you can do
to love somebody and they don't love you
there is nothing you can say
don't want to go but you're leaving anyway 

Packed my suitcase and my guitar
tryin' to leave it all behind
lord, I tried my best to be her big star
now I'm tryin' just to get her off of my mind

There ain't nothing you can do
to love somebody and they don't love you
there is nothing you can say
don't want to go but you're leaving anyway 

There ain't nothing you can do
to love somebody and they don't love you
there is nothing you can say
don't want to go but you're leaving anyway
