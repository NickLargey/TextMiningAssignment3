The smoke ring?s running through your hair
There's a look in your eyes
I see a glint of smile on your face
But I know that smile ain't mine

Oh, a fool he is
Oh, a fool he is

They say everything has a place in time
But this ain't one of those times
I feel there's something in the air
Just don't know what, don't know why

What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been

Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up my mind for me?
Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up my mind for me so easily?

There's a love life breaking through the dawn
But where will I be when morning comes?
I feel it, feel it in my bones
Just don't know where my feeling goes

What a fool I've been
Oh, what a fool I've been

Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up my mind for me?
Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up my mind for me?

They say there's a time and place for everything
But this ain't one of those times

What a fool I've been
Oh, what a fool I've been

Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up my mind for me?
Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up my mind for me so easily, so easily?

Have you made up your mind, girl?
