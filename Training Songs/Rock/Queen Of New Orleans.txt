She said baby our love's just like your songs
The beat ain't bad but the words are all wrong
It's time to pack my bags, it's time to just move on
She sang johnny, I'm gone, gone, gone
And she was gone

Me and leigh met summer of '95
In a burgundy dress lookin' finer than a french wine
A cajun queen with another side
She was a schoolboy's dream, I was out of my mind
She was lookin' fine
She said "you want to drive me home"
But what I didn't know...

Ooh, ooh - I was dancing with the
Queen of new orleans
Ooh, ooh - dancing in the streets of new orleans
Ooh, ooh - dancing cheek to cheek in new orleans
Ooh, ooh - it was almost like a dream

That night I made a move, man I felt hard
When I put my hands in her cookie jar
She was more than a girl, she was a cabaret star
I was a deer in the lights of a speeding car
Nothing's what it seems
She was a venus de milo in her sister's jeans

Ooh, ooh - I was dancing with the
Queen of new orleans
Ooh, ooh - dancing in the streets of new orleans
Ooh, ooh - dancing cheek to cheek in new orleans
Ooh, ooh - it was almost like a dream

Ooh, ooh - I was dancing with the
Queen of new orleans
Ooh, ooh - dancing in the streets of new orleans
Ooh, ooh - dancing cheek to cheek in new orleans
Ooh, ooh - dancing with the queen down bourbon st.

Ooh, ooh - I was dancing with the
Queen of new orleans
Ooh, ooh - dancing in the streets of new orleans
Ooh, ooh - dancing cheek to cheek in new orleans
Ooh, ooh - dancing with the queen down bourbon st.

Ooh, ooh - I was dancing with the queen of new orleans
