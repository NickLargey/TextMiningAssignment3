Is she somewhere in the city, is she somewhere in this town?
What's her name, what does she look like, is she fun to be around?
Does she make you feel like I did, oh, so long ago?

I wanna hear it from you, tell me that it's over
Let me hear it from you, tell me that it's over
I wanna hear it from you

First you look at me with anger in your eyes then you look at me with spite
That's if you look at me at all, that's how I'm looking at you tonight
You tell me that love's a drag for you but when the lights go out you panic

I wanna hear it from you, tell me that it's over
Let me hear it from you, tell me that it's over
I wanna hear it from you

I know I must be some kind of fool
To be in love with you, to be in love with you

Tell me that it's over, let me hear it from you
Tell me that it's over, I wanna hear it from you
Tell me that it's over, let me hear it from you
Tell me that it's over, I wanna hear it from you

Tell me that it's over, I wanna hear it from you
Tell me that it's over, let me hear it from you
