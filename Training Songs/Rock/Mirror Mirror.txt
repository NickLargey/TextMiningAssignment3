I think I missed you in the elevator
I think I missed you when I shot too high
Just like the bullet in the temple baby
I really miss your eyes
I know I missed you in Andalusia
I think I missed you when I took my time
Just like that photograph that Carroll drew ya
I think my shot was wide
Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me why you make things fall
Mirror mirror look at me
Tell me why we disagree
It's so complicated

Just when you think you've got the one in sight
He starts to run into the crowd of cages
With all that bleeding light
I think I've got the combination
I think I've got my settings straight
I measured time like he was half-crustacean
And now he makes me wait
Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me why you make things fall
Mirror mirror look at me
Tell me why we disagree
I've resorted to aphorisms

Somewhere between love and jism
Stolen like the blanket 
I stain on bended knee
I'm afraid of my own drop shadow
I'm frozen by the coming youth
I'd like to see the dotted line 
Between flies and truth
Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me why you make things fall
Mirror mirror look at me
Tell me why we disagree
