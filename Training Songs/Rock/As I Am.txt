Oh, in another place and time, oh, I will be the vision in your mind
I wanted to be everything you wanted
I wanted to be everything you needed
I wanted what I said

To bring to you laughter
I wanted what I did to make you smile
But in a perfect world
There's no perfection

'Cause in a world of dreams
You're only dreaming
I want it to be real
I just can't take it

As I am
Take me as I am
Now I'm only flesh and blood
Oh I wish that you could

Love me as I am
You thought you had me
Tucked inside your pocket
You thought you had it under your control

You can put my smiling picture in a locket
But you can't put a chain around my soul
But in a perfect world
There's no perfection

'Cause in a world of dreams
You're only dreamin'
Don't make me feel like I can't make it
As I am

Take me as I am
Now I'm only flesh and blood
Oh I wish that you could
Love me as I am

As I am
Now I'm doing the best I can
Try to understand
And love me as I am

Oh, in another place and time
Oh, I will be the vision in your mind
As I am
Take me as I am

Now I'm only flesh and blood
Oh I wish that you could
Love me as I am
As I am

Now I'm doing the best I can
Try to understand
Now I know God has a plan
And I guess that's why she made me

As I am
