I've got that lefty curse 
Where everything I do is flipped 
And awkwardly reversed 
You're seldom known and barely missed 
I always put myself 
In destructive situations 
I need oxygen 
To be exposed where no one goes, where no one's been 
When it all comes crashing

Now we've got a big, big 
Mess on our hands tonight. (sing it) 
Now we've got a big, big 
Mess on our hands tonight. 

Somebody get my phone 
So I can throw it in a public 
Pool and watch it float 
And as it slowly sinking down, 
Become a social ghost 
Inside a box, cut at the top 
To let some light shine in 
To remind me what I've done and where I've been 
When it all comes crashingÃ¢?Â¦ 

Now we've got a big, big 
Mess on our hands tonight. (sing it) 
Now we've got a big, big, big, big 
Mess on our hands, on our hands. 

Don't give in, don't give up, 
I'll be gone. 
You don't look innocent enough. 
We're too young to be critics 
We won't miss anything at all 
Don't give in, don't give up 
I don't look innocent with this big big mess on, 
I'll say something else. 

Oh, we've got a big, big mess, 
Oh, we've got a big, big mess, 
A big, big mess, 
Now we've got a big, big mess, 
A big, big mess 

Now we've got a big, big 
Mess on our hands tonight. (sing it) 
Now we've got a big big 
Mess on our hands tonight. 
Now we've got a big, big, big, big 
Mess on our hands 

Don't give in, don't give up 
I'll be gone. 
I don't look innocent enough 
We're too young to be cynics 
We won't wish any harm at all 
Don't give in, don't give up 
No one looks innocent with this big big mess on our hands tonight. 

When it all comes crashing.
