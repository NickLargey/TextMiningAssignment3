It's a terrible love that I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's a terrible love that I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's quiet company, it's quiet company

It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's quiet company, it's quiet company
It's quiet company

And I can't fall asleep
Without a little help
It takes awhile to settle down
My ship of hopes
Wait til the past?

It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break

Company
It's quite company
It's quiet company

But I won't follow you into the rabbit hole
Last night I woke but then I saw
The ship of woes but didn't want me to

It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's a terrible love that I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in

It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
