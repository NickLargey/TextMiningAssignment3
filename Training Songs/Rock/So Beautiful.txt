Verse I
Another show, another freestyle another note,
Another seed sown deep into the hearts of those
Through a microphone speaking in a hyper tone 
Flights around the globe from Japan to Calico
I'm only one man with one chance, and one command
God as my witness I won't given, I'm all in
No matter how big or small or monies involved
I won't falter or fall I'm giving you my all

Chorus
Every time, every mind, every music note,
Man, it's beautiful, it's so beautiful
Every city, every town, every decimal,
It's irrepressible, I'm a professional
Every kick, every snare every line I write,
It's because you are my light
Every vision, every dream, every sleepless night,
Is right there when I hold this mic

Verse II
You called me again called me your friend
Even when I didn't call back ye still lent me your hand
When I didn't have a cent, and on the floor we slept
You still kept a close eye though I didn't understand
Every mile I drove every city and home
Another mile stone, wild you never left me alone
Though I don't always get it, I could never forget it
How you saved me made me, forever I'll tell it

Chorus
Every time, every mind, every music note,
Man, it's beautiful, it's so beautiful
Every city, every town, every decimal,
It's irrepressible, I'm a professional
Every kick, every snare, every line I write,
It's because you are my light
Every vision, every dream, every sleepless night,
Is right there when I hold this mic

BRIDGE
When I'm out of line,
You're always by my side,
And when I fall behind,
You pick me up/
When I try to climb,
Feel like I'm losin' my mind,
You, I can always find,
You're beau-ti-ful/

Verse III

Every time I fell down you knelt down to help out
Ye so proud of me now, you called me to reach out
With these sounds and freestyles overseas to speak out
I can see it now you had it planned for awhile
When everything else fails you are where I dwell
Wind under my sails, thunder that brings health
Wonder of the earth, love and cover my hurts
Up and coming so stunning you've been healing my world

Chorus
Every time, every mind, every music note,
Man, it's beautiful, it's so beautiful
Every city, every town, every decimal,
It's irrepressible, I'm a professional
Every kick, every snare every line I write,
It's because you are my light
Every vision, every dream, every sleepless night,
Is right there when I hold this mic

Every time, every mind, every music note,
You're Beautiful,
Every city, every town, every decimal,
You're Beautiful,
Every kick, every snare every line I write,
You're Beautiful,
Every vision, every dream every sleepless night
Is right there when I hold this mic
