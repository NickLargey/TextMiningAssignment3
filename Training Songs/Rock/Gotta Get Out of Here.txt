I know you know why
When I see you smile
When I you you said I
I wanna have your mind

Oh,I've gotta get out of here
(You know better)
Have to move fast and clear
(I've got it back)
Gotta get out of here
Before it's to late

I know you know I've try
But I'm no longer foul
You can't see when I lye
'Cause I don't liked you cool

No I've gotta get out of here
(You know better)
Have to move fast and clear
(I've got it back)
Gotta get out of here
Before it's to late
Before it's to late

You moved off love we care
You got me running scare
You throw a love's I care
I've gotta go, I've gotta go
I've gotta go, I've gotta go

Have to move fast and clear (4x)
(I've got it back)
Gotta get out of here
(You know better)
Have to move fast and clear
