Pearl, listen to me now
I'm about to bring it down
There are things I need to tell you that can't wait
I've been doubting in my sleep
There are secrets I keep
Maybe in the end I'll find a way to stay
Oh but pearl it don't feel that way today

Well it wasn't long ago
I was down upon my knees
Begging you to change your mind again
You were tired of trying to love me
And had put yourself above me
You try to leave a pearl I don't let go
It isn't till tonight now I know

There's a world outside our window
There's the mystery of desire
I can wait to make you happen
I can set this house on fire

Listen now, i'm about it to bring it down
"Are we meant to be?" I'll ask again
As I wait for your reply
Hear the traffic passing by
Tomorrow I'll be far away from here
Pearl I'll be far away from here
Through the world outside our window
Though you're all that I desire
I couldn't make you happen
So I set this house on fire

There's a world outside our window
There's the mystery of desire
I couldn't make you happen
So I set this house on fire
