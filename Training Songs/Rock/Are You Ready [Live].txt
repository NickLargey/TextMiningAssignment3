Are you ready?
You can trust me all the way
Are you ready?
Well, then let me hear you say

That you're ready
And the world will know it's right, yeah
Yes, you're ready
And you know it's out of sight

Now you're ready
Well, then what you waitin' for?
If you're ready
You just open up your door

'Cause I'm ready
For everything you got
Said, I'm ready
Come and get it while it's hot

Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

Ready
Ready
Ready
