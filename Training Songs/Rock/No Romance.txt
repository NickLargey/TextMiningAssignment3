If you're looking for some answers
Well you've come to the wrong place
You might find lines, but no valentines
Written all over my face
I bear no grudge, I wear no frown
I just come with calloused hands
And I don't mean to bring you down but
There is no romance.

I've spent too much of my life waiting
Hoping, dreaming, wishing, believing,
And way too little of it living
Smashing it up and taking and giving
I wish someone had warned me
While I was still a young man
And saved me lots of time and money
There is no romance.

No romance, no romance, no romance, no romance
No romance, no romance, no romance, no romance

Save your stories for the bartender
And your crying for the theater
And your poems and your diary pages
To kill some time in your old age.

Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh

There may be gods who hear your prayers
And honest men who, men who care
And young lovers who say they will wait forever
Lives that look like movies and books
But the sooner that you learn this
The sooner you free your hands
To get on with things that really matter
There is no romance.

Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh
