Well, since my baby left me, I found a new place to dwell
It's down at the end of lonely street, that's Heartbreak Hotel
I felt so lonely baby, I felt so lonely
I've been so lonely, baby, I could die

The bellboy's always crying, the ladies dressed in black
They been so long on lonely street
They'll never ever come back
I've been so lonely baby, I've been so lonely
I've been so lonely, baby, I could die

People talkin' all around about the way you left me flat

I don't care what those people say
I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind, and it terrifies me too
The way you call me another guy's name
When I try to make love to you

So if your baby leaves you, got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street to Heartbreak Hotel
I've been so lonely baby, I've been so lonely
I've been so lonely, baby, I could die

Heart breaker, heart breaker
Hotel
