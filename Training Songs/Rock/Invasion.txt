They came across the border in the middle of the night
It was much much worse in the cold daylight
There's hundreds of tanks and thousands of men
And helicopters buzzing right above your head

[Chorus]
Oh no, it's an invasion, invasion
Oh no, it's an invasion, invasion

They're moving out of cities, they're moving out of towns
If you're caught resisting you're quickly mown down
Everybody's running, but they don't know where
So long as they escape, well they just don't care

[Chorus]

You can't understand, why they murder your land
But you can't fight a tank with a stick
And you want to fight back, but the future is black
And the killing is making you sick
The tanks pass by, in a never ending line
Not a man or a woman is spared
And then you wonder why, no help does arrive
The world doesn't seem to care

You've formed a small resistance, you've got a few guns
You plan a small ambush, but you end up on the run
You're running through the foothills, but you'll never make yourcave
You're just another rebel in an unmarked grave

[Chorus]
