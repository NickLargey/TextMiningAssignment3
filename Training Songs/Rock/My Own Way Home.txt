MY OWN WAY HOME
WRITERS GLENN SHORROCK, BRIAN CADD

The lights in my eyes they are starting to hurt me, I no longer need them to see where to go, you're showing me signs in too many directions, I'll find my own way home ... "I've got something fantastic I know you can use," said the five and dime prophet on the ten dollar news, he's asking me to share his vision while looking down at his shoes, how can I work out what he's saying, how will I know if he's telling the truth ? The lights in my eyes they are starting to hurt me, I no longer need them to see where to go, you're showing me signs in too many directions, I'll find my own way home ... For the secret of romance turn to page 94, then take of all the boxes and add up your score, radio heartbreak can save any marriage, and that's what "AM" is for, opinions of numbers don't add up to nothing, I've already done it - I've been there before ... The lights in my eyes they are starting to hurt me, I no longer need them to see where to go, you're showing me signs in too many directions, I'll find my own way home ... Oh, no, why can't they let things be, I'm outa here - that's enough for me. Woah, the lights in my eyes they are starting to hurt me, I no longer need them to see where to go, you're showing me signs in too many directions, I'll find my own way home ... The lights in my eyes they are starting to hurt me, I no longer need them to see where to go, you're showing me signs in too many directions, I'll find my own way home ... I'll find my own way home, I'll find my own way home, leave me alone I will find my own way home (repeat)
