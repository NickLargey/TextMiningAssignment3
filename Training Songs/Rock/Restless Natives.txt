Alone among the hills and stone
Through summer sun and winter snow
The eagle he was lord above
And Rob was lord below

240 years
We lived without hope and without pride
So who will know where they come from
Who raised a torch for those who died

I will be with them
In the summer sun
And the winter snow
They will come and clouds will go
And show that we are proud again

Though all we lost in autumn days
Cannot be born again
Stand here by me
Until the ways of age and youth
Are one and same
