(mick ralphs)

Listen woman you needn't look so stupid when I call your name out loud
Cause everybody thinks you're a sweet smelling girl with intelligence and you
Know how
I wouldn't want anyone else to know
About the way you really are
You're just a rock and roll queen
You know what I mean
And I'm just a rock and roll star

Listen woman you needn't go to bed with everybody that you meet
Cause everybody thinks you're a sweet little girl with intelligence in your
Feet
I wouldn't want anyone else to know
About the way you really are
You're just a rock and roll queen
You know what I mean
And I'm just a rock and roll star
Alright!
You're just a rock and roll queen
You know what I mean
And I'm just a rock and roll star
