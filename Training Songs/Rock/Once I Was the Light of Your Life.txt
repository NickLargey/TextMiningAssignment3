(Hugh Prestwood)

I see you stranger standing there
Far across the room
Do you remember when Forth Worth 
was in bloom

You know it wasn't all that long ago
That we were in the dark
One touch would light up the
whole would with a spark

No one here tonight would guess how
wrapped up we were

Once I was the light of your life
You really made me shine
Every letter that you sent to me
Was a valentine
These days all we've got to say
Is how you doin, I'm fine
But once I was the light of your life
And you were the light of mine

Maybe the planets didn't line up right
Maybe the time was wrong
Maybe forever was a little bit too long

But still we had about as fine of time
As two true lovers could
Before the magic was up and gone for good

Even though I'm not much more than 
a shadow now

Once I was the light of your life
You really made me shine
Every letter that you sent to me
Was a valentine
These days all we've got to say
Is how you doin, I'm fine
But once I was the light of your life
And you were the light of mine
