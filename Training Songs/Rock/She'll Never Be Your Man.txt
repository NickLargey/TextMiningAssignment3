The AM finds me home alone, awake and dead
Morning blinds me had that dream of you again
Fog is lifting I realize that you're not here
How you left me, life disappeared

Life is rejection, I know you've had your share
But this one's special, I can't compete with her
And did she tell you only she could know your mind
And did she sell you what I said one time

[Chorus]
She can be your lover
She can be your friend
She can be your vision of a mother, like the one you never had
She will know your troubles better than I can
But she'll never be your man
She'll never be your man
She'll never be your man

She's got you thinking of a world where you might fit in
A whole lot better than the one you've been living in
And did she tell you only she could understand
And did she sell you only time will tell

[Chorus]

She can be your lover
She can be your friend
She can be your vision of a mother, like the one you never had
She will know your troubles better than I can
Yeah, but one thing's for sure
She'll never be your man
She can be your lover
She can be your friend
She can be your vision of a mother, like the one you never had
She will know your troubles better than I can
Yeah, but one thing's for sure
She'll never be your man
She'll never be your man (Never be your man)
She'll never be your man (Never be your man)
Never be
She'll never be your man
