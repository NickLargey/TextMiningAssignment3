Two divided by love
Can only be one
And one is a lonely number
Two divided by love
Can only be sad
Can only hurt one another

Every night your tears come down
And I know how youre feelin inside
Loneliness is no ones friend
Ive been takin the same kind of ride
And that just shouldnt be
If youre still lovin me
Come on baby

Two divided by love
Can only be one
And one is a lonely number
Two divided by love
Can only be sad
Can only hurt one another

Id by lyin to myself
If I said I was gettin along
All I do is think of you and I know
That its here you belong
Come on girl make your way
We can start from today
Puttin it back together cause

Two divided by love
Can only be one
And one is a lonely number
Two divided by love
Can only be sad
Can only hurt one another

Take away the rain from a flower
And the flower just cant grow
Take away you from me girl
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind

Two divided by love
Can only be sad
Can only be broken hearted
Two divided and blue
Should take what they had
And go back to where they started

Two divided by love
Can only be one
And one is a lonely number
Two divided by love
Can only be sad
Can only hurt one another
