Seems like yesterday, we just flew away
I have done my best
Against the odds and then
From time to time your'e gone
It makes me feel so strong
And when I get that way, all my dreams fade away
In the time it takes to love me - I love you
Time and space won't keep us down
I see your face and my feet don't touch the ground
We could fall in love, we could change the world
We could see each other floating through the girl
And every move i make takes me back to you
And when we're sure it's over
The light comes shining through
In the time it takes to love me - I love you
Time and space won't keep us down
I see your face and my feet don't touch the ground
Listen to me now, the stars are all asleep
Shoot me through the clouds, 'cause you still hold the key
To open up my heart
That's when the screaming starts
I heard she's leaving town, so I won't stick around
In the time it takes to love me - I love you
Time and space won't keep us down
I see your face and my feet don't touch the ground
Time and space won't keep us down
I see your face and my feet don't touch the ground
We can fall in love, we can change the world
We can see each other floating through the girl
Time and space can't keep us down
Can't keep us down
