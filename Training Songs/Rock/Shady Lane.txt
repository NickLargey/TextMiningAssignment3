Blind date with a chancer, we had oysters and dry lances
And the check when it arrived, we went dutch dutch dutch
Dutch a redder shade of neck on a whiter shade of trash
And this Emory board is given me a rash
I'm flat out
You're so beautiful to look at when you cry
Freeze don't move
You've been chosen as an extra in the movie adaptation 
Of the sequel to your life

A shady lane 
Everybody wants one
A shady lane
Everybody needs one
Oh my God, oh your God, oh his God, oh her God
It's everybody's God
The worlds collide
But all that We want is a shady lane

Glance don't stare
Soon you're being told to recognize your heirs
No not me
I'm an island of such great complexity 
Distress surrounds
In the muddy peaceful center of this town
Tell me off
In the hotel lobby right in front of all the bellboys
And the over friendly concierge

A shady lane 
Everybody wants one
A shady lane
Everybody needs one
Oh my God, oh your God, oh his God, oh her God
It's everybody's God
The worlds collide
But all that We want is a shady lane
