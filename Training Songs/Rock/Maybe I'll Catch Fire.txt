This house is full of ears but I can't talk to anyone
They've heard this one a thousand times
Most exciting thing I do
Hang half way out a third floor window,
Maybe throw lit cigarettes down
And maybe I'll catch fire,
Something warm to hold me,
Something pure to burn away the darkness
That hides inside my mind
All that evil shit's not hard to find
I guess I only claim to be nice

This house is full of eyes but I can't look at anyone
They've seen this face a thousand times
Most relaxing thing I do
Hang half way out a third floor window,
And look at rocks if I fall out,
And maybe I'll fall hard,
Something tough to break me,
Something sharp to rip into my insides 
And bleed out all that pain
Sorry I don't even know your name
I guess for me it's easy this way

Maybe I'll catch fire,
Something warm to hold me,
Something pure to burn away the darkness 
That hides inside my mind
All that evil shit's not hard to find
I guess I only claim to be nice
