We're self imploding
Under the weight of your advice
I wear a suitcase
Under each one of my eyes

Finally,
I know now what it takes
It takes money
And aeroplanes

If you Love me let me go
Back to that bar in Tokyo
Where the demons from my past leave me in peace
(ah ah ah ah)
Ill be animating every night
The grass'll be greener on the other side
And the Vampires and Wolves won't sink their teeth
(Ah ah ah ah)
I'm sick of dancing with the beast

Astrophysics,
You'll never be my closest friend
I find no comfort
In what my mind can't comprehend

Finally,
I work out what it takes
It takes money
And aeroplanes

If you Love me let me go
Back to that bar in Tokyo
Where the demons from my past leave me in peace
(Ah ah ah ah)
Ill be animating every night
The grass'll be greener on the other side
And the vampires and wolves won't sink their teeth
(Ah ah ah ah)
I'm sick of dancing with the beast

No matter how much it needs me
Go on and follow someone else's lead

If you Love me let me go
Back to that bar in Tokyo
Where the demons from my past leave me in peace
(Ah ah ah ah)
I'll be animating every night
The grass'll be greener on the other side
And the Vampires and Wolves won't sink their teeth
(Ah ah ah ah)
I'm sick of dancing with the beast
