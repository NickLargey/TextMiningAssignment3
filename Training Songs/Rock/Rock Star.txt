They put a shrine for you in rolling stone,
And sixteen servants weeping at your throne,
Yeah and I love you ten times more dead than alive,
I want to hold your kid and make love to your wife.

I want to be a rock star too yeah,
I want to be a rock star just like you.

I'm never gonna see you old or see you wise,
Forever young as jesus crucified,
I want to put my mouth on you and make you breathe,
Open up wide and sing for me,

I want to be a rock star too yeah,
I want to be a rock star just like,
I want to be a rock star too yeah,
I want to be a rock star just like you.

Fame, I'm gonna live forever,
Fame, I'm gonna live forever.
