You might be knocking
Knocking knocking at my door
Don't you wonder, baby
You'll find me
Rocking rocking
Back and forth on the floor

I hear a rocking song
It'll take just as long
I need to enter the screen
To walk through the mirror
Down through that hallway
Within the walls, the length of my spine

I rock for my mama
Rock for my papa
Rock for my sister to get things right
I rock when I'm lonely
Rock for you only
Only you to hold me tight

This is a rocking song
It'll take just as long
I need to enter the screen
To walk through that mirror
Down through that hallway
Within the walls, the length of my spine
I rock for my body
The feel for my body
I rock for a rhythm a reason a rhyme
Just sittin' there swaying
Pretending I'm trying
When I should be fighting for

Sea of time
Did you learn how to swim
Did you learn how to move
Sea of time
Did you learn how to swim
Did you learn how to move

You might be knocking
Knocking knocking at my door
Don't you wonder, baby
You'll find me
Rocking rocking
Back and forth on the floor

This is a rocking song
It'll take just as long
I need to enter the screen
To walk thru that mirror
Down through that hallway
Within the walls, the lengh of my spine
I rock for my body
The feel for my body
I rock for a rhythm a reason a ryhme
I rock for my freedom the feel of my freedom
I rock for a passion a party a thrill
Now there's someone pointing at me
With a finger
'Cause I should be fighting for

Sea of time
Did you learn how to swim
Did you learn how to move
Sea of time
Did you learn how to swim
Did you learn how to move
If you don't want to drown in this muddy water
You will have to move
You must learn how to swim
You have to have a plan
I follow my own little plan
And it's right here
And when I looked
I saw
That somebody had erased my video scrapbook
And I said, shit!
Is there nothing sacred anymore?
Hmm
Did you learn how to swim
Did you learn how to move
Yeah, did you learn how to move
And you gotta watch out for what they say
'Cause they, sometimes they say
Take it easy
Take it easy, now
But I know that
Waking up ain't easy, no
When you're lonely
Sea of time
Did you
Did you learn
Now, did you learn how to swim
Now, did you learn how to move
Did you?
You wanna, you wanna drown in this muddy water
Muddy water here I come, huh!
I wanna drown
Sea of time
Call me easy
Say I'm strong
Love me my way
It ain't wrong
Ooh yeah
Time
Sea of time
Ooh
Did you learn
Call me easy
Say I'm strong
Love me my way
It ain't wrong
