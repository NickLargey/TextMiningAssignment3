There's no sleep inside
Their dreams are broke and inspired
All the times you try to
Scream
Houses dark indoors
And blinds are pulled and closed
Everything that needed
Change
And there`s nothing wise
Or twice as good as nice
You save it all inside while you
Hang your head
Hang your head
Underneath it all
Your smile your smile your smile is flawed
And the songs you sing are only
Spoken
The promise of this child
You crossed your palms with silver crowns and the
People swore he's only
Choking
There's no promises
No light is ever shed
Between the living and dead
Hang your head
Hang your head
There`s no promises
No light is ever shed
Between the living and dead
