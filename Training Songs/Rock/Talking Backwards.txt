We can talk for hours
And the line is still engaged
Were not getting any closer
You're too many miles away

And I might as well be talking backwards
Am I making any sense to you
And they only thing that really matters
Is the one thing that I can't seem to do

When the night was over
And the field was lit up bright
And I want to tell you
Nothing I said came out right

And I might as well be talking backwards
Am I making any sense to you
And they only thing that really matters
Is the one thing that I can't seem to do

And I might as well be talking backwards
Am I making any sense to you
And they only thing that really matters
Is the one thing that I can't seem to
Make sense of this dream
It's the one thing I can't seem to do
