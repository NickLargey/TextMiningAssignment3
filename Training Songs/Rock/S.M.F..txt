Black sheep of the family, nothing like the rest
Separate from the others, failing all their tests
Can't they see you're different, so hungry and so lean
You're a walking wonder, you're a metal machine
Look and you'll see you're a lot like me

CHORUS:

You're an S.M.F.
You're an S.M.F.
You're an S.M.F.
You're an S.-M.-F.

Caught up in their worries and tomorrow's dream
Missing all the living, milk without the cream
They think you're so foolish, living for today
Caring just what you think, not what others say
Join with us, oh, how they'll scream and fuss

REPEAT CHORUS

Solo - Jay Jay

We're the ones that live it, we're all really free
And if they think that we're sick then sick is what we'll be
Scream it loud, Know what you are, be proud

REPEAT CHORUS
