There’s no such thing as a harmless joke
There’s no such thing as a gentle toke
There’s no such thing as panama jack

Who’s got the crack? Who’s got the crack?
Who’s got the crack? Who’s got the crack?

I am a goat in a moat with a boat

Who’s got the crack? Who’s got the crack?
Who’s got the crack? Who’s got the crack?

I like it when my hair is poofy
I like it when you slip me a roofy
I like it when you've got the crack

Who’s got the crack? Who’s got the crack?
Who’s got the crack? Who’s got the crack?

I wanna be a hippie but I forgot how to love
It’s hard to be a garbage man when a sailor stole my glove
I wanna be reckless but I’m feeling so uptight
Put your mama in a headlock baby and do it right

Who’s got the crack? Who’s got the crack?
Who’s got the crack? Who’s got the crack?
Who’s got the crack?
