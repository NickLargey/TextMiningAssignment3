You want to hear a story
A story 'bout a broken man
You're just trippin' nowhere
Or is it hard for you to understand
That I'm a man

I'm so sick and tired of you
You better not touch me
I'm so sick and tired of you
And the crazy things you do
I'm getting sick and tired
I'm getting sick and tired

And I'll die just to get to you
Baby, I will lie just to get to you
But I ain't never gonna cry

So you want to hear another story
Another story in a different place
But when it comes to lovin'
I will leave you with a broken face
'Cause I'm a man

I'm so sick and tired of you
You better not touch me
I'm so sick and tired of you
And the crazy things you do
I'm getting sick and tired
I'm getting sick and tired

And I'll die just to get to you
Baby, I will lie just to get to you
But I ain't never gonna cry
No way

I don't believe that I will live forever
But I do believe that I will die
And I'm gonna drive by a hundred miles
'Cause I'm a high-flying sucker with a super smile

Die 
Just to get to you
Baby, I will lie just to get to you
But I ain't gonna cry

Just to get to you
Baby, I will die
Just to get to you
Baby, I will die, die

Just to get to you
And, baby, I will lie
Just to get to you
But I ain't gonna cry

Just to get to you
But, baby, I will die
Just to get to you
