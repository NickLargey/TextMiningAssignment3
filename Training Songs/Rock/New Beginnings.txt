Hand-me downs and photographs spread across the floor
A broken record spins in circles, she can't listen anymore
She's turned around a thousand times; she set that bridge afire

But did you want to listen?
You took the world with you, so what is left for me?

I called you on the phone again, just the other day
It sounds to me you've found your place and everything is great

But did you want to listen?
You took the world with you, so what is left for me?

I've tried so hard to figure out why
No explanation keeps me waiting
That's fine because I know that you won't forget
Even if the story is over
