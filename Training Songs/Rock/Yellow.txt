Well I've tried and I've tried and I cannot conceive. 
'Coz the air that I breathe is the air that I bleed. 
And I've lied and I've lied and I just can't believe, that you went a way. 
And I've danced and I've danced all upon the blue skies. 
And I've looked at the sun and I've looked at the stars. 
And I still can't believe how naive, I am.... yellow 

I'm falling.... yellow 
Take my hand.... yellow 
I'm falling.... yellow 
Take my hand. 

I've looked in the mirror and I've seen a pale face. 
And my minds drifted back to that secret place. 
Where you'd hold me and tell me the ground, wasn't too far away. 
And I believed all the times that you helped me come down. 
I drowned in the rain and I flew far away. 
I'm still quite amazed how well, I am.... Yellow. 
I'm falling.... yellow 
Take my hand.... yellow 
I'm falling.... yellow 
Take my hand. 

Yellow.... I'm falling 
Yellow.... take my hand.
