Must have been a mistake
While you make things hard for me
Wouldn't hurt you at all if I didn't have to
Give in it's our first fight
Now that I see this side
I want to more than I did before
This night has opened my eyes
I know you, hope I do now
Communication's down
I know you, hope I do now
We come closer
Temptations, they crumble by your side
You say you wouldn't hurt me at all
Can't be sure that you mean it
If it's worth holding on to, we can't stay in between it
I know you, hope I do now
Communication's down
I know you, hope I do now
We come closer
A comfort to us all
Insured against a fall from normal life
Afraid to be at it alone
To shoulder I wonder is it safe for now
This could go either way
This could work out between us, or never again
Make it clean, how realistic we mean to
I know you
