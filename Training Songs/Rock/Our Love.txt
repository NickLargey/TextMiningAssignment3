Lost and lonely lives
Floating like waves at sea
We make it day by day
Watching the world go by

In a moment where time stands still
From here we look out on forever

[Chorus]
Darling, our love
One love that never fades away
Our love
This love will light the world on its way

Shattered, broken dreams
Sifting like grains of sand
We claim it and here we stay
Watching the world go by

With the strength that we spend in this life
In the hope that it goes on forever
We believe as we promise to try, that

[Chorus]

In a moment when time stands still
From here we look out on forever
And we can see all that time will tell

[Chorus]
