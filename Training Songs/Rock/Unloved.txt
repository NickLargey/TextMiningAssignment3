I bet you don't know how it feels 
To be walking past your house at night 
I bet you don't know how it feels 
To stand outside and watch the lights 

And I don't know why 
I just can't seem to dry 
The rain on my face 
All the tears I've cried 

I think of the day 
When you pushed me away 
What can I do when I still love you 

What can I do 
Where can I hide 
From all of these feelings I keep inside 
It's dark as can be 
And you'll never see 
Just what it's like to feel
What it's like to feel unloved 

Bet you don't know how it feels 
When your life flashes before your eyes 
I bet you don't know how it feels 
The moment when you realize 
That you lost all you had 
All that's good - all that's bad 
And everyone tells you, you should be glad 
Your love for me is gone 
I should be moving on 
And find someone new, but I still love you 

What can I do 
Where can I hide 
From all of these feelings I keep inside 
It's dark as can be 
And you'll never see 
Just what it's like to feel
What it's like to feel unloved 

If I could turn back time 
If I could press rewind 
Go back to the days when you were mine 

What can I do
Where can I hide 
From all of these feelings I keep inside 
It's dark as can be 
And you'll never see 
Just what it's like to feel
What it's like to feel unloved
