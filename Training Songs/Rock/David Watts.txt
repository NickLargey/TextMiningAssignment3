I am a dull and simple lad
Cannot tell water from champagne
And I have never met the Queen
And I wish I could have all he has got
Wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

And when I lie on my pillow at night
I dream I could fight like David Watts
And lead the school team to victory
Take my exams and pass the lot

Wish I could be like David Watts (wish I could be like)
Wish I could be like David Watts (wish I could be like)
Pump up my life like David Watts (wish I could be like)
Wish I could be like David Watts (wish I could be like)

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

He is the head boy at the school
He is the captain of the team
He is so gay and fancy-free
And I wish I could have all he has got
Wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

And all the girls in the neighborhood
Try to go out with David Watts
They try their best but can't succeed
'Cause he is of pure and noble creed

Wish I could be like David Watts (wish I could be like)
Wish I could be like David Watts (wish I could be like)
Wish I could be like David Watts (wish I could be like)
Wish I could be like David Watts (wish I could be like)

Wish I could be like, wish I could be like
Wish I could be like, wish I could be like (wish, wish)
