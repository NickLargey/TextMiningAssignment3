We used to dance,
But all the best clubs all have closed down
Now all of the music sounds mean
And what does it mean
When the one thing I can't put down
Is a letter that you wrote to me
At twenty-three
Dream, I'm on the outside of a dream
Praying that you could salvage me
Thy will be done
No second chance
Was the last thing that you told me
And I was the fool who agreed
Now I'm driving past
All the places that we went to
When the kisses flowed 
So easily from you to me
Dream, I'm on the outside of a dream
Praying that you could salvage me
Thy will be done
On and on and on and on
The smallest hope is never gone
My optimism always is well fed
And if I die before I wake
I pray for all of goodness sake
That you are happy where you make your bed
So I went to search
And to find out that you're married
With a sweet little child on the way
Now I can let go of this
Tiny dream I carried
With me all these years
Through all my fights and all the tears
Dream, I'm on the outside of a dream
Praying that you could salvage me
Thy will be done
See, seeing the artificial lives
Something that you always denied
Now I'm the one
On and on and on and on
The smallest hope is never gone
My optimism always is well fed
And if I die before I wake
I pray for all of goodness sake
That you are happy where you make your bed
On and on and on and on
The smallest hope is never gone
My optimism always is well fed
And if I die before I wake
I pray for all of goodness sake
That you are happy where you make your bed
