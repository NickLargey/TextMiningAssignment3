Are you aware 
Of how much you complicate me
And are you aware
Your words suffocate me
And don't deny
You're talking behind my back
To your friends
And don't deny
One day you'll need me

All my life I've been looking for the answers
To the questions you never asked and
We never planned on this disaster
When will I let it go

So incomplete 
Your stare is cold
Unlike anything I've ever seen
So incomplete
Your body is tired and falling apart at the seams
I won't deny
I took no part in ever wanting you back
Don't deny
One day you'll need me

All my life I've been looking for the answers
To the questions you never asked and
We never planned on this disaster
When will I let it go

If it's tonight
Please let me know
If it's tonight
Why don't you let me know
