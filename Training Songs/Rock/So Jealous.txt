I don't want to be
Part of the problem
I try so hard
To get roughed up

Fists on up
It looks that easy
It looks that way to me
It looks that way to you

But then there's you
Telling me I can
Then there's you
Screaming say something

I want the ocean right now
I want the ocean right now
I get so jealous
That I can't even work

That I can't even work
There I am in the morning
I don't like what I see
I don't like what I see

I don't know how
It's become such a problem
Keep you up all night
If I try to remain calm
How can they ask

Why I feel so angry
Do you see my problem
If I never explain it
But then there's you

Asking me how long
Say something
It's taken me so long
I want the ocean right now
I want the ocean right now

I get so jealous
That I can't even work
That I can't even work
That I can't even work

There I am in the morning
I don't like what I see
I don't like what I see
