The butterfly dances overhead
And the dark lights up my lips
I'm steppin' right off the edge
Can you take on the fool?
Trancin' round a field of joy
I change from girl to boy
Can you deliver fun from cruel?
Could you laugh at truth with a fool?
Can you deliver fun from cruel?
Could you laugh at truth with a fool?

I got no name and
I got no race and
I got no mind to
Tie down with you
I'd give you all my
Sidekick flowers but
You can't have me, no
I am the fool

{You trust me too strong to refuse} (?)
Sweet fool, what's to loose?
You could begin at the end if you choose
The mad hold hands with the fool
Sunlight fills the everywhere
As we step right off the edge
Could you wear the world as your jewel,
Or could you shine it on as a fool?
Could you wear the world as your jewel,
Or could you shine it on as a fool?

You want teasin' and
You want freedom and
You want pleasin' to
Be taught in school
You need playthings and
Everyday things but
You can't have me, no
I am the fool

I got no name and
I got no race and
I got no mind to
Tie down with you
I'd give you all my
Sidekick flowers but
You can't have me, no
I am the fool

You want teasin' and
You want freedom and
You want pleasin' to
Be taught in school
You need playthings and
Everyday things but
You can't have me, no
You are the fool
