Passing shadows
When love is strong
The ruby cross
The rose of the world

Constant flow
The deep heart
Fat man's daughter
Christian mother

Future life
Glories of the sacred
In God's country
Man from nowhere

Dear Friends
Forgive and forget
For better for worse
In God's country

The turn of the tide
Passing shadows
When love is strong
The ruby cross

The rose of the world
Best foot forward
Hearts of gold
Dear Friends

Mysterious doorway
Future life
For better for worse
Life's blessings

In heaven we know
Our own glories
Glories of the sacred
In the wonder days

The wonder gifts
The wonder story
Christian mother
Fat man's daughter

Passing shadows
Shadows lifted
Forgive and forget
For better for worse

In God's country
Under cedars and stars
Under cedars and stars
Under cedars and stars

The future life
And wonder days
