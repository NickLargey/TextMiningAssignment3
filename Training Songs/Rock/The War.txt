And all these songs I write for you
They tear me up, it's not hard to do
Listen to my voice
It's the only weapon I kept from the war

And I can soothe every ailment you endure
And I can see into the future most assured
I don't have a choice
It's the only life I know after the war

Everything we made, reduced to dust
You were the one who taught me most
I carry your remains
Your emblem and your name
Nothing left will ever be the same

And this war we fought was violent and long
Weeks turned into years but we keep on keeping on
The ringing in my brain
Is what remains

This war has worn me down
Broken dreams and a hole in the ground
Don't give up
And don't give in
