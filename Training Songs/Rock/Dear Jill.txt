Sorry babe, but I won't be home, 
Won't be home tomorrow.
Sorry darlin' but I got to let you
Gotta let you down
Your wasten' my time
Got no love
Love left to give you anymore.

I gotta look for, I gotta find me a brand new
Find me a brand new woman
You know I gotta find, the one that won't
The one that won't run around
You took everything I had, but I got no love,
Love left to give you anymore.
