I have a right to get up when I feel
Don't tell me I can't break the law

I have a right to get up, don't care what you say

I have a right to get up, even where I'm bound
Gonna tell the pain dealer to keep his nervous breakdown

I have a right to get up, when I please

Don't tell me I can't break the law
'Cause the law has broken me

I have a, I have a right
