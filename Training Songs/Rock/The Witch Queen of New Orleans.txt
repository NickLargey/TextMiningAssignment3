Marie

La voodoo veau
She's the witch-queen oh
Of New Orleans, of New Orleans

I'm gonna tell you a story
Strange as it now seems
Of zombie voodoo gris
And the witch-queen of New Orleans

She lived in a world of magic
Possessed by the devil's skew
From a shack near the swamp lands made of mud by brick
Marie stirred her witches brew

La voodoo veau
She's the witch-queen oh
Of New Orleans, of New Orleans

Dime or a nickel anyone could buy
Voodoo of any kind
She had potions and lotions herb
And tanna leaves guaranteed to blow your mind

Early one mornin' into mucky swamp dew
Vanished Marie with hate in her eyes
Tho' she'll never return all the Cajuns knew
A witch-queen never dies
