When your all alone and blue and the world looks down on you
Turn around I’ll be following you, when you need someone to care
And you need a love to share, turn around I’ll be following you
Turn around I’ll be walking behind you, with a love that’s true and never ever die
Maybe someday honey you’ll see, that this love was meant for only me
Turn around I’ll be following you,
Turn around I’ll be walking behind you, with a love that real and never ever die
Maybe someday you’re going to see that your love is meant to be for only me
Turn around I’ll be following you
