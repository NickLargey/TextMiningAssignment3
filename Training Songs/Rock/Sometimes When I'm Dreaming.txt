All the friends I believed in
I believed in for a while
They had their flair
They had their style

But nobody quite got it right
Nobody knew
Just how it feels to dream
Dream

But sometimes when I'm dreaming
And I dream a lot these days
I need someone who understands
Who leads me through the haze

It's only when I'm dreaming
That I fall in love for real
But I wake up screaming
Sometimes when I'm dreaming

And it's now
That I need a friend
I reach out for the phone
Nobody's there, nobody's home

Though it may not be right
To give up the fight
I'm sailing away
Now I'm on my own, alone

But sometimes when I'm dreaming
And I dream a lot these days
I need someone who understands
Who leads me through the haze

It's only when I'm dreaming
That I fall in love for real
But I wake up screaming
Sometimes when I'm dreaming
But I wake up screaming
Sometimes when I'm dreaming
