They say this lasts forever
That's just what I'm afraid of
I'll never dance like this again
She smiled like a Georgia summer
She laughs with the sound of thunder
I wanna dance like this again

I'm not the marryin' kind
I've said a thousand times
But I've never danced like this before
She's got them pretty little shoes
And I love the way she moves
I wanna dance like this again

I was free and far from home
I was young and on my own
I was blind as I could be
Thinkin' love was not for me
Till the night I met the girl named Tennessee

Lights came down
and the room spun slow
Started sayin' she had to go
Don't go baby I didn't get your name
She said Don't worry
I did not say

Oh she danced away with my
Heart and soul
Who she was I will
never know

Danced away with my
Hopes and dreams
My sweet girl from Tennessee
