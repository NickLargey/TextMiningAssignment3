Lately I've been thinkin' 'bout settlin' dow-own
To find me a life of my ow-own
Too much drinkin' and sleepin' around
Was bound to weary your soul

So darlin', for the gravy
Darlin', for the wi-i-ine
You made me feel like your frie-iend
Darlin', for the gravy
Darlin', for the wi-i-ine
Come love your sweet old fashioned man
Come love your sweet old fashioned man

I've been out on the road with a rock 'n' roll band
Terry Britten, Old Stockley, now Beeb
And I like what I got now and what I once had
Sweet lady, you're more than I need

Yes I said, darling, for the gravy
Darling, for the wi-i-ine
Make me feel like your frie-ie-iend
Darling, for the gravy
Darling, for the wi-i-ine
Come love your sweet old fashioned man
Come love your sweet old fashioned man

Come on honey
Lately I've been thinkin' 'bout settlin' dow-own
To find me a life of my ow-ow-own
Too much drinkin' and sleepin' around
Lord, is bound to weary your sou-ou-ou-ou-ou-oul

Darling, for the gravy
Darling, for the wi-i-ine
Make me feel like your frie-ie-iend
Darling, for the gravy
Darling, for the wi-i-ine
Come love your sweet old fashioned man, oh yes
Come love your sweet old fashioned man, ma-a-a-a-an
Come love your sweet old fashioned man
Come love your sweet old fashioned man
