With a growing sense of dread
And a hammer in my head
Fully clothed upon the bed
I wake up to the world
That lately I've been living in

There's a cut upon my brow
Must have banged myself somehow
But I can't remember now
And the front door's open wide
Lately I've let things slide

I go to the bin
I throw the laundry in
And pick out the cleanest shirt
Then I tell myself again
I don't really hurt

Smoking I once quit
Now I got one lit
I just fell back into it
Along with my pride
Lately I've let things slide

I go to the bin
I throw the laundry in
Dig out the cleanest shirt
When all at once I'm seized again
By exquisite hurt

That untouched take-away
I brought home the other day
Has quite a lot to say, the evidence is clear
Only resign piled high and wide
About how lately I've let things slide

I'm just about holding on
But lately I've let things slide
