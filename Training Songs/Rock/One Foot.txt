Not a soul up ahead and nothing behind
There's a desert in my blood and a storm in your eyes
Am I the king of nothing at all?
Then you're the queen of nothing at all
Well I remember the fight and I forget the pain
I got my hand in your pocket and my key on your chain
Am I the king of nothing at all?
Then you're the queen of nothing at all

Oh, through the wilderness
You and I we're walking through the emptiness
Oh, my heart is a mess
Is it the only defense against the wilderness?

Cross my heart and hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
Got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other

One foot in front of the other
All that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other

Not a soul on the road, not a star in the sky
It's a desert in my heart, and I know where to hide
I'm your king of nothing at all
And you're my queen of nothing at all
Well, out here in the dust if you don't have trust
Ain't nothing left of us, this is the exodus
They're just testing us, they can't flex with us
They can't mess with us, they can't mess with us

Oh, through the wilderness
How come even together there can be loneliness?
Oh, our heart's a mess
But it's our only defense to brave the wilderness

Cross my heart and hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other

(Wilderness)
One foot in front of the other
All that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other

(Well, out here in the dust)
Oh, through the wilderness
How come even together there can be loneliness?
Oh, our heart's a mess
But it's our only defense to brave the wilderness

Cross my heart and hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other

(Wilderness)
One foot in front of the other
Oh, all that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other

In the so-called Land of the Free
One foot in front of the other
Don't you know that all we have is each other
One foot in front of the other
