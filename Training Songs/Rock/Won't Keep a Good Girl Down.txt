Sometimes it's so confusing
You win and then start losing
Just when you thought you'd seen it all
You picked your lucky number
So is it any wonder
You've got your back against the wall
You'll get delirious
If you take life too serious
You'd think by now that you would know

You can't stop the world from changing
But you could turn it around
'Cause you won't keep a good girl
Won't keep a good girl down

I look at life it's scary
So dull and ordinary
Sometimes it makes me want to scream
They say that less is more
But you've been there before
And it ain't always what it seems

You can't stop the world from changing
But you could turn it around
'Cause you won't keep a good girl
Won't keep a good girl down

Everybody wants happiness
But sometimes it slips away
It's yours if you want it
You can take it back
But it's up to you to find another way
Why can't you let it go
You've got nothing left to show
For all the hell that you've been through

And now you've finally found the answer
You've got your feet back on the ground
You won't keep a good girl
Won't keep a good girl down
Oh yeah, you won't keep a good girl
Won't keep a good girl down
