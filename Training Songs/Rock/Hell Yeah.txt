Life is a be movie
It's stupid and it's strange
A directionless story 
And the dialogue is lame
But in the he said she said
Sometimes there's some poetry
If you turn your back long enough
And let it happen naturally
Oh, yeah
Hell yeah

I got a face like a limp handshake
Hair like an accident scene
I've been waking up slowly
Savoring the same old dream
And somewhere between
The folds of your memory
I was sleeping soundly
Oh, yeah
Hell yeah
 
'Cause I like you
But I know you don't know it
I like you so much, 
I talk to everyone but you
And I wonder
What you would think of this little number
I wonder
What you would say if you knew

If you don't ask the right questions
Every answer feels wrong
I was a terrible waitress
So I started to write songs
And I don't know how I feel
But I wonder if you feel like me
Do you ever get wrapped up 
In the folds of my memory
Oh, yeah
Hell, yeah

'Cause I like you
But I know you don't know it
I like you so much
I talk to everyone but you
And I wonder
What you would think of this little number 
Yeah I wonder
What you would say if you knew

There's a river of people 
That runs past my eyes
And it's beautiful enough
Just to watch it go by
But the trouble with water is
She'll always leave you for gravity
I never even told you 
I had a crush on you or anything
Oh, yeah
Hell yeah

Life is a be movie
It's stupid and it's strange
A directionless story
And the dialogue is lame
But in the he said she said
Sometimes there's some poetry
If you turn your back long enough
And let it happen naturally
Oh, yeah
Hell yeah
