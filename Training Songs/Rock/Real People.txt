Real people of the world
Hear me
Real people of the world
Come near me
The time has come for us
To do what must be done now
The time has come for us
Together, old and young now
United we must stand
United hand in hand

Real people of the world
It's late now
Real people of the world
Don't wait now
Those of you who care
Take the time to show it
People everywhere
Let each other know it
Together we must try
Together you and I

The time has come for us
To do what must be done now
The time has come for us
Together, old and young now
United we must stand
United hand in hand
