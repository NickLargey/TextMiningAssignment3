I get it started and then I get brokenhearted
Because I can’t get a hold of the beast
It’s like I’m blind, I’m running out of time
Everything I crave is out of reach

You say I drink too much
You say I f*ck too much
So what the hell am I supposed to do
I wanna die and kill my dirty mind,

I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I need it, I need it, I need it, I need it
I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it
A gluttony on me has started.

I take a dive and I medicate my mind,
'Cause I hate what I fucking see
It’s all a grind, we’re filling up our time with the rules of society

You say I drink too much
You say I smoke too much
What the f*ck am I supposed to do
I wanna die and kill my dirty mind,

I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I need it, I need it, I need it, I need it
I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it
A gluttony on me has started.
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I need it, I need it, I need it, I need it
I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it
A gluttony on me has started.

Whoa whoa whoa oh
Whoa whoa whoa oh

I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I need it, I need it, I need it, I need it
I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it
A gluttony on me has started.
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I need it, I need it, I need it, I need it
I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it
A gluttony on me has started.
