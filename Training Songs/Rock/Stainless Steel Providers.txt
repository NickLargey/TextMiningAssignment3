Get around get around I get around

Stainless steel providers, 
Make it obvious- 
We like driving the point home,
A hundred thousand vagabond insects
All making a meal out of stainless steel
You should kick away the watchword 
And throw caution to the wind
Remember what it's like 
When we are

Screaming dreaming [Repeat: x 5]
Stainless steel!

Stainless steel providers [Repeat: x 2]

Get around get around I get around
When it's time to go, i´m the first to know
A parasitic nation
Is it good enough for me?
I'll make you a mantra 
From monkeys and car bombs

Beneath [Repeat: x 5]

Quick locate and detonate your public enemy
Stainless steel, believe it's real, 
It's all you mean to me
What's that sound, what's that sound
It bleeds efficiency
The way I feel on stainless steel, 
And all it does to me

Another tire 
Let it catch on fire
A metal motor mantra
Makes you waste the time of day
You´ll sit on a timebomb, forever and ever
Now breathe breathe breathe breathe breathe!

Quick locate and detonate your public enemy
Stainless steel, believe it's real, 
It's all you mean to me
What's that sound, what's that sound
It bleeds efficiency
The way I feel on stainless steel, 
And all it means to me
