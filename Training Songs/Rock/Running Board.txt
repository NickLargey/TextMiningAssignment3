Soft, soft fade
Circled around
Turn loose goodbye
Switch off
No attempt to look failure is king
Are we ready
Close those lips
Try to lose me three more times
Hush baby now don't say a word
(total fucking chaos)
6:53 and where are you?
Run home, run far
Throw your face in a pillow
Scream out what you can't
Fix that makeup cover your tracks
Yeah your an angel
Avoiding what games, games to play
Was it "less or more or more or less"
Coward
Wisk away the fear
Clear the air
Clear the air and slide
Closer to the edge
Say good night
Final curtain call
Switch off, goodbye.
