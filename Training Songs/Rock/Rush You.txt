Love is no fun anymore
There's too many things I can't afford
So what do you mean when you say
That she's your girlfriend today

I wouldn't ever want to rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you

Love's not beating down on my door
I guess it's cause ooh, I got lucky, lucky before

I wouldn't ever want to rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you

Wealth is boring without happiness
Fame is notorious for causing stress
Health is for binging on in between drinks
Money over matter for the rich in minks

I wouldn't ever want to rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you

Never want to rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
