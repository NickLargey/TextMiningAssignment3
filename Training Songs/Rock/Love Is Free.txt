One
Two
One, two, three!
Hey, hey!

She got a shack
Floating down the Pontchartrain
With the water rolling in
We gotta swim
Before the levees start to crack

Another day
Another dollar down the drain
You go to town
No one's around
'Cause if you drown
There ain't no hope for coming back

It ain't no big thing if you lose your faith
They kinda like to keep you in your place
You never know what might be coming your way

[Chorus]
Oh everybody
Devil take your money
Money's got no hold on me
Oh oh everybody's making love
'Cause love is free

You go to church
And pray to God for no more rain
A Cadillac
A paper sack
Well hey there Jack
You want some bourbon for the pain

Hey tambourine
Ain't no rhythm on the street

With the voodoo
What do you do
When the radio just plays on anyway?

Those crazy fingers in your jelly jar
They'll jack your money
While you sleep in you car
They got the karma
They ain't getting too far

[Chorus]

Everybody come together
(Love is free)
Everybody come together
(Love is free)
Everybody come together
(Love is free)
Everybody come together

Yeah 

[Chorus: x2]

Love is free
Yeah,
Love is free.
