I want you to know
It’s time to go
Yeah we are done
I want you to see
That I need (oh) to be free

(Done done done done done done)
We are done
(Done done done done done done)
We are

Done with being a silent many
Every voice rings out and carries
No we won’t just go back
Home without you hearing
The sound when the many say
We are done

You, first brought the sun
For everyone, uh here to see
Why, does it always change
To guns and chains, eventually

(Done done done done done done)
We are done
(Done done done done done done)
We are

Done with being a silent many
Every voice rings out and carries
No we won’t just go back
Home without you hearing
The sound when the many say
We are done

Done with being a silent many
Every voice rings out and carries
No we won’t just go back
Home without you hearing
The sound when the many say
We are done
