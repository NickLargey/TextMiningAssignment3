You look like you’ve seen a ghost
I don’t think it’s even gonna be close
Your rabbit’s foot and your four leaf clover
Throw them away and start all over

Here I am see me comin’ around
Swinging out wide with the hammer down
There I go watch me leave you behind
Holding all the roses on the other side

The odds against me were 20 to 1
Carry that weight like it weighs a ton
Ain’t no luck in a gasoline rainbow
Come on drop that rag away we go

Here I am see me comin’ around
Swinging out wide with the hammer down
There I go watch me leave you behind
Holding all the roses on the other side

Here I am ain’t a thing you can do
There I go it’s the end of the line
