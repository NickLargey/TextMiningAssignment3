Everyone take your places
We're fuckin' it up, going crazy
Another town, which way to roll and you know that we're takin' it
(C'mon)

Stoned baby, loves to go ridin'
She loves it cause she's sick in the head
Lights down, music loud and you know that we're makin' it
(Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
We're goin' ridin'
We're gonna find a way
We're goin' ridin'
And when the fear has left you put one down and go home

Phat like a fiend on a payday
The crazy days have taken their toll
And if you think the road's a bore
Well you know, you're fakin' it

You're so upset but complacent
I know the place that you outta go
Calvin's in the back, you're face in my lap and let's roll

[Chorus]

All the from the west side of town
We get up and we never come down
Got the juice and we're loose
Cause we want to get wasted
(Alright, alright, oh yeah)
Fucked up from the left side down
Mom and dad are out of town
You know the don't like it when you're stoned

[Chorus]
