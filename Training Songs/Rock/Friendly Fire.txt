I don't want to hear
Another word from you now
I'd rather be wrong
Life is mostly what 
You don't see anyway
So just look away
But our shadows
Never leave us alone
Down the bad roads
They will follow us
Faithfully home

[Chorus]
You launched the assault
With the first cannonball
My soldiers were sleeping
I know that you thought
It would never come down,
Down to the wire
It's friendly fire

In your room filled with the things
That you've never done
Does anyone really care
Your shadow 
Just won't leave you alone
Cause he knows well 
He knows what you've done

[Chorus]

Waves don't wonder 
When you're drowning
Under the sea
So don't look for me
Find her keep her lose her
Deserts you in the end
You were my friend
Like your shadow
No one knows you as well 
As I do

You launched the assault
With the first cannonball
My soldiers were sleeping
I know that you thought
It would never come down,
Down to the ground
Cause I was so tired
Then I'll get down
Down to the wire
It's friendly fire
