Me grandma, grandpa on me mind all the time,
(Scrub, scrub, scrub.)
I scrub them in almost all of the time.
(Scrub, scrub, scrub.)
They're in a bottle, inside my shampoo,
Me grandma, grandpa they are dead.
(Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.)

Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

Me grandma, grandpa on me mind all the time,

(Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub.)
They're in a bottle, inside my shampoo,
Me grandma, grandpa they are dead.
(Dead, dead, dead.)

Grandma, shampoo! Grandpa, shampoo!
