Ten English pounds
And these hot pavement fields
As though I'm moving to the end
Am I moving to the end of your loving?

How, how did I do this?
Me, I put the wall around my heart
Why didn't I notice such cold detachment from the start?
Oh, the joys they slammed down
And the one in this town was bright enough

Without joy, joy, joy in the rain
I could feel forever the same
Without joy, joy, joy in the rain
I could feel forever the same

So how, how did I do this?
Oh, me I put that box around my heart
Why couldn't I notice such a cool detach from the start?
Oh, the joys they slammed down
From the one in this town is bright enough

Without joy, joy, joy in the rain
I could feel forever the same
Without joy, joy, joy in the rain
Yeah, I could feel forever the same

Without joy, joy, joy in the rain
I could feel forever the same
Without joy, joy, joy in the rain
Yeah, I could feel forever the same

Without joy, joy, joy in the rain
Oh, I could feel forever the same
Without joy, joy, joy in the rain
I could feel forever the same
