Call me, if you want to see me,
Call me, if you still believe me.
'Cause I'm not gonna hide,
No, I'm not gonna hide from you.

If you still think you need me,
Like I do, I want you to feed me.
With your love, I'll be strong,
With your love, ill be strong and carry on.

Don't be hurt by what you've seen, dear,
I know it's like a dream, dear.
Remember, I slept too,
Remember, I slept too with you.

Well, we'll go on our way, (go on our way)
Yeh, we'll go on our way, it's a brand new day.
