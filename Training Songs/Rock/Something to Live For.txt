Woo
Alright

Bobby drives a pickup
For the corner store
Four bucks an hour
And he's hoping for more

He's twenty eight years old
And he still lives at home
Bobby's got ideas
But he ain't alone

There's a million
Bobby's across this land
Everybody's got
Real big plans

He's got something to live for
Something so real
He's got something to live for
That one, big deal

Bobby's got an uncle
He talks a mean streak
Makes more in an hour
Than Bobby in a week

He tells the boy
Don't waste your time
Be useless like your father
Nickel and dime

There's a million
Bobby's across this land
Everybody's got
Real big plans

He's got something to live for
Oh, something so real
He's got something to live for
That one, big deal

Well Bobby could'a done it
If he only tried
Could'a been a contender
Could'a been a big guy

But he didn't rob a bank
Or write a hit song
Got a raise
Married Yvonne

Yea
Turn it on
Turn it up now baby
Let's go

He's got something to live for
Something so real
He's got something to live for
That one, big deal

He's got something to live for
That one sweet deal
He's got something to live for
Ohh oh one sweet deal
He's got something to live for
That one big deal
He's got something to live for
Oh oh
