I love that hair, long an' black
Hangin' down to the middle of your back
Don't cut it off whatever you do
I need it to run my fingers through

'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my, baby

Got me a dollar that I saved
Saved it up for a rainy day
Everybody's callin' for bills that's due
But they don't catch me, I'll spend it on you

'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my, baby

Got me a guitar, got a six strings
And a picker to make 'em ring
Every string's gotta know what to do
'Cause I'm gonna use 'em to serenade you

'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my baby

Well, I had me a gal, she said she's mine
But she run around on me all the time
Now she's gone an' I'm glad we're through
'Cause I'm plum-flipped over you

'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my, baby

Oh, baby, baby, yeah you're my baby
Well, I don't mean maybe
You drive me crazy
I love you, baby, you're my, babydoll
