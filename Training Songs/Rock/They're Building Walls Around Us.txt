Sorry baby, sadly, I gave up, I know 
I was out of options with nowhere left to go 
I was much too young back then baby, just a kid 
It just seemed I stayed that way no matter what I did 

Oh let´s say it 
They´re building walls around us now 
Oh let´s say it 
They´re building walls around us now 

My friends say: 
- Hey by splitting, what did you achieve? 
For all intents and purposes, it´s easier to leave 
Now it just seems whoever else approaches me, 
There´s always an imbalacne, I mean, ideologically 

It seems that I fell out of luck into the 
Outstretched arms of f*ck up, I know 
It seems that I fell out of luck into the 
Outstretched arms of f*ck up, I know 

Now I seem blindfolded, I just tag a long 
When I found out that I did wrong 
Baby you were gone 
I smile and shake my head like this, what else can I do? 
I keep getting signs baby, all leading back to you 

Oh let´s say it 
They´re building walls around us now 
Oh let´s say it 
They´re building walls around us now 

It seems that I fell out of luck into the 
Outstretched arms of f*ck up, I know 
It seems that I fell out of luck into the 
Outstretched arms of f*ck up, I know
