See the funny little clown  See the puppet on a string  Wind him up and he will sing  Give him candy...he will dance  But be certain not to feel  If his funny face is real    Stop right up and see him folks  Couldn't you die at all his jokes?  Couldn't you cry at all his tricks  He'll come up with in a fix?  But be certain not to stray  He will steal your heart away    I am a clown, I am a clown  You'll always see me smile  You'll never see me frown  Sometimes my scenes are good  Sometimes their bad  Not funny ha-ha, funny sad    I am a clown, look at the clown  Always the laughing face  Whenever you're around  Always the same routine  I never change  Not funny ho-ho, funny strange    Sometimes I think the world is a circus town  Sometimes I feel I belong in a side show  That man on the flying trapeze  He ain't never coming down  He know's what I know...  If you look inside  If I didn't hide, you might decide  You don't want me    I am a clown, that's why I'm a clown  Just like the fool on the hill  Begging to come down  I want to live again  I want to feel  Tell me you love me, make me real
