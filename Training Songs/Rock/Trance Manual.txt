Cross the palisade
At the holiday inn
See the mujahidin barricades
Just walk right through

Past the bullhorns
And sleepy 47s

Right by the coalition guards
I'm in the back of the second floor basement
I'll have my editors
Arrange for payment

Come to me now
You are warming weather
Come to me now
The kind that comes with
Sandbags along the river

Wear your aqua mirabilis
Dotted on your pulse points
A miraculous transformation
Ahh my aching joints

You are a vision in the air
Cheap lipstick, bleached hair

Ohh dressed like that
You are a flag of a dangerous nation
Oh dressed just like that
You are some kind of declaration

Come to me now
You are warming weather
Come to me now
The kind that comes with
Sandbags along the river

Here cowboy bars
And dance clubs don't exist
The trance manual says just stand alone
And then shift and shift

Come to me now
You are warming weather
Come to me now
The kind that comes with
Sandbags along the river
