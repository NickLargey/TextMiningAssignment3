I've got you on the loose
I left you groovin'
I've got you on the beat
I left you broken
But won't you take my place
Since long ago I wandered
Way out on a cliff
With the brilliance of an angel

So fly me courageous
So fly me courageous

Mother America is brandishing
Her weapons
She keeps me safe and warm
By threats and misconceptions
So if you break the chains
You'll have to shake me
And if you break my heart
You'll have to take me

Whoa lady won't you take it easy
Push, me, out, of
Whoa won't you take it easy lady
Push, me, out, of

Whoa won't you take it easy lady
Push, me, out, of

So fly me courageous

I heard your whispers
From the bottom of the canyon
It's not so hard to hide
The rattlesnakes confusion
Wrap me high in the sky
Circle me with stallions
She flew from peak to peak
With the freedom of an eagle

So fly me courageous
Fly me courageous
So fly me courageous
