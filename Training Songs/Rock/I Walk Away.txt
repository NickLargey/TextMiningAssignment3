You came out of the world to me
My life parted like the red sea
We flowed easy between the rocks and stones
never seemed to stop us
The years ended in confusion
Don't ask me I don't know what happened
but I am a man with a mission
Must be the devil I don't know
Finally, marching to a different tune

It's hard to let go
Of all that we know
As I walk away from you
The sun always sets
No room for regret
As I walk away from you

Reveal whatever you desire
To you it may be death defying
Your life, slave to ambition
Tension your permanent condition
So much you've always wanted
Too much giving you a sore head

Finally marching to a different tune (That's right)
As I walk away from you
As I walk away from you

It's hard to let go
Of all that we know,
As I walk away from you
The sun always sets
No room for regret
As I walk away from you
--
It's hard to let go
Of all that we know
As I walk away from you
The sun always sets
No room for regrets
As I walk away from you

Give it to me, give it to me, your inspiration
Give to receive, find all we need
As I walk away from you.
