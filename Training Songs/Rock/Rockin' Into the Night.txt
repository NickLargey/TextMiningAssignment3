Oh Rockin'
Oh Yeah

Cruising down the motorway
Got my girl by my side
We're both a little anxious
Ooo, we got love on our mind
Waiting, anticipating
For the fireworks in the night
Well I swear we were doing eighty
When we saw those motel lights

And we were rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
Ooo hoo, rockin'
Rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night

Out on the back street
Taking love where I can
I found a sweet madonna
Ooo, with a bible in her hand
She's waiting, anticipating 
Well, for someone to save her soul
Well, I ain't no new messiah
But I'm close enough for rock and roll

And we were rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
Ooo hoo, rockin'
Rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night

And I'm slowin' down, and she's pullin' in 

Waiting, anticipating
For the fireworks in the night
Well, I swear we were doing eighty
When we saw those motel lights

We were Rockin', 
Rockin' into the night
Ooo yeah
Rockin', rockin' into the night
Rockin', rockin' into the night
Rockin', rockin' into the night

Rockin' into the night, rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night, rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night, rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night, rockin' into the night
