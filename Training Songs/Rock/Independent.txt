Read my lips
I don't care what you say
I might listen
But I'll do it my own way
Don't you see
It don't mean nothing to me
When all's said and done
I'll stand on my two feet
Let me be
I live by my own rules
Independent, independence
Can't you see
It's my right to choose
Independence, independent
Once they tried to teach
Teach me all their rules
I had my own ideas
Didn't fit in, in their schools
Don't they see
That we all have a brain
There to learn
Not to be whipped and tamed
Let me be
I live by my own rules
Independent, independence
Can't you see
It's my right to choose
Independence, independent
Read my lips
I don't care what you say
I might listen
But I'll do it my own way
Don't you see
It don't mean nothing to me
When all's said and done
I'll stand on my two feet
Let me be
I live by my own rules
Independent, independence
Can't you see
It's my right to choose
Independence, independent
