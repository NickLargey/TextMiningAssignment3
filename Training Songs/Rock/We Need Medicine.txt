We need medicine and we need it now
We need medicine and we need it now
We need medicine and we need it now
To get us to the end of time

My soul's on fire, but my heart she's made of stone
I'd be a good man if only my wicked thoughts were known
I don't believe in nothing that isn't shown
I'm not the kind of man you take back home

We need medicine and we need it now
We need medicine and we need it now
We need medicine and we need it now
To get us to the end of time

I won't be happy 'til I don't have a friend
I just can't convince myself of what I'll never comprehend
I'm not a sinner, I confess at the end
But don't trust a single word I say

We need medicine and we need it now
We need medicine and we need it now
We need medicine and we need it now
To get us to the end of time

I cry your tears while all my friends stand in line
I've seen no injustice in that broken-hearted victory sign
If I was them I would be no friend of mine
I laugh when the walls come crashing down

Well you could buy me for a handful of dust
But I'm so cheap that gypsies only deal with me when they must
I'm only happy when the gold turns to rust
It's the kind of thing that makes my day

We need medicine and we need it now
We need medicine and we need it now
We need medicine and we need it now
To get us to the end of time
To get us to the end of time
To get us to the end of time
To get us to the end of time
