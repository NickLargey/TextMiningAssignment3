IÆve got a feeling of an afterglow  And the second that the sorrow goes  Will breed a new career    And I wanna open up my eyes and see  æCos the agony and ecstacy  Look all the same from here    You donÆt get no view like you do on the top of the world  The top of the world  Where the skyÆs so blue and the girls are so beautiful    And times where the heaven is a mile away  And itÆs looking like itÆs there to stay  Unlikely to remain    And I got a list of things IÆm working on  IÆll be working on number one  I hope you do the same    You donÆt get no view like you do on the top of the world  The top of the world  Where the skyÆs so blue and the girls are so beautiful
