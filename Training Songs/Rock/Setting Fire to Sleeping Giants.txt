First off let me say you look so tired 
Rest your head and shut your eyes 
Empty ambition blankets the sky 
I'm thinking 'bout another world tonight 
So drop the gown the game's over 
Just push your face into the fight 
And it breaks my heart like dancing up all night
Ride so high we both start thinking 
'Bout another world tonight 
And it feels so wrong 
Like nothing we've ever felt before 
The stranger's candy takes you where 
You ought to be 
In broken alleys 
In the back of every street 
Close your eyes tonight, baby 
You can have it, ooh baby 
Gnaw me down to the bone 
Soon you'll find I'm never 
Gonna take you back home 
Well there's so much you never told me 
And there's not much I want to know 
Cause your pretty face will do just fine 
You'll be the star of my every last show 
Let's go for a long ride 
I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave The stranger's candy takes you where 
You ought to be 
In broken alleys 
In the back of every street 
Tonight we could bring it all down 
We could bring it all down 
They think this body's a dead note 
Dancing to the beat but they'll never see 
This corpse coming 'til it kills them
