Well, I'm craving for a cigarette, hey give me a light
Feeling kind of thirsty, give me something that bites
Sure been hanging 'round here for much too long
All you crazy people waiting for my song, I said

Well, here I am
I'm just another one-night stand
Anyway, I don't know why I'm sad
For my fan club

Waiting for an autograph, well you must be mad
Standing in the pissing rain must be a drag
If that's what you wanna do, I won't say no
Wanna see more of me, see me after the show, I said

Well, here I am
I'm just another one-night stand
Anyway, I don't know why I'm sad
For my fan club

Well, you send me pretty flowers while I'm slashing my wrists
Read those little letters through my smashed-out mist
The dream I shock you is my nightmare
I'm the freak that's on display so stand and stare, I said

Well, here I am
I'm just another one-night stand
Anyway, I don't know why I'm sad
For my fan club
