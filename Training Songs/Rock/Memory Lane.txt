Two years away, I got back today
Tried calling up this girl I used to know
But when I said hello, she didn't know
Who the hell I was supposed to be

Memory lane, we're here again
Back to the days and I'll remember you, always
So much has changed, now it feels like yesterday
I went away

The words around, that she's moved town
About a thousand mile away from here
I ran to get my bike, but it wasn't there
My parents sold it at the summer fair

Memory lane, we're here again 
Back to the days, and I'll remember you, always
So much has changed, now it feels like yesterday
I went away

So much has changed (so much has changed)
So much has changed (so much has changed)
So much has changed (so much has changed)
Down memory lane, we're here again
Back to the days and I'll remember you always
So much has changed, but it feels like yesterday I went away

So much has changed (so much has changed)
So much has changed (so much has changed)
So much has changed (so much has changed)
Down memory lane...lane...lane...lane...
