Baby, sometimes I feel like dyin'
Drivin' while I'm closin' my eyes
Movin' in and out of hidin'
Tryin' to catch some truth in my life
Watchin' your stars in your moonlight
Come tumblin' down from the sky
Take it now

I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna come to you
I wanna find you
In everything that I do
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna count on you
I'm gonna follow
Baby, what else can I do?

Sunday mornin' my town is sleepin' (sleepin')
Lyin' all alone in my bed
There's not a sound, I can't help but listenin'
Wishin' I was somewhere else instead
But sometimes they're too hard to handle
Those voices inside my head
Listen now

I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna come to you
I wanna find you
In everything that I do (everything I do for you)
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna count on you
I'm gonna follow
Baby, what else can I do?

Take a walk inside my dream, a church, a lonely road
All the people come and go and come and go 
(All the people come and go and come and go)

I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna come to you
Ooh, do it now
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna count on you
I'm gonna follow, ah ah

I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna come to you
I wanna find you
In everything that I do (everything that I do for you)
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna count on you
I'm gonna follow
Baby, what else can I do?

I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna come to you
Baby, what else can I do? (Everything that I do for you)
(I will run to you)
I'm gonna come to you
What else can I do?
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna come to you
Baby what else
