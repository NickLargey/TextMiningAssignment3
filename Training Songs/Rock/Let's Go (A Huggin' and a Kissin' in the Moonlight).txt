Let's go, let's go
Let's go hugging and a-kissing in the moonlight
I know, you and I together make it so right
Let's go, girl I told your mama and it's alright
We'll be alone baby, I'll walk you home in the moonlight

Hey you got the key to my heart anytime you want to use it
I'll be waiting for you, girl cause I adore you so
You know

Everybody wants to know what my life was like before you
I don't think about it, I just want to shout it out
Baby I love you

Let's go hugging & a-kissing in the moonlight
I know, you and I together make it so right
Let's go, girl I told your mama and it's alright
We'll be alone baby, I'll walk you home in the moonlight

Hold me in the palm of your hand
Twist me 'round your little finger
Do just what you wanna, baby I'm a goner for you
And it's true, so

Let's go hugging & a-kissing in the moonlight
I know, you and I together make it so right
Let's go, girl I told your mama and it's alright
We'll be alone baby, I'll walk you home in the moonlight
