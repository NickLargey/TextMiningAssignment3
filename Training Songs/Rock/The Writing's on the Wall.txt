Lookin' out my window, it was a smoggy afternoon
I breathen in some air, I couldn't get in too soon
I turned on the news, learned of some food I shouldn't eat
Don't you run around today, you might pass out in the heat

Writing's on the wall, facts are in the books
Nothin' lost is nothin' gained
It seems there's writings on the wall, yeah

I just can't understand how this world is run
Well, people say that war is bad, but they keep on makin' guns
Ever since the world began it's always been the same
'Cause hist'ry'll always tell the truth war is such a shame

So the writing's on the wall you can't outrace your fate
What will be will always be, so the writing's on the wall
Facts are in the books, nothin' lost is nothin' gained
Writing's on the wall

Writing's on the wall, facts are in the books
Nothin' lost is nothin' gained
So there's writings on the wall

Writing's on the wall, facts I learned too late
What will be will always be, writings on the wall
You can't outrace your fate, so what will be will always be
There's writings on the wall, the lesson's learned too late

Nothin' lost is nothin' gained cause the writing's on the wall
Facts I learned too late, so what will be will always be
Writing's on the wall, you can't outrace your fate
So what will be will always be, cause the writing's on the wall
