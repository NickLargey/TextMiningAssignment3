I can't reach behind your eyes, you always look away
You hide behind your alibis, and change your mind from day to day
If there's something I can do, then I'll be there
Outside your broken world, you'll see it's me who cares

Take me straight to your heart, ''cause this time's real and real lasts forever
I know where you are, ''cause you know I've been there before
Straight to your heart

I watch you move, and I watch you dance, I watch you drift away
And I'd give anything for you, and you know that's bad, when it gets that way
You can't go on like this, and I don't want to fight again
I don't give a damn anymore, right or wrong, you're gonna let me in

Straight to your heart, ''cause this time's real and this time's forever
I know where you are, ''cause baby I've been there before
Straight to your heart, this time, this time
Baby I know where you are, ''cause you know I've been there before

Then maybe I'll break down the walls, and my love will go
Straight to your heart

(Instrumental break)
Inside, take me inside, yeah
Straight to your heart, ''cause this time's real and real lasts forever
I know where you are, ''cause this time we're goin' all the way
Straight to your heart, this time, this time
Baby it's straight, yeah yeah yeah yeah
This time it's straight to your heart, oh yeah, ''cause this time it's real
