Oh, my lady
I'm alone, you'd feel your presence in the night
Oh, my lady
Through the storm I felt your fire, saw your light
Oh, my lady

I said lady, I can feel
That soon my lady will be free
And ain't it like walkin' out after the pourin' rain
To meet the morning train

Oh, my lady
There will be time for reflection and for play
Oh, my lady
Well, a darker night will dawn a brighter day
Oh, my lady

I said lady, I can feel
That soon my lady will be real
And ain't it like walkin' out after the pourin' rain
To meet the morning train

And life being what it is
She'll be round in time
And time changing like it does
Oh, won't change my mind about my lady so real
I said, my lady can feel
And ain't it like walkin' out through the pourin' rain
To meet the morning train

Oh, my lady
I said lady, I can feel
That soon my lady will be real
And ain't it like walkin' out after the pourin' rain
To meet the morning train
Well, in the morning rain
Oh, my lady
