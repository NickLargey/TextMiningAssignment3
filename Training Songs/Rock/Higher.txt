Alright, now it's up to you
There's a rocking storm
Coming over you
Alright let's go

We've got the last call
And we're ready to go
Lights are burning
For another show tonight
It just feels alright

Shoulder to shoulder
Scream n' shout
We got what you need
A whole lotta dynamite
It just feels alright

It's now or it's never
Gonna make it last forever
It's really close to overload

We'll take you higher
More n' more
We'll take you higher
Than before

It's a journey to the eye of the storm
Hot vibrations coming one by one
Party's just begun
High speed running goes hundred and two
Power train rockin' all over you
Nothing  you can do

Higher, higher, higher
We'll take you higher
Than ever before
Dig it
