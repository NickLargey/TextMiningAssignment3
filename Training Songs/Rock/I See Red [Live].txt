[Chorus]
When my baby is walking down the street
I see red, I see red, I see red
How can someone wicked walk around free
I see red, I see red, I see red
I see red, oh I see red

You gave me such precious hours
What to do without you
Squeezed me out of your life
Down the drain like molten toothpaste
I feel used and spat out
Poor old me

[Chorus]

I am fed up with crying
My despair is drying
Draining into rage day by day
Green before you met me
In the pink when you let me love you
I was blue when you let me down
Black and blue

[Chorus]
