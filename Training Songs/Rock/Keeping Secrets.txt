Took all week for the feeling to come.
Dry your eyes we're staring at the sun.
Want to call I've got nothing to say.
Want it all got a line and the nerve to stay

You're keeping secrets
There's only one I need to find

Shaking myself from the hum of the morning
Saving it all for the rest of the night
Losing myself to the drug of the city lights
You're keeping secrets,
There's only one I need to find.

Said it all now there's no mystery.
Talk so much I force myself to breathe.
Underhand but it all went to plan
Sold my soul to an understanding man

You're keeping secrets
There's only one I need to find

Shaking myself from the hum of the morning
Saving it all for the rest of the night
Losing myself to the drug of the city lights
You're keeping secrets,
There's only one I need to find

Stay up all night for the kids,
It's getting better.
Stay up all night for the kids,
It's getting better

You're keeping secrets
There's only one I need to find

Shaking myself from the hum of the morning
Saving it all for the rest of the night
Losing myself to the drug of the city lights
You're keeping secrets,
There's only one I need to find
