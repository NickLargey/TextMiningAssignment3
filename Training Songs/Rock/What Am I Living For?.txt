What am I living for if not for you, 
What am I living for if not for you, 
What am I living for if not for you, 
oh nobody else, nobody else will do

What am I longing for each lonely night, 
To feel your lips to mine, to hold you tight
You'll be the only girl my whole life through, 
Oh nobody else, nobody else will do

I want you close to me that's all I know, 
I want you all the time because darling I love you so

What am I living for if not for you, 
What am I living for if not for you, 
What am I living for if not for you, 
Baby nobody else, nobody else will do

What am I living for if not for you, 
Darling nobody else, nobody else will do
nobody else, nobody else will do
