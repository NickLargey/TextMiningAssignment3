Hi, hi, hi,
Hi, hi, hi,
Hi, hi, hi.

She makes me bleed, oh yeah, she makes me cry,
She makes me sneeze, oh yeah, she makes me sigh.

So bring her on down, bring her on down from heaven,
So bring her on down, bring her on down from heaven,
My only number must be must be...

Bring her on down by the soles of her feet,
Slapping her 'round and making her bleed,
I vowed to my god I'd give it all up
If he would bring her on down from heaven.

She makes me bleed, oh yeah, don't know her name,
She makes me freeze, oh yeah, she's in my face.

So bring her on down, bring her on down from heaven,
So bring her on down, bring her on down from heaven,
My only number must be must be

Bring her on down by the soles of her feet,
Slapping her 'round and making her bleed,
I vowed to my god I'd give it all up
If he would bring her on down from heaven.

Oh yeah yeah yeah,
Oh yeah yeah yeah,
Oh yeah yeah yeah,
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

So bring her on down, bring her on down from heaven,
So bring her on down, bring her on down from heaven,
My only number must be must be

Bring her on down by the soles of her feet,
Slapping her 'round and making her bleed,
I vowed to my god I'd give it all up,
Don't know her name, don't know what she does

Bring her on down by the soles of her feet,
Slapping her 'round and making her bleed,
I vowed to my god I'd give it all up
If he would bring her on down from heaven.
