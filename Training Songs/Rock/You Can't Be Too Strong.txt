Did they tear it out with talons of steel
And give you a shot, so that you wouldn't feel?
And washed it away as if it wasn't real?

It's just a mistake I won't have to face
Don't give it a name, don't give it a place
Don't give it a chance, it's lucky in a way

It must have felt strange to find me inside you
I hadn't intended to stay
If you want to keep it right, put it to sleep at night
Squeeze it until it could say

You can't be too strong
You can't be too strong
You can't be too strong
Can't be too strong
You decide what's wrong

Well I ain't gonna cry, I'm gonna rejoice
And shout myself dry and go see the boys
They'll laugh when I say I left it overseas

Yeah babe, I know it gets dark, down by Luna Park
But everybody else is squeezing out a spark
That happened in the heat, somewhere in the dark, in the dark

The doctor gets nervous completing the service
He's all rubber gloves and no head
Yes, he fumbles the light switch, it's just another minor hitch
Wishes to God he was dead

But you can't be too strong
You can't be too strong
You can't be too strong
Can't be too strong
You decide what's wrong

Can't be too hard
Too tough, too rough
Too right, too wrong
And you can't be too strong
Baby can't be too right
