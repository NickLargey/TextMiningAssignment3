I've been living for too long
With a feeling something's wrong
Like a thorn stuck in my side
Just out of reach for me to pull it out
Now the picture's crystal clear
I can see that the end is near
We no longer to have pretend
All things have got to come to an end

This is gonna hurt
This is gonna hurt you
This is gonna hurt you
More than it hurts me.
And I don't wanna hurt
That's why I'm gonna hurt you
That's why I'm gonna hurt you
That's how it's gonna be.

And they say what doesn't kill you
Well, I'm sure you know the rest
If you'd shut up for a second
I could get this off my chest
Cause I've been though way too much
And we've grown so out if touch
Now we can't see eye to eye
It's time to kiss it goodbye.

This is gonna hurt
This is gonna hurt you
This is gonna hurt you
More than it hurts me.
And I don't wanna hurt
That's why I'm gonna hurt you
That's why I'm gonna hurt you
That's how it's gonna be.

This is gonna hurt you
That's how it's gonna be
This is gonna hurt you

Can't you see the writing on the wall?
One more step before I end it all.
Closing my eyes, holding my breath,
Finish it now, get it over with.
Can't you see the writing on the wall?
One more step before I end it all.
Closing my eyes, holding my breath,
Finish it now, get it over with.

This is gonna hurt
This is gonna hurt you
This is gonna hurt you
More than it hurts me.
And I don't wanna hurt
That's why I'm gonna hurt you
That's why I'm gonna hurt you
That's how it's gonna be.
