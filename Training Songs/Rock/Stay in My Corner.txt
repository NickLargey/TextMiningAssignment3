I won't always be a winner, babe
In fact, I'm bound to burn
All these bumps in the road, dear
They're just lessons we learned
We learned
Stay in my corner, babe
Stay in my corner, please
Stay in my corner, babe
I will fight for you if you fight for me too
They can steal away my soul
Hang me dangerously low
I don't care for the gold
'Cause I've been down there before
Before
Stay in my corner, babe
Stay in my corner, please
Stay in my corner, babe
I will fight for you if you fight for me too
We sit together forever
By the colour TV glow
Telling stories, allegories
Letting ourselves go
Stay in my corner, babe
Stay in my corner, please
Stay in my corner, babe
I will fight for you if you fight for me too
