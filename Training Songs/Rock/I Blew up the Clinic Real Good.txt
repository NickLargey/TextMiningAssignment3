I Blew Up The Clinic Real Good

I have the road in my blood
I drive a custom van
I play the tunes
I'm the neighborhood ice cream man
so don't you mess this boy around

The other day, when the clinic had its local debut
some chicks were trying to picket
the doctor threatened to sue

Now I don't care if it's a baby or a tissue blob
but if we run out of youngsters
I'll be out of a job, and so I
I did my duty cleaning up the neighborhood
I blew up the clinic real good

Try and catch me, coppers
you stinking badges better think again
before you mess this boy around

I've hung in Saigon just to see the special effects
I've hung from gravity boots for my Napoleon complex

It's time to close
ooh...there she blows
history in the making
you picked the fight
I picked dynamite
I blew up the clinic real good

Preacher on a corner
calling it a crime
says, "The end don't justify the means anytime"
I stood up on my van
I yelled, "Excuse me, sir.
Ain't nothing wrong with this country
that a few plastic explosives won't cure."
