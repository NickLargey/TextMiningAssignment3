Starry eyes I've got to try
I love you but I love the rock
And I think you're gonna cry
And the dawn is coming up

As I look out on the rain
But I pick up my guitar
And do it all again
Fade away help me play

It's the feeling I get
When the music is right
That makes me feel this way
You can win or lose it all

Is what makes you want to walk the line
No guarantees you take your chances every time
Oh I know your love is real
And I feel the same

Oh I know it's in my soul
No one can really free me
Starry eyes I love the rock

We run around my friends and me
Telling all the girls we should be free
Up all night and down all day
But we only want to play

Starry eyes you're wandering how
You love a man who loves the rock
And you can't change it now
And the midnight telephone

To say I can't make it home
It's another night you have to face it all alone
Oh I know your love is real
And I feel the same

I know it's in my soul
No one can really free me
Starry eyes I love the rock

Starry eyes I've got to try
I love you but I love the rock
And I think you're gonna cry
And the dawn is coming up

As I look out on the rain
But I pick up my guitar
And do it all again
Oh I know your love is real

And I feel the same
I know it's in my soul
No one can really free me
Starry eyes I love the rock
