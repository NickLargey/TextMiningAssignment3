Hey Mister, backstabbin' son of a bitch
You're livin' in a world that'll soon be dyin'
And I know everybody knows you try to be like me
But even at your best as a man, you couldn't equal half of me

I am realizing that everybody's lost their simple ways
And now that it's here, I see it all so clearly
I've come face to face with the enemy, the enemy

You, you're another shit talkin' punk to me
You're a living inspiration for what I never wanna be
And I see you've been blinded by what you believe
And now back up and sit down, shut up and act like you need to be

I am realizing that everybody's lost their simple ways
And now that it's here, I see it all so clearly
I've come face to face with the enemy, the enemy

Come to me, come to me
The enemy come to me, come to me

So predicting you're the reason why I lie
Simple decision took me too much time to fly
Oh, checkmate

I am realizing that everybody's lost their simple ways
And now that it's here, I see it all so clearly
I've come face to face with the enemy, the enemy

Come to me
