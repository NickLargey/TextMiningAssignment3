Way to go Mr. Microphone
Show us all what you don't know
Centuries secret societies
He's out commander still
Space Dog

So sure we were on something
Your feet are finally on the ground he said
So sure we were on something
Your feet are just on the ground girl

Rain and snow
Our engines have been receiving your eager call
There's Colonel Dirtyfishydishcloth
He'll distract her good
Don't worry so

And to the one you thought was on your side
She can't understand
She truly believes the lies

Lemon pie
He's coming through
Our commander still Space Dog
Lines secure Space Dog

Deck the halls
I'm young again
I'm you again
Racing turtles
The grapefruit is winning
Seems I keep getting this story twisted
So where's Neil when you need him
Deck the halls
It's you again
It's you again
Somewhere someone must know the ending
Is she still pissing in the river now
Heard she's gone
Moved into a trailer park

So sure we were on something
Your feet finally on the ground he said
So sure we were on something
You feet just on the ground girl
So sure we were on something
Your feet finally on the ground he said
So sure we were on something
Your feet are just on the ground
