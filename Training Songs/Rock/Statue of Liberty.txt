STATUE OF LIBERTY
WRITER GLENN SHORROCK

Give me your hungry, give me your tired, give me your homeless, give me your wanderers, Statue of Liberty, standing in the harbour, this is America, we try a little harder. Oh, this is America, ah. We set the standards and everyone will follow, we've got our own values, but they're built on the dollar, Statue of Liberty, standing in the harbour, this is America, we try a little harder. Oh, but now it's tumbling, fakin', quakin', tremblin' on its own foundation, there's been so many warnings, too late the old lady's fallin', the only thing to do is to get out of the way, anything can happen in the U. S. of A. ain't no use anymore in tryin' harder, Statue of Liberty sinkin' in the harbour. You can be a millionaire by steppin' on the needy, words of equality, but they're written for the greedy, Statue of Liberty, yeah, yeah, standing in the harbour, this is America, we try a little harder. Oh, this is America, ah. Give me your hungry, give me your tired. give me your homeless, give me your wanderers. Give me your hungry, give me your tired. give me your homeless, give me your wanderers.
