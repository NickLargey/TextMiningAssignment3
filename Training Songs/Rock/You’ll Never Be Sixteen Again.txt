Look out now, love has done you wrong
You can be weak, you can be strong
But if you go on you can't look back, don't look back
For you'll never be sixteen again

It might be easy to stop and cry
And let the rest of the world roll by
But if you run for the golden sun, run now, run
For you'll never be sixteen again

Oh no, you'll never be sixteen again
You'll never be sixteen again
No no no no no, don't be lonely
There'll always be new romance
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, love is only
A win, lose or draw game of chance

And you'll never be sixteen again
Remember the rainbow always follows the rain
True love may be just around the bend
So make time your friend, hearts take time to mend

And you'll never be sixteen again
Someday you won't regret and you'll forget
Ah, but you'll never be sixteen again
Oh no, you'll never be sixteen again
Oh no, you'll never be sixteen again
