I've been trying to love myself for real 
I've been trying not to feel what I feel 
I've been trying to be a bit less mistaken 

It was real the feeling I had for you 
And you told me how you need me too 
Everyone kept saying it's not the real thing 

How dare you break my lonely heart 
And dance on the pieces 
Being with you just tares me apart 
Not again and again 
Take you love and leave me behind 
Realize we're mistaken 
I don't need to be torn down 
Not again and again 

I've been wanting to die, just so you know 
Trying to show them all how I'm alone 
I've been hating my bedroom in the night 

I've seen heaven and hell with you 
I believed the lies you said were true 
I've been trying to grow, I've been holding on 
I've been trying to be strong 

How dare you break my lonely heart 
And dance on the pieces 
Being with you just tares me apart 
Not again and again 
Take you love and leave me behind 
Realize we're mistaken 
I don't need to be torn down 
Not again and again 

Once again I just want to feel something true 
Once again I just want to get closer to you 
Nothing will ever change anyway 
This is all we have 
Not again will I lie to myself 
Not again
