Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it Jesus is my plea
When we're walking close to Thee
Let it be Dear Lord let it be

I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus keep me from all harm
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk let me walk close to Thee

Through this world of toil and snares
If I falter Lord who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee Dear Lord 
None but Thee

Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it Jesus is my plea
When we're walking close to Thee
Let it be Dear Lord 
Let it be
