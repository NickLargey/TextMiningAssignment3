I don't want you to know too much about me, oh no
'Cause I know you'll take advantage of the words that I say
You're looking for a way to depress me, make me pay

You don't want me to be to close around you 'cause I would see
All the weak sides that you got, but which you're trying to hide
You know I would nail you if I could nurse my pride

'Cause you're on the top when I'm low
As soon as you're fading I will grow
I don't like you, you don't like me
We're lacking energy, yeah we're lacking energy

It's a mind game we play
Rule the roost, major clich√©
While one of us is fit, the others going insane
And every time we think the positions will remain

You're on the top when I'm low
As soon as you're fading I will grow
I don't like you, you don't like me
We're lacking energy, yeah we're lacking energy
So you got me up against the wall
And I'm only waiting for your fall
I'll get back on top, and be carefree
It's not the end for me, no it's no the end for me

I know we're thinking the same
And our opponent's the one to blame
Thinking this way is not something that we both longed for
Living this way is something we never did plan
But I don't think we will change
'Cause we're stuck in roles as others antipoles
