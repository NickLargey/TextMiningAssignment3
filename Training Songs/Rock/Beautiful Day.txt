Things you forget to say 
Will haunt you 
Down here a million days 
I know you'll get me through 
You don't need to stay 
Because I'll never be alone 
Do you cry anymore? 

Refrain 

You're in the never-ending 
Bitter and converscending blue 
I just want to be by you 
And everything will turn to blue 
The dream is fallacy come true 
Just want to spend some time with you 
On a beautiful day... 

Seeing the morning in 
Forget to 
Worry abaout the things 
That hurt you 
You'll becoming dependent now 
Is it could where you are too? 
Freeze no more 

Refrain 

We got it os throw it away 
'cause we will be as lucky as the 
Last time, child 
The habits don't blow it away 
We are on the other side 
You know you're 
Talking about the old times 
Walking down an open road 
But failing to disguise 
Revealing the signs 
Nothing you can do will change it 
It's a beautiful day... 
Ooooh
