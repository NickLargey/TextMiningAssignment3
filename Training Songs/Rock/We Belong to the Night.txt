The burning sun hangs over the city
You and me baby, we don't feel nothing at all
From nine to five we're lost
This life ain't so pretty
But when the sun goes down
We know that we can stand tall

I just can't wait
For the night to come
'Cause when the shadows cover the light
We're the only ones
'Cause baby, we
We belong to the night
Yes, baby, we
We belong to the night
By day we just survive
But after dark, we come alive
'Cause baby, we
We belong to the night

Dancing' on the street
In the heat of the neon
The quiet in the cool night air
Makes it easy to breathe
The music that we hear in our heats
Gives us something to dream of
'Cause when that lonely soul that calls
It's those dreams that we'll need
To keep us strong
To take us far
Far away from the pain of the days
'Cause that's a cruel mental start

But baby, we
We belong to the night
Yes baby, we
We belong to the night
By day we just survive
But after dark, we come alive
'Cause baby, we
We belong to the night

Ahh ahh-ahh-ahh
We belong to the night
Yes, yes baby, we
We belong to the night
By day we just survive
But after dark, we come alive
'Cause baby, we
We belong to the night
We belong to the night
We belong to the night
