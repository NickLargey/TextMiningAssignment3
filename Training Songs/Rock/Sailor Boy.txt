Oh sailor boy, don't steal my girl from me
I'm so alone, please let her be
Oh sailor boy, my heart's been broke before
Every time you fellas hit the shore

Oh sailor boy, your ship will sail at dawn
Please please, leave my girl alone
Oh sailor boy, don't steal my girl from me
I'm so alone, please let her be

Oh sailor boy, don't steal my girl from me
I'm so alone, please let her be
Oh sailor boy, my heart's been broke before
Every time you fellas hit the shore

Oh sailor boy, your ship will sail at dawn
Please please, leave my girl alone

Oh sailor boy, don't steal my girl from me
