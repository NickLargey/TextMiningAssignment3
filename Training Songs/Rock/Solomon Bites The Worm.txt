Monday
Count all the teeth in my head
Tuesday
Anointed by a man in a dress
It's more than just a question of time
It's more a question of
Reason and rhyme

Wednesday
Got hitched just like a good boy should
Thursday
And Friday didn't feel so good
On Saturday I said my goodbyes
On Sunday I'm food
For the worms and the flies

Pack up your troubles now take
All you can carry
On your way
Your way
Just remember this time you know you've only got seven days

It's more than just a question of time
It's more a question of
Reason and rhyme

Pack up your troubles now take
All you can carry
On your way
Your way
Just remember this time you know you've only got seven days
