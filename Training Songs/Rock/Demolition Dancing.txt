It's a very small world in the middle of a crowd 
the room gets dark when the music gets loud 
treble cuts thru' when the rythmn takes the bite 
but there's no room to move 'cause the floor is packed tight 

A voice shouts loud 
'we'll never surrender' 
A voice in the crowd 
'Never surrender' 

A hand in the crowds flying propaganda: 
'Never surrender, we'll never surrender' 

The skins in the corner are staring at the bar 
the rude boys are dancing to some heavy heavy ska 
it's getting so hot people are dripping with sweat 
the punks in the corner are speeding like a jet 

Staring at the rude boys 
Staring at the rude boys 
Dancing with the rude boys 
Dancing with the rude boys 
Staring at the rude boys 
Staring at the rude boys... 

A bunch of peers march in on the DM's 
with some standing there saluting the air 
they wanna be pirates but the sea is not calm 
tattooed crossbows on their arm 

A voice shouts loud 
'we'll never surrender' 
A voice in the crowd 
'Never surrender' 

Another hand fly fly propaganda, 
propaganda, propaganda 

The lights come alive in a blinding flash 
dance floor clears as the mutants clash 
everyone leaves when the heavy's arrive 
someone hits the floor, someone takes a dive 

Staring at the rude boys 
Staring at the rude boys 
Dancing with the rude boys 
Dancing with the rude boys 
Staring at the rude boys 
Staring at the rude boys... 

Staring at the rude boys 
Staring at the rude boys 
Dancing with the rude boys 
Dancing with the rude boys 
Staring at the rude boys 
Staring at the rude boys
