On Jubilee Street there was a girl named Bee
She had a history, but she had no past
When they shut her down the Russians moved in
I am too scared, I'm too scared to even walk on past

She used to say
All those good people down on Jubilee Street
They ought to practice what they preach
Here they are to practice just what they preach
Those good people on Jubilee Street
And here I come up the hill
I'm pushing my wheel of love
I got love in my tummy and a tiny little pain
And a ten ton catastrophe on a sixty pound chain
And I'm pushing my wheel of love on Jubilee Street
Ah look at me now

The problem was she had a little black book
And my name was written on every page
Well a girl's gotta make ends meet
Even down Jubilee Street
I was out of place and time, and over the hill, and out of my mind
On Jubilee Street
I ought to practice what I preach
These days I go downtown in my tie and tails
I got a fetus on a leash

I am alone now, I am beyond recriminations
Curtains are shut, the furniture is gone
I'm transforming, I'm vibrating, I'm glowing
I'm flying, look at me now
I'm flying, look at me now
