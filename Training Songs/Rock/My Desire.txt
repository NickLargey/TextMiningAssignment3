Be my desire
I'm a frustrated man
Summon us for peace
Do what we can

Feel my desire
Favor the bold
Some of us fall to the Earth
These others roam
Beseeched by desire

Come on baby
You played me out
You played me out
What looked like your chance to leave
But you played me out
So now I gave you up
It's time for a change of heart

See my desire
No solemn moods
All of us are teammates
We stick to the rules
It's a real life desire

Come on baby
You played me out
You laid me out
That looked like your chance to leave
But you played me out
So now I gave you up
It's time for a change of heart

I'm human
I feel you
Erased

Be my desire
I'm a frustrated man
Some of us fell to the Earth
These others ran
They flee my desire

Come on baby
You played me out
You played me out
So it's time for a change of heart
You played me out
So I gave you up

I'm human
I feel you
Erased

I'm human
I feel you
Erased
