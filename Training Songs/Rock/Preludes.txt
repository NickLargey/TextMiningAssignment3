Well the gangsters drove Preludes and sold this one weed called White Tiger
Wirth Park had a body
The holiday guy couldn't make change
The parking lot scene still existed, but not without problems
I came back to St. Paul and things had progressed and got strange

I got stuck in a snowbank
I was too drunk to drive to Edina
Right there is proof of my faith that God watches us
And the North Stars went south
And my friends all went out to Seattle
I stuck around town
Hit the bars then wait for the bus

And the guys at Northeast ride bicycles up to the market
Fish take to water but licenses they get revoked
And the writing on walls in the stalls in the bathroom says "Cindy's so easy"
But I've never met Cindy, besides it might be a joke
Fish take to water but licenses they get revoked

I got stuck in a snowbank
I was too drunk to drive to Edina
Right there is proof of my faith that God watches us
And the North Stars went south
And my friends all went out to Seattle
I stuck around town
Hit the bars then wait for the bus

I was down on the trails by the river when this guy jumped out
He was waving a pistol
I consider my options
Decided to do what he said
He went through my jacket and found all my packets and matches
He lit up a cig and put the Kryptonite over my head

I was knocked out down in the mud too heavy to float off to Memphis
The crust from the camps they pulled me awake with a stick
Made coffee over a campfire
I described my attacker
They patched up my wounds, showed me a place to get sick
They patched up my wounds, showed me a place to get sick

I got stuck in a snowbank
And God watches us
We got into the Preludes
And God watches us
God watches us
