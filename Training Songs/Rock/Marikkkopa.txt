There is a lynching at Home Depot
of the last day laborer
In this sanctuary city
with its anchor-baby births
They say “It’s time we had some justice
for the white race on this earth
This place is strange and getting stranger”

“We got to round ’em up!
Door to door tonight we’re ready”
Knock Knock Knock
“Drag them from their beds
They got some nerve to say
they were here first”
“We’re gonna round them up!
Hiding in the semi-trailers”
Knock Knock Knock
“Beat it in their heads
We keep our word and Maricopa pure”

They’re sweating in Sun City
cause they just got off the course
Saying “Sheriff Joe it’s awful
and it’s only getting worse”
“Oh did you hear about Rob Krentz?
They left him bleeding in the dirt
These Spics they’re brave and getting braver”

“We got to round ’em up!
Door to door the posse is ready”
Knock Knock Knock
“Drag them from their beds
Cause it’s their turn for someone to get hurt”
“We’re gonna round ’em up!
Crying in the day-care center”
Knock Knock Knock
“Beat it in their heads
They’ll never learn until Maricopa burns!”
