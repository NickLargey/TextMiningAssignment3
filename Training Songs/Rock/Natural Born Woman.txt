There she is again, steppin' out of her limousine, well
Looking like the cover of a twenty-dollar magazine
She's got it where you find it
If you know what I mean

She's a natural born woman
Natural born woman
She's a natural born woman

There she is again watch her stop the Main Street in its tracks
Looking like Creole queen, hair hangin' down her back
I say, don't look too long, boy
She'll make your glasses crack

She's a natural born woman
Natural born woman
She's a, yeah yeah, natural born woman

Yeah yeah, get your track
Yeah, natural born woman
Yeah, yeah, natural born woman
Yeah, yeah, she's a natural born woman

Well, I'm sweatin' and I'm shakin' when I'm bringin' you the news
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Why I'm standin' here today
Preachin' natural born woman blues

Well, she's a natural born woman
Well, yeah, natural born woman
Well, yeah, natural born woman

Well, I'm looking out my back door, wonderin' which place to go
Think I'll move on down to Memphis
Pay my money to see a rock 'n' roll show
Find me a sweet-heart Susie, together we can lose control

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a natural born woman
Yeah, yeah, natural born woman
Yeah, natural born woman
Yeah
