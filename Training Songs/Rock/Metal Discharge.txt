There wouldn't be good without the vil
No wisdom without stupid people
Would there be fear if we could be immortal?
Welcome to the opposition portal!

Don't we all hate the adjustment we make
Is to compromise for a safe life a mistake?
Musical destruction is our outbreak

Metal discharge
Payback to all those losers
The armies of black will dictate
Metal discharge

All those years of torment
In a society that I do hate
Metal discharge
Pay...
Metal discharge

The opposition against all odds
Unbreakable, longhaired, noise loving squads
The non conform metal power station
Grows slosly through nation and nation

Once greeted with smiles
'Cause of outrageous lifestyles
Our breed wil resist all fake trends
Until this sad world ends!

Caal it culture of the brainsick
Our press ignored music
This cultural essence of noise
Keeps us watchful not to turn into toys!
