I saw tolerance. out of commune.
Out of terminal.
Caught in the clap-trap/inert/flat pack.
Holds the nation to abreast.
The front rank it turns and said,
"One in five cracks up"
But who was that said that?

Sink Venice Sink

I saw that Ruskin said,
You can't jump off a bridge.
'Cause the water stinks.
Look around, look around look around:
You can't even throw a noose.
Cause all the beams are cracked.
All gone Glasnost Glassed.
A place to marry, but never wed.

Sink Venice Sink.

Look around, look look look around.
Back at the reception.
At the opening.
Well it all looked pretty good.
But those columns they were made of plastic.
And the host he was very polite.
All data and quick, quick chat.
Look around look around look,
Cause it's rising

Sink Vencie Sink

Look around, look look look around.
2000 damp bricks won't save you now.
