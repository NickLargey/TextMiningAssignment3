Now baby we should go back to where we started from
I know we feel the reasons, let's pick them up and run
Let's not let confusion cover up the shine
There's no use in denial, we can't reinvent this time
Look me in the eye and see my love
Take me by my hand, you'll know why
It's just me and you
There's no reason to
Be shy

We'll bring back all the colours and paint outside of your lines
Use the pieces of this picture like a poet uses rhyme
Recapture all the passion, play a lovers game
To not would be a crime, to wait would be a shame
Look me in the eye and see my love
Take me by my hand, you'll know why
It's just me and you
There's no reason to
Be shy

Let go
You will see
Follow your heart
Look me in the eye and see my love
Take me by my hand, you'll know why
It's just me and you
There's no reason to
Be shy

We know what to do
There's no reason to be shy
You don't have to be shy
No no
Shy oh
