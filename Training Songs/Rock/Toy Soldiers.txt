It wasn't my intention to mislead you
It never should have been this way,
What can I say?
It's true I did extend the invitation,
I never knew how long you'd stay,
When you hear temptation call
It's your heart that takes,
Takes the fall

Won't you come out and play with me?

Step by step,
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart,
We never win,
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

It's getting hard to wake up in the morning,
My head is spinning constantly,
How can it be?
How could I be so blind to this addiction?
If I don't stop
The next one's gonna be me
Only emptiness remains,
It replaces all the pain.

Won't you come out and play with me?

Step by step,
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart,
We never win,
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

(We never win)

Only emptiness remains (ahh)
It replaces all the pain,

Won't you come out and play with me?

Step by step,
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart,
We never win,
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers
