Romantic fool -- yeah, that's the word, fool
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, I think
I'm starting to drool

The more I drink, the worse I feel
I'm talking to the floor and
I'm soaking in my pee

[Chorus]
I don't want to dance, I don't want to sing
I don't think that I can move
'Cause I can't feel a thing
Stench in the air, vultures flying up above
Another useless dead thing
I've been killed by love

I've walked those fields of juniper and mist
And my lips are still burning from 
The touch of your last kiss
I though you were an angel 

And I trusted your embrace
But you turned into a monster 
And you spit right in my face
That crafty old jackal ripped my guts out before

The boy with nine lives
I keep coming round for more
My passion was your weapon
It put a blindfold on my eyes

The last sound I heard was laughter
As you buried me alive
