Aye aye aye, aye aye aye 
Tell you baby, you hugging up the big monkey man 
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye 
Tell you baby, you hugging up the big monkey man 

I never saw you, I only heard of you 
hugging up the big monkey man 
I never saw you, I only heard of you 
hugging up the big monkey man 

It's no lie, it's no lie 
Them a tell me, you hugging up the big monkey man 
It's no lie, it's no lie 
Them a tell me, you hugging up the big monkey man 

Now I know that, now I understand 
You're turning a monkey on me 
Now I know that, now I understand 
You're turning a monkey on me 

Aye aye aye, aye aye aye 
Tell you baby, you hugging up the big monkey man 
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye 
Tell you baby, you hugging up the big monkey man 

I was on my way to Banbury Cross, 
Then I see a monkey upon a white horse 
With rings on he fingers, bells on him toes 
Sing a little song, wherever he be 
Cause he's a monkey, 'cause he's a monkey 
Cause he's a weedy little monkey man 

Aye aye aye, aye aye aye 
Tell you baby, you hugging up the big monkey man 
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye 
Tell you baby, you hugging up the big monkey man
