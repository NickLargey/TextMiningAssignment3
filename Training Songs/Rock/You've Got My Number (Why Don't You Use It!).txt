You've got my number
Why don't you use it
You know my name
You won't abuse it
If you want to want to want to want to
want to have someone to talk to
I'll pick you up
In my car
Take you home

Its not far
If you want to 
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Why don't you ring my number?
Why don't you ring my number now?
Let's say goodbye
I couldn't stand it
You've got my number
Why don't you use it?
