What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?

Still pending and wishing now on every star in the sky
That everything would be alright
Falling down to your knees
With promises that you'd intended to keep
What good are the words we speak?

Perhaps some other time when everything's in place
When all the stars align reveling all the answers that we seek
That place where violence will not fix everything
Does it fix anything? Can you tell me?

What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?

Sinking in the sand, a revelation that you had
So long it goes, away now clouded by the smoke
That place were happiness and broken dreams align
And become the life that you seek
It was all that you needed

Perched in the corner with your hand on your ears
To stop the dribbling of words that keep on pouring out in fear
Finding yourself at the end of the race or merely falling behind
Can you tell me? What you waiting for?

What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?

Can you?
Can you tell me?
