I didn't know God made honky-tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make me a wife
You keep off the only one that ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life

All of the glamour of the gay night light had lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
Where you wait to be anybody's baby
And forget the truest love you'll ever know

I didn't know God made honky-tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make me a wife
You keep off the only one that ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life

I didn't know God made honky-tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make me a wife
You keep off the only one that ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life
And went back to the wild side of life
And went back to the wild side of life
