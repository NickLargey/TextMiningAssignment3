The way of the weekend
Is getting right to yah
And the city just deceived you
And then stared right at yah

And the way we learn
Its the way down on the weekend
That's taking control

I'm hollow but I'm heaving
Where did my week go?
And why do I feel cold
When I'm triggered to run?

And the way we are
Is taking control
And the way down on the weekend
Is getting right to yah

And the way down on the weekend
Is getting right to yah
And the way we are
Is taking control
