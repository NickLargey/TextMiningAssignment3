Nothing I'd say or I could do
Could move the mountains from your view
Nothing I see or I could show
There's only darkness now I know

I should have been there to inspire you
Not paint your world a cold, cold blue
I should have been there to inspire you
I could have told you truthful too
I believed in you, told you truthful too

I should have been there
Within your reach
This is not self pity,yeah
Of which I speak

I never took time to see how you'd grown
I never took the care it takes to know
Never took the time to see what you'd found
(Never took the time to see what you'd found)
Oh, had the time to bring you down

I should have been there to inspire you
Not paint your world a cold, cold blue
I should have been there to inspire you
I could have told you truthful too
I believed in you, told you truthful too

I could have been there
I could have been there

More than all this I do not know
Only that love is here to show
Someone a world to be themselves
A place to fall when all else fails

Friends harsh words cut deep and sore
But believe me mine will hurt me more
In those moments before I sleep
When I am truly alone to see

I should have been there to inspire you
Not paint your world a cold, cold blue
I should have been there to inspire you
I could have told you truthful too

I should have been there to inspire you
Not paint your world a cold, cold blue
I should have been there to inspire you
I could have told you truthful too
I believed in you, told you truthful too

Ohh, I believed in you, yeah
(Told you truthful too)
Yeah, I believed in you
(Told you truthful too)
