I got my things together
And on a wing I flew
I meant to send a letter
That said goodbye to you
I didn't hear you call
When I went out the door
When I..went..out...your..door
Oh yeh...
It's a long walk back and the train don't pass through here
It's a long walk back, I fear
It's a long walk back and the path ain't always clear
It's a long walk...a long walk back
Now once there was a reason
For everything I did
With every passin' season
I've lost my way instead
The road that led me far
From all that I once knew
Will bring me back to you
Oh yeh
It's a long walk back and the train don't pass through here
It's a long walk back, I fear
It's a long walk back and the path ain't always clear
It's a long walk...a long way back
It's a long walk to your door
To where we were before
And I pray that I can made it back home
(back home)
The road that led me far
From all that I once knew
Will bring me back to you
Oh yeh
It's a long walk back and the train don't pass through here
It's a long walk back, I fear
It's a long walk back and the path ain't always clear
It's a long walk...a long walk back
Well it's a long walk back!
