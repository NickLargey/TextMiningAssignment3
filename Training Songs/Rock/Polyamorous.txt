So just when you think that you're all right
I'm crawlin' out from the inside

My polyamorous friend
Got me in a mess of trouble again
So just when you think that you're all right
I'm crawlin' out from the inside
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all
Just stay away from the white light
I'd say your worst side's your best side
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all

Well how do you know?
Well how do you know?
Well how do you know?
Well how do you know?

Just when you think that you're all right
I'm crawlin' out from the inside
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all
Just stay away from the white light
I'd say your worst side's your best side
I never hurt anyone
I never listen at all
