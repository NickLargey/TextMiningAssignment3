Sometimes I stop and wonder
Why can't I let myself enjoy 
The space I'm in
And all the wonderful
Places I've been
My eyes are on the future
I can't think about the past
My aspirations
Always exceed my grasp

You've got to reach a little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey woa - oh you got to grow
You've got to reach a little bit higher
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul and you'll never grow old

When the habits of a lifetime
Become a painful cage
You want to break out
But you don't know how to change
You may have a vision
Or you may have a friend
Who will come to you
And say these same words again
