I can hear the sound
Of the North Star calling
Put your high beams on
Stay on my wing
I'm falling
And spinning and turning
This is ultra-glide
The beginnings of great things
Cannot be seen
By your naked eye

Can you see me know crack the skies like lightnin'
Mama's little sonic boom
Is simply frightening
I'm a skyscraper

Float like a buttuerfly
Acrobatic
Sting like a B-52
Dramatic
And the radar locks on you
No static

Can I reach it now
I'm not up here often
God only knows
And he ain't talkin'
I'm a skyscraper.
