Drunken days drunken nights
Someone please turn out the light
I can't face the mirror anymore
Move along magics gone, someone else can sing my song,
I can't lift my head up of the floor

N-n-n-n-n- no no no no more
N-n-n-n-n- no no no no more
N-n-n-n-n- no no no no no no no no more

Empty days sleepless nights
Have I lost the will to fight
Someone help me back onto the road
Sinking fast time has past I can't make the story last
Every little note is coming hard

N-n-n-n-n- no no no no more
N-n-n-n-n- no no no no more
N-n-n-n-n- no no no no no no no no more

There's no use in trying
When you only end up crying
It's a fools game
It's no longer funny when you're doing it for money
It's a shame shame
No no no more no more
No more

N-n-n-n-n- no no no no more
N-n-n-n-n- no no no no more
N-n-n-n-n- no no no no no no no no more
