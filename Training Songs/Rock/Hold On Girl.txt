I know about the guy who treated you so bad
He took your love and then just walked away
I know that you have got a reason to be sad
But help is on its way

Hold on, girl; be a little bit stronger
Hold on, girl; wait a little bit longer
Hold on, girl, help is on its way

I know you feel as though your world is at an end
But you don't have to live with yesterday
I promise you the sun is gonna shine again
And help is on its way

Hold on, girl; now that we are together
Hold on, girl; things are gonna be better
Hold on, girl, help is on its way
