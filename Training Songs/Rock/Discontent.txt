Skin is pale my arms are thin
See the coward from within
Feels so good it feels so right
Gonna drain my life tonight

I died a bastard in your arms
Tell my son I never meant him harm
It feels so good it feels so right
I'm gonna drain my blood tonight
I know you're angry

So am I
I know you're special
So was I
I know you're so much more
I know you're so much more

Eyes are closing very quick
Feelings flash I'm feeling sick
Feels so good it feels so right
Gonna drain my life tonight
I died a bastard in your arms
Tell my son I never meant him harm
It feels so good it feels so right
I'm gonna drain my blood tonight

I know you're angry
So am I
I know you're special
So was I
I know you're so much more
I know you're so much more
Darkest days are done now
I don't mind cause I'm numb
Darkest days are done now

I don't mind cause I'm numb
I know you're angry (so am I)
I know you're special (so was I)
I know you're so much more
I know you're so much more
I know you're angry
So am I
I know you're special
So was I
I know you're so much more [Repeat: 4X]
