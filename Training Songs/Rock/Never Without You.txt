We were young, it was fun
And we couldn't lose
Times were right, overnight
We were headline news
Crazy days and reckless nights
Limousines and bright spotlights
We were brothers through it all

And your song will play on without you
And this world won't forget about you
Every part of you was in your song
Now we will carry on... Never Without you
(Without you Without You) Within you without you
Here comes the song it's about you

Here today, not alone
With my memories
Life is strange how things change
It's reality
You played a beautiful melody
That keeps on haunting me
I can always feel you by my side

And your song will play on without you
And this world won't forget about you
Every part of you was in your song
Now we will carry on... Never Without you
(Never Without You) Within you without you
(Within you without you)
Here comes the song it's about you

I know all things must pass
And only love will last
I'll always love the memory of you and me
Take it away Eric

And your song will play on without you
And this world won't forget about you
Every part of you was in your song
Now we will carry on...Never Without you
(Never Without You)Within you without you
(Within you without you)
I think love is about you
