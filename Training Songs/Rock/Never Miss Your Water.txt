Jilly was a young girl
Treated her like she was a friend of mine
She wanted me for a lover
But damn did I see it
Man, I was so blind

Because the grass looks greener on the other side
Your cup runneth over till you're never satisfied 
She was the one, but I thought there was another
I came out lookin' like a prodigal lover

Now I... I know that you never miss your water till you're dry
(Never miss your water... your water till you're dry)
Now I... I know that you never miss your water till you're dry; why, why
(Never miss your water... your water till you're dry)

You can't buy love, but you spend all your money just makin' time
Yeah, the best things are free
Can you please tell me why I ain't got a dime?

Because the grass looks greener on the other side
Your cup runneth over till you're never satisfied 
She was the one, but I thought there was another
I came out lookin' like a prodigal lover

Now I... I know that you never miss your water till you're dry
(Never miss your water... your water till you're dry)
Now I... I know that you never miss your water till you're dry; why, why
(Never miss your water... your water till you're dry)
Now I... I know that you never miss your water till you're dry; why, why

Jilly is a woman now
My, oh, my
How things have changed
She's turnin' heads and breakin' hearts
Everyone in town wants to know her name

Now I... I know that you never miss your water till you're dry
(Never miss your water... your water till you're dry)
Now I... I know that you never miss your water till you're dry; why, why
(Never miss your water... your water till you're dry)
Now I... I know that you never miss your water
