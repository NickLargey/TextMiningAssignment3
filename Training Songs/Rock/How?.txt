I don't care, I don't mind
Just as long as we find some time

Just come back, I'll stay out of the way
And be all the things you need
Another mouth to feed

How can I be sure again, once more
How can I find time to be with you again

How can I give you the answers you need
When all I possess is a melody, yeah
How can I take up the air that you breathe
When all I possess is a melody

How can I be sure again, once more

I don't care, I don't mind
Just as long as we find some time

When you come back I'll go out of my way
To be all the things you need
Another mouth to feed

How can I give you the answers you need
When all I possess is a melody, yeah
How can I take up the air that you breathe
When all I possess is a melody

How can I find time to be with you again?

When you come back I'll go out of my way
To be all the things you need
Another mouth to feed
