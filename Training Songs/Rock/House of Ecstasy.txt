If you want pleasure for free 
Some French company 
Take a ride to the House of Ecstasy 
Take a ride with me 
Time stands still for each pleasure and thrill 
Meet the love of your life 
With looks that kill 
Oh I know you will 

[Chorus :]
So boy take a ride 
To the House of Ecstasy 
Once you come 
You'll never leave 
The House of Ecstasy 
Take a ride with me 
It'll stimulate your passions 
Ease your insecurities 
With their perfume pillows and satin sheets 
Someone told me it's the All-American dream 
Oh what a scream 

[Chorus :] 

Guitar solo 

[Chorus :]

If you want pleasure for free 
Some French company 
Take a ride to the House of Ecstasy yeah 
House of Ecstasy yeah 
House of Ecstasy
