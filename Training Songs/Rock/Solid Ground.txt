Just nod your head complacently 
Just fall into line and wait there patiently 
Its just what they want 
Its just what they planned 
Total control 
And we have become 
The ones they command 
Don't have to take it anymore 
We've already been through this before 
We don't have to fall for their every deception 

So we will search for sold ground 
And we will push on 
And turn this thing around 
Its just what they fear 
When we won't adhere 
To total control 
And we have become the ones they command
