Underneath me you are melting
Soon enough you will be shouting
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love 
It's all we need

Seems there is no other way now
We've been gone for many days now
Gimme your love 
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
It's all we need

[Chorus: x2]
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme a love that's sweet as , Oh yeah

Til our last breath we will love dear
I have time for nothing else here
Gimme your love 
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
It's all we need

[Chorus: x2]

What do you say to, one of you please get out?
One of you got to, one of you got to
What do you say to, one of you please get out?
One of you got to, one of you got to

[Chorus: x2]

I have time for nothing else here
Til our last breath we will love dear

[Chorus: x2]

Wasting away in my hotel room all alone with you
Wasting away in my hotel room

[Chorus]
