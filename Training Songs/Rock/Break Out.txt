And where I'm going, and I know where I'll be
And I know that I'll find some things
That made my life begin
Now the world is neither good nor bad,
The whole thing's up to you
If you just breakout and be free
Yeah baby, baby, baby
Breakout and you'll see - come on, now baby
You're gonna see,
Then you'll be a
Livin' lovin' walkin' talkin' beautiful person
Who's not afraid to know who you - you are
Yeah now, baby - breakout and be free
Yeah baby, baby, baby
Breakout and you'll see
Just around the corner, is a place few people see

A house dressed, home of love and peace,
A place for you and me,
If you want to share this world with me,
Then I could take you there
Wish you would breakout and be free
Yeah baby, baby, baby
Breakout and you'll see - now, come on, now
You're gonna see
Then you'll be a
Livin' lovin' walkin' talkin' beautiful person
Who's not afraid to know who you - you are
Come on now baby - you're gonna see
Then you'll be a
Livin' lovin' walkin' talkin' beautiful person
Who's not afraid to know who you - you are
