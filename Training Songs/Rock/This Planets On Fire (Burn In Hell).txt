Canceled flights, limousines, 
Hustle bustles, crazy scenes. 
First, you're here, then, you're there 
Pretty soon, man, you've been everywhere. 
Ooh, this planet's on fire 
Oh, Satan's desire 
We've seen the rise, we'll see the fall 
He's here to see us all, 
Burn in hell. 
Time ticks away, faster, faster. 
You run so fast you forget what you're after. 
You make a deal to sell your soul 
Just to find out, baby, it's been sold. 
Ooh, this planet's on fire 
Oh, Satan's desire 
We've seen the rise, we'll see the fall 
He's here to see us all, 
Burn in hell. 
Burn in hell. 
Not me, baby! 
Ooh, this planet's on fire 
Oh, Satan's desire 
We've seen the rise, we'll see the fall 
He's here to see us all, 
Burn in hell. 
Fine, white lines of crystal light 
Keep us up all day and all night. 
Oh, we just forgot girls and boys 
Who thrive on cosmic toys. 
Ooh, this planet's on fire 
Oh, Satan's desire 
We've seen the rise, we'll see the fall 
He's here to see us all, 
Burn in hell. 
Burn in hell, Ow! 
(This planet's on fire) 
(This planet's on fire) 
Ooh, this planet's on fire 
Oh, Satan's desire 
Ooh, this planet's on fire 
Oh, Satan's desire, yeah! 
Yes!
