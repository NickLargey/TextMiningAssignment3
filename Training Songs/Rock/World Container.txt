There's a world container with your name on it
And a billion ways to go berserk
When the country quits on you it must be dinner
And the Himmler on this one is there's no dessert
(He's the one who couldn't imagine all the people living life in peace)

Good News! You get to vanish
Go to Cleveland, be an indie smash
The good news is now you're smaller
The bad news is you can be smaller than that

Go suck some souls, be a reader, get used
Laugh at a funeral or two
And laugh til all the chameleons turn black
Laugh and laugh til you're told 'please don't come back'
Then fake incredulous, say 'I just can't believe!
How'd it get so late so early?'
Say 'ain't life a grand and I'm in awe of y'all'
Then drop into your haunted bunk
Go to your touchless times out where the water's drying
Go past the 'No Attractions Past This Point' sign

What you'll find there are all flaws in progress
Where all songs are one song and that song is Don't Forget
Where all songs are one song and that song is Don't Forget

I've faked incredulous and said 'I just can't believe!
How'd it get so late so early?'
Said, 'ain't life a grand and I'm in awe of y'all'
I've dropped into my haunted bunk
Been to your touchless times out where the water's drying
Been past the 'No Attractions Past This Point' sign

What we have here are all flaws in progress
Where all songs are one song and that song is Don't Forget
Where all songs are one song and that song is Don't Forget
Where all songs are one song and that song is Don't Forget
