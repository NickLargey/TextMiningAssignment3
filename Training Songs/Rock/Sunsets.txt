Sunsets over the beaches from now on
Each day looking for new ways to go

Maybe I should drop by 
Maybe I should have called
Maybe I should have followed you and beat down your door
Maybe it's gonna be breaking you every time you fall
But to shower you with pity will do you no good at all

Slow burn watching the world turn from my arms
New way of measuring each day till it's gone

Maybe I should drop by 
Maybe I should have called
Maybe I should have followed you and beat down your door
Maybe it's gonna be breaking you every time you fall
But to shower you with pity will do you no good at all, no good at all

Sunrise building a reprise in my heart 
Regret tight around my chest plays its part
until its gone
yeah, until its gone

But to shower you with pity will do you no good at all, no good at all

Watching the sunset sunset sunset sunset
over the beaches beaches beaches beaches
