Tread softly tonight
Because our worries are all out of sight.
And your halo is bright
For the first time since we took flight.

And I would like us to sway, 
Slow-dancing further away
From this place, from this place.

Speak gently tonight, 
Just a whisper to make us ignite.
And you headache is gone,
And so are we by the first light of dawn.

And I would like us to sway, slow dancing further away from this place, from this place.
And I would like us to sway, slow dancing
Further away from this place, from this place,
With such grace.
