There's no place that I'd rather be than right here
With my red necks, white socks and blue ribbon beer
The bar-maid is mad 'cause some guy made a pass
The juke box is play-in' there stands the glass
And the cigarette smoke kind-a hangs in the air
Rednecks, white socks and blue ribbon beer

A cowboy is cursin' the pinball machine
A drunk at the bar is get-tin' noisy and mean
And, some guy on the phone says ill be home soon dear
Red-necks white socks and blue ribbon beer

[Chorus]
No we don't fit in with that white collar crowd
We're a little too rowdy and a little too loud
There's no place that I'd rather be than right here
With my red-necks white socks and blue ribbon beer

The semis are passing on the highway outside
The four thirty crowd is about to arrive
The sun's go-in' down and we'll all soon be here
Red-necks, white socks and blue ribbon beer

[Chorus]

There's no place that I'd rather be than right here
With my red-necks, white socks and blue ribbon beer
