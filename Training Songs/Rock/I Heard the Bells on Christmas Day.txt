I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old, familiar carols play
And wild and sweet
The words repeat
Of peace on earth, good-will to men

Till ringing, singing on its way
The world revolved from night to day
A voice, a chime
A chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good-will to men

And in despair I bowed my head
"There is no peace on earth," I said
"For hate is strong
And mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men"

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
Oh God's not dead and not asleep
The Wrong shall fail
The Right prevail
With peace on earth, good-will to men

Peace on earth, good-will to men
Peace on earth, good-will to men
Peace on earth, good-will to men
Peace on earth, good-will to men
