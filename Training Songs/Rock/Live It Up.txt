Well, alright

How come your money's always in the bank?
Then you always say you're broke
Why don't you get a shot of confidence?
'Cause the way you live's a joke

How come you never take a second chance?
Just what are you waiting for?
You think you're beat so you don't compete
Well, I know what I'm gonna do

I'm gonna live it up, all of the time
I'll do it all night, whoa yeah
I'm gonna live it up, I'm takin' what's mine
I'm stayin' up all night
So get ready to live it up

Don't live it down, gotta live it up
Don't live it down, gotta live it up

Do you remember back when you were young?
You used to knock 'em dead in their tracks
Why don't you take a bite of somethin' new?
And give yourself a pat on the back

It's not too late, so communicate
'Cause I know what I'm gonna do

I'm gonna live it up, all of the time
Do it all night, whoa yeah
I'm gonna live it up, I'm takin' what's mine
I'm stayin' up all night
So get ready

Gonna live it up, all of the time
Do it all night, whoa yeah
I'm gonna live it up, I'm takin' what's mine
Stayin' up all night
Stayin' up all night
Stayin' up all night

Don't live it down, gotta live it up
Don't live it down, gotta live it up

I've only got one life to live
I'm gonna live it up
I'm gonna drag myself to the top
You're gonna hear me say, ?Don't stop?

Gonna live it up, all of the time
Gonna live it up, whoa yeah
I wanna live it up, takin' what's mine
I'm stayin' up all night, so get ready

I'm gonna live it up, all of the time
Do it all night, whoa yeah
I wanna live it up, I'm takin' what's mine
Stayin' up all night, so get ready to live it up
