We're going to stand proud
Won't let your rules get us down
Talking shit about that way we act
You say we're Nazi's on the attack
Skinhead youth - fighting in the street
Skinhead youth - all as one
Skinhead youth - filled with pride
Skinhead youth - will never die

Don't tell me that we're wrong
The way we think, the way we live
United skins, that's our goal
All our pride, it shall stand tall
If you get in our way, you shall fall
