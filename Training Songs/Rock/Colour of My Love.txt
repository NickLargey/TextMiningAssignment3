Ahhâ€¦

Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my only love

Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my only love

Love, make a make
Me a love song to sing
I'm in the right 
She is wrong
And she knows
(Easy now that it shows)

I want her love 
But she won't let me in
When I see her
I think who's fooling who
(She loves you too)

Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my only love

Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my only love

Baby there's someone else
But I won't give in
I'll play her game
And I hope I don't lose
(You'll be the one she will choose)

Love, make a make
Me a love song to sing
She'll hear my song 
And I hope she'll be there
(She knows you care) 

Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my only love

Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my only love
Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my only love

Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my only love
