Hip-shakin', boogie baby
You're never gonna be no queen
Passed your time and lost your prime
Now you're twenty years past your teens

Well, like a blast from the bloodline special
And the doctors are growing rich
What the guys in town are being passed around
It ain't no seven year itch

Rockin' Moonbeam
You're a cool operator
Rockin' Moonbeam
You old heart breaker
Rockin' Moonbeam
You two-bit taker
Cover up your frown
It's only age that will slow you down

Rockin' Moonbeam
Rock, Rockin' Moonbeam
Hip-shakin', boogie baby
You're never gonna be no queen
Passed your time and lost your prime
Now you're twenty years past your teens
