We both had doubts
We both had doubts
I found myself while I was away
All your life, now I understand
So many hours
And no company
But you imagine things
Through cold eyes of sleep
Then what have I seen this for
We both know about

All my life
You were important
And your father too
Wandering the orchard
Through budding dormant eyes
On a lamp lit plane
You imagine things
Why does this speak to me?
To you I know I'll only sail without?
My life is dull
And my body aches
Oh then what I have I seen this for?

Oh I imagine things
Through cold eyes of sleep
And I want things
Back more than I do
My life is dull
And my body aches
Oh this blood in my mouth
Makes me hate
How we both end up.
