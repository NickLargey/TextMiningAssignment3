Let's say I'm feeling better
Let's say I'm feeling fine
Let's say I gave you all I had
And now I'm out of time
And it aches and it hurts and it burns
Oh it kills me

Tick, tock, you don't stop
You don't fade
You just stay
But I'll do it all again

Now don't you call me baby
Just don't pretend you care
Save your sorry for yourself
When Judas takes you there, 
And he will take you there 

Once I really believed
There was nothing out there for the lost and lonely
But a voice in my head kept banging on my heart
Says you're not the only one
But it kills me

Tick, tock, you don't stop
You don't fade
You just stay
But I'll do it all again

I'll do it all again

Tick, tock, you don't stop
You don't fade
You just stay
But I'll do it all again

I'll do it all again
But I'll do it all again
