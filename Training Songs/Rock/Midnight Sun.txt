As far as the eye could see
From the horizon to infinity
Static forces down the line
Connecting voices talking rhymes

Can't decode nor can define
The signal's perfect indicates a sign

Midnight sun
Guiding light
Take the eye
Go skimming
Across the sky

As far as the eye could see
Communications were all down
Connecting voices in the air
New formations moving sound
Then came what I could not explain
I felt a hand turned around and saw a face
