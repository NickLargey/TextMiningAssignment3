I don't like to worry 
About no one else 
I like to be, you know alone and free 
I'm happy by myself yeah 
But here comes this girl whoa, yeah 
I've seen em all around the world 
She looks into me 
Looks right through me 

[Chorus:]
Don't you know it hit me like a hammer 
Hit me like a ton of lead 
You know it hit me like a hammer 
You know it hit me, baby 

I told myself to take it easy 
'cause this won't last long 
A day or two I'll be back in love 
And she'll be long gone, yeah 
But then she caught my eye whoa yeah 
I knew that it was all a lie 
I started shakin' 
My heart was breakin 

[Chorus] 

And now I can't stop this feelin' I got, I want to know 
'Cause there's no time to make up my mind 
You shocked me, now you've got me, if you really want me 

But here comes this girl whoa yeah 
I've seen em all around the world 
She looks into me 
Looks right through me 

[Chorus] 

Shocked me, now you've got me 
You know it hit me like a hammer 
Hit me like a five pound sledge. 
You know it hit me, baby.
