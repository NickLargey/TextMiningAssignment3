From his youth, he sees inside,
A slow parades of storms
Lessons learned from fear are nothin' to lose
The voice remeins it sounds the same
Even from so far
And he feels much better
From the sky hear the call

Faces and colors they change I fade my believin'
When I'm lost in the shadows to roam
The voice of Eujena can send me home

Draw this bridge and sail away
The boy becomes a man
To fight his own battles and realize some dreams
Beacon light shine all around
Guides the sheep to shore
And he feels much better
In the light safe he goes

Faces and colors they change I fade from believin'
I feel lost in the shadows alone
With no ending
Faces and colors they've changed
Through all that I've known
But thevoice of Eujena can send me home

In silent times my closest friend
Without her strength I'd fall
Peace of mind and soul are nothing to lose
Rest inside her voice and find
Everything I need
And I feel much better
May the voice carry on
