Hello amsterdam my name is fernando
Hello amsterdam I bet you've seen my kind before
Another sad tourist with his eyes rolling in his head
Another sad tourist who never had a drink before

Hello amsterdam you didn't like my waterloo
Hello amsterdam I wish I had something to offer you
Tail between my leg I crawl back to the canal
All alone with my eyes rolling like the moon

Superstar

There once was a white elephant
That escaped from the zoo
Got to the big city and didn't know what to do
Had a sticker on his shirt that said,
'hello my name is unclean'
I swear they would have liked us
If we'd played dancing queen

Hello amsterdam don't I look cool in my white shirt
Hello amsterdam don't I look hip in my red tie
We came from america so you could share in the pride
Guilt, greed, and genocide

Superstar
