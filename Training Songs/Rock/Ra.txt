Burning fiery furnace in the sky
Burns the ground around us where we lie
Sad old black-faced thunder will you rise
Bring your cloud and shadows to our eyes 

Blazing star in heaven, mirror bright
Dry our seas and rivers with your light
Universal sentinel you are
Guide of all who look on from afar 

Blazing Ra
God of old now broken and defaced
Punish all who've fallen from your grace
You whose power leaves the deepest scar
Mystic eye of heaven, Amun Ra
