Who wants to laugh Who wants to sing 
And who is the king of the disco swing 
He wants to laugh and he wants to sing
But who wants to be the disco king 

Over and over and over and over the radio's on but I don't hear a song
Absurd is the word to describe what I've heard and my heads in a spin 
From the state that we're in

Hopeless me a fool I've been 
I'm just two legs of the groove machine
I don't like the words I can't stand the beat
And I don't need the thrill of the world at my feet

I've entered a world 
Full of ugly girls 
With kisses and curls 
And a hold on the world
How sick has it become
How sick has it become
How sick has it become
How sick has it become

(There's an idiot wind and there's lies on the rise)
So who wants to laugh and who wants to sing 
But who the hell would be the disco king 

There's an idiot wind and there's lies on the rise
