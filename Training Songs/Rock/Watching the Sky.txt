Everyone was dancin' or reelin'
And the band was playin' with feelin'
While the rest of the world was rockin'
You and I were sittin' there talkin'

Watchin' all of the people
Watchin' all of the sky fall down

Said that you were always too shy
And everythin' kept passin' you by
While the rest of the world was rockin'
You and I kept sittin' there talkin'

Watchin' all of the people
Watchin' all of the sky fall down

A new year was lightin' the sky
And all you did was sit there and cry
And while the rest of the world was rockin'
You and I kept sittin' there talkin'

Watchin' all of the people
Watchin' all of the sky fall
Watchin' all of the people
Watchin' all of the sky fall down
