Burn down all your idols, destroy your idols
Create a scene
There goes all your reason, it's helter skelter
It's not a dream

Come down from the altar, remove your blindfold
What do you see?
Nothing left to do here, there's nothing new here
It's all the same

You're going down, down, down, how low can you go? x3
Hare, Hare Krishna, was that your sister
A covergirl?
A wasted primadonna, she lost her way here

She disappeared
Come back to your altar, and build a fire
It's getting cold
Nothing stops the rain here, there's not a soul here

You're all alone
You're going down, down, down, how low can you go? 
You're going down, down, down, how low can you go? 
You're going down, down, down, how low can you go? 

Here we go now
Build a new religion, no inhibition
No alibi
Televised confession, a true obsession

Is on the rise
Miscommunication, disinformation
A perfect waste
Bite the sacred apple

Suck the poison
Enjoy the taste
You're going down, down, down
How low can you go?

You're going down, down, down
How low can you go?
You're going down, down, down 
You're going down, down, down 

You're going down, down, down 
How low can you go?
How low can you go? 
How low can you go?

How low can you go?
