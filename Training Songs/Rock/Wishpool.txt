In a pool of wishes, wish for only time.
All the things you're missing, throw it down inside.
From the bottom, you will be hiding everything you know,
And your sins have set you free.
Can't get away from
Feeling that you're better off to live another lie.
Can't get away from
Knowing you'd be better off, if you could find a place to hide.
Walking into blindness, feel it scratch your eyes.
Maybe you should listen, maybe you won't die.
Bitter tone you talk to me, I sting from every word,
And my pride begins to rage.
Can't get away from
Feeling that you're better off to live another lie.
Can't get away from
Knowing you'd be better off, if you could find a place to hide.
I hear you speak; you lie.
I hear you speak; you lie.
A new lie, a new lie.
