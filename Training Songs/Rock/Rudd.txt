All exits marked and named
The signs shows it was too late
Good intentions gone to waste
Stupid thought for a stupid place

I cut across the road
Too many things are watching me now

Torn curtain and a dusty screen
Cough and stumble find my seat
Good intentions gone to waste
Stupid thought for a stupid place

I cut across the road
Too many things are watching me now

Shortwave radio
Cheap magazines
I heard about you
But now we're comin through

We just gotta find our way
We just gotta find our way

I cut across the road
Too many things are watching me now
I cut across the road
I just sit and watch and wait now

Shortwave radio
Cheap magazines
I heard about you
But now we're comin' through

We just gotta find our way
We just gotta find our way

Two down and five to go

I cut across the road
Too many things are watching me now
I cut across the road
I just sit and watch and wait now
