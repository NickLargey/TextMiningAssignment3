You ride on the swing 
In and out of the bars
Capturing moments of life in a jar
Playing with children, 

Acting as stars
Guiding your visions to heaven 
And heaven is in your mind
Take extra care not 

To lose what up feel
The apple you're eating 
Is simple and real
Water the flowers 

That grow at you heel
Guiding your visions to heaven 
And heaven is in your mind
