Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams, sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

Before you go
Please remember I need you so
And this love that I have for you
Will never grown cold

If you should awake in the still of the night
Please have no fear
For I'll be there, you know I care
Please give your love to me, dear, only

Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams, sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

Before you go
Please remember I need you so
And this love that I have for you
Will never grown cold

My love, goodbye
