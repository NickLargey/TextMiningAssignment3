Re-write these words upon my grave
And look down on everything we've loved
Loose lips sink ships and leaders
For this you need to lead us all.

For every change that you've put down on me
I've re-read this stone a hundred times.

Would you stand over these shadows and embrace our history?

We apologise for nothing
We apologise for nothing
Take the world away from us but
We apologise for nothing.

If I could gather strength a final time
And dream up a war to end all wars
Race lists and mist of vengeance
I don't fear your movements anymore.

Lets celebrate this change in turning tides
This revolution won't be televised.

Would you stand over these shadows and embrace our history?

We apologise for nothing
We apologise for nothing
Take the world away from us but
We apologise for nothing.

Cut me out of all of this
Cut me out of all of this you say
Just cut me out of all of this
Cut me out of all of this you say.

Would you stand over these shadows and embrace our history?

We apologise for nothing
Take the world away from us but
We apologise for nothing
We apologise for nothing.

Floods Lyrics
You can't all pretend
That you don't know enough
Enough to make sense
All this will be gone
And you can sink beneath
The rapture we've spawned

What have we become

You know we don't have all the entire world
To make the floods seem still
You know we don't have all the entire world
To make the most of this

Blood will bleed the blind
When the only thing diseased their lives
Let not the sun their lives
On the wrath of this inconvenient truth

What have we become

You know we don't have all the entire world
To make the floods seem still
You know we don't have all the entire world
To make the most of this

Just smile like the idiots you are

You know we don't have all the entire world
To make the floods seem still
You know we don't have all the entire world
To make the most of this
