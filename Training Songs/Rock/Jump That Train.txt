I gotta run, 'cause I hear it comin', I gotta jump that train.
I gotta run, 'cause I hear it comin', I gotta jump that train.
I got tears in my eyes like fallin' rain, that's why I'm ridin' the blues train.

John Lee Hooker had it all figured out,
When he said, "It's in you and it's got to come out",
I believe it's true, 'cause it worked for me before,
If ain't right the first time, try it once more.
No need to tell you 'cause it's understood,
And it feels so good, yes it feels so good.

I got to run, 'cause I hear it comin', I got to jump that train.
I got to run, 'cause I hear it comin', I got to jump that train.
I got tears in my eyes like fallin' rain,
I got to jump, jump that train, I got to jump, jump that train,
I got to jump, jump that train, that's why I'm ridin' the blues train.

Jenny's got a face twice as long as a kite,
'Cause she didn't get everything she wanted last night.
Her daddy's got money and she should be satisfied,
With her brand new Roller and a pony to ride.
Wants to find a lover, needs to be understood,
And I know she could, yet I know she could.

I got to run, 'cause I hear it comin', I got to jump that train,
I got to run, 'cause I hear it comin', I got to jump that train,
I got tears in my eyes like fallin' rain, that's why I'm ridin' the blues train.

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...

I gotta jump, jump that train, I gotta jump, jump that train,
I got to jump, jump that train.

I got to run, 'cause I hear it comin', I got to jump that train,
I got to run, 'cause I hear it comin', I got to jump that train.
I got to run, 'cause I hear it comin', I got to jump that train,
I got to run, 'cause I hear it comin', I got to jump that train.
Whoo!

Jump that train, jump that train, c'mon baby! Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...
