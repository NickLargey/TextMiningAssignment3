I don't mind if you treat me bad again 
I don't care anymore 
Life's too short to make trouble out of small things 
It is better this way 
I am sort of laid back today

I close my ears when words come flying out 
I have heard them all before 
Just a lot of hope flushing down the drain 
It is better this way 
I am going away 

I've tried and then some more 
Instead of dragging the both of us down 
Divide, separate ways 
It's never easy this way 
It's never easy this way 

My palms are sweating 
I'm barely aware 
Of what I'm turning down 
It's all for life that is what I've been told
I think it's better this way 
I will regret it one day 

I've tried and then some more 
Instead of dragging the both of us down 
Divide, separate ways 
It's never easy this way 
It's never easy this way 

Talk to me, throw the ball back 
I've been here before, there is no turning back 
Talk to me, just tell it like it is 
Just two afraid souls
Going at each other, at each other 

We're at the crossroads going separate ways
Time to say it as it is 
And if we bump into each other one day 
It will be better, then 
Maybe we can start all over again 

I've tried and then some more 
Instead of dragging the both of us down 
Divide, separate ways
It's never easy this way 
It's never easy this way
