If she wanted the world
To be a happier place
She'd stop at least one tear
From rolling down my face
She'd think about me
Maybe pick up the phone
And say "I'm missing you"
At the sound of the tone

If she wanted the world
To keep spinning around
She'd pick a piece of my heart
Up off of the ground
I'd whisper her name
In the still of the night
And while I'm dreaming of her
Holding me tight
She'd be changing her mind
Packing her clothes
She'd buy a one-way ticket
That would bring her home

And she'd come back to me
She'd be more than just a memory
She'd come back to me
And we would fall in love
Forever all over again

If I'd only known
How I'd be breaking inside
I would have begged her to stay
I would have swallowed my pride
I wouldn't be here
Drinking alone
I'd be holding her
'Cause she wouldn't be gone

So God if you're listening
From somewhere out there
You know I'm down on my knees
And if you'd answer one prayer

Then she'd come back to me
She'd be more than just a memory
She'd come back to me
And we would fall in love
Forever all over again

Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah
If she wanted the world
To be a happier place
She's stop at least one tear
From rolling down my face

She'd be changing her mind
Packing her clothes
She'd buy a one-way ticket
That would bring her home

Then she'd come back to me
She'd be more than just a memory
She'd come back to me
And we would fall in love
Forever all over again
Forever all over again
Yeah we would fall in love
Forever all over again
