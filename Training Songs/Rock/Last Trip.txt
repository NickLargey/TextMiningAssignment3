Here I stand, my angel
With a three quartz broken heart
You said the grass was greener
You knew that from the start
It's the last trip to my baby's arms tonight

Got my bread from the baker
Two-bit crusty roll
Sang my song to the savior
And down the road I go
It's the last trip to my baby's arms tonight

Any day now, see me walking
Hear me knocking on your front door
Catch a bus, catch a train
Catch a plane, it's all the same
It's the last trip to my baby's arms tonight

Dreaming of her ways
Her caressing, my obsessing
She made me cry
As I walk along, find myself smiling
I'm about to lose my broken heart
On the last trip to my baby's arms tonight
