I'm down in a hole, baby
You're lockin' me up, you're lockin' me up
I got found by a cold lady
She's lockin' me up, she's lockin' me up
I am down in hole baby,
I'm 'bout to give up, just about to give up
I got found by a cold lady
She's lockin' me up, lockin' me up

And this pain, this pain I feel
Won't set me free from you

'Cause I'm a prisoner of your heart
Takin' it slow, but then I locked up hard
I am a prisoner of your heart
I was takin' it slow, and I was caught off guard

I'm helpless, and I'm hurting
I'm affixed to your moves and you're shakin' me down
You got me locked up
In the doghouse
You had to chain me up 'cause I was fallin' for you
I am a hopeless situation
I've been cut to the bone and I'm coming for more
So if you need me I'll be waiting
For the girl that I love just to figure me out

This lockless cage you trapped me in
Has brought me to my knees

'Cause I'm a prisoner of your heart
Takin' it slow, but then I locked up hard
I am a prisoner of your heart
I was takin' it slow when I got caught off guard
I am a prisoner of your heart
Takin' it slow, but then I locked up hard
I am a prisoner of your heart


Well I'm a prisoner of your heart
Takin' it slow, but then I locked up hard
I am a prisoner of your heart
I was takin' it slow when I got caught off guard
I am a prisoner of your heart
Takin' it slow, but then I locked up hard
I am a prisoner of your heart
Takin' it slow, and I got caught off guard
