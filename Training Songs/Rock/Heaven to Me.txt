You’re heaven to me
Yeah she's so real my lady
Well the chimes of my kingdom rang
And the Lord has advised me to do my thing

You’re heaven to me
And I ain’t no believer baby
But you must have one or two things to do with a place above
I’d like to call you my one true love

Oh you're heaven to me
Yeah my heart is skipping beats like I’m crazy
If the amount of love I wish to give
Is more than you can stand
I’d loose my marbles baby to be your man

What a hot buttered day

Oh, you lift me above the town
Then drag me underground
And I wonder how
Yeah, on a lazy afternoon
Tell what’s your ruse
Cause I wonder how

Well my honey and me
It looks like a high class movie
Everyone knows in this world that will never end
Eloping over yonder to the far old distant land
