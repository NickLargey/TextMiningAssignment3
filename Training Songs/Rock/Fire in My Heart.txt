Somethings are temporary, somethings change
Somethings you never know are just fadin' away
I stood in darkness and I watched you leave

Sometimes something gets a hold of you
Like you got hold of me
Cause there's a fire here that's burnin' bright
I shut it out and I refused to believe
Some lonely night you'll see

I got a fire in my heart
That is never gonna die
You say you're never comin' back
But I never said goodbye
With a fire in my heart
I'll keep alive the flame
Now every night I'm lyin' here awake

In the candle light I see your face
I can't believe you'd throw it all away

Cause I just can't let it go
That is never gonna die
I'm the kind who falls in love
I got a fire in my heart
And never says goodbye
I'll keep alive the flame
With a fire in my heart

Woo ohh
Woo ohh

Ohhh oh
I got a fire in my heart
You say you're never comin' back
That is never gonna die
But I never said goodbye
With a fire in my heart
I'll keep alive the flame

That is never gonna die
I'm the kind who falls in love
I'll keep alive the flame
And never says goodbye
With a fire in my heart
