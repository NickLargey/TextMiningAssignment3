The sunshine fills the island
All is calm across the bay
I can hear the children laughing
Down the streets we used to play, yeah
Oh, the girls they all adored you
Everybody sang your name
Till something deep destroyed you, oh yeah
And now it's up to you to change
Come on, Georgie Boy
Why don't you stand up and fight?
Be it winter, summer, or spring or fall
You just hangin there
Down by the old town hall
Remember that summer evening
When we stole your father's car?
You said "hey, boys, I'm leaving"
But you didn't get too far
You had this way of talking, oh yeah
You said "I'm gonna be a star"
Come on, Georgie Boy
Why don't you stand up and fight?
Be it winter, summer, or spring or fall
You just hangin there
Tear the picture off the wall
Come on, Georgie Boy
Why don't you wake up and fight?
Be it winter, summer, I can still hear you call
You gotta stand this way, believe in yourself
You can, oh yes, you can
Come on, Georgie Boy (2x)
The bees are humming, the birds are singing
Take a step/stand, get out of bed
Wake up, boy, use your head
Come on, Georgie Boy
