(VERSE 1)
There is a time for everyone
But this ain't the time or the place
When will you see what you're doing to me
My tear stains are easy to trace

(CHORUS 1)
Shouldn't do that, you shouldn't do that now baby
Shouldn't do that, did nobody ever tell you that you
Shouldn't do that, shouldn't go that now darling?
Shouldn't do that, did nobody ever tell you not to?

(VERSE 2)
Some things ain't worth the worry
When you fight for them hand over tooth
You've got one hell of a lesson coming
'cause I'm gonna teach you the truth

(CHORUS 2)
Shouldn't do that, you shouldn't do that now darling
Shouldn't do that, did nobody ever tell you that you
Shouldn't do that, shouldn't go that now baby?
Shouldn't do that, did nobody ever tell you not to do it?

(MIDDLE)
Shouldn't do that, shouldn't do that
Shouldn't do that, that, that, that, that, that
Shouldn't do that, shouldn't do that
Shouldn't do that, that, that, that, that

(VERSE 3)
There is a time for most things honey
Some things are easy to see
Some things are better forgotten
Like you sure made a fool out of me

(FINAL CHORUS)
Shouldn't do that, you shouldn't do that now baby
Shouldn't do that, did nobody ever tell you that you
Shouldn't do that, shouldn't go that now darling?
Shouldn't do that, did nobody ever tell you not to?
Shouldn't do that, you shouldn't do that now darling
Shouldn't do that, did nobody ever tell you that you
Shouldn't do that, shouldn't go that now baby?
Shouldn't do that, did nobody ever tell you not to?
