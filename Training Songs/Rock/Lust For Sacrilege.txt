She makes the sign of the cross
While she lies in bed
Last temptation of love
A life for sin
Cryinâ€™ to the dark
A lost wicked game
Lust for sacrilege
A lust for hell
Pulls her in the flames

She goes out
Hunts through the night
Crucified
No one survives
She is the blood, spirit of none
Lust on fire
Future loser, future undead
Keeps her alive

Bodies melt away
Bodies burn to ash
Sins of the flesh
A Judas kiss to ruin man
She dreams of holy wars
Of gold coins used for death
Lust for sacrilege
A lust for hell (Whoa-whoa, yeah)

She goes out
Hunts through the night
Crucified
No one survives
She is the blood, spirit of none
Lust on fire
Future loser, future undead
Keeps her alive

She goes out
Hunts through the night

Lust on fire
Future loser, future undead
Keeps her alive
Keeps her alive
Keeps her alive
Keeps her alive
Keeps her alive
