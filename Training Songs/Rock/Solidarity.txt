Everybody wants the same things don't they
Everybody wants a happy end
They just want to see the game on Saturday
They wanna be somebody's friend

Everybody wants to work for a living
Everybody wants to keep their children warm
Everybody just wants to be forgiven
Everyone wants shelter from the storm

Look at me I ain't your enemy
Why can't we walk on common ground
We don't need to be fighting each other
What we need, what we need is solidarity

Nobody likes to ask for money
Nobody likes to play the clown
Nobody likes waiting in the long lines
Nobody likes being pushed around

Everybody wants their family protected
They only want to express themselves
Everybody wants to live forever
Everybody wants to be somebody else

Look at me I ain't your enemy
Don't believe everything you hear
This is no time to be fighting each other
What we need, what we need is solidarity
