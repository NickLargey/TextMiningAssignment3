Do you remember once upon a time
When you were mine
The stars above were bright and new
I pulled them down for you

Just when I fell in love again
You said that all good things must end
Baby, that's just the way it is Baby
Baby, that's just the way it is Baby

I never had a head for solitaire
It's so unfair
That I'd should have my chance and lose
Feel like I've been used to help you

Through another night
You spelled in out in black and white
Baby, that's just the way it is Baby
Baby, that's just the way it is Baby

The tides that had once carried you away
They bring you back again today
Time has washed away my pain
You'll find that things have changed

And disappeared without a trace
You can't get back what you've erased
And I say
Baby, that's just the way it is Baby

That's just the way it is
Baby, that's just the way it is Baby
That's just the way it is

Baby, that's just the way it is Baby
Baby, that's just the way it is Baby
Baby, that's just the way it is Baby
Baby, that's just the way it is Baby
Baby, that's just the way it is Baby
Baby, that's just the way it is Baby
