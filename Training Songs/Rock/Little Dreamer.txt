You're a dreamer, a pretty little dreamer
I couldn't leave you, I really couldn't leave you
You didn't gimme, gimme time to beat the fever
I've got the fever, I couldn't beat the fever

Just listen while I'm talking to you all night long
Right or wrong, listen to me all night long
I'm never gonna waste time crying all night long
Right or wrong, I won't be crying all night long

You're a dreamer, a purty little dreamer
I couldn't leave you, I really couldn't leave you
You didn't gimme, gimme time to beat the fever
I've got the fever, I couldn't beat the fever

You're a dreamer, a purty little dreamer
I couldn't leave you, I really couldn't leave you
You didn't gimme, gimme time to beat the fever
I've got the fever, I couldn't beat the fever

I've waited long enough I reckon on my own
Tried to phone, tried to phone but you're not home
I'm thinking while I try and reason what went wrong
Something's gone, ain't no good in hanging on

You're a dreamer, a purty little dreamer
I couldn't leave you, I really couldn't leave you
You didn't gimme, gimme time to beat the fever
I got the fever, a fever for the dreamer

You didn't gimme, gimme time to beat the fever
I've got the fever, a fever for the dreamer
You didn't gimme, gimme time to beat the fever
I've got the fever, a fever for the dreamer

You didn't gimme, gimme, you didn't gimme, gimme
You didn't gimme, gimme, you didn't gimme, gimme
