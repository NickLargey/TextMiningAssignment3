I used to lie in my bed
Sleep wouldn't come
Thinkin' 'bout things that they said
They led me on
All of the fancy ladies
Oh they could talk and talk

I shot for the highest star
But I aimed too high
You wanted a rich rock star
But he made you cry
Now that we have each other
We can laugh about it

[Chorus]
You're not the one I was lookin' for but
You're the one for me (you're the one)
I'm not the one you were lookin' for but
You can't go wrong with me
You're not the one I was lookin' for but
You're oh so good for me

Now I can't make it without
I can't go on
We can make beautiful music
And prove them wrong
We've been put down by the best
And now we laugh about it, ya

[Chorus]

You're oh so good for me (You're so good)
You're oh so good for me (You're so good) 
You're oh so good for me (You're so good)
