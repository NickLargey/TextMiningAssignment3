Do i look like a liar
Do i look like a liar to you
Fighting crime in this time brings a girl down
Makes a body sink so low
And i sink pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
I sink pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
I wish i carried a camera
I'd have proof that you're never where you say
I wish i could fly up in a helicopter
I'd shine a blinding light on your escape
Better to show you
That i'll sink pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
I'll sink pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
Do i look like a crier
Do i look like a cry baby to you
Fighting fire in this town wears a man out
Makes a body break so slow
Remember when we all went out to fire island
You thought you saw a body on the beach
When we got closer it was just a tire
And you were disappointed i could see
So i pretended
And now i'm in pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
I'm in pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
Everything i ever learned is wrong so long so what
Pretty deep, pretty deep, pretty deep
