[Chorus]
Sleep when I'm dead, you angels
I'll sleep when I'm dead, I said
Sleep when I'm dead, you angels
I'll sleep when I'm dead, I said

Sleep when I'm dead, you angels
Well until then

Told me I could run the world
If I kept it clean
Told me I could be the chosen one
If I took one for the team
And it's the only way to be
Never think it isn't fair
It's a green-eyed panic (pride?)
To the edge of nowhere

Give it to the chick
And see if it ticks
Give it to the (kid?)
See if it sticks
Give it to the wonderful, wonderful me
I'll let you know on my return just how it is
with all the other boys and girls

The whole fucking other world
The way they grew to (be?)
(The love they feel about me?)

[Chorus]

Told me I could run the world
If I kept it quiet
They said I could be the man
If I took it out of sight
So in a monkey suit of (pins?)
Having fun with all your friends
How a casual (act can pull?)
All this world to pieces

Give it to the (bunny? bonnie?)
And see if she kicks
Give it to the (puppy?)
See if it sticks
Give it to the wonderful, wonderful me
I'll let you know when I return on how it is
with all the other boys and girls

The whole fucking other world
The way they feel inside
The why they never make it (by?)
The way they are inside
The why I never take the time
The way they are inside
The why I never act surprised
Yeah, just how it is

[Chorus: x2]

Well until then

I may as well be tired, I think
Before I lay me down to dream
