No time like the present
No good looking back
No lives like the future
No bugs in my path
'Cause I got you, you you you
'Cause I got you

Don't need no reflection
Don't analyze my feel
I found my perfection
Got all that I need
Yeah, 'Cause I got you, you you you
'Cause I got you

You're all that I'm after
And all you can be
You call when I answer
You fall when I plea

You're all that I'm after
And all you can be
You call when I answer
You fall when I plea

No time like the present
There's no good looking back
No lives like the future
No bugs in my path
'Cause I got you, you you you
'Cause I got you

'Cause I got you

You you you

'Cause I got you, you you you
'Cause I got you, you you you
'Cause I got you, you you you
'Cause I got you, you you you
'Cause I got you...
