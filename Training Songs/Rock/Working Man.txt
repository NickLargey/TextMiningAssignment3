I get up on Monday and I work all day
I go till Friday when I get my pay
I'm a long, long way from the promised land
Oh, I'm just a working man

It ain't so bad in this factory town
I drink with my buddies when the sun goes down
Some of you people may not understand
No, no, I'm just a working man
I'm just a working man

I'm a working man, that's what I do
I'm a working man, just like you
I'm a working man, I know who I am,
I sweat for my money and I work with my hands

Oh, oh, working man
Oh, oh, working man
Oh, oh, working man
I'm just a working man
Hear me people, I'm just a working man

There's only one way to beat the small town blues
Take of your boots, put on your rock 'n' roll shoes
Come over here baby 'cause I've got something to say
We're gonna rock our troubles away

Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm a working man
Oh, I'm a working man
You've got to understand
I'm just a working man

Working man
I'm a working man
Working man
I'm just a working man
Just like you, I'm just a working man
