Another humdrum gray day
I wonder if this rain passed Toledo
And if so I hope it left a sunny day through your
Window
I can't make shape or form
Of this new emotion

I need a drive up San Fransisco bay
I'd write this song on the way
I'm not sure I belong here anyway
She thinks that I've already gone away

Another hum drum gray day
Maybe I'll head out for a movie
The day is always so bright
After a matinee
Wouldn't you say?

I need a drive up San Fransisco bay
I'd write this song on the way
I'm not sure I belong here anyway
She thinks that I've already gone away

Yeah I figure one day I'll snap out of this
Yeah one day soon I'll pull my head down out of
Outer-space
Yeah I figure one day I'll snap out of this
Yeah one day soon I'll take that drive out
