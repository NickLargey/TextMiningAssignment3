Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up

One year and still the same -- Don't wanna be left aground
Your bullshit and lies to blame -- You can't blame me
You live a lie that's so unique -- That's me, I'm so unique
You're fed on bullshit, now it's reached a peak -- No not me no

You know you know you know you know
You're just a fucking lie -- Man of the world
I know I know I know I know
The fucking reason why -- Man of the world
You know you know you know you know
You're just a fucking blame -- Man of the world
I know I know I know I know
I'll never be the fucking same -- Man of the world

Life goes on it's still the same -- You should know me by now
You're fucked promise still to blame -- Who said I won't be put down
Still live in lie, that's so unique -- Who's sorry now
You're fed on bullshit, it's reached a peak -- Now here you fall

You know you know you know you know
You're just a fucking lie -- Man of the world
I know I know I know I know
The fucking reason why -- Man of the world
You know you know you know you know
You're just a fucking blame -- Man of the world
I know I know I know I know
I'll never be the fucking same -- Man of the world

Shut up, shut up, shut up shut up,
Shut up, shut up, man of the world
Shut up, shut up, man of the world
Shut up, shut up, man of the world...

You know you know you know you know
You're just a fucking lie -- Man of the world
I know I know I know I know
The fucking reason why -- Man of the world
You know you know you know you know
You're just a fucking blame -- Man of the world
I know I know I know I know
I'll never be the fucking same -- Man of the world

What the f*ck do you know?
