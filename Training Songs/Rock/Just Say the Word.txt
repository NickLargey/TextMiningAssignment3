Holdin' on 
To your pictures on my telephone 
And I know that I should let you go 
But it's hard to break away 

I ask around 
And I wonder what you're doing now 
But I hear that you been going out a little more these days 

But I can't lie 
That I think from time to time how you're doing 
Well don't hang up, 'cause what I really meant to say 

[Chorus]
When everything's wrong and nothings going right 
Just know that I'm not hard to find, 
So just say the word and I'll race through the night 
And I'll be right there by your side 
(Holdin' on) 

Remember when, 
We were further than you've ever been 
And I think about it now and then 
And it takes me to that place 

When I pretend 
That I'm better than I've ever been 
Well at least that's what I tell my friends 
Cause I can't show my face 

Well I can't lie 
That I think from time to time how you're doing 
Don't hang up 'cause what I really meant to say 

[Chorus]

It's hard enough 
To believe in something 
More than just pretend 
Just because we both know it's over 
We can still be friends 
Yeah 

[Chorus]

I can be right there by your side 
Oh 
I can be right there by your side 
Just say the word and I'll race through the night
