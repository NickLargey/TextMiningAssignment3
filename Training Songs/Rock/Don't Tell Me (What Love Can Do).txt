It's ok, I'll do what I want 
If I choose, I can take the fall 
There's a choice 
It's my destiny 
In my hands 
Yeah, it's up to me 
I can drive 
I can shoot a gun in the streets 
Score me some heroin 
I can jump 
Be the sacrifice 
Bear the cross just like Jesus Christ 
And I don't want to hear 
What love can do 
No, I ain't gonna tell ya 
What's right for you 
Is it right to take the easy way 
Close your eyes 
Get on your knees an' pray 
Now you're saved by a higher voice 
Givin' up, givin' up, givin' up your 
Choice 
If I'm wrong, then I'll pay for it 
If I'm right, yeah you're gonna hear 
About it 
But I've tried, yeah, I've tried for it 
I tried, I tried, 'til I'm satisfied 
And I... 
I'm tired of hearing what love can do 
And I... 
Ain't gonna tell you what's right for 
You 
I've seen the damage done 
Down with the shotgun 
Don't stop the setting sun on my 
Kingdom com 
Ohhh...
Is it right to take the easy way 
I don't know, I get on my knees an' 
Pray 
Now I'm saved by a higher voice 
Givin' up, givin' up, givin' up my choice 
If I'm wrong, then I'll pay for it 
If I'm right, yeah 
Your gonna deal with it 
Cause I tried, yeah I tried for it 
I'll try, I'll try, even die for it 
No I...
Don't want to hear what love can do 
No I... 
I can't tell ya what's right for you 
Oh i...I...I... 
Tell you what love can do 
No I...I...I... 
Can't say but your time is through 
I've seen the damage done 
Oh Lord, I've heard the shotgun 
I fought the setting sun 
On my kingdom come 
Ohhh...
Don't tell me what love can do 
Hey, hey, hey 
Don't tell me what love can do 
Hey, hey, hey
