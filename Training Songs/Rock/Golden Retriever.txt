Hey said the devil 
When I met her at the roundabout 
She's got powers 
Magnetic devours you of everything you've got 

She's a golden retriever 
Retrieves your oldest coin 
Leads you blindly down every dark alley 
Then she'll bleed you dry 

Stop! Said the puppy 
When I met him at the zebra cross 
She said "You need protection 
From every direction 
But she'll get you anyhow" 

She's a golden retriever 
Retrieves your oldest coin 
Leads you blindly down every dark alley 
Then she'll bleed you dry 

She's a golden retriever 
She's a golden retriever 
Golden retriever 
Golden retriever 
Golden retriever 
Golden retriever 

Golden retriever 
Golden retriever 
Golden retriever 
Golden retriever
