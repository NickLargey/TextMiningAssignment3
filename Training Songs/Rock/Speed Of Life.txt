Like ghosts on open windows,
The curtains rise and fall.
The past is a foreign country
At the dark end of the hall,
And the morning is an offering
To the shelter of the day.
But the violent come, and they bury it away.
Time goes by at the speed of life,
Slower than a slow dance on a hot summer night.
Faster than the skin breaks on the edge of a knife,
And we just go on at the speed of life.
Like questions begging answers,
The stars appear at night.
What's it mean to love somebody?
What's it mean to be alive?
I heard a little girl laughing
At her first sight of snow;
Saw an old man dying
In a room he didn't know.
While the world turns through the ages,
It's a most peculiar ride.
Holding on to one another,
Moving at the speed of life.
We just go on at the speed of life.
A family on the midway, in the carnival lights,
Moving in a circle through the sounds and the sights,
And it all goes by at the speed of life.

Time goes by at the speed of life,
Slower than a slow dance on a hot summer night.
Faster than the skin breaks, baby,
On the edge of a knife,
And we just go on, and on, at the speed of life.
Moving at the speed of life.
Speed of life.
On and on, and on, and on.
On and on, and on, and on.
