Driving me insane

All the people going nowhere
Going nowhere slow
All the people going nowhere
Going nowhere slow

Saw the apocalypse licking its lips
Sat in a van on the M 25
You could just sit and stare, it was going nowhere
Chances are it will never arrive

In my car, well, I don't go far
And it's driving me insane

All the people going nowhere
Going nowhere slow
All the people going nowhere
Going nowhere slow

Went to the park and ride but the city had parked then died
There's nothing left there anyway
Back to the motorway, fell asleep like yesterday
Maybe I dreamed it, I couldn't say

In my car, well, I don't go far
And it's driving me insane

Saw the apocalypse swinging its hips

All the people going nowhere
Going nowhere slow
All the people going nowhere
Going nowhere slow

All the people going nowhere
Going nowhere slow
