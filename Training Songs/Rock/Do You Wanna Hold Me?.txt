Children, I wanna warn ya, 'cos I've been to California
Where Mickey Mouse is such a demon, where Mickey Mouse is as big as a house
Life is wasted on illusions, Tom and Jerry's my solution
Evil gangs will cut the demons, but I belong some real boy, look around

And I cry all night, do you wanna hold me, hold me tight
Do you wanna hold me, oh yeah, do you wanna hold me, hold me there

Children, you got to hand me, you just got to understand me
Love and death ain't no physical thing
'Cos making next ain't no one of 'em

And I cry all night, do you wanna hold me, hold me tight
Do you wanna hold me, oh yeah, do you wanna hold me, hold me there

Do you wanna
And I cry all night, do you wanna hold me, hold me tight
Do you wanna hold me, oh yeah, do you wanna hold me, hold me there

And I cry all night, there ain't no more confusion in the night
There's someone there to tell me what is right

Do you wanna hold me, hold me tight
And I cry all night, there's only one solution to this life
There's someone there to tell me what it's like
Do you wanna hold me, oh yeah, do you wanna hold me, oh yeah
Do you wanna hold me, hold me there

Do you wanna hold me, oh yeah

Do you wanna hold me, oh yeah

Do you wanna hold me, oh yeah
