I'm just a straight in a gay, gay, gay world
I'm carryin' the banner tryin' to keep the flag unfurled
Well I'm just a straight in a gay, gay, gay place
I might look a little odd but I'm part of the human race

Well I'm just a straight in a gay, gay, gay world
Might look a little butch but my hair is naturally curled
Don't wear no floral shirts or white, buckled shoes
No blow jobs or blow waves, I do just what I choose

And if I'm forty-seven and I've never been married
That's just a load that's gotta be carried
Even if I had my eyebrows plucked
That don't mean I'm hangin' round just to get
Just 'cos he's happy don't mean that he's gay
All his friends seem to take him quite the wrong way
There ain't many of us still left alive
All my friends have gone over to the other side

I'm just a straight in a gay, gay, gay world
I'm carryin' the banner tryin' to keep the flag unfurled
Well I'm just a straight in a gay, gay, gay time
And a straight in a gay world is getting hard to find
