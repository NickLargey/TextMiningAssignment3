So he's learned to hold his cigarette and his drink in one hand
But he wonders if he's getting old
Everyone comes off so silly
But he doesn't forget the moon outside
And the stars up above
Met a girl from Poland
She say Breznev
Met a boy from Santo Domingo
He say cocaine
Met a girl from Poland
She say Breznev
Met a boy from Santo Domingo
He say cocaine
And the boy keeps on dancing
Girls come
And this boy keeps on dancing
Girls come
And the music goes from bad to worse
Dancing
Everybody's dancing
Dancing
Dancing
