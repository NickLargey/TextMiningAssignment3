Well, out of love
Times we're now
Well, out of love
Times we're now
I love the way my woman screams and shouts
I'm a rocker when I wake up
I'm a rocker when I'm sleeping
It's my life now I'm a rocker
When she's dancing
Looks so fine
When she's dancing
She looks so fine
I love it when she rubs it close to mine
I'm a rocker when I wake up
I'm a rocker when I sleep
It's my life now I'm a rocker
Well outta sight
Outta mind
Outta sight
Outta mind
I love it when she rubs it close to mine
I'm a rocker when I wake up
I'm a rocker when I sleep
It's my life now I'm a rocker
Yeah give me a standing audition
