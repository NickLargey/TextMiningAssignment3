I make mistakes you shit-face
And I'm no good, no good (x4)

Things ain't your way that's right I'm glad
Everything makes you mnad
I'm a fucked up loser and that makes you sad
An anti-product of the lower class
I see though it, I see though you
Ha he choo f*ck you

(chorus)

I'm a no good you're a no good
I'm a no good
