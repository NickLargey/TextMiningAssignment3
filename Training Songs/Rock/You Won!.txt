Someone may want to get a hold on you
You're baning your head against the wall again
He's always one step ahead
Who knows what he's planning next

DO DO!
WAH!
OH!

if you only could get away
Somehow someway
Is there anywhere you could hide?
You've been looked after all your life

DO DO!
WAH!
OH!

I'm in the position where I've got
To put myself in
In the place of a crazy brain
If you're cunning I'm insane

SMASH ME!
SMASH IT!
YOU WON!
YOU WON
