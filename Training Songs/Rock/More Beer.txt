More beer, more beer
All I want is more beer
More beer, more beer
All I want is more beer, more beer

When I get home from work and I'm dyin' of thirst
All I want is more beer
I run into the kitchen and I tear off my shirt
All I want is more beer
Open up a six pack I'll be downin' it first
All I want is more beer
I can open up and finish faster than you
All I want is more beer
Gonna kill a case or maybe two
All I want is more beer
If there was no more beer then what would we do
All I want is more beer

More beer
More beer, more beer
All I want is more beer
More beer, more beer
All I want is more beer, more beer

All I want is more beer
All I want is more beer
All I want is more beer

All I want is more beer
All I want is more beer
All I want is more beer

And when I wake up in the morning
My mouth's all parched and dry, parched and dry
And I crawl to the refrigerator
And I peek inside
And I feel like somebody drove nails
Into my head and eyes
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
I hope there's one more beer

More beer, more beer
More beer, more beer
More beer, more beer
More beer, more beer
More beer, more beer
More beer, more beer
More beer, more beer
