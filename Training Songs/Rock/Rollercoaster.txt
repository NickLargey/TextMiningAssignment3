Think I should call a doctor
To cure this vertigo
My brain keeps turning over
Like something you know

The ups and downs
The screams as I spin to the ground

[Chorus]
Maybe you might be my roller coaster
Maybe I''ll ride for a while
Maybe it's time my turn's almost over
It's way too high, but hey, I'll try

Been thinking about the landing
Been thinking way too much
Feels lucky I''m still standing here
But I've run out of luck

Whisper goodbye
As I'm holding on for my life

[Chorus]
