Sally's in love 
With her automobile 
Says she feels so sexy 
From behind the wheel 
She got dual carburetors 
Ported and relieved 
She pull the soft top down 
She makes the devil believe 
Packs a four-twenty seven 
Down on 101 
Crack a buck ten-eleven 
On the radar gun 
She roll it over to the shoulder 
Moving past her man 
Swing it back to the fast lane 
Singing catch me if you can 
She got five speed, four elevens 
Ten thirteen in a quarter mile 
Trick gas, full blown nitrous 
Speed queen with a smile 
Ride, ride, ride 
Let Sally ride 
Drive, drive, drive 
Let Sally drive 
Ride, ride, ride 
Let Sally ride 
Drive, drive, drive 
Let Sally drive 
Drive, drive, drive 
Got long tall Sally 
Blastin' on the box 
Just like Mustang Sally 
Kicked up a notch 
Puts the pedal to the metal 
Tacking seven grand 
Smoking fifty yards of rubber 
In the rear view mirror 
Singing catch me if you can
