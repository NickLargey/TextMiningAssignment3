I was feelin' like a prisoner inside myself I saw you 
Lookin' like you might be 
In a mood to try anything that was new 
Don't be starved for the love and laughter 
Break through total stranger 
You only get one life 

This night could be like no other night 
You and me 
Find the fire in our hearts 
And dance in the light 
Yeah 
We'll take our chances 
How can we lose 
We're making our own rules 
This night can be like no other night 

There's a child I can see in the back of your eyes 
Dying to be set free 
Let the hunger inside you bring it alive 
Baby 
This night won't last forever 
Break loose 
Girl remember, you only get one life 

This night can be like no other night
You and me 
Find the fire in our hearts 
And dance in the light 
Yeah 
We'll take our chances 
How can we lose, 
We're making our own rules 
This night will be like no other night 

Yeah yeah 
Time you don't use 
You lose it 
You grab every moment you can, before it's gone 
When you can feel, you really 
Know that you're alive 
Show that you're alive 
For one night and 

This night can be like no other night
You and me 
Finding the fire in our hearts 
And dance in the light 
Oh yeah 
We'll take our chances 
How can we lose, 
We're making our own rules 
This night will be like, be like no other night
