I don't want to run I don't want to stay
'Cause everything that's near and dear is old and in the way
Emergency has gone, apathy rolling on
Time to take a stand 
Redneck wonderland

Got you in my sights, spotlit by the fence
If it's love you're faking it's just common sense
Brick and tile for miles, rolling in the aisles
Rifle in my hand 
Redneck wonderland

Well the streets are clean, nothing gets away
I can see the beauty treatment draining from your face
It is vision free, it's poor bugger me
Something less than grand 
Redneck wonderland
