We live out here in the desert
Where time stands still
In the face of our foolish pride
We trade our love for ambition
And tell each other
We'll get it all back in time

But time moves on like a river
Soon leaves us all behind
Like a summer rain
It all gets washed away

Round and round and round we go
Where it stops don't no one know
Find a love you better let them know
Before you both get washed away

I watch the wind blow out there
Maybe hear some distant laughter
Look outside the hotel window
When my soul wanders off babe
This is the town I met you in
And I won't soon forget that
Your proud beauty lingers on
Until the storm has lifted

Go find your fortune fast
It's cold outside but you'll make it
Don't trade your love for ambition
You'll get washed away

Round and round and round we go
Where it stops don't no one know
Find a love you better let them know
You'll both get washed away
 
Round and round and round we go
Where it stops don't no one know
Find a love you better hold on fast
You'll both get washed away

An old clich√©
That you used to tell me
Some things might change
All things won't last

Do the best you can
It'll all work out
At the end of the storm
Live to love another day

Round and round and round we go
Where it stops don't no one know
Find a love you better hold on fast
You'll both get washed away

Round and round and round we go
Where it stops don't no one know
Find a love you better hold on fast
You'll both get washed away

The time we spend
As we pass this way
We might not ever be here again
Hold on tight to what you find
Then we're gone tomorrow
