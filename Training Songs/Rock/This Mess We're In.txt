Can you hear them?
The helicopters
I'm in New York
No need for words now
We sit in silence

You look me
In the eye directly
You met me
I think it's Wednesday
The evening

The mess we're in
And ohh (the city sunset over me)
Ohh (the city sunset over me)

Night and day
I dream of
Making love
To you now baby
Love making on screen

Impossible dream
And I have seen
The sunrise over the river
The freeway
Reminding of

This mess we're in
And ohh (the city sunset over me)
Ohh (the city sunset over me)

And ohh (the city sunset over me)
Ohh (the city sunset over me)

What were you wanting? (What was that you wanted?)
I just wanna say (I just wanna say)
(Don't ever change) Don't ever change now baby
(And thank you) And thank you
(I don't think we will meet again) I don't think we will meet again

(And you must leave now) And you must leave now (Before the sun rises over the skyscrapers)
Before the sun rise (And the city landscape comes into view) 
Over the skyscrapers (Sweat on my skin, oh)
The city 

This mess we're in
And ohh (the city sunset over me)
Ohh (the city sunset over me)
Ohh (the city sunset over me)
Ohh (the city sunset over me)
