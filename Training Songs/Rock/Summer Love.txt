Summer love is like no other love
Oooh yeah-eah-eah
Summer love is like no other love
You know what I mean
Summer love is like no other lo-ove

Cloudy skys are blown by with a breeze
And when that su-un shi-ines
Life comes easy
Bye bye troubles goodby-ye
I'm walkin' with my head in the sky-why-why
See birds sailing in and out of blue
Oh when that su-un shines
I'll be there with you-ou
When you bring your lovin' to me-ee
Let your love come easy and free-ee
Yeah, Listen

Summer love is like no other love
Oooh yeah-yeah
Summer love is like no other love
Summer love is like no other lo-ove
Oo-ooh

Everybody talk about the summertime blues
Just take it easy and let it cruise
The sun is up and the day is fine
I feel so good in the summer ti-i-ime

When you bring your lovin' to me-ee
Let your love come easy and free-ee, Yeah
You know what I mea-ea-ean

Summer love is like no other love
Summer love is like no other love
Summer love is like no other love
Summer love is like no other love
Summer love is like no other love
