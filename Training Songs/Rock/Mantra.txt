A thousand dreams within 
Within me sofetly burn
They burn the savage soul
Tat twisted what it learned
I feel this life slipping by
I can fell this life slipping by

Desire is a state
A state of ill repair
It's ill prepared to cope
It's ill prepared to care
I feel this life slipping by
I can fell this life slipping by

Time and time life's left me only
Feeling sick and feeling scared 
Now my love is strong
My love is strong 
I'll go on and on and on and on and on

Mercy is the cry of the soul that stirred

Beneath the creeping vine
A flower trys to change its tries to satisfy
It's thrist without the rains
I fell this change coming on
I can feel this change coming on

Time and time life's left me only
Feeling sick and feeling scared 
Now love is strong my love is strong
I'll go on and on and on and on and on

Ercy is the cry of the soul that stirred
Mercy is the cry and it's never heard

Love is all we have
Love is all we need
