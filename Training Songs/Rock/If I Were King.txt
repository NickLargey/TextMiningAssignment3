I have so much more to say, my brother.
Can you hear me?

A fool is left to live as the brave ones fall.
I swear if I were able,
I would have done the same for you.
But now you're gone and I wish I were too.

I spend all my time asking questions,
How can I pay you back when
The price you paid was so high, my friends.
If I were King of all I imagine,
I would trade all I am
To have you by my side.

If I were King.
I have too much time today, my brother.
Can you hear me?

I know where I am, but I still feel lost.
Please know that I am grateful
For the years you gave to me.
Everything's changed, but nothing changes
For you.

I won't waste my life asking questions.
I've seen the horror of war and
There's so much more for a man who's been
Where I've been.

If I were King of all I imagine,
I would trade what I have
To have you back at my side.
If I were King of all I imagine,
We would both be back home
Living the rest of our lives.
If I were King.
