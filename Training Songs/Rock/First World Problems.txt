Where is this American dream?
I see American greed
'Cause no one's happy in their first world problems
Money in the bank (hey)
Silver in your plate (hey)
You're getting dizzy 'cause nobody's gonna solve 'em

Don't waste your breathe around me
'Round me
Spin until the needle skips a beat
Don't waste your breathe around me
'Round me
'Cause I don't care about your first world problems
First world problems

I’m the American dream 
I spent a month on the streets 
so I don’t care about your first world problems
Nothing in the bank (hey)
Never got a break (hey)
Go f*ck yourself if you’re mad
I think you’re all just a fad

Don't waste your breathe around me
'Round me
'Cause spinning to the beat of skips in here
Don't waste your breathe around me
'Round me
Don't waste your breathe around me

Don't waste your breathe around me
'Round me
'Cause spinning to the beat of skips in here
Don't waste your breathe around me
'Round me
Don't waste your breathe around me

Don't waste your breathe around me
'Round me
Spin until the needle skips a beat
Don't waste your breathe around
Don't waste your breathe around
'Cause I don't care about your first world problems
First world problems
