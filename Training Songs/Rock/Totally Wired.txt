I'm Totally Wired. Totally Wired. I'm Totally Wired. Totally
Wired.
Can't you see? A butterfly stomach round ground. I drank
A jar of coffee, and I took some of these.
And I'm Totally Wired. Totally Wired. I'm Totally Wired. Totally
Wired.
Life leaves you surprised.
Slaps you in the eyes.
If I were a communist, a rich man would bale me.
The opposite applies.
The morning light.
Another fresh fight.
Another row, right, right, right, right.
And I'm Totally Wired. JJJust Totally Wired. I'm
Totally Biased. Totally Wired.
You don't have to be weird to be wired.
You don't have to be an American brand.
You don't have to be strange to be strangled.
You don't have to be weird to be wrangled.
But I'm Totally Wired. Totally Wired. JJJust Totally
Wired. I'm Totally Wired.
My Heart and I agree. My Heart and I agree.
I'm Irate, Peeved, Irate, Peeved,
Irate, Bad State. Bad State.
'cause I'm Totally Wired. Totally Wired. JJJust Totally
Wired. Totally Wired. And I'm always worried. And I'm always
Worried. And I'm always worried. And I'm always worried.
