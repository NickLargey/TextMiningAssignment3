Look around  could it bring somebody down
If I never made a sound again?
In your eyes you've already spread my thighs
And you're rocking to the next big thing
Kissing the bride 45 minutes a side
This was my dream played out rocking routine
Who sucked out the feeling?

Where'd you go now that everybody knows
And we did a couple shows out there?
Look at me  I can write a melody
But I can't expect a soul to care
Kissing the bride, 45 minutes a side
This was my dream, played out rocking routine

Who sucked out the feeling?

Kissing the bride, 45 minutes a side
Who sucked out the feeling?
