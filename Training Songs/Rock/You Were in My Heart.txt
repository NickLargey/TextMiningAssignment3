It's over now, that's plain to see
But so hard to understand
Why you were looking for a love
When it was right there, right there in your hand

You were in my heart, when you walked out my door
I gave you my love baby, you wanted something more
And now it's cold and lonely down in paradise
But don't look back no, no more, I'm as cold as ice

And the rumors that came back to me
Were so easily denied
But tell me what made you my enemy
When I was right there, right there by your side

You were in my heart, when you walked out my door
I gave you my love baby, you wanted something more
And now the rain is falling on your paradise
But don't look back no, no more, I'm as cold as ice

To your heart I was the one that held the key
I guess your one big promise never let you free
But that's all over now, it's really over now

You were in my heart, when you walked out my door
I gave you mu love baby, I'll never know what for
And now the rain is falling on your paradise
But don't look back no, no more, I'm as cold as ice
