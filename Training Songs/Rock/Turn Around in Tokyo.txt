Leavin' on the runway
To another world
Still stranded somewhere
In between the earth and sky
It's 3 AM
I'm in Japan
You're still on my mind
Your long-distance love is coming through alright 
And I'm not lonely
Lost in the Orient
I'm dreamin' of
Turn around in Tokyo
Gotta send it back to you
Turn around in Tokyo 
Well I feel like a stranger 
In a modern land
Outside the sky light stands like a Buddha shrine
And on the east horizon there's complete design
It's the quiet hours of darkness before the light 
The words don't come easy
Lost in the Orient
I miss you
Turn around in Tokyo
Gotta make it back to you
Turn around in Tokyo
I'm comin' home now 
And I'm not lonely
Lost in the Orient
I'm dreamin'
Turn around in Tokyo
Gotta make it back to you
Turn around in Tokyo
I'm comin' home 
Oh oh
I'm all turned around yeah
I'm all turned around
I'm all turned around yeah
I'm all turned around
Turn around in Tokyo
I said turn around in Tokyo
Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo
Oh baby
I'm all turned around
Gotta make it back to you
I miss ya girl
Miss ya girl
