I've got the sweetest little angel
And I love the way that she spread her wings
I've got the most adorable sweet little angel
And I love the way that she spread up her wings
When she put her arms around me
I get joy, I get joy, I get joy and everything
Listen to this will ya

I asked my baby for a nickel
And you know what, she gave me a twenty dollar bill, that ain't all
Now listen to this, I asked my baby, my baby
My own sweet baby for a nickel
And she gave me a twenty dollar bill

That's what makes me think
I've got such a sweet little angel
And if she should be sad to leave me
I would break down and cry

If my baby should leave
I think I would lose my poor old horrible mind
If my baby should leave
I do believe I would lose my mind

Because you know what
I've got this sweetest little angel
And I love the way and I love every way
That she spread her wings
