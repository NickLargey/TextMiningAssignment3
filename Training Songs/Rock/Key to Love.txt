I never realized that you were in pain.
I want to help you honey, let me see you again.

[Chorus:]
Hurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough.
Life is so bad, baby, when I find the key to love.

Put a smile on your face and dry away your tears.
Life is bound to get better as you live your years.

[Chorus]

Somewhere in this world, the one you waited for
Come along and find you, turn the key in your door.

Hurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough.
Life is so bad, baby, when you find the key to love.
