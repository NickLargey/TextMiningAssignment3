Weather man on the radio
Threatens rain, maybe snow
he don't know, I need blue skies
I've got to go

I'm not a cowboy
I've never been shot
I'm not a convict
I've never been caught

[Chorus]
Tell my sister
To tell my mother
I'm coming home
Home, alone

Sunday morning 
I boarded a plane
Leaving London, England
In the rain

[Chorus]

Someday I'll be back again
To that green and pleasant land
Between the Channel and the sea
Across the ocean, that's where I want to be

But until then, tie me to the ground
I've got to let these weary bones rest
From runnin' around

[Chorus]
