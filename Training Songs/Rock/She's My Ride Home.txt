We talked
Together sharpening a knife
Like killing partners for a life
Hey we can hide the bodies on the ride home

Now here we are
We're licking skin to wipe us clean
Strike a match, pour gasoline
Ditch the scene and watch this city burn
Asleep, my life will be a pillow steering wheel turn

I'll be reaching for the stars with you (honey)
Who cares if no one else believes?
Yeah, so i, set fire to everyone around
But I told you, I told you, we'd do it

So ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha 
Yeah we walk

We drive
To leave the past and clear the mind
To watch the sunset set its time
I swear you'll find
I'm your ride home

Now close your eyes
It's getting dark and the highway's clear
No sign of life from front to rear
Is it just you my dear
On the ride home?
We're going home

I'll be reaching for the stars with you (honey)
Who cares if no one else believes?
Yeah, so I, set fire to everyone around
But I told you, I told you, we'd do it

So ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha 
Yeah we walk

We talked
Together sharpening a knife
Like killing partners for a life
Hey we can hide the bodies on the ride home
'Cause we're going home

I'll be reaching for the stars with you (honey)
Who cares if no one else believes?
Yeah, so I, set fire to everyone around
But I told you, I told you, we'd do it

So ha ha ha ha (we walk)
Ha ha ha 
Oh yeah we walk
We walk
Yeah we walk
Yeah we walk
