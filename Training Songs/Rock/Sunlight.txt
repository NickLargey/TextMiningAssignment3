Today we don´t know
Who we are
Ashamed, hiding behind the scars
Too many times
We let the things we feel
Get in the way of letting us
Heal the wounds
That open in the dark
Did you ever feel
Sunlight on your face?
Did you ever taste clouds?
Did you ever touch space?
Did you ever feel
Sunlight on your face?
Did you ever truly live?

So walk, in time
To life´s refrain
Relax, don´t do it
To yourself again
Decaying yourself with
All the love you won´t give
Killing yourself about the way
You don´t live now
´Cause you´re not
Gonna live forever

Did you ever feel
Sunlight on your face?
Did you ever taste clouds?
Did you ever touch space?
Did you ever feel
Sunlight on your face?
Did you ever truly live?

Did you ever feel
Sunlight on your face?
Did you ever breathe hope?
Did you ever
Dance with grace?
Did you ever feel
Sunlight on your face?
Did you ever truly live?
