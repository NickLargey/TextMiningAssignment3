Cold Chicago nights
Chains on tires
You're diggin' out snow
That wind, it just ain't right
I made up my mind
I'm headin' home

Well babe, can't you give it time?
I'll keep you warm at night
This town is all I know
And I could see you in my life
Stay inside (I can't go outside)
Just please don't go (so I gotta go)

'Cause baby, your Winter is nothing but prison
It drives me away
And maybe, come Summer, then we'll be together
Our time will come again
'Til then I'll see you in the Spring
Ah, so don't throw it all away
Throw it all away

The end of Spring and June arrives
Won't you take a flight?
Come down to San Antone
That heat, feels like I'm on fire
No, it just ain't right
It makes me sweat at night
I'd rather be alone
(It's just not right, it's just not right to be so alone)

'Cause baby, your Summer is nothing but prison
It drives me away
And maybe, come Winter, we can't be together
But love will come again
'Til then I'll see you in the Spring
Ah, so don't throw it all away
Throw it all away

You know I live just to see your eyes
I'll meet you half way
I'll meet you half way by the runaway sign
(Makes me fall when for me you'll find a way, 
I'll find you baby)

'Cause baby, your Winter is nothing but prison
It drives me away
And maybe, come Summer, we can't be together
Our time will come again
When I'll see you in the Spring
Ah, so don't throw it all away

Ah, don't throw it away
Ah, so don't throw it all away, throw it all away
