I don't want to hear about your miserable day
If I gave you the chance you'd talk me life away
You tell me that you love me and that's not a sin
But fifty times a day is kinda wearin' me thin
I know you like to talk just to hear your own voice
Is there a point you're trying to make or just a little noise
Chorus:
All ya do is nag, nag, nag, nag
Can't you stop your bitchin', are you always such a drag
G-g-gimme' no lip, ya gotta shut-up baby
G-g-gimme' no lip, ya gotta shut-up baby
Your jaws always jabber, you're a pain in the neck
Even driving in your car you're gonna have a wreck
Talk about the things I don't understand
You hold the world's record, biggest mouth in the land
Once I had a dream you couldn't utter a peep
But then you woke me up, 'cause you were talkin' in your sleep
Chorus
Baby why ya talk so much, ya drivin' me crazy
Baby why ya talk so much, ya drivin' me nuts
Baby why ya talk so much, ya drivin' me crazy
Baby why ya talk so much, ya drivin' me nuts
Chorus
G-g-gimme' no lip,gimme' no lip
G-g-gimme' no lip,gimme' no ,gimme' no lip
Chiney mo,Chiney mo
Chiney mo,Chiney mo
