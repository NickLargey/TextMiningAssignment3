Gettin' lucky is the name of the game
What you call it, it all means the same
Put on your good looks and your dancing shoes
Go downtown and try to shake those blues
But you know, another night
Another number, gettin' lucky

Tryin' the hot spots with the bright funky lights
Look for the love and stay out of the fights
Talk to the people but you know that it's true
Even if they like you, the joke's on you
'Cause you know, another night
Another number, gettin' lucky

Livin' in a dreamy world that's full of tinsel and glitter
When the morning comes, why are you always so bitter
You know what you're gonna find and you know I'm right
You'll come home with a number from another night (aah ooh)

When the morning comes, why are you always so bitter
You know what you're gonna find and you know I'm right
You'll come home with a number from another night (aah ooh yeah)

Givin' it up, would be the easy way out
Only thing you'll do is sit and pout
You've got to fight it, hold your head up high
Even if it never works, you know you try

But you know, another night
Another number, gettin' lucky
But you know, another night
Another number, gettin' lucky

Are you a winner
Oh Lord, I'm a winner

Ooh gettin' lucky yeah
