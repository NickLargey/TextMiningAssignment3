The night is new 
The faces are friendly 
So have a few 
And let me play 
Some new songs, some blue songs 
The mood is always right 
Every night at the Paradise Cafe 

The world outside 
May make its own madness 
But here we hide 
The world away 
No headlines, no deadlines 
We'll make them disappear 
While you're here at the Paradise Cafe

The room is kinda smokey 
The phone ain't workin' 
The same old broken keys don't play 
But no one seems to mind it 
'cause someone's buyin' 
And we'll all get through one more day 

Just me and you Around the piano 
Not much to do But dream away 
So stay on I'll play on 
I'm all yours for a song 
All night long at the Paradise Cafe 

Forget the one who loved you 
Then lied and left you 
Forget the love you almost had 
But if you must remember 
The way it left you 
We'll make it feel good to feel bad 

Just me and you around the piano
