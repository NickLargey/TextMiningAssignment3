Can you surry
Can you picnic?
Can you surry
Can you picnic?
Surry down
To a stoned soul picnic
There'll be lots of time and wine
Red yellow honey
Sassafras and moonshine
Stoned soul

Surry down
To a stoned soul picnic
Surry down
To a stoned soul picnic
Rain and sun come in akin
And from the sky comes the Lord and the lightnin'
And from the sky comes the Lord and the lightnin'
Stoned soul

Surry surry surry surry
There'll be trains of blossoms
There'll be trains of music
There'll be trains of trust
Trains of golden dust
Come along and surry on
Sweet trains of thought,
Surry on down
Can you surry?

Surry down
To a stoned soul picnic
Surry down
To a stoned soul picnic
There'll be lots of time and wine
Red yellow honey
Sassafras and moonshine
Red yellow honey
Sassafras and moonshine
Stoned soul
Surry surry surry surry
