Please understand
This isn't just goodbye
This is I can't stand you
This is where the road crashed into the ocean,
It rises all around me and now we're barely breathing
A thousand faces we'll choose to ignore

Curse my enemies forever
Let's slit our wrists and burn down something beautiful
This desperation leaves me overjoyed
With fading lights that lead us past the lives that we destroy

I listen to you cry
A cry for less attention
But both my hands are tied
And I'm pushed into the deep end

I listen to you talk
But talk is cheap
And my mouth is filled with blood
From trying not to speak

So search for an excuse
And someone to believe you
In foreign dressing rooms
I'm empty with the need to

Curse my enemies forever
Let's slit our wrists and burn down something beautiful
This desperation leaves me overjoyed
With fading lights that lead us past the lives that we destroy
Please understand

I lay rotting where I fall. I'm dead from bad intentions
Suffocated and enbalmed, and now all our dreams are chased in
You swore you wouldn't lose, then lost your brain
You make a sound that feels like pain

So please understand
This isn't just goodbye
This is I can't stand you
