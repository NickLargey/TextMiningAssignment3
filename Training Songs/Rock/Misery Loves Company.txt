Well I've just left my home friends where I couldn't sleep
For missin' a man that I couldn't keep
She just walked out and left me for somebody else
Now her memory keeps haunting me but I'm by myself

So break out the bottle bring on the crowd
Tell funny stories turn the jukebox up loud
Come on sit at my table where the drinks're on me
Yes gather round me cause misery loves company

This is not the first time I lost everything
To a false hearted woman with a false hearted dream
But this is the first time I've suffered myself
Help me get over this love
I'll handle the next love all by myself

So break out the bottle
Yes gather round me
Cause misery loves company
