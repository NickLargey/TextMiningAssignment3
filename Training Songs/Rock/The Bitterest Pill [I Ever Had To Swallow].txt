In your white lace and your wedding bells
You look the picture of contented new wealth
But from the onlooking fool who believed your lies
I wish this grave would open up and swallow me alive
For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-colored, mocking shadows, yeah

When the wheel of fortune broke, you fell to me
Out of grey skies to change my misery
The vacant spot, your beating heart took its place
Now I watch smoke leave my lips and fill an empty room

For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-colored, mocking shadows

The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more hate
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more hate

Now autumn's breeze blows summer's leaves through my life
Twisted and broken-down, no days with sunlight
The dying spark, you left your mark on me
The promise of your kiss, but with someone else

For the bitterest pill is mine to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-colored, mocking shadows
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore ill
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more hate
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more hate
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more hate
