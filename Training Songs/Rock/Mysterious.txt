GIRL WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND,
YOU GOT SOMETHING THAT'S AILING YOU
I'M DYING FOR YOUR EVERY TOUCH
YOUR FANTASY, IF YOU WANT ME TO BE, 

CHORUS

CAN'T LET YOU, CAN'T LET YOU GO
IT'S SO MYSTERIOUS
SO LET ME KNOW, CAUSE I GOTTA KNOW
THIS TIME IT'S SERIOUS
ALL THE YEARS GONE BY
SEEMS I'VE BEEN WALKING ALONE
BUT NOW WITH YOU BY MY SIDE, 
I'LL CLAIM YOUR LOVE, SHOW YOU WHAT I'M MADE OF

CHORUS: 

CAN'T LET YOU, CAN'T LET YOU GO
IT'S SO MYSTERIOUS
SO LET ME KNOW, CAUSE I GOTTA KNOW
THIS TIME IT'S SERIOUS
ALL THE YEARS GONE BY
SEEMS I'VE BEEN WALKING ALONE
BUT NOW WITH YOU BY MY SIDE, 
I'LL CLAIM YOUR LOVE, SHOW YOU WHAT I'M MADE OF

FILL MY MIND WITH THINGS TO SAY, YES YOU DO
I NEED YOUR LOVE INSIDE OF ME, INSIDE OF ME

SOLO

SO WHERE DO I DRAW THE LINE, 
TELL ME WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO
CAUSE I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG
IF YOU FEEL THE SAME, FOREVER KEEP THE FLAME
CHORUS
