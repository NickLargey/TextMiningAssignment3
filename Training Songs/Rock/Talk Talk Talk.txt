A healthy argument to start the day, 
what better way
Would you, the fan of life 
remove to tears?
Lend me your ears 
But you spend all your time
Waiting in static shopping lines
And all your troubles and debates
Are solved in glossy magazines 

Too much small talk leads to a small mind
So tell me what your views are
And I will tell you mine 

Well how's the weather 
(plain and boring)
It's back to work on 
(Monday morning)
Oh let it go
Tell me things I'd like to know
Frighten me, enlighten me, oh no 

Opinion can be void if not 
presented from both sides
So speak your mind my dear, 
your loves and fears
And nothing in between 

Initiate, debate about
The way you hate the things I say
Rather than to spend another minute
Killing time 

Too much small talk leads to a small mind
So tell me all your secrets
I'll never tell you mine 

Well how's the weather 
(plain and boring)
It's back to work on 
(Monday morning)
Oh let it go
Tell me things I'd like to know
Frighten me, enlighten me, oh no
