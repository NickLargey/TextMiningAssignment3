We got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We been talkin' Jackson
Ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson
I'm gonna mess around
I'm goin' to Jackson
Lookout Jackson town

Well go on down to Jackson
Go ahead and wreck your health
Go play your hand you big talkin' man
Make a big fool of yourself
Yeah yeah go to Jackson
Go comb that hair
I'm gonna snowball Jackson
Go ahead and see if I care

When I get into that city
People gonna stoop and bow
All them young men gonna make me
Teach them what they don't know how
I'm goin' to Jackson
You turn a loose of my coat
Cause I'm goin' to Jackson
Goodbye that's all she wrote

We'll I've had you in Jackson
And I'll be dancin' on a pony keg
They'll lead you around that town
Like a scolded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs
Yeah yeah go to Jackson
You big talkin' man
And I'll be waiting there in Jackson
Behind my gay ban plan

We got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We been talkin' Jackson
Ever since the fire went out
Goin' to Jackson
And that's a natural fact
We're goin' to Jackson
Ain't never comin' back
Ain't never comin' back
Ain't never comin' back
Ain't never comin' back
