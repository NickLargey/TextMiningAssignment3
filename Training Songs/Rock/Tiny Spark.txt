I've always been this way
Never known any other way to feel
Got the right of way
And all of the others must yield
But I'm naked
And I'm in school
And I can't make it
To the door
Try to understand
That an oyster can only make a pearl
From a grain of sand
But from what I don't know comes a girl
And I'm trying
Not to laugh
Feels like I'm dying
When we break apart
And you take back your heart
And it aches in the dark
But it makes a tiny spark
I've always been this way
Never known any other way to feel
Got the right of way
And all of the others must yield
But I'm naked
And I'm in school
And I can't make it
To the door 
We were lying in the grass 
I was trying oh not to laugh 
I was drowning in the past
