It was a day we both remember
And again I am all the way alone
And I know that these things are never changing
But maybe I'm not so good...
'cause I have to know if I'm right or wrong now
Take my troubles and wash'em down the drain if you can...say
The things are only messed up
But again we are all the way alone
'cause I have to know if I'm right or wrong now
Take my troubles and wash'em down the drain if you can...
Take my hands 'cause I don't know if I am dead
And the love affair was my mistake please come again
All I know is that I messed up
But again I was up in heaven 2
Don't you know that I took those things to love you and just maybe 'cause they're so good
'cause I have to know if I'm right or wrong now
Take my troubles and wash'em down the drain if you can...
Take my hands 'cause I don't know if I am dead
And the love affair was my mistake please come again
Take my hands 'cause I don't know if I am dead
And the love affair was my mistake please come again
