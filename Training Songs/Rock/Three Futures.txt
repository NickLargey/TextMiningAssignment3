I got hard in your car
In the parking lot of the Masonic lodge

We lined the Hudson with our tangents
You trusted me to love your parents
Sunk into my tunnel vision
Sunk into my tunnel vision

I hope that's what you'll remember
Not how I left but how I entered
Who didn't know I saw three futures
One alone and one with you
And one with the love I knew I'd choose

You got me loaded on bergamot perfume
Downstairs in the TV room
You, you laid the plans and I was quiet

My eyes are trinity divided
My eyes are trinity divided

I hope what you will remember
Is not how I left but how I entered
And not the hope that I abused
If remembering's something you do

You didn't know I saw three futures
You didn't know I saw three futures

One alone and one with you
And one with the love I knew I'd choose
