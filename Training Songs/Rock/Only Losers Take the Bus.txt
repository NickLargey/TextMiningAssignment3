I'm not stupid -- I'm a man
I'm not stupid
I'm born again in hail and flames (goldrush almighty)
Go tell it loud to all my slaves (goldrush almighty)
You scum don't have the fear of god
All that's left is the iron rod (goldrush almighty)
Let's go down, kiss the plough
Public system burn down
And let memory fade
Nothing is wrong!
Only losers take the bus
Only losers take the bus
Churchill was a shopping bag (goldrush almighty)
Can you draw the Chinese flag? (goldrush almighty)
It's, uh, three blue lines and six dalias
Paris is in India (goldrush almighty)
Let's go down, o my friends
All alone we descend
Plastic food, tv
Take your eyes off of me!
Only losers take the bus
Only losers take the bus
I hate misunderstandings
Hey, get these dead bodies off my racetrack!
And we cry out with joy
As we drive through the rain
And our enemies claw
From every god damned side!
Only losers take the bus....
Only losers, only losers, only losers take the bus
I'm no loser, I'm a letch!
Protect me! protect me!
I'm not one of them....
