On parole since the age of eighteen
Made his mark on society
Found him in the wrong territory
He was left for dead

Used to be such a precious young thing
But got caught up in some mixed up things
Took a bullet to the head
Now he's left for dead

Dreams were set for momma's pride and joy
Don't forget daddy's little boy
Now, look and see know what you've done
Now, you're left for dead

She was raised on a country farm
Not with needles in her arms
She lived to fast and died too young
She was left for dead
