Susie had a razor
     But Jimmy, he had a gun
     She tried to end it all one day
     He helped her get it done
     She was no more than fifteen
     But Jimmy, he was a man
     She heard the neighbors whispering
     'Twas more than she could stand
     Too much talk
     It's not a question of love that's lost
     It's not a question of things gone wrong
     It's just too much talk...too much
     Jimmy, he was a loner
     But Susie, she was his friend
     She tried her best to please him
     Until the very end
     Yeah when the gunshots screamed through the air that night
     And Susie's long blond hair turned red that night
     Too much talk
     It's not a question of love that's lost
     It's not a question of things gone wrong
     It's just too much talk
     Too much talk
     It's not a question of love that's lost
     It's not a question of things gone wrong
     It's just too much talk, it's just too much talk, too much talk
