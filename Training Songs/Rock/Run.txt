I feel you in the sidetrack
I'm reaching out for contact
To keep you on my mind
And are you close to breaking
I'm sorry if you're aching
But I don't want to hide

I feel you somewhere downtown
I hear you in the low sounds
I bleed until I'm cut
And I'm still thinking of you
I promise I could love you
If you could keep it up

[Chorus]
Run if you want me
You're moving too slow
Run if you want me, oh whoa
Run if you want me
You're moving too slow
Run if you want me, oh whoa

The secret that I'm keeping
The moment that I'm reaching
The image on my mind
I feel you in the outback
I'm holding out for contact
You're so far behind

[Chorus]

Wake up jump start
Your name across my heart
Sign one track mind
Until the finish line
Slow burn new time
Still life a lesson learned
Fun damage done
If you want me you gotta

[Chorus: x2]
