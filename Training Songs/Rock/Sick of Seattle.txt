Alright, let it rock

Feeling so tired
And grungy and scared
Tired of flannel
And growing my hair
Tired of going nowhere
And I'm sick of Seattle

Came here to find me a place in the sun
Once was a scene now it's already done
Thinking of leaving, it's no longer fun in Seattle
In Seattle

Catch the first plane in the morning
I won't be sleeping tonight
I won't be late for that flight
'Cause I'm sick of Seattle
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Catch the first plane in the morning
I won't be sleeping tonight
I won't be late for that flight
'Cause I'm sick of Seattle

Feeling so tired
And grungy and scared
Tired of flannel
And growing my hair
Tired of going nowhere
And I'm sick of Seattle
Yes I'm sick of Seattle
Yes I'm leaving Seattle
And I'm tired of the prattle
