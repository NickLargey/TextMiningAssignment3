Oh my holy lord
Sets my soul on fire
Flames of love and sweet perfume
She's my heart's desire
She's an angel straight from hell
Draws me to the deep
In the darkness way below
It's my heart she'll keep

Thunder underground
Watch the castle fall
Sound of wind it takes the sky
And winter takes us all
Mountain high against the sky
Watches as we pray
Laughing loud and smiling proud
This is where we lay

Lover
Leaver
Taker
Believer

Oh God, hellfire
With your hand'll raze
So he'll fall to his knees
Watch the fire blaze
Satan plays his flute for him
The sound it burns his ears
Watch his eyes
The peace of mind
Slips and disappears

Lover
Leaver
Taker
Believer

Believer
