Nothing she can do, She's so confused
Something should be done, But she'll refuse
She's got a new fix, to ease her pain
She's got a new fix, to control her brain

Oh, no no no mainliner, mainliner
Out of frustration, she unwraps the foil
Takes out her spoon, starts to boil
She used to be pretty, To all her friends

But the hypodermic needle
Took her to the end
Oh, no no no mainliner, mainliner
She's boiling up, always in heat

Stick it in again
Just to keep her beat
This time she'll try a little more
This time we found her on the floor
Oh, no no no mainliner, mainliner...
