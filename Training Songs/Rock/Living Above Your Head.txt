Seems so strange, 
You puttin' me through changes

I can't believe that you're the same sweet girl, 
That I once knew
And baby, the changes coming on don't look so good
Too good on you

It seems so strange, 
You puttin' me through changes
Baby, you started doing 
Things you should not be doin'

[Chorus:]
Living above your head, girl
Coming on way too strong
Living above your head, girl
Something has got to go wrong

Baby, don't think that I don't know you goin' out 
With other guys
And Baby, 'though it hurts me so, you know that I'm so
So hypnotized

So let's not fight, 
Kill all the love inside of me
Baby, you started doing 
Things you should not be doin'

[Chorus]
Living above your head, girl
Coming on way too strong
Living above yer head girl,
Something has got to go wrong...
...with our love, with our love

Livin' above your head...
