Sprung like a wild orchid
Curled like a wave
Hanging like wood smoke yeah
In the airy glade
Only the wine talking
Only the wine
Head spinning, mouth open
Time after time

Sympathetic
Won't forget it
Hope I never live to see the day
Gone forever
Ah whatever
Have to find a way
Home

Coiled in my synapses
Poised like a snake
There as the time lapses
And the levee breaks
Only the wine talking
Only the wine
Head spinning, mouth open
Time after time

Sympathetic
Won't forget it
Hope I never live to see the day
Gone forever
Ah whatever
Have to find a way
The way
The way
