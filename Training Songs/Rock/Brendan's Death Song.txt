If I die before I get it done
Will you decide
Take my words and turn them into sounds
That will survive
Because a long time ago
I knew not to deprive

It's safe out there and now you're everywhere
Just like the sky
And you are love, you are the love supreme
You are the rise
And when you hear this, you know it's your jam
It's your goodbye

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's gonna play my song
To carry me along

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes 
To ferry me away
To where we all belong

We all crossed when we were feeling lost
It's just the time
Kateri cried the day her lover died
She recognized
Because you gave her a life of real love
It's no surprise

The night's are long, but the years are short
When you're alive
Way back when we'll never be again
It was a time
It's gonna catch you so glad I met you
To walk a line

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's gonna play my song
To carry me along

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes 
To ferry me away
To where we all belong

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's gonna play my song
To carry me along

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes 
To ferry me away
To where we all belong

Let me live so when it's time to die
Even the reaper cries
Let me die so when it's time to live
Another sun will rise

I said yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I said yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's gonna play my song
To carry me along

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes 
To ferry me away
To where we all belong

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
