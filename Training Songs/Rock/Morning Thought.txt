Stop, break nothing, try
Running around the park.
If I’d known,
I wasn’t allowed to take this stop,
From the moment that you wake,
I’m running around it, a simple place.

Not thinking about it.

There were two, three, four,
Across the line I was born.
You were born,
Just like me.
You’re thinking about how long it takes,
To cross the ocean. 
While you wait,
I’m running around it, anyway.

I’m not thinking about it.
Not thinking about it.

Still can’t keep me from crying, oh
Still can’t keep me from crying.

I would like to protect you,
I would like to release you,
I would like to inform you,
I would like to pretend but we don’t know how,
We don’t know how to.

We don’t know how to.
