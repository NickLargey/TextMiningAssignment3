Don't claim to understand her 
I wonder what she's doing with me 
Don't know what she does with the rest of her time 
But she gives it to me for free 

She gives me love 
She gives me love 

She never takes my money 
But she always steals my time 
She's the kind of a girl that if you gave her the world 
She'd say it wasn't worth a dime 

She gives me love 
She gives me love 

It's not easy to explain it 
The effect she has on me 
Make a dumb man talk and a blind man see 
That sweet little mystery 

She gives me love 
She gives me love 

She gives me love 
She gives me love
