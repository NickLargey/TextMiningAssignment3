If I never get back home
There's no garden on the ground
No widows at the wall
No widows left at all

No shirts that I will fold
No kid I want to hold
No widows at the wall
No widows on the phone

If I'm stuck out here alone
If I'm stranded here all weird
Just nothing left at home
No widows disappear

If the wheels jump off the road
There's no widows left to know
No perfect love will grow
There's no punishment below

When they shake
Say the wings won't hurt
When they shake
Say the wings won't hurt

If I'm stuck out here alone
If I'm stranded here all weird
Just nothing left at home
No widows disappear

If the wheels jump off the road
There's no widows left to know
No perfect love will grow
There's no punishment below

When they shake
Say the wings won't hurt
When they shake
Say the wings won't hurt
