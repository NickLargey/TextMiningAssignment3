I used to have no wolves around me
I was too free, if that's possible to be
No safety, is what I mean
No solid foundation to keep me

But the sun's peeping out of the sky
Where there used to be only gray
The wolf is getting married
And he'll never cry again

Your smile makes me smile
Your laugh makes me laugh
Your joy gives me joy
Your hope gives me hope

And the sun's peeping out of the sky
Where there used to be only gray
The wolf is getting married
And he'll never cry again

Never cry again

Even if something terrible is happening
You laugh and that's the thing I love about you most, yeah

Your smile makes me smile
Your laugh makes me laugh
Your joy gives me joy
Your hope gives me hope

And the sun's peeping out of the sky
Where there used to be only gray
The wolf is getting married
And he'll never cry again
