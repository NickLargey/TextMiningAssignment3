It may be winter time
But baby it's super fine
You may be near or far
Finding a way to really get to me
Baby you know you are getting close to my heart

Your self is my best side
My hope my faith and my guiding light
Your love is super fine
And it feels good in my heart
And I hope that I'm a part of you

So good to know you
So good to hold you
Thank you for being you
It's so good to know you

Empires may fall apart
And rivers may part
And though you have won my heart
It feels good from the start
And I hope that I'm a part of you

So good to love you
So good to know you
Thank you for being you
It's so good to love you

You really make my day
Make each day seem like a special day
I love your way
Oh won't you stay?

So good to know you
So good to hold you
Thank you for being you
It's so good to know you
