All my life I denied ever knowing what it's like
You came around
You shook my ground
Now I'm searching for a drug to come down
You always thought I'd never go
I can't believe I did

Look out below
I'm letting go
Look out below
I'm falling completely
Out of control
I'm letting go
Now I can see so clearly around me
You're everything I need

Deep inside is where you've been
Ever since you wandered in
And now I shine and get so high
On all the things I used to deny
Now I can never let you go
I guess I'll just let you win

Look out below
I'm letting go
Look out below
I'm falling completely
Out of control
I'm letting go
Now I can see so clearly around me
You're everything I need
To find all of the things I used to deny
And I know that the closer you bring me fear tries to keep me alone
Look out below

Look out below
I'm letting go
Look out below
I'm falling completely
Out of control
I'm letting go
Now I can see so clearly around me
You're everything I need

You're everything I need
You're everything I need
You're everything I need
