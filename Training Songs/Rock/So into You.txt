When you walked into the room
There was voodoo in the vibes
I was captured by your style
But I could not catch your eyes
Now, I stand here helplessly
Hoping you'll get into me

I am so into you
I can't think of nothing else
I am so into you
I can't think of nothing else
Thinking how it's gonna be
Whenever I get you next to me

It's gonna be good, don't you know
From your head to your toe
Me into you, you into me, me into you

When you walked into the room
There was voodoo in the vibes
I was captured by your style
But I could not catch your eyes
Now, I stand here helplessly
Hoping you'll get into me

I am so into you
I can't get to nothing else
I am so into you, baby
I can't get to nothing else, no, no, no, no

Come on baby, I'm so into you
Love all the things you do
Listen baby, drivin' me crazy
Love all the things you do
