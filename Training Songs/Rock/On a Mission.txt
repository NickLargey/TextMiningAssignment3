I want to rise from my seat
Don't want to be held down
I want to get off the couch
I want to find a new sound
I want to step outside
I want to say I'm alive
I'm on a mission, I'm on a mission
Courtesy of a condition
My condition, my condition
Is something that you can't see
I'm just looking for a better way
I'm on this mission because of my condition
And its the only thing I can see
Don't want to try hard to be something
Just want to let it come naturally
I can only see one thing and that's
A bright future for me
Cause you're my friends I hope you'll
Never think again about my intentions on this stage
Its not just what I say but its what I believe
And now the only thing I now is get up & go
And find my destiny
I'm on a mission, I'm on a mission
Courtesy of a condition
I've got a vision, I've got a vision
Of all the things we can do together
