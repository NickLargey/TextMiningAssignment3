Up from the ashes and over the hill
We knew more than we ever will
Back when the days passed by so slow
And now we'll never know
That sense that tomorrow was far away
And our dreams they never fade
We never thought the good times could end
Can we go back to those days - When everything was simple then?
And nothing could ever change
Can we go back to those days - We didn't have a care at all
I wish I could remain - Back in yesterdays
Pictures of another place and time
They seem like scenes from a different life
We didn't notice as the days went past
We knew it couldn't last
But looking back I wouldn't change a thing
The memories shared they'll always stay with me
We never thought the good times would end
