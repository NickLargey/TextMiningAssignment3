Picture me a magazine, empty the night
No there isn't much redeeming about this dawn's breaking light
Curtains, I could have it all
The window, the view, the second story fall

Creased and doubled up, hung out on the tracks 
She said a diamond wouldn't hurt, and that I should have rolled a deck
Curtains, on the quiet side
Curtains can, what it is they were to hide
