There's a shadow across the sea
A phantom power that's pestering me
A spectre as bold as stone
I say "no! Go!"
It's summer snow

Well you can fathom that something is wrong
When they're making a dance and a song
'Bout some useless excuse of a thing
I say "no! Go!"
It's summer snow

People!
Show me a place where we're never confronted
By things we never needed

People!
Show me a place that isn't corrupted
And peace interrupted

People!
Show me a place where we're never confronted
By things we never wanted

People!
Show me a space that isn't corrupted
And peace interrupted

I say "no! Go!"
(Summer sun, summer rain, summer snow)
It's summer snow
I say "no! Go!"
(Summer sun, summer rain, summer snow)
To summer snow
I say "no! Go!"
(Summer sun, summer rain, summer snow)
It's summer snow
I say "no! Go!"
(Summer sun, summer rain, summer snow)
