Suddenly you'll move away from me
What more is it that I could be, if you move away from me
You on that train, I was alone in your room
When there on the floor, I saw a little black book
You left it there on the floor, open and evidence

Your diary, your diary, open and inviting me back
Your diary, your diary, open and inviting me back
(I'm back)

You couldn't say why you loved him
He's asking you why you loved him
You couldn't say why you loved him
But he gave you a list of all the reasons why he did
And you couldn't reply but you could say that you did

Your diary, your diary, open and inviting me back
Your diary, your diary, open and inviting me back
(I'm back)

He said he had lips like petals unfurling from a bud
I could have ripped page and petals, ripped to the blood
Ripped until ripping was all it was good
But I didn't and don't want you ever to read
Any diary of mine and word I may leave now

Your diary, your diary, open and inviting me back
Your diary, your diary, open and inviting me back
Your diary, your diary, your diary, open and inviting me back
(I'm back)
Your diary, your diary, your diary, open and inviting me back
(I'm back)
