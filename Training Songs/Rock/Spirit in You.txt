Under your skin there's something beckoning
There's something that makes me believe in you
Behind your eyes, that's where the sacred lies
You know I need to get through
Oh here I go again
Through the undergrowth again
Feel the earth move, the planets spin

But I can't get through
It's the spirit in you
It's the spirit in you
It's the spirit in you
That I want to find
I've seen your face, the one your mother made
Now let me see what makes you really move
I know you're scared, I know it's tender there

Just let me closer let me get through
O here I go again
Through the undergrowth again
Feel the earth move, the planets spin
But I can't get through
It's the spirit in you
It's the spirit in you
It's the spirit in you
That I want to find

And when you make me feel
When you make me bleed
My lucky stars fall down on me
You know I need to know you
I need to see
I need to take ahold of what's underneath
So close your eyes, close your eyes
Unlock your mind, unlock your mind
Throw off the fear, and let us fly
O here I go again

Through the undergrowth again
Feel the earth move, the planets spin
But I can't get through
It's the spirit in you
It's the spirit in you
It's the spirit in you
That I want to find
It's the spirit in you
It's the spirit in you
It's the spirit in you
That I want to find
