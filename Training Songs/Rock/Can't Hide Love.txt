Lyin' here, I watch you sleep and wonder what you're dreamin' of
Am I with you now
Suddenly, you walked into my life and got the best of me
And I gave in somehow
We could try and fool ourselves, afraid to face these feelings
In the dark we cry for help, we could walk away, but
Chorus:
We can't hide love, I see it in your eyes, I feel it in your touch
Can't hide love, we could both pretend it doesn't mean that much
Can't hide love
Just a smile, but when it comes from you it really moves me down inside
Amazes me that way
'Cause when we start to care, we hesitate it never felt like this before
And it gets stronger every day
We could stand our ground, even though we love our freedom
The walls will tumble down, it's just you and I, and
(chorus)
Let's not lose each other, this chance won't come again, let love begin, yeah
(Solo)
We could try and fool ourselves, afraid to face these feelings
In the dark we cry for help, we could walk away, but
We can't hide love, I see it in your eyes, I feel it in your touch
Can't hide love, once in a lifetime that you find someone you trust
Can't hide love, we could both pretend it doesn't mean that much
Can't hide love
