Down by the dock, hot blood in the sun 
The body lays up against the weeds 
The locals said the man had it comin' 
And it's time someone put him six feet in the ground 

Where did she go that night 
Where did she sleep when the morning came 
To the summerhouse (cha!) 

Mrs. showed up to ID the body 
Then shed a tear, as she hid a smile 
The sergeant laughed and smiled in frustration 
One life is lost, while another one is found 

Where did she go that night 
Where did she sleep when the morning came 
To the summerhouse 
To the summerhouse (cha!) (cha!) 

Where did she go that night 
Where did she sleep when the morning came 
When the morning came 
When the morning came 
To the summerhouse
