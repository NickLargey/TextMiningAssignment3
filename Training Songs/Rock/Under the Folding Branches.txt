There I knew you once, didn't I?
And the sound of that music traveled
To me from that orphan sky
And pulled it all in my vault

Love hide me away deep in this town and canopy of snow
Go, spin me around under the folding branches
Now, is not too late, heaven can wait another year or so

Thought I loved you once, didn't I?
But I wanted the fin, didn't I?
Thought it broke your heart, didn't I?
But that face in the dark wasn't mine

Love hold me away deep in this town and canopy of snow
Go, spin me around under the folding branches
Now, is not too late, heaven can wait another year or so

Go, spin me around under the folding branches
Now, is not too late, heaven can wait another year or so
Go, spin me around under the folding branches
Now, is not too late, heaven can wait another year or so

For I loved you once, didn't I?
There, I loved you once, didn't I?
