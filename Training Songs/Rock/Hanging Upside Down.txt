Window shoppin'
Finger poppin'
Hangin' in our fav'right shopping mall
Looky looky
A little cutie
A little kitten she deserves a home

Tell you dudes when I get old enough
Bet that I am gonna try some stuff
Twisted sister
Don't 'cha miss her
But there's a hundred more where she came from
Wiggle wiggle
Jiggle jiggle
Jesus, how the babes are almost grown!

I don't need to watch the news at night
Anyone can see we're outa time --

Hangin' on
Hangin' out
Got my hundred dollar shoes
Hangin' round
Hangin' free
We got nothin else to do
What goes up
Must come down
Oh, she took an overdose
Hangin' out
Hangin' free
Till our mama takes us home

Shimmy shimmy
Gimmie gimmie
We don't need you & we don't need love
Gotta have it
I'm gonna grab it
It ain't stealing, hey, it's only fun

When you live inside the pleasure dome
You don't ever want to go back home

Hangin' on
Hangin' out
Some are hangin' upside down
A perfect world
A perfect girl
Oh ? another year rolls by
I'm the king
You're my queen
When those zombies all awake
A broken heart
A broken home
Ain't no tears upon your face

Hangin' on
Hangin' out
There's a place for me & you
Hangin' round
Hangin' free
We got nothin' else to do
Turn it up
Fade it down
Yeah, that song it saved my life
Perfect teeth
A perfect smile
Oh, she was a friend of mine
Let's go out
To the place
Where the hands of time are slowed
No one walks
No one dies
No more hassles anymore
