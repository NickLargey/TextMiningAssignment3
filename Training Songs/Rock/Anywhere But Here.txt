I would like to meet Billy Kardoff
I would like to go to the pub
But I'm stuck here with me own company
My friend this is really tough

[Chorus:]

Anywhere but here
Anywhere but here
I would like to be upon the sea
Or anywhere but here

I would like to ride a motorbike
I would like to drink with me mates
I would like to go to the cinema
And have me way with a date

[Chorus]

I would like to go to the palace
To pick up me MBE
I would like to go up to heaven
And sit on gods right knee

[Chorus]
