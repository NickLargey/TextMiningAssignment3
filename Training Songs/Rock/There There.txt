There, there, it's only me and you
Be true
Your big eyes
This careless life
Conversation, we gave it a try
It's all the same
Now pull real close
Feel the beat, of our pulse
There, there, it's only me and you
There, there, only you can do
There, there, it's only me and you
No one else knows what we go through
What's yours is mine
This privileged life
Temptation, we gave it a try
It's all the same, that winding road
Feel the beat, lose your pulse
But I can only see
I can only see dreaming
I can only love
I can only love the screaming
I can only love
I can only love equal
I could only love
Crawling on the fire
