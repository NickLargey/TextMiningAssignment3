I'm all about you

There's somethin' I've got to say
You're always with me even though you're far away
Talkin' to you on my cell
Just the sound of your voice makes my heart melt
Oh girl, its true

I'm all about you 
I'm all about us 
No baby you never
Have to question my love
And every night there's a new crowd
But it's always you I'm singin' about
There is only on theses words are goin' out to
Oh girl, I'm all about you

I know you worry sometimes
Some other girl will make me forget you're mine
There's not a doubt in this world 
That anyone could take the place of my number one girl 
It's true 

I'm all about you 
I'm all about us 
No baby you never have to question my love 
And every night there's a new crowd 
But it's always you I'm singin' about 
There's only one these words are goin' out to 
Oh girl 

I'm all about you
(heya,hey yea)

When I close my eyes I can see you
It's like you're right here 
And this feeling's only getting stronger
You're with me everywhere. . .

I'm all about you 
I'm all about us 
No baby you never have to question my love
And every night there's a new crowd 
But it's always you 
I'm singing about 
There is only one these words are goin out to 
Oh girl 

I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you 
I'm all about you
I'm all about you
