Everybody wants something for nothing
Everybody wants a piece of your spark
I just want to be the one you call when things go worse
Then I'll come running, yeah I'll come running

Everybody wants something for nothing
Everybody wants the key to your heart
I just want to be the one you call when things go worse
Then I'll come running, yeah I'll come running

'Cause you give me just a little bit
All the joy that lies within the mess
I just want to be the one you call when things go worse
And I'll come running, yeah I'll come running

Everybody wants something for nothing
But nobody wants to love who you are
Umm, I just want to be the one you call when things go worse
And I'll come running, yeah I'll come running

'Cause you give me just a little bit
All the joy that lies within the mess
I just want to be the one you call when things go worse
And I'll come running, yeah I'll come running

You can try but it won't ever hold me back from you
Those burning bridges keeping us apart
Let's turn this nothing mess back into something
Calling, I'll come running to you

'Cause you give me just a little bit
All the joy that lies within the mess
I just want to be the one you call when things go worse
And I'll come running, yeah I'll come running
'Cause you give me just a little bit, oh oh
All the joy that lies within the mess, oh
I just want to be the one you call when things go worse
And I'll come running, yeah I'll come running
