I was living in a newtown
I had problems with my parents
So I moved on up to London town
Where they said that things were happening, going down
Chorus:

Living in a bedsit
Bunking the tube trains
Sleeping all day long
And you know no one, 'cause you don't go out,
'cause you've got no work
You just watch television
Living with unemployment I, I ain't got a job And, there's no work in the city
They, they always try to blame it on the blacks
But it's really those in power that stab you in the back
Chorus
'round our way, we ain't got a lot
And after two years on the dole, I felt I'd been left to rot
But now I've joined the Army and, believe it or not
I'm going to Northern Ireland and, I'm going to get shot!
Chorus
Living with unemployment Oh you get so lonely
Living with unemployment
It gets so frustrating
Living with unemployment
And the Neurotics wanna tell you, what it's like to be
Unemployed, out of work, unemployed, out of work (repeat)

"Try to stay, out of trouble dear..."

It's lonely for you
And it's lonely for me
It's lonely for all of us - can't you see?
Chorus
Living with unemployment
Oh you get so lonely
Living with unemployment
It gets so frustrating
Living with unemployment - living without

When you're out of work
They treat you like dirt
When you're out of work
They treat you like dirt

It's all part of the plan (8)
We are the scroungers (4)
Living with unemployment
