Now there is a way to say I love you
And it's said ev'ry day by some kind of fool
But where is the way to tell her goodbye
We both can't be wrong
I must be right 

Hot love in a cold world
Gonna make you cry
Hot love in a cold world oh yeah

Our connection was strong I thought it would last
Dreams of the future not a care for the past
But look at us now
Not knowin' what to do 
You're lookin' so sad
I feel so cruel

Hot love in a cold world oh yeah
Gonna make you cry 
Hot love in a cold world
Gonna make you cry 
But in this cold world with a hot love
You'll get by 
Hot love in a cold world
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
