Don't you ever feel sad
Lean on me when the times are bad
When the day comes
And you are down
In a reveal of trouble
And bite the ground

Hold on I'm coming
Hold on I'm coming
Hold on I'm coming

I was always be your lover
If you get cold I'll be your cover
Don't have to worry, don't have to fear
You don't have to suffer baby
'Cause I'm here

Hold on I'm coming
Hold on I'm coming
Hold on I'm coming

Reach out to me for satisfaction
Just call my name for quickly action
