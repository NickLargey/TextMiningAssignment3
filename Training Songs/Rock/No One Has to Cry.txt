As I wake today same as yesterday
I get in my car the poor turn my wheels
There's so much today, who's got time to listen?
As we fulfill our dreams the shame is left unseen

Why should someone lose so that I get by?
Why should someone pay just to send me high?

[Chorus]
No one has to cry while I can smile
No one owns the sky so blue above you
Somewhere in this world
There's a field where we all play
The secret's in your eyes
No one has to cry

There's no self-control as we play our roles
It's all dog eat dog, we're all dressed for show
As we plot and scheme full of American dreams
Who says it's fair who gets the opportunities?

There are some who live without so that I get by
They pay the price for doubting just to send me high.

[Chorus]
