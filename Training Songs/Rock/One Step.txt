And you wonder what you're doing
And you really want to get somewhere
And you're thinking nothing's going to get you there
It's important to remember that you're free to go anywhere
Take your chances and let the change take you there
Sometimes it takes one step at a time
When that straight line makes you blind
And sometimes it takes a one step
It's not easy never easy
When you know you're gonna have to change
Your direction find yourself another way
Just remember what you're leaving
It is something that you had to go through
Don't be sorry there's something better waiting for you
Sometimes it takes one step at a time
When that straight line makes you blind
And sometimes it takes a one step
It takes one step at a time
When that straight line makes you blind
And sometimes it takes a one step
Well it takes one step at a time
When that straight line makes you blind
And sometimes it takes a one step
And sometimes it takes a one step
And sometimes it takes a one step
