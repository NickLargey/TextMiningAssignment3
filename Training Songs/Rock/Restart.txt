I was finished, game over
Couldn't carry the weight on my shoulders
At my end, in trouble
Knocked down on the ground seein' double

But then your love, love opened my eyes
Lifted me up, up, now I'm alive
I raise my hands, hands to the sky
Singing "oh oh oh oh oh oh" "oh oh oh oh oh"

Oh lord, I'm a different man
You gave me a second chance
I was lost, I was fallin' apart
But you came along, and you hit the restart

You, you, you hit the restart
You, you, you hit the restart
You, you, you hit the restart
You came along, and you hit the restart

I was twisted, like bad religion
Fully committed to my way of livin'
I heard the preacher, but never listened
On a dead end road without a mission

Restart, restart, oh oh oh
Restart, restart, oh oh oh
I was lost, I was fallin' apart
But you came along, and you hit the restart

You make all things new
That's just what you do
You're making me new
