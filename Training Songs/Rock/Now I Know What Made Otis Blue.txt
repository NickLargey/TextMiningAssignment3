You got a hold on me
Hey don't you know
We've gone too far for me to let you go
You throw my love away
And then you try
To see it burning in a stranger's eyes

I remember the good times
I remember the things we used to do

Now I know what made Otis blue
Girl it must be love that we're going through
Now I know what made Otis blue
Every single night I keep wanting you

Don't make me sleep alone
Don't make me bleed
How can you waste your love in jealousy
If we're together baby
Your eyes will see
There is no other lover here than me

You remember the good times
Do you remember when every word was true

There is no one else
Only you
I'm begging you
Don't turn your heart to heartless
