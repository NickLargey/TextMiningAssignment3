I can still remeber you
Like a wish that won't come true
All the rumors do add up
Do they always?

Still water does run deep
Its currents pull me through my sleep
It goes away but then comes back
Will it always?

When we wonder what we are
Somewhere distant on a star
I can believe
Don't look down if you're afraid
Do we always?

Still water does run deep
Its currents pull me through my sleep
It goes away but then comes back
Does it always?

Does it always?
Does it always?
