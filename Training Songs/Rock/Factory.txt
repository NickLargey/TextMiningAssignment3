Be yourself, boys
Let's get this show on the road

Well I'm up every morning by 6:08
Take the Volkswagen bus up the interstate
Feel Charlie Manson just like
I'm diggin' real hard for some money to spend
Well it ain't that bad if the summer's free
I got my evenings, to cruise the scene oh yeah

I got a pretty old lady
Who rolls back in the morning
She don't pressure me about my over time
Got a kickin' black chick
Who meets me in the alley
Sayin' unsnap your jeans, baby
I'll take what I find
I got non-stop shoot 'em up, on a layaway plan
I've got a workman's compensation, I'm a union man

Working at the factory
Gonna get me some of them luxuries
Well now me and the boys
Machines are making noise
Working at the factory (moola)

It works like this

I got one eye on the time clock
I got my other eye on, the girl in the hall
I got this, rocket, hum, stuck right here in my pocket
Waitin' for the five o'clock whistle to call
I'm the whistle dancer of the production line
I got an encore tomorrow at the very same time
