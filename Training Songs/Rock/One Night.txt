One night with you, is what I'm now praying for.
The things that we two could plan, would make my dreams come true.
Just call my name, I'll be there right by your side,
I want your sweet helping hands,
My love's too strong to hide.

Always lived, very quiet life, yeah.
But I never did no wrong.
But now I now that life without you has been too lonely too long.
One night with you, is what I'm not prayin' for.
