Never before would he even thought it
Take her life away
Nothing could give her peace but leaving
Careful what you say

He sees the pain, that no one else is seeing
He feels the pain, that no one else is feeling

(pre-chorus) now you've gone past the point you can't take
now you've gone past the point you can't
stop all the suffering...
stop all the pain...

(chorus) Old man stop the pain
now your life is stained
(repeat)

had it been the other way around 
there's nothing i would change here
for my sake-for her sake
hey it's not a life i'm ending
hold on to nothing, i'll set you free

(pre-chorus)
(chorus)

go to sleep softly and know this, 
i'm gonna take away the only thing you've left
because you can't speak to ask,
i will send you on your way...

it's the way its gotta be to set her free
take another shot old man
it's the way its gotta be
you know what you are ending

(modified chorus)

its the way its gotta be to set her free
take another shot old man
its the way its gotta be... old man
