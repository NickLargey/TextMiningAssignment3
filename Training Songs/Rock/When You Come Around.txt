I got a feelin'
My heart starts to reelin'
No use concealing
You so appealing
Lawdy, lawdy, lawdy, lawdy
When you come around, come around

Please listen to me,
There's no one can fool me
You know you always
Do something to me
Lawdy, lawdy, lawdy, lawdy
When you come around, come around

I'll never scold you,
You know I told you
You make me want to
Reach out and hold you
Lawdy, lawdy, lawdy, lawdy
When you come around

Now, please listen to me,
There's no one can fool me
You know you always
Do something to me
Lawdy, lawdy, lawdy, lawdy
When you come around, come around
