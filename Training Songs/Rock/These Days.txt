You left town alone the day
And set your sails for another place
All this time I thought I knew 
That you would be mine, and I would be yours too

Yeah, yeah, these days, yeah
I need to be with you and spend a little time
While your gone I will wait here for you

[Chorus:]
I'll be with you when you feel no emotion
I'll be with you when you can't find a way out
I'll be with you when you feel no emotion
I will wait for you, I will be here for you

You went to places you've never been
You got into things you never thought that you'd get in
Fell in deep into a wishing well
Looking for freedom you found a prison cell
