To some I am a blessing
To others I'm a curse
I'm a writer not a fighter
I'm a person not a verse
I may be just an easy touch
And taken for a whore
But I just came to leave
A little lovin' at your door

Oh, ooh show me some affection
Oh, ooh give me some direction
Oh, ooh know you're my connection

Just a jet-age gypsy 
Looking for a gypsy queen
I sometimes think I'm on the brink
Of knowing what I mean
Cities come and cities go
But still I cannot find
A place to call a home
When there's a woman on my mind

Oh, ooh show me some affection
Oh, ooh give me some direction
Oh, ooh know you're my connection

If hanging out with you
Was spent by hanging in
I'd still be out of time with time
Just waiting to begin
I have no preconceived ideas
Of how things have to be
I'll just take life as it comes 
And hope that it takes me

Oh, ooh show me some affection
Oh, ooh give me some direction
Oh, ooh know you're my connection
