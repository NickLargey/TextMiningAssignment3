She's in love with you, that's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down, she'll never fool around
'Cause she's in love with you

So if you see her all alone one night walk up to her discreetly, ask her why
And if she replies with words that don't make sense it may be just because she's shy
Don't take advantage of her lack of understanding just because you think you could
Treat her right, treat her good, take her home and make her feel the way she should

'Cause she's in love with you, that's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down, she'll never fool around
'Cause she's in love with you
She's in love with you, that's all she wants to do
She'll never let you go, she may not let you know, but she's in love with you

So if you happen to be out one night and someone asks you where you're gonna go
Just remember she's not like the other girls she may not want them all to know
Though she may need a little time she never wants to stand in line the way they would
So treat her nice, treat her good, treat her like you know you should
You may never find another girl like her

'Cause she's in love with you, that's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down, she'll never fool around
'Cause she's in love with you
She's in love with you, that's all she wants to do
She'll never let you go, she may not let you know, but she's in love with you

So take her home and hold her close, touch her where she feels it most, but be true
And when she's making love to you, she'll do what you want her to
Treat her good, treat her like you know you should
You may never find another girl like her

'Cause she's in love with you, that's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down, she'll never fool around
'Cause she's in love with you
She's in love with you, that's all she wants to do
She'll never let you go, she may not let you know, but she's in love with you
She's in love with you, that's all she wants to do
