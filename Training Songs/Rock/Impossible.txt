I can't fly
But I, I keep finding myself soaring high above this
I have nothing left but I keep on pouring
Out like I am endless
Impossible, Impossible

I don't run too fast but I'm looking back
And miles and miles have passed
I can barely breathe but I'm
Singing out like this is nothing to me
Impossible, Impossible

Every morning I see another miracle
I can't believe, I'm living the impossible
We are the sign and we are the wonder
Another day of living the impossible
Impossible, Impossible

I choose to be alive
Especially because the odds say I should die
I wrestle death again I know more of
His moves now and I won't give in
Impossible, Impossible

Every morning I see another miracle
I can't believe, I'm living the impossible
We are the sign and we are the wonder
Another day of living the impossible
Impossible, Impossible

When I'm weak I wonder if I'm gonna be alright
But too many times I've seen this all come to life
If I make myself stop and remember

When I'm weak I wonder if I'm gonna be alright
But too many times I've seen this all come to life
If I make myself stop and remember

Every morning I see another miracle
I can't believe, I'm living the impossible
We are the sign and we are the wonder
Another day of living the impossible
Impossible, Impossible

I'm living the impossible
We are the sign and we are the wonder
I'm living the impossible
