Give me a kiss, give me a kiss
I want to find out what I missed
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Don't leave me at a time like this.

Posters in blue look just like you
A snapshot on a magazine
Now all the rage, turn back the page
At one time you were just like me
Here in...

Teenland oh oh oh
Teenland oh oh oh
Teenland oh oh oh
Teenland now

Drink up and drown, drink up and drown
This poison always brings me around
I need cigarettes, I need cigarettes
I need nicotine for full effect
Here in...

CHORUS

All the kids are walking out on their heroes now
What the kids are talking about means zero now
You've gotta give us a break, give us a break
Give us a break in Teenland now
In dreamland now, in Teenland now.
Right now!

You're all the same, you're on the team
Sometimes it makes you want to scream
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss
I want to find out what I missed
Here in...
