Don´t turn around,
It could never be the same again,
You´ve let me down,
I don´t understand I can´t pretend.
Oh, feels like I´ve been goin´ down this road sometime before,
Someday, I will leave it far behind and that´s for sure.

Don´t call my name,
There´s no guarantee that I´ll be there,
You feel no pain,
Nothing for the times we used to share,
Oh hopin´, you´ll be easy on my mind and I´ll forget
Somehow, can´t help thinkin´ that I wish we´d never met.

This is my song for you
Thoughts of winter,
Dreams of sunshine,
Nothing that I can do
Changes how I feel in my mind.
This is my song for you,
Times I hope you will remember,
Things that were meant for two,
Here in my heart,
Here in my song for you.

I´d like to know,
Do you ever stop to wonder why,
As feelings grow,
We could never change it, never try,
Oh, who knows, you might even find you miss me when I´m gone,
Somewhere, I´ve just got to find the strength to carry on. 
This is my song for you
Thoughts of winter,
Dreams of sunshine,
Nothing that I can do
Changes how I feel in my mind.
This is my song for you,
Times I hope you will remember,
Things that were meant for two,
Here in my heart,
Here in my song for you.

Here in my song

Nothing that I can do
