I close my eyes but I can`t sleep
I hear you crying in my dreams
I`m flying high, i`m falling deep
It`s your blood life is cheap

It`s a game and you will lose
You`re just a story in the news
There`s a whisper in the air
The weeping willow doesn't care

I close my eyes I fall asleep
I hear you crying in my dreams
I`m flying high i`m falling deep
It`s your blood life is cheap

Who`s the friend who`s the foe?
Where`s the smile in your face
Say goodbye and say hello
It`s the end of the show

Innocent
And when she died a second time
The angels cried
