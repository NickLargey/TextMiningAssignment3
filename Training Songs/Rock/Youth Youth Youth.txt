Youth youth youth 
Youth youth youth 
Never wanna be an adult 
Always wanna be in revolt 

Youth youth youth 
Youth youth youth 

Don't wanna spend my life saving up for things 
I don't wanna have what a steady job brings 
I don't want security 
Don't want responsibility 

I don't wanna stay at home not making any noise 
I always got to be out 
I always got to have a choice 
I don't want security 
Don't want responsibility 

Youth youth youth 
Youth youth youth 

I don't want no uniform 
And I don't want no book of rules 

'Cause that's youth

Youth youth youth 
Youth youth youth 

Never wanna be an adult 
Always wanna be in revolt 

Youth youth youth 
Youth youth youth 

Well I don't want no uniform 
And I don't want no book of rules 'cause that's youth
