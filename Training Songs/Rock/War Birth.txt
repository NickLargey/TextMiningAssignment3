In '64 there's a milk man at the door 
Heard the battle family had a new born 
Baby named eddie was a product of the trailer parks 
His military father died when he was four drop 
Kids drop dead they're drafted from a crib war 
Birth war birth eddie battles got no chance far 
Away in fighter planes, so many die in boming 
Raids yer an old man at the age of 19 they sent him off 
To sea to sink in a submarine all the leaders they got the masses 
To believe march until yer dead do all the rest will be free 
Death is democracy life is anarchy shoot the president I want to f*ck yer queen 

[chorus] 
Eddies in the scouts & dreams about m-16's
Mom swims in a bottle for breakfast everyday the kids don't get along 
Embarrassed of his home he hates his pops who left and wants to do the same
