Mother Mary, your hold on me
Denies my feelings
From those who can see
Your sacred wisdom
Can caress my soul
Confused and forsaken
By what I've been told
It always sounded so right to me
To offer my prayers
With the hope to be free 
Mother Mary, is this wrong for me
To judge myself by what you see
And if I stand here
Will you stand by me
If the choice that I make
Is the choice to be me

I've heard your words
In so many ways
Do I trust myself
Beyond your praise
My heart has been touched
By something said
I want to go with her
I want to be led
I knelt at your side
Did you feel me
I gave you my all
To be nearer to thee

Mother Mary, is this wrong for me
To judge myself by what you see
And if I stand here
Will you stand by me
If the choice that I make
Is the choice to be me

You know I'll always be there [Repeat: x3]

Can't you show me a way to believe
Have I been enlightened, misled or deceived
It always sounded so right to me
To offer my prayers
With the hope to be free

Mother Mary, is this wrong for me
To judge myself by what you see
And if I stand here
Will you stand by me
If the choice that I make
Is the choice to be me
