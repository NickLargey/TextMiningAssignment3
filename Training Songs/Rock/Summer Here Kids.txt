After she lets you glide around
finally hit the ground like a paper plane
take a trip join me in the sun
but not really though, I aint having fun
Cause summer here kids
summer here totally lies
tourist info said id have a good time
summer here kids
all of them awful lies
tourist info said id have a good time
Do as I didn't do because
I?m a picture of imdumbivinity
stay alone put a record on
listen to the songs keep yourself at home
Cause summer here kids
summer here totally lies
tourist info said id have a good time
summer here kids
all of them awful lies
tourist info said id have a good time I?m not having a good time
