In the Grand Pecking Order
Where is it you stand
Under foot of swollen bastards
Or on the neck of another man
At the grand feeding table 
Are you sitting near the head
Or the corner by the bathroom
Where you're asked to pass the bread
And you pass it with a smile on your face
For to pout about would only bring disgrace
To the Grand Pecking Order
In the grand pecking order
Where is it you lie
Are you the tall hog at the trough 
Or a piglet in the stye
On the grand ladder of life
Are you near the highest rung
Or somewhere near bottom
With your nose in hairy bung
And you sniff it with a smile on your face
For to pout about would only bring disgrace
To the Grand Pecking Order
And you're dancing with a smile on your face
For to stand about would only bring disgrace!
To the Grand Pecking Order
