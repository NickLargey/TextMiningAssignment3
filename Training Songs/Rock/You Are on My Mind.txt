You are on my mind
The echo of your laughter flowing through me
Sitting by a mountain fire
And wishing you were in my arms
And loving me completely
Rocky mountain highs are very nice
But you are gone and nothing's quite the same
L.a. is so far away and I can't
Stand another day
Without you by my side
Though I've tried, tried, tried

You are on my mind
You are everything a woman could be
Consequently I believe that no one
Else could take your place if you
Should ever leave me
I'll be coming home again to you
And look upon the woman that I love
There is nothing I can say that celebrates
The special way you keep me satisfied
Pretty girl

(break)
Feeling just a little lonely
Wishing you were in my arms
Yeah...

You are on my mind
The echo of your laughter flowing through me
Sitting by a mountain fire
And wishing you were in my arms
And loving me completely
Rocky mountain highs are very nice
But you are gone and nothing's quite the same
L.a. is so far away and I can't
Stand another day
Without you by my side
Keep the fires burning

Keep the fires burning on
Keep the fires burning on
Keep the fires burning on
Keep the fires burning on
