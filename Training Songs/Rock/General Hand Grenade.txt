Good old General Hand Grenade
Ridin' in a motorcade
Sippin' on a lemonade
And waving at his fans

Isabella Band Aid
Wavin' at the Shrine parade
Eatin' toast and marmalade
And getting sticky hands

Good old General Hand Grenade
Ridin' in a motorcade
Lookin' for the cavalcade
To take him off to war

Isabella Band Aid
Suckin' on a Gatorade
Lookin' at the mess he made
And wonderin' what it's for

People gettin' high
People gettin' low
People gettin' nowhere
'Cause they don't know where to go

Good old General Hand Grenade
Ridin' in a motorcade
Lookin' for the cavalcade
To take him off to war

Isabella Band Aid
Suckin' on a Gatorade
Lookin' at the mess they made
And wonderin' what it's for

People gettin' high...
