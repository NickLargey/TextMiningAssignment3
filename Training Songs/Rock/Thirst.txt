When I think of fates worse than death
All I can think of is something you said
You said we were golden, bright like the sun
And now I am stranded
Knowing I’m not the one

An ocean of anger
Flowing through me
Blood stained and broken
From when I fell to sea
And just like a snake charmer
You led me astray
Living in distress
Hoping help is on the way

In the midst of a storm
Searching for shelter
I came upon
One single feather
A half-hearted wish
For something better
Gracefully cursed, I thirst

Attached to the soil
I’m guiding the wool
As I am in my blood
Yet so venerable
But after I’m gone
Once I finally leave
You will be left alone
To the wolves and the thieves

In the midst of a storm
Searching for shelter
I came upon
One single feather
A half-hearted wish
For something better
Gracefully cursed, I thirst
Gracefully cursed, I thirst
Gracefully cursed, I thirst
I thirst
