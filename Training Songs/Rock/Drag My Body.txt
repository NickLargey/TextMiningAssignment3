Well I got my heart up in a beautiful mess,
I should've known better when I took the risk,
To wreck myself and to gamble while broke,
Shaking something mental at a loss for the words I'd once known.
I traded two steps forward for three steps back,
To get to know the meaning of showing respect.
I found the pedestals and burned them down,
To kill my idols and to bury the thoughts underground.
I'm no longer deaf to the sounds.

I'm hardly feeling human anymore,
Enough to drag my body from the floor.

Well I got my head up in a critical mess,
Fighting like a demon in a shell I possess.
Gnashing my teeth and speaking in tongues,
Still shaking something mental at a loss for the words I'd once known.
Something's rattling my bones.

I'm hardly feeling human anymore,
Enough to drag my body from the floor.
I'm hardly feeling human anymore,
Enough to drag my body from the floor.

Stand to hold steady now,
Take a breath and somehow,
Take a step to begin again,
After all we can only do our best.

I'm hardly feeling human anymore,
Enough to drag my body from the floor.
I'm hardly feeling human anymore,
Enough to drag my body from the floor.

Stand and hold steady now.
