Could you wake me up when it's over
Well maybe I'll sit this out, I think I know the score
You read to me before
Why wrap it up so precisely
I know what you're bringing me, I keep them on the side
With gone and nevermore

Should I feel that it's over, all over
And are you here when I hold you, I wonder

You wanted days to remember
September without the fall, a house without a wall
A given in surprise
I never match you for missing
And you call this kissing , I feel closer to the sky
You never ask me why

Should I feel that it's over, all over
(Dry your eyes, outside vermillion skies eases the lies
Loose the ties that keep you under)
And are you here when I hold you, I wonder
(And I realize, when the sun is in your eyes it's no wonder)
