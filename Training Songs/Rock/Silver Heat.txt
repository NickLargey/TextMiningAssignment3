Watching your reflection in the window screen
Walking on the pavement in the Silver Heat
Foot slaps the ground twice over and over
A sound passes by your left shoulder

Frozen fingers
Sweaty palms
Transfer an image
Onto her heart

You're on the street below my window
Calling me down
You've got your bare feet on the dashboard
I'm running out of solid ground
She keeps a picture in her left breast pocket
In case he comes back
Oh forget that boy, come on now, drop it
I want to see you again

Watching your reflection in the window screen
Walking on the pavement in the Silver Heat
Foot slaps the ground twice over and over
A sound passes by your left shoulder

Sunken eyelids
Closed and wet
You've been crying
I told you to forget

You're on the street below my window
Calling me down
You've got your bare feet on the dashboard
I'm running out of solid ground
She keeps a picture in her left breast pocket
In case he comes back
Oh forget that boy, come on now, drop it
I want to see you again
