Freedom's all lies different walk away 
You gotta hold your tongue you gotta hit it with the right of way 
Maybe I blocked you from your intellectual scene 
In a way insane in a way it's gotta be. 
Red Sister might be choking but I ain't about that kind 
Answer me with the rhythm of a body that was born to lose two times. 
Hey big motor
He says that I'm a true fortune lie
Hang my shoulder 
Big broken love, big broken knives 

They might try to hide they have to answer mordant sins 
You might be right like a hole in the wind 
Poison daggers for the road mix broke down cross 
Takes your head off the line
The flavor might be missing he has to cross that anyway 
You can bet you can riddle with the brothers to the power of another day. 

Hey big motor
He says the Night Patrol 49 
Hang my shoulder 
Big broken love, big broken knives 

Doing it say I'm meat 
Which one stole my time 
Didn't you say you'd watch it? 
Didn't I? 
Evil stripped in me 
Three more stripped in time.
Didn't you say you've got it? 
Watch me...Ah!
