You know, what I like and need, but its over
You know, what I want and feel, but its over
My heart is an open book
Don't need to read between the lines
To leave tears up all of me
Yes I believed in everyday

Get it and hurry up, get it and hurry up, get it and hurry up and go
Get it and hurry up, get it and hurry up, get it and hurry up and go

You know, what I give and take, but its over
You know, what I mend and break, but its over
My thoughts always close to you
What I caressed was by my side
To break will be hard on me
Yeah I will save our everyday

Get it and hurry up, get it and hurry up, get it and hurry up and go
Get it and hurry up, get it and hurry up, get it and hurry up and go

Forgive, that I'm on my way, but its over
Without you all night all day now its over
Our love sealed in history
Got my respect in every way
Don't you turn around no more
No, don't you ask for me to stay

Get it and hurry up, get it and hurry up, get it and hurry up and go
Get it and hurry up, get it and hurry up, get it and hurry up and go
