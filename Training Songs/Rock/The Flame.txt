I can't believe
That I tried to freeze your heart
Had to clean the mess
And to keep my lucky start
I can stay in bed all I want

'cause I got you and your love, boy
You're doing me so harm
I knew that you would never leave me
Wasted my time, No!
Won't do that no more
I knew that you would never leave me

I can't believe that I thought
I saw your ghost
I've been losing sleep
And my laundry I forgot
I can stay in bed all I want

'cause I got you and your love boy,
You're doing me no harm
I knew that you would never leave me
Wasted my time, No!
Won't do that no more
I knew that you would never leave me
