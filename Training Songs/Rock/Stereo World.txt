Staring at the ideal world
The bubble begins to break
Gazing at the ceiling cracks
The more the picture fades
It's just that I can't see
When I'm down like this
I just feel the weight
As I try to resist

It doesn't matter when I can dream away
Life in a stereo world
Something happens, I drift away

Floating out of sync again
Reaching for a cloud
