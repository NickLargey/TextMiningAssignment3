Back from the crowd stood I
As you moved up to the stage
Catching the singer's eye
Looking older than your age
Then I couldn't help thinking and remember when
You hated rock and roll
I'm the loser

[Chorus:]
You're the liar, liar
Rock and roller
You're the liar, liar
Star struck strummer
You're the liar, liar, ohhhh

Taking my heart each day
When you say you do no harm
How can I feel that way
With those strange men on your arm
Cause I do remember when your head was clear
And you didn't read those looks
I'm the loser

[Chorus]
And I couldn't help seeing when your friends arrived
They weren't sniffing from a cold
I'm the loser
Liar, liar, liar, liar...

And I recall that overhearing someone say
You're a working girl as well
I'm the loser again

[Chorus]
You're the liar, liar, liar...
