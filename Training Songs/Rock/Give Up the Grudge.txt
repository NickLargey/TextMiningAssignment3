Don't make me listen to the stupid broken record again 
The needle's skipping and repeating never reaching the end 
You're bitching and complaining like you've got it so tough 
I'm sick of all your crying will you ever shut up? 

So keep bleeding your fake blood 
'Till no even sees it 
If that's the best you can make out 
At least act like you mean it 

[Chorus]
Give up the grudge 
Shut your fucking mouth 
Why you gotta judge everybody but yourself 
Take a look around you 
There ain't nobody home 
I may be a loser but at least I'm not alone 

Your Mercedes won't start 
Now that's a crying shame 
I guess 90K a year buys nothing but complaint 
The people in the neighborhood think that I'm a threat 
While their boss gets richer 
They get deeper in debt 

So keep bleeding your fake blood 
'Till no even sees it 
If that's the best you can make out 
At least act like you mean it 

[Chorus]
