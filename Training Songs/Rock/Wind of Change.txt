The sweetest fragrance, it brings a wind of change
I feel it's now or die
I have itchy fingers and butterflies a strange
You know that I live a lie

Take me away, take me away, faking my way through
Take me away, take me away, faking my way through

Sapphires aren't enough to buy me happiness
Diamonds don?t demand me, they?re just for looking
Love comes close to wrecking all you have to give
God knows, there's so much to give

Take me away, take me away, faking my way through
Take me away, take me away, faking my way through

La da da da, like I do
La da da da, cause all I do is for you
And all I do is for you, you, and you, and you

La da da da da da da
