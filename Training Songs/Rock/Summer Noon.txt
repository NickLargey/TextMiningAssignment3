Summer noon I can always stay
To radiate what the cello can't play
She spoke to me and provoked my band
And I broke in two in the heat of her hand

Like a lioness or a coyote
At a pink beating heart in the balcony
I followed the finger to the creature's gate
In the hubbub where the pitiful congregate

I thought there was a note I could not hear
So I floated to the whisper up against my ear
Afterwards, I found my face in the trash
Really at the core of it, it wasn't so bad

Never leave your mother's womb
Unless you wanna see how hard a broken heart can swoon
Unless you wanna see how hard a broken heart can swoon
