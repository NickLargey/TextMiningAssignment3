Well the road is rocky but it won't be rocky long
Ah, this old road is rocky but it won't be rocky long
Well, another man got my baby and gone

Well, I got the blues, I'm wearing the soles right outta my shoes
Aw, I got the blues, I'm wearing the soles right outta my shoes
My baby ran away and left me with the doggone blues
Ah, go home, yeah

Well, the road is rocky but it won't be rocky long, honey
This old road is rocky, won't be rocky
Well, another man got my baby and gone

Aw, you're gonna lap up this-a water till the old-old well runs dry, yeah
You're gonna lap up this-a water till the old-old well runs dry
Well, you never miss your baby till she says goodbye

Aw, this road is rocky but it won't be rocky long, honey
This old road is rocky but it won't be rocky long
Well, another man stole my baby and gone, let's go

You're gonna lap up all the water till the old-old well runs dry
Aw, you're gonna lap up all this-a water till the old-old well runs dry, yeah
You never miss your baby till she says goodbye
