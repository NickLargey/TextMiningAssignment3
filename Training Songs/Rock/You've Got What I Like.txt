Your smile can make the darkness turn to light
Your eyes make gold & silver not so bright
Your hair's as soft as a summer night
You've got what I like

You say the things I always wanted to
You walk just like an angel out of the blue
& when you hold me, my life starts anew
You've got what I like

(x2):
You've got the kind of lips I long to kiss
& when we go on dates now, endless bliss
You make a desert island come to life
You make the whole wide world seem free from strife
You are the one I'm gonna make my wife
You've got what I like
You've got what I like
You've got what I like
