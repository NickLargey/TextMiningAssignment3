Oh no
We've been had again

we had a seed
A beautiful seed
It was planted by thieves
We never saw leaves
Dropped on a soil
A beautiful soil
But they weren't wearing boots
We never grew roots

oh no 
We've been had again
Oh no 
We've been had again

beauty was found
And vanity lost
But the beauty was dead
Before we saw frost
Well fools never learn
That innocent burn
But we didn't expect 
What we couldn't detect

oh no
We've been had again
Oh no
We've been had again

I'm on borders
The second thoughts are always wisest
And everybody's wiser than anyone
But then again we could have been 
Regretfully yours...

oh no 
We've been had again
Oh no
We've been had again

we had a seed
A beautiful seed
