[Chorus]
He's a mouse in a maze
With its so many ways
But there's only one way to get out
He's a mouse in a maze
With its so many ways
But there's only one way to get out
Ever nearing eyes
Watch him as he tries
To correct that one same mistake
It souldn't take long
Oh, where did he go wrong
He's tried so hard it must be in his fate
For everybody else
It's quick they need no help
Why must it take him so long
He's been this way before
Stares at the final door
The one he's missed
Each time he's been around, around
With plenty of advice
From all the other mice
Sets out and hopes he's got it straight
His audience will grow
As long as he is slow
They love to watch another man's mistakes
As more of them arrive
His path is more disguised
Confusion seems to cloud his every thought
But it's been this way before
Stares at the final door
The one he's missed
Each time he's been around, around
[Repeat Chorus]
[Repeat Chorus]
Ever nearing eyes
Watch him as he tries
To correct that one same mistake
It shouldn't take long
Oh, where did he go wrong
He's tried so hard it must be in his fate
For everybody else
It's quick they need no help
Why must it take him so long
But he's been this way before
Stares at the final door
The one he's missed
Each time he's been around, around
[Repeat Chorus]
