I love you so much, but you're leaving today
Somehow we've lost touch -- I can't make you stay
You say I'll get by, but it's my head on the block
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.

What did I do wrong, tell me what was my crime
I've loved you so long, now my neck's on the line
You pass judgement on me while I stand in the dock
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.

When we were living in the city of a million dreams
You were telling me that love is never what it seems
Yeah, you walked into my life and now I must surrender.

So you go with him and say I'm to blame
I know I can't win while you feel no shame
For every vow that you break and every word that you mock
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.

When we were living in the city of a million dreams
You were telling me that love is never what it seems
Yeah, you walked into my life and now I must surrender.

God holds out His hand, why suffer the gloom
Of a renegade heart in some lonely room
Our lives slip away with each tick of the clock
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.
