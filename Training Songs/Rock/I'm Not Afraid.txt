I'm afraid of growing old
I'm afraid of staying young and running out of fun
I'm afraid of photographs of mom and dad when they were young

I'm afraid of spening my life 
Waiting for a day that may never come
I'm afraid of earthquakes huirricanes and other acts of god

I'm afraid of having kids
I'm afraid there'll be no world for them to live
I'm afraid of pleasing all the people all the time

Im afraid of jeaslousy cupidity
And all words at end in "ee"
Im afraid of men with bombs who theink they're god

But I'm not afraid I'm not afraid I'm not afraid of you
I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid I'm not afraid I'm not afraid of you
I'm not afraid I'm not afraid

I'm afraid of driving over 65
I'm afraid of flying in the sky
I'm afraid of getting out of bed with nowhere to put my head

I'm afraid of multiple choice
When a and b and c and d are true
I'm afraid of not being afraid

You're a constant in life's stream of variables
As sure as the sun and the moon
You're a certain in this world of changeables
You are you
Snd that's the only thing I know that's true

Only thing
Only thing I know that's true

But I'm not afraid Im not afraid I'm not afraid of you
I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid I'm not afraid I'm not afraid of you
I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
