It's been many years
So much has changed
It's not the same

I'm so full of pain
By the things that I've seen
But who could I blame

See, the road that were on
Never changes
People turn their heads
And run from the truth
Is there any hope at all

[Chorus]
Sitting here watching the world
Falling apart oh, what can we do
Standing in the shadows of lies
And deceivers, when does it end

Promises made by people
We trust, are all in vain
The things that we're told,
The lives that are lost
It seems insane

See, the road that were on
Never changes
People turn their heads
And run from the truth
Is there any hope at all

And the news we get
It's certain they're pro-gender
And the talking heads
Just read another screen
Is there any hope at all

[Chorus]

It's just a matter of time (it's just a matter of time)
There's nothing left for us to say (nothing left to say)
In a world so unkind (in a world so unkind)
Reach out your hands
Let's try to change their hearts

Is there any hope at all?

[Chorus: x2]
