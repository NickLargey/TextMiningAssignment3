Somebody cry, somebody cry, somebody cry
Well, somebody try, somebody try, somebody try
Something quick
Did you look back, did you look back, don't you look back
Well, somebody cry, somebody cry, somebody cry
Well, I can't see why or what for
What for, what for?

Break it up
Boy, stupid boy
Don't sit at the table
'Till you're able to

Toy, broken toy
Shout, shout, you're inside out if you don't know

Electric co. (Electric co.)
If you don't know Electric co.
Electric co.

Red, running red
You'll play for real
The toy could feel
A hole in your head
You go in shock
You're spoon-fed

If you don't know Electric co.
If you don't know Electric co.

Break it up
Div it up

If you don't know Electric co.
If you don't know Electric co.
If you don't know Electric co.
If you don't know Electric co.
