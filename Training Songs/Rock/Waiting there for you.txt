Did they let you go?
Or are you running still from them?
Are you just mesmerized by the way it is?

Did you see your dream
Fade before your eyes?
Or are you still reaching out?

And can you hear me scream?
Can you hear me scream?
Hear me scream?

I'm waiting there for you
I'm waiting there for you
But there's nothing I can do
There's nothing I can do

Did you see my face
Stuck here in the crowd?
Could you see me cry
When you turned away?

And did you see the tears
Rolling down my face?
Could you feel my pain

And did you hear me scream?
Did you hear me scream?
Hear me scream

I'm waiting there for you
I'm waiting there for you
But there's nothing I can do
There's nothing I can do

I'm waiting there for you
I'm waiting there for you
But there's nothing I can do
There's nothing I can do
