My clothes don't fit me and my friends don't like me
And this furniture is giving me a rash
I don't have credit and I know I'll never get it
And I'm pretty sure I'll end up all alone

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna be drunk and flat broke
I'm gonna be tired, old and bitter
And really messed up

Cause this behavior is gonna get me nowhere (x4)
But straight to hell, oh yeah
Straight to hell

Girls wont ride me and the boys wont fight me so my
Self esteem has hit an all time low
The drugs don't thrill me and my life's about to kill me
And I'm pretty sure I'll end up all alone

[Chorus:]

Cos this behavior is gonna get me nowhere (x4)
But straight to hell, oh yeah
Straight to hell, oh yeah
Straight to hell

The cops wont arrest me and the hookers wont undress me
And my manager is tired of my voice
The servants wont serve me and the doctors wont cure me
And my producer calls my music a bunch of noise

[Chorus]

Cause this behavior is gonna get me nowhere (x4)
But straight to hell, oh yeah
Straight to hell, oh yeah
Straight to hell, oh yeah
Straight to hell
Straight to hell

I'm gonna be drunk, and slight broke
I'm gonna be tired old and bitter, and really messed up

Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere, but straight to hell
Oh yeah, straight to hell
Oh yeah, straight to hell
Oh yeah, straight to hell
Straight to hell
