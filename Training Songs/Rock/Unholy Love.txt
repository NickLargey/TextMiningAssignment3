You make it so easy
When you're making it rough
You won't make no promises
But you can't get enough

I feel like I'm standing
In the headlight beam
You come on like thunder
I know what this means

[Chorus]
It's unholy love
Oh can't you see
This unholy love
You know is killing me

The sting of confusion
Then a kiss from your lips
You don't make it painless
And you don't make it quick

I hold on forever
'Till I feel the sweet rush start
Then you're holding me closer
While you're breaking my heart

[Chorus]

I feel like I'm standing
In the headlight beam
You come on like thunder
I know what this means

It's unholy love
