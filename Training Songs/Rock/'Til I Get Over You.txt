Every time I feel alone
I can blame it on you
And I do, oh
You've got me like a loaded gun
Golden sun and sky so blue
We both know that we want it
But we both know you left me no choice

[Chorus]
(chaque fois que tu ton va)
You just bring me down
(je pretend que tu fais bien)
So I'm counting my tears 'til I get over you

Sometimes I watch the world go by
I wonder what it's like
To wake up every single day
Smile on your face
You never tried
We both know we can't change it
But we both know we'll just have to face it

[Chorus]

If only I could give you up
But would I want to let you off of this soapbox baby?
We both know that we want it
But we both know you left me no choice

[Chorus]

(chaque fois que tu ton va)
(je pretend que tu fais bien)

We both know that I'm not over you
I'm not over you
