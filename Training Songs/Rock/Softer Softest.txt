I tell you everything
And I hope that you won't tell on me 
And I'd give you anything
And I know that you won't tell on me 
Pee-girl gets the belt
It old milk makes me mind
And all your milk is so sour, and I can only cry 
And I can only cower, and I can only cry
You have all the power 

I've got a blister from touching everything I see 
The abyss opens up, it steals everything from me 
Pee-girl gets the belt
The old milk makes me mind 
Your milk is so sick, your milk has a dye 
Your milk has so dick, your milk has a dye 
Your milk has so dick

Burn the witch, the witch is dead 
Burn the witch
Just bring me back her head 
Pee-girl gets the belt
The old milk makes me mind 
Your milk is so mean
Your milk turns to mine
Your milk turns to cream
Your milk turns to mine
Your milk turns to cream
Your milk turns to cry
Your milk turns to cream
Your milk turns to cry
Your milk turns to cream
