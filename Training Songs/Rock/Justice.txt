I want justice I want you overthrown
I want justice
I want to stand alone

So take all you can from an open hand
The hope of the dying
To save your disease
You're an empty breed
Your love of this lifetime

So you're somebody who brags about their innocence
While playing on the ignorant storm
Now I'm just here to criticize the lies, the lies, the lies

I want justice I want you overthrown

I want courage I want to stand alone
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
I want your everything and I want your head

So cry if you feel
That the tears you shed will make you feel better
See I'm just critical of living like a criminal
While you become a royalty hiding
I wonder how you'll justify the lies, the lies, the lies

I want justice I want you overthrown
I want courage I want to stand alone
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
I want your everything and I want your head

So bury all the evidence
Disguise yourself plead innocent
One penalty, one consequence is sure
Your jury they will recognize the lies, the lies, the lies, the lies

I want justice I want you overthrown 
I want courage
I want to stand alone
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
I want your everything and I want your head

I want justice I want you overthrown
I want courage I want to stand alone
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
I want your everything and I want you dead

I want justice I want justice
Give me justice and I want you dead
