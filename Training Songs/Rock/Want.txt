I don't want to make it rain
I just want to make it simple
I don't want to see the light
I just want to see the flashlight
I don't want to know the answers

To any of your questions
I don't want, no I really don't want
To be John Lennon or Leonard Cohen
I just want to be my Dad

With a slight sprinkling of my mother
And work at the family store
And take orders from the counter
I don't want to know the answers
To any of your question

I don't want, no I really don't want
To be John Lithgow or Jane Curtin
But I'll settle for love
Yeah I'll settle for love

Before I reached the gate
I realized I had packed my passport
Before security I realized
I had one more bag left
I just want to know

If something's coming for to get me
Tell me, will you make me sad or happy
And will you settle for love
Will you settle for love
