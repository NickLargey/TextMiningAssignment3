I've been losin' sleep
I've been keepin' myself awake
I've been wandering the streets
For days and days and days

Oh if I'm row to row
Back to back, lover to lover
And black to red, but I believe
I believe

There's no salvation for me now
No space among the clouds
And I've seen I'm heading down
That's alright, that's alright
That's alright, that's alright

And I've been taking chances
I've been setting myself up for the fall
And I've been keeping secrets
From my heart and from my soul

Going from row to row
Back to back
Lover to lover
Black to red

But I believe, I believe
There's no salvation for me now
No space among the clouds
And I've feel that I'm heading down
But that's alright

That's alright
That's alright
That's alright

Row to row, back to back
And lover to lover
And black to red
And row to row, back to back
And lover to lover

No space among the clouds
And I feel I'm heading down
But that's alright

That's alright
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright

Row to row, back to back
And lover to lover
And black to red
And row to row, back to back

Lover to lover, to lover to lover 
To lover to lover, to lover to lover
To lover to lover, to lover to lover

No salvation for me now
No salvation for me now
No salvation for me now
No salvation for me now
