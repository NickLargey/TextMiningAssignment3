I'm going into Tow Law
For what I need
Chain for the ripsaw
Killer for the weed
The dog's at the back door
Leave him be
Don't feed him Jack
And don't wait up for me

Going into Tow Law
To fuel my fire
Shells for the twelve
And razor wire
The dog's at the back door
Leave him be
Don't do Jack
And don't wait up for me

So bad so bad
So bad so bad

I'm going into Tow Law
To have my fun
Don't get me wrong
You were the only one
Behind my back Lord
You made a fool of me
Don't do Jack
And don't wait up for me

So bad so bad
So bad so bad
