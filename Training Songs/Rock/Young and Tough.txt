Here she comes like a heart attack
The way she looks could kill ya, all dressed in black
With her lips on fire and a wild hair
She knows the boys are looking but she don't care

She's way too smart for an empty lie
Gotta let her know, she's my kind

She's young and tough
(She's young)
She's got the moves, she's got the stuff
She's young and tough
(So young)
You bet I want it

Some like to talk, some fantasize
They call her cheap and easy but that's a lie
She's got class, got style
She got on me by a city mile

She's way too fine for an empty lie
Gotta let her know, she's my kind

She's young and tough
(She's young)
She's got the moves, she's got the stuff
She's young and tough
(So young)
You bet I want it

Here she comes like a heart attack
The way she looks could kill ya, all dressed in black
With her lips on fire and a wild hair
She knows the boys are looking but she don't care

She's way too fine for an empty lie
Gotta let her know, she's my kind

She's young and tough
(She's young)
She's got the moves, she's got the stuff
She's young and tough
(So young)
Baby, baby, baby, do your stuff

So young, young and so tough
(So young)
You've got the moves, you've got the stuff
Well, she's young so young and tough
(She's young)
Baby, baby, baby, do your stuff

You're so young, young and so tough
(So young)
You've got the moves
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Young and young
You bet I want it

I told you I was bad, woman
