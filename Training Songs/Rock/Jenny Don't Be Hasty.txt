You said you'd marry me if I was twenty three
But I'm one that you can't see if I'm only eighteen
Tell me who makes these rules
Obviously not you
Who are you answering to?

Oh, Jenny don't be hasty
No, don't treat me like a baby
Let me take you where you'll let me
Because leaving just upsets me

And I'll be around again to see these other men
That are more adequate in the age department
And I did not think you cared
There'd be no problems here
But now you're looking at me like you're disgusted
Then I'm definitely waiting for you to smile and change your mind
Then I'll say I'm sorry and I'll wrap my arms 'round your body
I really hope that you forgive in a hurry
And don't just ask me to leave

Oh, Jenny don't be hasty
No, don't treat me like a baby
Let me take you where you'll let me
Because leaving just upsets me

Oh, Jenny you are crazy
First I'm perfect, then I'm lazy
And I was calling you my baby
And all the times that you just left me
And it kills me so

Oh, Jenny don't be hasty
No, don't treat me like a baby
Let me take you where you'll let me
Because leaving just upsets me

Oh, Jenny you are crazy
First I'm perfect, then I'm lazy
And I was calling you my baby
And all the times that you just left me
And it kills me, yeah, oh yeah

You said you'd marry me if I was twenty three
But I'm one that you can't see if I'm only eighteen
