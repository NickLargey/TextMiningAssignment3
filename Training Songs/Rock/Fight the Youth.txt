And now another story of stolen faith and tragic glory
They claim to be your friends but all the while they taunt you with lies
They tell you what to think and how to face the world around you
You never question what you know inside is lax and untrue

But take a look around
We`re not running anymore
We`re in the positive
But we`re ready for the war... For the war

Fight the Youth
The Youth with poisoned minds
Ignite the truth
Restore sight to these blind
Fight the youth
The youth with poisoned minds
And if they suffer it`s no fault but their own

And every time I see the hatred that engulfs these children
It makes me wonder if the quest for peace will someday subside
I`m not afraid to wage the hopeless battles I must fight
For I could never lose, I know my cause shines in the light

Take a look around
We`re not hiding anymore
Your weapon`s cowardice
And we won`t take it anymore... Anymore
Fight the Youth
The Youth with poisoned minds
Ignite the truth
Restore sight to these blind
Fight the youth
The youth with poisoned minds
And if they suffer it`s no fault but their own

And all the feelings of a generation fed with anger
Make all the choices for a future where all nightmares come true
I choose to fight for youth, to fight for truth, to fight for justice
I choose to heal the wounds of sacrifice made by the children
