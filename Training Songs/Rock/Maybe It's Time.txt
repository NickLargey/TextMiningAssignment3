All the scars, all the lines
On my face they show the times
I've abandoned my own life
I can't breathe, I can't eat
So I just drink myself to sleep
And embrace this morbid price

But maybe it's time to heal, maybe it's time to try
Maybe it's time to deal with all the pieces in my life
Maybe I'll sober up, maybe before I die
Maybe I'll finally deal with all the wreckage in my life

I'm older now, I'm breaking down
My regrets they turn to dust
And soon enough they'll blow away
When I was young, I was dumb
I was never strong enough
I wish I had the guts to say

Maybe it's time to heal, maybe it's time to try
Maybe it's time to deal with all the pieces in my life
Maybe I'll sober up, maybe before I die
Maybe I'll finally deal with all the wreckage in my life

And this was self-inflicted
Yeah I was on a mission
To ruin everything in life
But now I'm so damn ready
Just take my hand and steady
And we will make it through the night

Maybe it's time to heal, maybe it's time to try
Maybe it's time to deal with all the pieces in my life
Maybe I'll sober up, maybe before I die
Maybe I'll finally deal with all the wreckage in my life

Maybe it's time
Maybe it's time
Maybe it's time
