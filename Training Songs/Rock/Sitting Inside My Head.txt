I walk around this town 
As buildings close and windows are boarded
I think about you

When I hear a door slam in the wind 
And the glass on the mat says welcome
I think about you

Sitting inside my head,
Laughing at what I said
Come on baby 
Let's have another toast
You might think I'm dense, 
Laughing at my expense
Let's fill the cup 
let's wash away the ghost

In this ghost town where we live
There's a wanted poster of you on every corner
She keeps asking me 'who's that' and 'what's her name?'
But I choke on every letter, 
As the glass flies off the table
I keep telling her 
I ain't the one to blame

Sitting inside my head, 
Laughing at what I said
Come on baby 
Let's have another toast
You might think I'm dense, 
Laughing at my expense
Let's fill the cup
Let's wash away the ghost

I left when I was gone,
I didn't feel a thing
I didn't think you'd haunt me this long after
But the buildings crumble down, 
As I run from the town
I hear you breathe 
And I listen to your laughter

Sitting inside my head,
Laughing at what I said
Come on baby let's have another toast
You might think I'm dense, 
laughing at my expense
Let's fill the cup 
Let's wash away the ghost

I walk around this town
As buildings close and windows are boarded
I think about you
When I hear a door slam in the wind
And the glass on the mat that says Welcome
I think about you

I think about you (repeat many times)
