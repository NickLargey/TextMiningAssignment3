See you on rooftops
with blue jeans and stars in your hair

Drew you in lamplight
you built you somewhere in my heart

I bought you a kite now,
you fly when the moon is so high

Caught on your highwire
your falling oh so fast, oh so fast

Caught in the moment
I watch you play with the stars

Lost in the clouds, yeah
your kite takes you higher than most

Caught on your highwire
your falling oh so fast, oh so fast

Time on your own, girl
is time, on your own

Time on your own, girl
is time, on your own

But still you fly
But still you fly
But still you fly
