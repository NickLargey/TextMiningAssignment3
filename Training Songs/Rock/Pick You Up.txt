(Bernhard Fanning)
When you are set
To throw in your hand
When you are far from home
When what you believe
Is buried in your hands
When you feel outgrown
I'll be the one to pick you up again
When you decide you've had enough of it
I'll be the one
I'll be the one
When your speech is slow
When your eyes are closed
When you feel betrayed
When your heart is frayed
When your feet are cold
When your sights are low
I'll be the one to pick you up again
When you decide you've had enough of it
I'll be the one
I'll be the one
