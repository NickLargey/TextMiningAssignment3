You been around enough to know
That if I wanna leave you better let me go
Because I take full advantage
Of every man I meet
I get away almost every day
With what the girls call
What the girls call
What the girls call
The girls call murder

You been around enough to see
That if you think you're it 
You better check with me
Because I take full advantage
Of every man I meet
I get away almost every day
With what the girls call
What the girls call
What the girls call, 
The girls call murder
