I've got my suitcase in my hand
I walk alone a lonely man
You lie to me but I love you still
So I'm on my way to heartbreak hill
If my friends should ask on me
They know just where I'm gonna be
You lie to me now I had my thrill
So I'm on my way to heartbreak hill
I guess I'll go and join the many
Cause I know there's a plenty
Million hearts all alone
And it call heartbreak hill their home
Baby in time I'll get by
Then I'll learn not to cry
You lie to me but I love you still
So I'm on my way to heartbreak hill

I guess I'll go join the plenty
Cause I know there's a million
Million hearts all alone
And they call heartbreak hill their home
Baby in time I'll get by
Then I'll learn not to cry
You lie to me but I love you still
So I'm on my way to heartbreak hill
