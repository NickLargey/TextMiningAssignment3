I have my heroes , but no one knows their names
They've never asked for recognition, They've never wanted fame
My granddad fought the second World War 
When he was just eighteen
He spent four months as a prisoner 
To give me the American dream
In my eyes he's everything, all I hope to be.
And I won't forget that day , he said he was proud of me

So I take that one day and figure out what I did right
I'll do it the same way for the rest of my life
Yeah I'll take that one day and figure out what I did right
I'll do it the same way for the rest of my life, what I did right

I have my good friends, they have a place inside my heart
But my best friend, well she holds the 
biggest part.
Well, she finds the good in me 
And she knows just what it takes
And she loves the man in me 
Through all of my mistakes.
In my eyes she's everything, everything to me.
And I won't forget that day she said you're all I need.
You're all I need.  

So I take that one day and figure out what I did right
I'll do it the same way for the rest of my life
Yeah I'll take that one day and figure out what I did right
I'll do it the same way for the rest of my life, what I did right

And as I hold my newborn baby
To give her some comfort while she cries
In this moment I feel helpless
Till she looks into my eyes,
Her tears subside.

I'll take this one day
And figure out what I did right,
I'll do it the same way
For the rest of my life.

Yeah I'll take this one day
and figure out what I did right.
I'll do it the same way
For the rest of my life.

Yeah I'll take this one day 
And figure out what I did right.
I'll do it the same way
For the rest of my life

I'll take this one day
And figure out what I did right
I'll do it the same way
For the rest of my life
