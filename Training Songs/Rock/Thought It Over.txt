Well give me some room
From those who don't have a clue
I see them sinking the common clay
I'm like, a black dove looking down from above
See you swimming in the mess you made

And if somebody is a threat to me
They're going to have to move over!

Before you get too deep
Yeah when you were lying in your bed to sleep
You should have thought it over
Yeah, you should have thought it over
Yeah, you should have thought it over
Should have thought it over

Tell me your name,
Who takes my money away
Before I even get a chance to eat
Well, where is the progress? 
And where is the logic?
On the level with the common thief

And if somebody on the top is a crook
They're going to have to move over!
Well he takes my money away
Yeah, when I am working for minimum wage
I'm gonna think it over

And if somebody's sitting in my seat
They're going to have to move over
Before you let it get too deep
Yeah, when you're lying in your bed to sleep
You should have thought it over
Yeah, you should have thought it over
Yeah, you should have thought it over
Yeah, you should have thought it over
