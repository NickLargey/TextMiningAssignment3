Our father was a union man some day I'll be one too.
The bosses fired daddy what's our family gonna do?
Come all you good workers good news to you
I'll tell of how the good old union has come in here to dwell.

[Chorus]
Which side are you on?
Which side are you on?

My daddy was miner and I'm a miner's son
And I'll stick with the union 'til every battles done.

They say in Harlan County there are no neutrals there
You'll either be a union man or a thug for J.H. Blair

Oh workers can you stand it?
Oh tell me how you can will you be a lousy scab or will you be a man?
Don't scab for the bosses don't listen to their lies
Us poor folks haven't got a chance unless we organize
