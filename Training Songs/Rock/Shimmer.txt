You have always been so kind to me.
Mere gratitude is not enough.
But if there's anything that I can do or say
To take that pressure off,
You know I'll do it,
Or at least I'll try.
I'm used to living off-the-cuff.

Shimmer!
It's a way of life,
When no other life is true.
Shimmer!
That's the only word,
When no other word will do.
Shimmer!

Nice new features on your automobile;
Maybe I could get a lift uptown?
That's some crazy hat that you've got on today.
You really put my feet back on the ground.
You know talking ain't my speciality,
Forgive me if I'm just going 'round.

Shimmer!
It's a way of life,
When no other life is true.
Shimmer!
That's the only word,
When no other word will do.
Shimmer!
It's a way of life,
When no other life is true.
Shimmer!
That's the only word,
When no other word will do.

You know you have my affections,
And my deepest respect.
I'm sorry, honey, if sometimes I just show
Too much neglect.

Shimmer!
Shimmer!
It's a way of life,
When no other life is true.
Shimmer!
That's the only word,
When no other word will do.
