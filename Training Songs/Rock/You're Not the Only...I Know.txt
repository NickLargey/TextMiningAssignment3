I should go
Even though
I've forgiven all the lies
That you told
Scared to have you back again
People just don't change
After all i know if i pretend
I'd be lying just the same

Now you're wondering why
Things did not turn out right
Got to change your style
You're not the only i know
Long ago
Should have known
You were young and scared to be
On your own
Tried to luck on me again
Fooled me for a while
I can see the games we played before
And it only makes me smile
