I get my kicks from rock and roll
A twelve bar boogie gonna bless my soul
want to dance to that rhythm
Get down to that rockin' beat
I don't want to play no heavy jazz
With high class music
And its stuffed shirt nights
'Cause I want to be a rock 'n roll star
And make my money out of playing' guitar

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a rock and roller
I'm gonna rock it, gonna roll all over
I'm gonna shake it to the midnight stroller,
And rock the night away

I don't want to play no Memphis soul
I don't want funk, just rock and roll
Gonna dance to the rhythm get down to that rockin' beat
Make my name in the headline news
There I'm busted singin' the blues
I must find myself a rock 'n roll band,
I'll play my music just as fast as I can

[Chorus]

Okay people,
Get your rockin' shoes on
Stroll us with the
Rock and roller, 
Rock and roller
yes I'm a rock and roller
Yes I'm a rock and roller

[Chorus]
