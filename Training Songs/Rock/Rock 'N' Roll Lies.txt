There's too much silence in her night
She calls herself an angel, and she comes to town, and that's
(L-O-N-D-O-N)
Yeah, just so she can fall
(L-O-N-D-O-N)
There's something about the way she walks, you know
It suits the city streets so well and
Nobody's heard her band yet, and no one will

And here it comes now, there's nothing to say
There it goes again but no-one cares anyway
What's in your eyes, your rock'n'roll eyes
'Cause it's all just the lies, just the rock'n'roll lies

You see that man, he calls out for a drink, but you're all
You're all tied up in your backstage lines
And you, you just can't move a muscle

Six in the morning so you rise and you fall, you've got to
You've got to grab what you can
And your blue-blood man, baby, he's a winner, yeah
What a gunslinger!

Oh now, here he comes yeah, there's nothing to say
He must be someone to someone, but no-one cares anyway
He sees your eyes, your rock'n'roll eyes
We know it's all just lies, just the rock'n'roll lies
Oh!

But oh baby, when you say my name, I get such a thrill inside
She says there's something in the way that I look at her
I guess it's right here in my eyes
I can't lie

And here it comes now, there's nothing to say
Here it comes now, but no-one cares anyway
He sees your eyes, your rock'n'roll eyes
Just a bit like mine
Yeah, rock'n'roll eyes

It's just the lies, it's just the rock'n'roll lies
Oh it's just the lies, it's just the rock'n'roll lies
Oh
Yes it is, oh, yes it is
Lies and the lies and the lies and the lies
