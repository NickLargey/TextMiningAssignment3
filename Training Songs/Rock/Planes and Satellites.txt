Airplanes and satellites
light up the evening sky
so bright the stars don't gotta shine
airplanes and satellites

When I was a boy
You know my momma would say to me
The world's a mystery, of darkness and light

When I was a kid
I was sent off to inner space
To escape the evil place, I was livin' in
Well, well

When I was a long-hair
I would close my eyes at night
Filled with imaginary light, with the moon and stars
yeah, yeah

But I remember
Livin' in the street 
And then my heart just drifts away, into the night
Well, well, well

In the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky
They got the planes and satellites
Yeah, airplanes and satellites
Whoa, whoa

You know my momma said, boy
She said, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby boy
You're the one that's safe?
You know that evil ain't goin' away
It ain't goin' away, no, no

But I look up in the sky, yeah yeah
It ain't flooded with the stars
Pretty lights are flying across
Shinin' on me yeah yeah

When I was a boy
I remember livin' in the streets
I didn't have enough to eat
It was a misery, yeah.

But I could wake up
And look up in the sky
Hoping that God's light
Would shine on me, yeah yeah
