Two lovers stop for kisses on a wall
She asked him, "Never leave me"
He tells her that he won't

But the boy is young and foolish and knows it all
And he puts it about when he goes out
Stories they get told
And stories, yeah stories get told

It's in his nature, his misbehavior and misdemeanors
The boy ain't no genius, he keeps her on her toes
It's in his nature, his misbehavior, and misdemeanors
The boy ain't no genius, he keeps her on her toes

And these lovers trip
And stumble down the road
And on the grass they fumble round
Like a flower their love grows

And by the flower grows a weed
And not the kind you smoke
It raises up its ugly head
Our lovers are in a choke hold
Two lovers, two lovers in a hold

It's in his nature, his misbehavior and misdemeanors
The boy ain't no genius, he keeps her on her toes
It's in his nature, his misbehavior and misdemeanors
The boy ain't no genius, he just keeps her on her toes

And I bet a bad thought don't cross her mind
And if it does, she just discards it 'till it's gone away
I bet of all of her, she sees, she feels
And there's somewhere that she stores it 'till it's gone away
'Till it's gone away, 'till it's gone away

And it's in his nature, his misbehavior and misdemeanors
The boy ain't no genius, he keeps her on her toes
It's in his nature, his misbehavior and misdemeanors
The boy ain't no genius, he keeps her on her toes

It's in his nature, his misbehavior and misdemeanors
The boy ain't no genius, he keeps her on her toes
It's in his nature, his misbehavior and misdemeanors
The boy ain't no genius, he keeps her on her toes

On her toes
Said the boy ain't no genius but he keeps her on her toes

Two lovers stop for kisses on a wall
She asked him, "Never leave me"
He tells her that he won't
