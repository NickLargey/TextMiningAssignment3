I've got memories
I keep them away from me
They won't behave
Won't be what I want them to be

I've seen it all and it's all done
I've been with everyone and no one

So many squandered moments
So much wasted time
So busy chasing dreams
I left myself behind

I've seen it all and it's all done
I've been with everyone and no one

So this dying slowly
It seemed better than shooting myself
This dying slowly
It seemed better than shooting myself

These worms, darling
They're nibbling away at me
They go at it when I'm sleeping
Won't let me get to my feet

I've seen it all and it's all done
I've been with everyone and no one

So this dying slowly
It seemed better than shooting myself
This dying slowly
It seemed better than shooting -
If I could find the words to explain this feeling
I would shout them out
If I could find out all this, what's inside me
I would shout it out

So this dying slowly
It seemed better than shooting myself
This dying slowly
It seemed better than shouting it out

I make some coffee
Pull on that new pair of pants
I can get so far
The feeling just falls away

I've seen it all and it's all done
I've been with everyone and no one

I'm just tired, baby
I just need to lay down
I'm just tired, darling
I just need to lay down
I'm just tired, baby
I just need to lay down
I'm just tired, darling
I just need to lay down
I'm just tired, darling
