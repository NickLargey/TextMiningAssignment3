I'm not so sure 
I still want more of this 
My mind's not quite 
Behaving, I don't know 
I'm not feeling like I'm told I should (???) 

 
  
 

This is my life 
Welcome to me tonight 
I don't feel too 
Glad to be here for sure 
I'm not feeling anymore at all 

This is my head 
This is my face 
It's all my fault 
This is my place 
I don't really think I wanna stay
