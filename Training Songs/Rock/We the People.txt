Sitting in the shelter
Head between your knees
Can't afford the struggle
Can't afford to sleep

Got my gas mask on
Hey I'm laughing like there's no tomorrow
All care no responsibility is take for the
Heap of garbage on the side of the road

Got my back door covered but the beast is on the loose again.
We the people who live next door
We are the ones you can feel through the floor
Back in the good old days

You paid a penny to the preacher
A pound of flesh to keep the planet alive
Pass around the pie
We're going to suck on this supper together

We got religion
We got the guns
We got the power to put out the sun
Come on everybody

Don't you know that you can dream forever
We the people who live next door
We are the ones you can feel through the floor
We got the power

But oh we are weak
We are brave in our silence
But we are to scared to seek
We will carry the impossible load

While our leaders weep by the side of the road
We've been dreaming so long
We've been taken so far from where we belong
We the people

We the people who live next door
We are the ones you can feel thought the floor
We are powerful
But oh we are weak

We are brave in our silence
But we are to scared to seek
We will carry the impossible load
While our leaders weep like children on the side of the road
