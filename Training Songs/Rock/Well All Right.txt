Well all right, so I've been foolish.
Well all right, let people know
About the dreams and wishes that you wish
In the night when lights are low.

Well all right, well all right,
You know we live and love with all our might.
Well all right, well all right,
You know our lifetime love will be all right.

Well all right, so I'm not working.
Well all right, let people say
That those foolish kids can't be ready
For the love that comes their way.

Well all right, well all right,
You know we live and love with all our might.
Well all right, well all right,
You know our lifetime love will be all right.

Well all right, so I've been foolish.

Well all right, well all right,

Well all right, well all right,
You know our lifetime love will be all right.
