But everyone said she was a goddess
They've got a rolex
Telling the same time for everyone
But you wouldn't notice
You'd better just come down
Come down
She's a good girl
But no one is giving you the reason
They've got a machine
Making you someone for everyone
But you wouldn't notice
You'd better just come down

If you make her happy
Make her happy with her
Happy with herself

Shall I say it slowly
Make her happy with her
Happy with herself

She's a good girl
An alien make up on a green skin
Holding her breath in
Maybe she's melting
Just like everyone
But you wouldn't notice

You'd better just come down
What will make you feel better
What will make you feel glad
Did you decide that all by yourself
There's no time for moderation

What will make you feel better
What will make you feel better
Through the long nights cover yourself
There' no time for moderation
