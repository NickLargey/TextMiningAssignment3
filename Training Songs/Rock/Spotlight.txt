Get my guitar
Get the car I'm gonna take a little strip out of town
Gotta go do a show
Rock and roll until I'm upside down
(I see the light) I see the light
Hear the crowd
Clappin' loud, they want the show to start
Oh, and now the stage is dark
Mmm, I can feel my heart
Can't you feel your heart

Spotlight, lighting the stage
I gotta go a little crazy tonight
Spotlight, take me away
I'm gonna rock till I feel alright

Here it comes
Feel the drums pound the rhythm of a jungle beat
And all around
Hear the sounds that go up and down the city street
(Play that guitar) Play that guitar
Play it hard
Open up and let it move your soul
Oh, I'm goin' out of control
I'm goin' out of control
Can't you feel it grow

Spotlight, lighting the stage
I gotta go a little crazy tonight
Spotlight, take me away
I'm gonna rock till I feel alright

Spotlight, give me the heat
I'm gonna burn like a star in the sky
Spotlight, I'm gonna explode now
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go
Alright

Spotlight, lighting the stage
I gotta go a little crazy tonight
Spotlight, take me away
I'm gonna rock till I feel alright

Spotlight, give me the heat
I want to burn like a star in the sky
Spotlight, I want to explode now (yeah)
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go
Alright, alright
Alright, alright

(Give it to me)
Spotlight
Feel the drums pound the rhythm of a jungle beat
Spotlight
Can't you feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
Spotlight
