I never wanted it to be this way
Crashing down like the pouring rain
Lying still in my blood-stained clothes
Is this the ending that no one knows
Is this the ending that no one knows
Is this the ending that no one knows

I cried out to heaven when I thought I lost myself
I cried out to heaven when I thought I lost myself

Myself

How can I live if you know
I lost my faith long ago

Ripped and torn from the inside out
Reminded of what I used to doubt
Letting go and I'll fly away
I'll see you all again someday
I'll see you all again someday
I'll see you all again someday

I cried out to heaven when I thought I lost myself
I cried out to heaven when I thought I lost myself

Myself

How can I live if you know
I lost my faith long ago
I could be shamed to let go
Gotta go there, let me know
Let me know

When did I lose my faith
Long ago
When did I lose my faith
I guess I'll never know
When did I lose my faith
Long ago
When did I lose my faith
I guess I'll never know

I never wanted it to be this way
Crashing down like the pouring rain
Lying still in my blood-stained clothes
Is this the ending that no one knows
Is this the ending that no one knows
Is this the ending that no one knows

So take me away
Take me away
(Take me away)
Take me away
So take me away
(Take me away)

How can I live if you know
I lost my faith long ago (How can I live now)
I could be shamed to let go (Is it time to let go)
Gotta go there, let me know
Let me know

I never wanted it to be this way
