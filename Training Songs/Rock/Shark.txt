This afternoon
Your back's not so straight
Your eyes aren't too clear
I could kiss you
For remembering my birthday
Find you on the dock
Out of money out of luck
You should thank me
For remembering your name
You could be very easy

Spin the shotglass
Kiss the bottle
Shark in your brain
Spin the shotglass
Kill the bottle
Shark in your brain
'cause she's warm

This afternoon
Your bite's not so bad
Your bark's not too scary
I could kiss you
For remembering my address
Find you in the dumps
Out of money out of drugs
You should thank me
For offering my mattress
You could be very easy

Spin the shotglass
Kiss the bottle
Shark in your brain
Spin the shotglass
Kill the bottle
Shark in your brain
'cause she's warm

Spin the shotglass
Shoot the bottle
I find angels over drinks
And you're one
