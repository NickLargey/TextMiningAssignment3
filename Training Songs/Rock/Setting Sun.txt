I met a girl
She's from my world
Now she's gone
She had to run

I want to go
Where no one else can know
Leave it all behind
Where no one else can find

Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Ba, na, na, na, na, na, na

Everybody climb in, in the I know go go
Find how much you've won then you feel crowded
What you wanna make it, there I'm anybody
Everybody climb in, so much more

Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Baa

I want to go
Where no one else could know
Leave it all behind
Where no one else can find

She left me here
[Unverified] fear
Everybody know

Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Ba, na, na, na, na, na, na

Everybody climb in, in the I know go go
Find how much you've won then you feel crowded
What you wanna make it, there I'm anybody
Everybody climb in, in the I know go go
You'll be climbing, climbing so much more

Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun

Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun
Just like a setting sun

Just like a setting sun, ahh
Setting sun
Setting sun
Setting sun
Setting sun

We are the Aliens
We are the Aliens
We are the Aliens
We are the Aliens
We are the Aliens
