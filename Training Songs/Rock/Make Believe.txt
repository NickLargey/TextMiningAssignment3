The way that you are
Is that the way that you are
Or are you shooting at the stars
From the gutter?

The things that you see
Are they the things that you can be
Or are you reaching out to me
Because I'm bleeding on your life?

Let's make believe
That we're all in this together
We're all in this together
We're all in this forever
Let's make believe

Tomorrow is a blur
And today I'm getting by
Traveling through the highs
Just the English boy and I

Let's make believe
That we're all in this together
We're all in this together
We're all in this forever

Let's make believe
Let's make believe
Let's make believe

Let's all make believe
Let's all make believe
Let's all make believe

Let's make believe
That we're all in this together
We're all in this together
We're all in this forever
Let's make believe

Let's make believe
Let's make believe
Let's make believe
Let's make believe
Let's make believe

Is that the way that you are?
Is that the way that you are?
Is that the way that you are?
Is that the way that you are
Or is it make believe, make believe, make believe?
