There's a fire beneath my skin
There's a fever that makes me ill
Got a love, a love that kills
I've got twenty-four hours to live, come back

I'm begging you please, come back
Come back
I'm down on my knees, come back
I'm begging you please

I don't know why and I don't understand
How you sold me down the river
I don't know why, I don't understand
How you sold me down the river
Sold me down the river

There's a rose across my chest
Got your name written on it
Love's the drug that I live by
Give me a shot before I die, come back

I'm begging you please, come back
Come back
I'm down on my knees, come back
I'm begging you please

I don't know why, I don't understand
How you sold me down the river
I don't know why, I don't understand
How you sold me down the river
Sold me down the river

Oh yeah, sold me down the river now

Sold me down the river tonight
Hoo-hoo

I've got twenty four hours
I don't know why, I don't understand
How you sold me down the river
Sold me down the river
