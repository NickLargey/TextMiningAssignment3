You say you love me
I don't know, I wonder why
You, yes you say you need me
I don't know, I wonder why
Maybe tomorrow I will know
Maybe tomorrow it will show

You say you need me
I don't know, I wonder why
You could not want to love me
I don't know, I wonder why
Maybe tomorrow I will know
Maybe tomorrow it will show

You say I'm your kind of man
I don't know, I wonder why
That I'll never understand
I don't know I wonder why
Maybe tomorrow I will know
Maybe tomorrow it will show

You say you love me
You say you love me
You say you love me
You say you love me
