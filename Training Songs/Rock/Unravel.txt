You've seen me unraveling
I know the difference this time
You pull me in, pull me out
I'm dissolving
Don't matter what you do wrong
I put your needs before mine
Doesn't really matter what they say
Doesn't really matter what they say

So take what you want from me, take what you want from me
Take what you want from me
And I'll give you all my love, I'll give you everything
Just take what I don't need

I know I've made some mistakes
But I'll be different, you'll see
I give in, tell me how
I keep falling
I'm slipping under
A wave of gold
So carelessly
Doesn't really matter what they say

So take what you want from me, take what you want from me
Take what you want from me
And I'll give you all my love, I'll give you everything
Just take what I don't need

'Cause all you wanna talk about is where you wanna go
And I don't need to think about losing you to know
How it feels, how it feels

So take what you want from me, take what you want from me
Take what you want from me
And I'll give you all my love, I'll give you everything
Just take what I don't need
