I've been lost inside, empty space in my heart
And some things never change, no
How it hurts me and how it's tearin' me apart, 
And it just goes on and on
Can you read my mind, take a good look at my face
Could you take the time, just to stand here in my place
What if I'd been the one to say goodbye, goodbye
Could you smile when inside you just want to cry, look inside
Can you read my mind? oh oh

When I hear your name, feel so cold deep inside
Still it's hard to explain, oh
But you're not meant to be, they say time will heal the pain
But it just goes on forever
Can you read my mind, have you closed the door on love
Can you be so blind, did you think I'd just give up

What if I'd been the one to say goodbye, goodbye
Could you smile when inside you just want to cry, want to cry
What if I'd been the one to say goodbye, goodbye
Could you smile when it hurts so deep inside, and it never fades away
Fade away

Time can't erase the reasons why
I count my mistakes and the heartaches since you said goodbye

What if I'd been the one to say goodbye, goodbye
Could you smile when inside you just want to cry, want to cry
What if I'd been the one to say goodbye, goodbye
Could you smile when it hurts so deep inside, and it never fades away
Never fades away
No, it don't fade away
