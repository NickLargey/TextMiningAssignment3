It seems like weeks since you looked at me baby
Without that look of distaste
I don't know why your feelings are changing
But I've seen it in your face
All those times when our lips were kissing
Our tongues were telling lies
And all those signs that I've been missing
Were right there in your eyes.

So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye.

I sometimes feel when we're together baby,
Everything has turned out wrong
And I know you feel exactly the same way
But still we carry on.
I've been waiting up by the window
Watching these cars go by
And I tell myself that I'll go through the motions
For the last time tonight.

So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye.

Now I'm watching the fumes foul up the sunrise
I'm watching the light fade away
And I'm hoping tonight that I'll open the door
And you'll stand here and say

Come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye
Better make it sooner than later
Before it all turns sour
We'd better kiss this thing
Goodbye.
