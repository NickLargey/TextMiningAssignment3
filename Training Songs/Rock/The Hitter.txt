Come to the door, Ma, and unlock the chain 
I was just passin' through and got caught in the rain 
There's nothin' I want, nothin' that you need say 
Just let me lie down for a while and I'll be on my way 

I was no more than a kid when you put me on the Southern Queen 
With the police on my back I fled to New Orleans 
I fought in the dockyards and with the money I made 
I knew the fight was my home and blood was my trade 

Baton Rouge, Ponchatoula, and Lafayette town 
Well they paid me their money, Ma, I knocked the men down 
I did what I did well it come easily 
Restraint and mercy, Ma, were always strangers to me 

I fought champion Jack Thompson in a field full of mud 
Rain poured through the tent to the canvas and mixed with our blood
In the twelfth I slipped my tongue over my broken jaw 
I stood over him and pounded his bloody body into the floor 
Well the bell rang and rang and still I kept on 
'Till I felt my glove leather slip 'tween his skin and bone 

Then the women and the money came fast and the days I lost track 
The women red, the money green, but the numbers were black 
I fought for the men in their silk suits to lay down their bets 
I took my good share, Ma, I have no regrets 

Then I took the fix at the state armory with big John McDowell 
From high in the rafters I watched myself fall 
As they raised his arm my stomach twisted and the sky it went black
I stuffed my bag with their good money and I never looked back 

Understand, in the end, Ma, every man plays the game 
If you know me one different then speak out his name 
Ma, if my voice now you don't recognize 
Then just open the door and look into your dark eyes 
I ask of you nothin', not a kiss not a smile, 
Just open the door and let me lie down for a while 

Now the gray rain's fallin' and my ring fightin's done 
So in the work fields and alleys I take all who'll come 
If you're a better man than me then just step to the line 
Show me your money and speak out your crime 
Now there's nothin' I want, Ma, nothin' that you need say 
Just let me lie down for a while and I'll be on my way 

Tonight in the shipyard a man draws a circle in the dirt 
I move to the center and I take off my shirt 
I study him for the cuts, the scars, the pain, 
Man, nor time can erase 
I move hard to the left and I strike to the face
