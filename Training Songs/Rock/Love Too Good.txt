Oh, spread your wings
You've been too long in the cage
Feeling the range of abuses
Oh, I'm sorry, yeah

I've opened the door
I've set you free
But you can't you see
That I'm no good, I'm sorry

(Sorry)
Baby, I still love ya
(Sorry)
And I worry about it
(Sorry)
The hurt I put on you
You can do without it

Love too good
You gotta love too good
You gotta love too good
For a woman like me, baby

Take to the wind
Here with me, there's too much pain
Over and over again, I'll hurt you
I'm sorry

Oh, I've opened the door
And I've set you free
But you still can't you see
That I'm no good, sorry, yeah

(Sorry)
Baby, I still love ya
(Sorry)
And I worry about it
(Sorry)
The hurt I put on you
You can do without it

Love too good
You gotta love too good
You gotta love too good
For a woman like me, for a woman like me, baby

Set you free
Can't you see?
Wanna set you free
Can't, why can't you see?

Love too
Love too
Love too
