(Wadu-aidu-wadaidu)

There is a song
You're trembling to its tune
At the request of the moon

Licking her chops, she looks at the lunatics
She needs another fix

I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smoking?
I'm just a-fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read

I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smoking?
I'm just a-fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
Only a crazy little thing I read

Maybe the planets
Are trying to become the stars
And we really came from Mars

The earth is alive
And man is a parasite
And heavenly bodies make us fight

I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smoking?
I'm just a-fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read

I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smoking?
I'm just a-fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
Only a crazy little thing I read

Wadu-aidu-wadaidu

There is a song
You're trembling to its tune
At the request of the moon

Licking her chops, she looks at the lunatics
She needs another fix

I'm only joking (I'm only joking)
I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smoking? (What are you smoking?)
I'm just a-fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read

I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smoking?
I'm just a-fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read

I'm only joking
I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smoking?
I'm just a-fucking with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
Only a crazy little thing I read
