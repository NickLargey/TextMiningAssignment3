I have slept beside the winter 
And the green is growing slow 
I have watched you find the places 
Hidden by the snow 
I have tripped into a valley 
That is blue till you can see 
I want you to come walk this world with me 

With the light in our eyes it's hard to see Holding on and on to what we believe 
With the light in our eyes it's hard to see
I'm not touched but I'm aching to be 
I want you to come walk this world with me 

And I'm sucked in by the wonder 
And I'm fucked up by the lies 
And I dig a hole to lie in 
And I build some wings to fly 
And I think that I could love you 'cause 
You know how to be free 
I want you to come walk this world with me 

With the light in our eyes it's hard to see Holding on and on 'til we believe 
With the light in our eyes it's hard to see 
I'm not touched but I'm aching to be 
I want you to come, I want you to come 
I want you to come walk this world with me 

And it's burning in our fingers 
And it's burning on the road 
And I like the way you're broken 
And I'll like you when you're old 
And I see you in the garden 
And I feel you plant the seed 
I want you to come walk this world with me 

With the light in our eyes it's hard to see Holding on and on 'til we believe 
With the light in our eyes it's hard to see 
I'm not touched but I'm aching to be 
I want you to come, I want you to come 
I want you to come walk this world with me
