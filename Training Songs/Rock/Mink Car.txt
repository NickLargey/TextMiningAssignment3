It's knocking off
My diamond wig
Knocking me down
Into the platinum ground
Woke up in a beautiful dream
Alone
Alone

I got hit by a Mink Car
Hit by a Mink Car
Driven by a Guitar
And the silver Chauffeur says
That it's all in your head
When you're 24 carrot dead
Dead

In my dream
She is reaching past my hollow form
And her smile's
An open sign in an abandoned store

I got hit by a Mink Car
Hit by a Mink Car
Driven by a Guitar
And the silver Chauffeurs says
That it's all in your head
When you're 24 carrot dead
Dead
Dead
