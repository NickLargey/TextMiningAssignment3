I know somebody you know
Someone who knows how to please
Thinking' maybe you got her
You think you're all she needs

I don't want to disappoint you
But there's something that you don't know
Girl's gonna leave you screamin'
Someplace where you don't want to go

Makin' you feel like nothing
Bringin' you to your knees
Leavin' you out in the cold
Is her specialty

The lady's got an obsession
You're like all the rest
Just like all the others
She's callin' you the best

I don't want to disappoint you
But you ain't the first or last
And sooner than you think my friend
You're another man in her past

Makin' you feel like nothing
Bringin' you to your knees
Leavin' you out in the cold
Is her specialty

Makin' you feel like nothing
Bringin' you to your knees
Leavin' you out in the cold
Is her specialty
Is her specialty
Her specialty
Her specialty
Yeah, it's her specialty
Her specialty
Oh, her specialty
