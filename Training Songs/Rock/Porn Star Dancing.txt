Kelly won't kiss my friend Cassandra
Jessica won't play ball
Mandy won't share her friend Miranda
Doesn't anybody live at all?

Amanda won't leave me empty handed,
Got her number from a bathroom stall
Brandy just brought way too much baggage
And that shit just gets old

But I got a girl who can put on a show
The dollar decides how far you can go with her

She wraps those hands around that pole
She licks those lips and off we go
She takes it off nice and slow
Cause that's porn star dancin'

She don't play nice, she makes me beg
She drops that dress around her legs
And I'm sittin' right by the stage
With this porn star dancin'

Your body's lighting up the room
I want a naughty girl like you
There's nothing hotter than a..

Stacy's gonna save her self for marriage
But that's just not my style
She's got a pair that's nice to stare at
But I want girls gone wild

But I know a place where there's always a show
The dollar decides how far you can go with her

She wraps those hands around that pole
She licks those lips and off we go
She takes it off nice and slow
Cause that's porn star dancin'

She don't play nice, she makes me beg her
She drops that dress around her legs
And I'm sittin' right by the stage
With this porn star dancin'

Your body's lighting up the room
I want a naughty girl like you
Let's throw a party just for two
You know these normal girls won't do

She wraps those hands around that pole
She licks those lips and off we go
She takes it off nice and slow
'Cause that's porn star dancin'

She don't play nice, she makes me beg her
She drops that dress around her legs
And I'm sittin' right by the stage
With this porn star dancin'
