I take your word like it was gospel 
I'm so eager to please 
Yeah I like it when 

You talk to me 
It feels so good inside your shadow 
(It's the place I need to be) 
Yeah I know I need to climb you 
Like a tree 

There is this place inside 
Where all the good things die 
Sometimes I feel like a whore 
(Sometimes I feel like a whore) 
I hate the way I am around you 
(I'm so nervous and weird) 
Sometimes I feel like I'm 

Breathing underwater 
You treat me like I am on fire 
Like I'm something to eat 
You make me hate what I see 

When I see me 
Yeah I dream of the day 
When I learn how to make you pay 
Someday I'll teach you to beg 

Someday, someday 
Yes I live for the day 
When I can hear you say 
You make me feel like a whore 
Yes I dream of the time 
When I can make you mine 
(Maybe then I'll feel half alive, more alive, so alive) 
There is this place inside 
Where all the good things die 
You make me feel like a whore
