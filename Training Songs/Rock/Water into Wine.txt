City papers blow around me
As the mornin' hits the sky
On the ocean ships are waitin' high
So am I

City sweeper goes around me
He don't need no reason why
If I don't seem in a hurry now
I've arrived

Come on baby won't you save me
Turn this water into wine
Love, emotion, like an ocean
How can I hold back the tide

Baby meet me on the corner
When you hear that whistle blow
If I don't seem like I oughta
The one you used to know

Come on baby won't you save me
Turn this water into wine
Love, emotion, like an ocean
How can I hold back the tide

I'm on high ground
Put this weight down
Of one thing you can be sure
On the ocean ships are sailin'
But I don't need them anymore

Come on baby won't you save me
Turn this water into wine
Love, emotion, like an ocean
How can I hold back the tide

Come on baby won't you save me
Turn this water into wine
Love, emotion, like an ocean
Turn this water into wine
