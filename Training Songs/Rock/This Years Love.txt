This years love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
I've been waiting on my own too long
And when ya hold me like you do
It feels so right oh now
I start to forget how my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on

Turning circle's and time again
Cut like a knife oh now
If ya love me gotta know for sure
'Cause it takes something more this time
Than sweet sweet lies oh now
Before I open up my arms and fall
Loosing all control
Every dream inside my soul
When ya kiss me on that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet

This years love it better last

This years love it better last
'Cause who's to worry if our hearts get torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Don't ya know this life goes on
Won't ya kiss me on that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet

This years love it better last
This years love it better last
This years love it better last
This years love it better last
This years love it better last,
Woah woah woah I yeah
This years love it better last
