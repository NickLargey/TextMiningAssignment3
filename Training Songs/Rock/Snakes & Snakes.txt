I need some crayon light
I need some coloring in
I need somebody who's going to give in

I need my own moon landing
I need a mission to Mars
I need to carry out repairs by the light of your star

You say you're missing my voice now
Yea, I'm missing it too
I'm missing my voice when it's talking to you

I'm hearing your voice now
And here I go again
Coming over like mist be coming rain

All this serves to tell me
Is maybe there's no ladders in this game at all
All this serves to tell me is maybe only snakes like the one in the garden that has to crawl

All this serves to tell me
Is maybe there's no ladders in this game at all
All this serves to tell me is maybe only snakes like the one in the garden fucked it all

I need to smile like an Angel
I need to smile like a Fool
I need to smile like I'm pissing
In your swimming pool
