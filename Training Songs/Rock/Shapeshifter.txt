When I was standin' on the gallows
Nothing to say, I watched my sun go down
And light got dark around the edges
With no control I felt my soul go down
When you're dead there isn't anybody else
Nobody else at all
So darkness came upon the valley
And all the war machines broke down broke down
And all the children ran for cover
And all the animals broke down broke down

Ooh, well maybe they should not have
Been quite so bold to test me
For I am the Shape shifter
And I'll have my revenge
[ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh's]
[ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh's]
