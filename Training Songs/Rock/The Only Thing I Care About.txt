She had the eyes of someone older
I have the eyes that wander 'round
I couldn't see what really mattered

Caught hell from my boss
Don't care about my job
Caught a cold from the rain
Don't care if I'm cold
Played every record that I own today
But the only thing I care about got away

She was a walking work of art
I am a broken wind-up toy
I thought I knew what really mattered

Got a flat on the road
Don't care about my car
Lost 26 bucks
Don't care about my rent
Caught every episode on TV today
But the only thing I care about got away

She had a brilliant future
I have a past
I have my memories
But they're fading fast
Caught hell from my boss
Don't care about my job
Caught a cold from the rain
Don't care if I'm cold
Played every record that I own today
But the only thing I care about got away
The only thing I care about got away
