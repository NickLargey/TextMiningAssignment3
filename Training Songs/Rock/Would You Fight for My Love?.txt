It's not enough that I love you
There's all these things I have to prove to you
You use the sun to erase the past
But you think it only erases for you

Well I'm afraid of being hurt that's true
But I'm not afraid of any physical pain
Just as I am always scared of women
But not afraid of standing out in the rain

The last bosom in the room she hugged
Was the bosom that the loved the most
Nobody noticed I was down on the rug
I'm getting better at becoming a ghost

I know that you want more
But would you fight for my love?
In the heart that you bid for
But can you ignore my love?

No walking out my back door
Looking back for my love
I know that you want more
But would you fight for my love?

People do their best to not let passion begin
If stepping forward has a chance to start
If so then I am the caretaker of sins
And you're a bandit in my malignant heart

It's such a blessing to sing with you together
Making love when there is nobody home
But I can't get you till you lift up your chin
You have to want to start being alone

I want you to fight for my love
