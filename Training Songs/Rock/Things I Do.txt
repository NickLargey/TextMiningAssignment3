All the things I do wrap around me like a blanket
A warm, wool blanket
All the things I do melt off me like icing
On a warm cake

And I'm left standing naked
Needing more time to do what I do
And I'm left standing naked
Needing more time

I have this Hitler list that runs my life
And says good girl, bad girl, worthless worm
I have this Hitler list to help me breathe
To be a rock inside my lungs

It makes me scream
It makes me... scream
It makes me scream
It makes me... scream

All the things I do confine me like bracelets
Cold steel bracelets
All the things I do protect me like mother
Protects her baby

And I'm left standing naked
Needing more time to do what I do
And I'm left standing naked
Needing more time

I have this Hitler list that runs my life
And says good girl, bad girl, worthless worm
I have this Hitler list to help to me breathe
To be a rock inside my lungs

It makes me scream
It makes me... scream
It makes me scream
It makes me... scream

Trip up my stairs... you can
Turn down my glare... and you
Trip up my eyes... then I
I start again

I have this Hitler list that runs my life
And says good girl, bad girl, worthless worm
I have this Hitler list to help me breathe
To be a rock inside my lungs

I have this Hitler list that runs my life
And says good girl, bad girl, worthless worm
I have this Hitler list to help me breathe
To be a rock inside my lungs

To be a rock inside my lungs [Repeat until fade]
