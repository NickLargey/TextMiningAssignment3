Lookin' out a dirty old window 
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by 
I sit here alone and I wonder why 
Friday night and everyone's movin' 
I can feel the heat but it's soothing heading down 
I search for the beat in this dirty town 

Downtown 
The young ones are goin' 
Downtown 
The young ones are growin' 

We're the kids in America whoa 
We're the kids in America whoa 
Everybody live for the music go round 

Bright lights the music gets faster 
Look girl don't check on your watch not another glance 
I'm not leavin' now honey no not a chance 
Hot shot shot give me no problems 
Much later baby you'll be saying never mind 
You know life is cruel life is never kind 

Kind hearts 
We'll make a new story 
Kind hearts 
We'll grab it in glory 

We're the kids in America whoa 
We're the kids in America whoa 
Everybody live for the music go round 

La la la la la 
La la la la la 
Sing 
La la la la la 
La la la la la 
La la la 

Come closer honey that's better 
Got to get a brand new experience feeling right 
Oh don't try to stop baby hold me tight 
Outside a new day is dawning 
Outside suburbia's sprawling everywhere 
I don't want to go baby 

New York 
To East Philadelphia 
There's a new one 
Comin' I warn you 

We're the kids in America 
We're the kids in America 
Everybody live for the music go round 

La la la la la 
La la la la la 
Sing 
La la la la la 
La la la la la 
La la la 
La la la
