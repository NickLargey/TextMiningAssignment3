(Pack)
Well I gotta catch a plane 
Check on out of L.A. 
To somewhere I've never traveled 
I'm on my way 
Yeah, I'm ready
So, sit back in your chair
'Cause I'll be there soon 
Don't get too unraveled
Just kick off your shoes 
Keep your head on steady
You gave me the feelin' 
And the love I need to go on
And I won't let you down 
'Cause I'm ready right now
You gave me the feelin' 
And the love I need to go on 
And I can't wait no more 
'Cause I'm ready
I was raised up in the middle 
Of a house full of hell 
And I'm lucky to be here 
With something to tell 
Glad those days are behind me 
Oh, yes I am
Well, the odds are against me
But I've still got the fight 
I've learned the hard way 
Of doin' it right 
Now I'm ready
I said you gave me the feelin' 
And the love I need to go on 
And I can't wait no more 
'Cause I'm ready right now 
You gave me the feelin' 
And the love I need to go on 
And I won't wait no more 
'Cause I'm ready 
Said I'm ready 
Yeah, yeah 
I said you gave me the feelin' 
And the love I need to go on 
And I can't wait no more 
'Cause I'm ready right now 
Said you gave me the feelin' 
And the love I need to go on 
And I won't wait no more 
'Cause I'm ready right now now
You gave me the feelin' 
And the love I need to go on 
And I can't wait no more 
'Cause I'm ready 
Said I'm ready
Oh, right now 
Mmm, said I'm ready (Ready) 
Well, I'm ready (Well, I'm ready) 
Yeah, I'm ready
