Too scared to move a mile
Now why can't we stay here for awhile.
Dark clouds are overhead,
Don't worry 'bout the thing I said.
It was self-defense,
Can I lower my defenses, now.
I couldn't lie to you,
Why can't I lie to you.
How can I hold what I've never had?
White teales and party threads,
Now who put these words inside my head?
'cause I'm at the cellar door
And I've never felt this way before.
Under the circumstance,
Can I lower my defenses, now?
I couldn't lie to you,
Why can't I lie to you.

You're so self-controlled that it makes you sad.
Oh, I couldn't lie to you,
Why can't I lie to you.
How can I hold what I've never had?
Pick a side, pick a room,
Dress me up in sweet perfume.
I wanna know you got it so bad,
I wanna hear you say it's driving you mad
On and on and on.
I couldn't lie to you,
Why can't I lie to you.
You're so self-controlled that it makes you sad.
Now I couldn't lie to you,
Why can't I lie to you.
I couldn't lie to you, now.
