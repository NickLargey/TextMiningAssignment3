Sun goes down I rise
Red hair flames so bright
Iced gin breaks the night
Steal into her mind
Walk without a sound
Fire in the mountains now
If you want to rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you want to rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling, love calling
If you want to rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you want to rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling

So baby rock on
Clap hands, clap hands
For the song man
Rock on, rock on
Ooo baby rock on,
Clap hands, clap hands
For the song man
Rock on, rock on

Song man dreams for you
Moves his clapping space
Turns us into snakes
Hot hits
And the blue moon move, move, move
Move until we die
Move until she cries
If you want to rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you want to rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling, love calling
If you want to rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you want to rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling
Oo baby rock on

If you want to rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you want to rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling, love calling
If you want to rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you want to rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling

So (Ooo) baby rock on
Clap hands, clap hands
For the song man
Rock on, rock on
Ooo baby rock on,
Clap hands, clap hands
For the song man
Rock on, rock on
