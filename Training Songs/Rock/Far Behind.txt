Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad
But I did it anyway
And now maybe
Some would say your life was sad
But you lived it anyway
And so maybe
Your friends they stand around they watch you crumble
As you fall to the ground
And someday
Your friends they stand beside as you were flying
Oh you were flying oh so high
But then some day people look at you for what they call their own
They watch you suffer
Yeah they hear you calling home
But then some day we could take our time
To brush the leaves aside so you can reach us
But you left me far behind

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain
No, no, no

Couldn't share the pain they watch you suffer
Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes
But I live with what I've known
And then maybe we might share in something great
But won't you look at where we've grown
Won't you look at where we've gone
But then someday comes tomorrow holds a sense of what I fear for you in my mind
As you trip the final line
And that cold day when you lost control
Shame you left my life
So soon you should have told me
But you left me far behind

Now maybe I didn't meant to treat you oh so bad
Oh but I did it anyway
Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain
No, no, no

Oh No, no, no
Oh No, No, no, 
Don't say it, I know, say I know, say I know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I said maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh-so bad?
Oh, but I did it anyway
So maybe some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain
I said times have changed your friends They come and watch you crumble to the ground
They watch you suffer
Yeah they hold you down hold you down
Said maybe, oh, maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad?
But you left me far behind
Left me far behind
Left me far behind
