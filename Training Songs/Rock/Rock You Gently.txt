All your life love's hurt you 
Turned you out then burnt you 
Held you high off the ground 
You touched the moon 
Then it dropped you down 
I know your heart's been broken 
Trust don't come so easily 
It takes time, that's all right 
Just let me heal your heart tonight 

I will rock you gently 
I will be there when the night comes down 
I will rock you so gently 
I'm gonna rock you gently 
I will be there when the morning comes 
I will rock you, rock you 

Late at night they haunt you 
Lovers' voices point you 
Back in time, wide awake 
You curse the moon 'til the morning breaks 
I know that lonely feeling 
We are two hearts still healing 
Hurry here, hurry now 
Please come to me 
Let me show you how 

I will rock you gently 
I will be there when the night comes down 
I will rock you so gently 
I'm gonna rock you gently 
I will be there when the morning comes 
I will rock you, rock you 

Little by little, day by day 
All through the night into the day 
I'll be your lover, I'll be your friend 
Open up your heart and let me in
