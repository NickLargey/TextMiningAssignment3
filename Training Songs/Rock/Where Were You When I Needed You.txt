Don't bother crying
Don't bother calling
It's all over now
There's no use in stalling
The love I once felt
I don't feel anymore for you
This time I'll even open the door for you
You walked out when I was down
Well now I'm well off
And look, look who's comin' round

Where were you when I wanted you
Where were you when I need you

Is worse than without you
I won't spend a lifetime worryin' about you
When things got bad
You disappeared
But I'm back on my feet
And look, look who's standin' there

Where were you when I neeed you
Where were you when I wanted you
Where were you when I needed you
Where

You were so young
And you were so wild
I knew you were nobody's innocent child
That first day I saw you 
You really got to me
I thought I could change you
What could you do to me
When times got rought 
Ah, you would't wait
Well now you're trippin' back
And babe, babe it's too late

Where were you when I needed you
Where were you when I wanted you
Where were you when I needed you
Where
