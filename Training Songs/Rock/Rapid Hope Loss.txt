You called to say you wanted out.
Well, I can't say I blame you now.
Sometimes you've got to fold
Before you're found out.
Well thanks for waiting this long 
To show yourself.

'Cause now that I can see you,
I don't think you're worth a second glance.

So much for all the promises you made,
They served you well.
Now you're gone and they're wasted on me.

So much for your endearing sense of charm,
It served you well.
Now you've gone and they're wasted on me.

I guess that all you've got
Is all you're gonna get.
