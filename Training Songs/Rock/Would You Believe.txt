Don't laugh in my face. 
You're making me feel small. 
I'm all rags wrapped in lace. 
Compared with you I'm nothing. 

Would you believe I'm in love with you? 
Would you believe I'm in love, 
and I can't help myself? 

I once tried to touch you, 
but I could never reach your height. 
You're way above me. 
It seems so useless somehow. 

[Chorus:] 
Wandering around 
with this maddening obsession you have over me. 
Just wandering around, 
oblivious to everything that's going on. 
One thought in my mind 
keeps pounding through my brain. 

I've got to make you see how I love you. 
My life is yours; I live for you, 
and I can't help myself. 

[Chorus:]
 
Would you believe I'm in love with you? 
Would you believe I'm in love? 
Would you believe I'm in love with you? 
Would you believe I'm in love?
