1. Life is but a dream repeat 

2. I make the air fall apart 
Around me 
Now as the petals are no more 
A corroding, shrinking stalk remains 
Bereft of his blooms 
And the ultimate cruelty of loves pinions 
Beset his appearance 
Beset his appearance 
No king could replenish his state 
Now browning, sinking, dying 
A thousand deaths x3 

3. Terry sat up 
And hugged the green army surplus bag 
Around his skinny waist 
It was cold 
And the person beside him had faded badly 
Legs apart his eyes lit up 
THE SKY'S GONE OUT - THE SKY, THE SKY... 
THE SKY'S GONE OUT 

4. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ 

5. The sky's gone out!
