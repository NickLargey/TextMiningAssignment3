Are you all seated comfly-bold
two-square on your botty?
Then I'll begin

Once upon a time in the land of greens
Where the sky was silky soft
and full of coloured dreams
Deep inside a rainbow lived Happiness Stan
in a small Victoriana charabanc

Evening will be here quite soon
Stan can sit and watch the moon
Watching as the white light
slowly makes the night bright
Hours slipping by while time stands still

Think of black and black will think for you
It's covered Stan in bruises, of the darkness that he knew
For black has stolen half the moon away
