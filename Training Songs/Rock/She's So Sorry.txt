We started out okay,
But you threw it all away,
My god what's going on in your head!
For all we could've found just to let it hit the ground,
But I'm good and done, we're over and dead

And yes I'm leaving you it's obvious
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
So wipe that stupid look right off of your face

Get out of my way,
What did she say, she's so so sorry
Just get out of my way,
What did she say, she's so so sorry
She said I wanna start over today, take me back again
Get out of my way,
What did she say, she's so so sorry

She was,

You try to shift the blame.
My god are you insane,
And I'm sorry babe is all you can say
You've made a mess before
I kept coming back for more
'Cause I never thought you'd end it this way

And yes I'm leaving you it's obvious
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
So wipe that stupid look right off of your face

Get out of my way,
What did she say, she's so so sorry
Just get out of my way,
What did she say, she's so so sorry
She said I wanna start over today, take me back again
Get out of my way,
What did she say, she's so so sorry

And that's all that I can say, if you've never been let down, then this story's far from over
Everything comes back around, so be careful what you say, what goes up's gotta come down
Don't be taken back it's all because of you

Get out of my way,
What did she say, she's so so sorry
Just get out of my way,
What did she say, she's so so sorry
She said I wanna start over today, take me back again
Get out of my way,
What did she say, she's so so sorry

Never again,
Never again,

What'd she say out of my way, what did I tell her, what'd I tell her
What'd she say out of my way, what did I tell her, what'd I tell her.
