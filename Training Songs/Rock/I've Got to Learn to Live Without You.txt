You came into my life, you took me off the shelf 
You told my name to me and taught me what to do 
But then you went away and left me by myself, 
I feel completely lost and lonely without you

Why'd you go, baby? I guess you know,
I've got to learn to live without you
I've got to learn to live without you
I've got to learn to live without you, without you

Today I thought I saw you walking down the street
With someone else, I turned my head and faced the wall
I started crying and my heart fell to my feet
But when I looked again it wasn't you at all

Why'd you go, baby? I guess you know,
I've got to learn to live without you
I've got to learn to live without you
I've got to learn to live without you, without you
It's just no good without you, without you
It's just no good without you, without you
It's just no good without you

I've got to learn to live without you
I've got to learn to live without you
I've got to learn to live without you
