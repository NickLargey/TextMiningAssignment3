I'm going down to the valley of the bones
To try and keep warm when the night comes cold
Cause god in his infinite mercy
Is gonna make old Susie rise for me

Got a hard rock bed and a dead black cat
That her soul went to when her eyes went flat
And I loved her though we weren't good friends
So make old Susie rise again

If god don't help I'll turn away
They say it's evil but that's okay
Cause I burned with love and in return
I found it doesn't hurt to burn
