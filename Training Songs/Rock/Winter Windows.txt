There is a man inside a room in the forest
He sits alone upon the chair his father left him
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark with the radio on

The voice crackles when he says that God will save you
He will take you from the lonely life you're living
If you give, if you give, if you give up on what you want

The man stands and pours himself another bourbon
He stops and watches the birds through the winter windows
And the light, and the light from the morning dew

"I thought I love you and our love would be forever
How could I hit you, the only one who ever loved me?"
Said the man, said the man to his shadow

This is the world, this is the world we live in
It's not the one I choose but it's the one we're given
This is the world, this is the world we live in
And it's the winter windows that ends become beginnings
Yep!

As a boy he was taught he was the bad one
One that could heed the other, the protector
He will walk, he will walk, he will walk into the river

Sixty years held down by his brother
Ten years with the ghost of his father
And five years since he spoke, since he spoke to his only son

This is the world, this is the world we live in
It's not the one I choose but it's the one we're given
This is the world, this is the world we live in
And it's the winter windows that ends become beginnings

Yes, it's the winter windows that ends become beginnings
