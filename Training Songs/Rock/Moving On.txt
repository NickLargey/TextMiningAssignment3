I'm gonna leave this place tomorrow.
I'm gonna leave this town behind.
I'll be gone before the morning,
on the other side of the mound.
That's why I'm moving on.
I'm moving on.
I've been hanging around too long,
it's time I was moving on.
Oh, well I'm tired of the same old faces,
and I'm sick of the same old names.
I'm getting bored with the same old places,
everybody starts to look the same.
That's why I'm moving on.
I'm moving on.
I've been hanging around too long,
it's time I was moving on.
Move it for me!
I've been tryin' to settle down here,
but my feet just won't stay still.
And I've heard that the grass is greener
on the other side of the hill.
That's why I'm moving on.
I'm moving on.
I've been hanging around too long,
it's time I was moving on.
Give me one more for the go!
I'm gonna leave this town tomorrow.
I'm gonna leave this place behind.
You can bet your bottom dollar,
all my troubles will be far behind.
That's why I'm moving on.
I'm moving on.
I've been hanging around too long,
it's time I was moving on.
I've been hanging around too long,
it's time I was moving on.
Said I've been hanging around too long,
it's time I was moving on.
Get out of here!
