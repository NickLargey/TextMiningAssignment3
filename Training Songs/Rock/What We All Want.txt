This wheel spins let me off
It's not for lack of trying
Can't put my finger on it
You can't help being hard up
You can't trust the god you trusted
Don't think that's any insurance
Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with something else
I need someone to fill my time

this wheel spins let me off
These jobs are nagging worries
Nothing to work towards
This demon on back preaches the razor's blood
The world it does not fade
Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time

this wheel spins let me off
It's not for lack of trying
Can't put my finger on it
You can't help being hard up
You can't trust the god you trusted
Don't think that's any insurance

could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with something else
I need someone to fill my time (repeat)
What we want's not what we get
