Now on the day I was born from my mama's belly torn, an angry sea did roar.
Old Poseidon knew, full-well, that a captain had been born, a captain brave as hell. 
I got bones made of coral, salt water in my veins, and a tidal wave of hope.
And when I stole Poseidon's trident there was nothing he could do except curse my world in storm.
  
Here I am, once again, 
At the mercy of the sea.
All my life, all my light,
You just keep on coming back to me.

I spent nearly all my days on this old, wooden boat drifting to-and-fro about the sea. 
And I’ve seen so much heartache I don’t care to remember and that’s why I can’t forget. 
I’ve wrestled 20 ft. swells. They tried to take me back to Hell, but not a one has prevailed.
And how that sweet little girl with the green-brown eyes, oh how she can take me there at will. 

Here I am, once again, 
At the mercy of the sea.
All my life, all my light,
You just keep on coming back to me.

Like any other sailor man that’s ever been to port, a shot of booze and a whole lot of love. 
I found myself in Philly on December, 28th, nearly 4 long years ago. 
T’was a night I remember, to never-soon forget, as the first time I ever held your hand.
I’ve made love to countless mermaids and all the Sirens too, and it’s strange how none compare to you.  

Here I am, once again, 
At the mercy of the sea.
All my life, all my light,
You just keep on coming back to me.
