How dare you sit in judgment
Of working girls on the game
You're just as guilty your honour
Hiding facts behind your fame
DISHING OUT A PRISON TERM
FOR WHAT SHOULD BE THEIR RIGHT
WE WANT THE TRUTH
THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING
BUT THE TRUTH
Pass the buck with a sentence
Learned upholder of decency
Dishonored your bench and all who sit on it
Paid young girls frequently
With your friends in high places
Hypocrite son of a bitch
The only reason you're still here
Is coz you're filthy rich
