So strange when lovers change their mind 
To realize the joy left foolishly behind 
And I feel secure down in my soul 
And somehow I know 
I know that love is on my side 
Deep down I know 
I know that love is on my side 
And I'm gonna win, girl 
Some nights I slip into the past 
To better understand why two hearts never last 
I just don't know why nights so tender turn so cold 
Somehow I know 
I know that love is on my side 
Deep down I know 
I know that love is on my side 
And I'm gonna win, yeah 
Walk on through the night 
It's all just a game she plays so well 
In time I know the tides will be turnin' 
And she's gonna learn 
Shine a light, shine it bright 
And time will testify I know 
I know that love is on my side 
Deep down I know 
I know that love is on my side 
Somehow I know 
I know that love is on my side 
Deep down I know 
I know that love is on my side 
Oh yeah, I know that love is on my side, I know
