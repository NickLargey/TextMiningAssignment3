Well they met in line at the checkout stand
Both unaware of what the gods had planned
She was lost in her Cosmo readin' about the stars
He was readin' about two-headed babies from Mars
When she reached for a Snickers she dropped her keys
And so began one of life's mysteries
He was a little old-fashioned and a little oversexed
He picked them up never guessing what would happen next

Then she smiled and said I like your tie
Yeah she smiled and told him that little white lie
And his soul lit up like the fourth of July
When she smiled

They made it to Starbuck's just before it closed
He pointed to the jar and said you want one of those
So over biscotti and double decafs
They shared their stories and they had some laughs
He got up his courage and asked her back to his place
Then he held his breath as he studied her face
She just sat and she stared and she said nothing at all
He knew he blew it and he waited for the ax to fall

Then she smiled and he knew he hadn't been wrong
Yeah she smiled and said what took you so long
And the world felt good like a rock and roll song
When she smiled

When she smiles I forget my lines
When she smiles man I'm on cloud nine
When she smiles oh it's time out of mind
When she smiles

Then she smiled and said where you been all my life
And she smiled when he asked her to be his wife
And the future had never looked so bright
When she smiled

I'm just diggin' her diggin' me diggin' her

When she smiles I forget my lines
When she smiles man I'm on cloud nine
When she smiles oh it's time out of mind
When she smiles

When she smiles I come all undone
When she smiles I'm the only one
When she smiles I'm a smoking gun
When she smiles
