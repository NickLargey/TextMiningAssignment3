Another town along the road
Getting ready for the show tonight
Killing time we sit and wait
Now's your turn to take the stage tonight

You know we've seen so many faces
From sea to sea
You know we've played so many places
They're all the same to me
Wild America, It's all I want, and it's all I need
Wild America, Home of the free

Waiting for the night to fall
For the time when you can leave it all behind
The lights go down, the show begins
Hear the sound, and you lose all sense of time

You know we've seen things come
Together in this dream
You know that this won't last
Forever so come along with me
Wild America, It's all I want, and it's all I need
Wild America, Home of the free

Feel the power and you'll believe
Live for the music that knocks you off your feet
It takes you where you wanna be
Love it up, cause it's down to you and me

You know we've seen so many faces
From sea to sea
You know we've played so many places
They're all the same to me
