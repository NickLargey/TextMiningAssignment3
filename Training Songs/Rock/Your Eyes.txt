I gave you all
Girl I gave everything to you
But all the love
It wasn't good enough for you

Just for a while
Just for a while you took my heart
I want it there before
You tear it apart 

Your eyes
I can read it in your eyes
All those long forgotten lies
I can see it in your smile
More and more everyday
Love is fading away in your eyes 

There was a time 
A time when you needed my embrace
But now it's fading here
Back to stranger face to face

I feel alone 
And after all our thrill has gone 
I close the door 'cause you 
Don't need me no more

Your eyes
I can read it in your eyes
All those long forgotten lies
I can see it in your smile
More and more everyday
Love is fading away in your eyes 

Your eyes
I can read it in your eyes
All those long forgotten lies
I can see it in your smile
More and more everyday
Love is fading away in your eyes 

Your eyes
I can read it in your eyes
All those long forgotten lies
I can see it in your smile
More and more everyday
Love is fading away in your eyes 

Your eyes
I can read it in your eyes
All those long forgotten lies
