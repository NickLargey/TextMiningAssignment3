Hey

Detroit got stupid, it was time to blow
I can't dig people when they play control
I rocked to Manhattan and what'd I see
Some great big buildings that could set me free

The bars are open all night
But that damn AIDS test got me so up tight
I said that damn AIDS test got me so uptight

Pay your money to the landlord
Donald Trump is just a money whore
Under my bed there's a baseball bat
Goddamn taxes gonna break my back

I'm in the wasteland, I'm in the wasteland
I'm in the wasteland, I'm in the wasteland
I'm in the wasteland, mama you know it's true
No motherfucker's gonna tell me what to do
I'm in the wasteland

The gangs are doin' drive-by's in L.A.
Quinn is drillin' ink and we're gettin' laid
Your shotgun cops are goin' to hell
L.A.P.D's got an awful smell

In Hollywood the scene's all there
Tommie's always got the drugs to go on a bender
Every time I go I never wanna come back
Breathe the summer air, you'll have a heart attack

You're in the wasteland, you're in the wasteland
You're in the wasteland, you're in the wasteland
You don't buy what the government sells
The goddamn President can go to hell
You're in the wasteland

Here we go

I can't live unless I'm free
You've gotta run to stay with me
I move from town to town
I'm livin' on the underground

Hey baby, come with me
I meet a lot of good company
To beat the system move around
It's the only way to freedom today

Find your freedom today
Find your freedom today
Find your freedom today
Find your freedom today

If I make bail, tell you where I'll go
Gonna cross the border into Mexico
Tequila's cheap as sunshine
Wind up bangin' everythin' in sight
I'm free and that's a fact
Once I leave I ain't never comin' back

I'm in the wasteland, I'm in the wasteland
I'm in the wasteland, I'm in the wasteland
I'm in the wasteland, yeah, I'm in the wasteland, yeah
I'm in the wasteland, yeah, I'm in the wasteland, yeah
I'm in the wasteland
