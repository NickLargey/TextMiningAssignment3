Vaya Con Dios (May God Be with You)
 Les Paul & Mary Ford
 Now the hacienda's dark, the town is sleeping;
 Now the time has come to part, the time for weeping.
 Vaya con Dios my darling,
 May God be with you my love.
 Wherever you may be, I'll be beside you,
 Although you're many million dreams away.
 Each night I'll say a pray'are, a pray'are to guide you
 To hasten ev'ry lonely hour of ev'ry lonely day.
 Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow,
 But the memories we share are there to borrow.
 Vaya con Dios, my darling:
 May God be with you, my love, my love,
 May God be with you my love.
 Now the village mission bells are softly ringing,
 If you listen with your heart you'll hear them singing,
 Vaya con Dios my darling,
 May God be with you my love.
 Wherever you may be I'll be beside you,
 Although you're many million dreams away,
 Each night I'll say a pray'are, a pray'are to guide you
 To hasten ev'ry lonely hour of ev'ry lonely day.
 Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow,
 But the memories we share are there to borrow,
 Vaya con Dios, my darling!
 May God be with you, my love, my love,
 May God be with you my love.
