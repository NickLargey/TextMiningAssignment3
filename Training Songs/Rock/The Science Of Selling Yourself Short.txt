I've come to my senses
That I've become senseless
I could give you lessons on how to ruin your friendships
Every last conviction, I smoked them all away
I drank my frustrations down the drain, out of the way
So I sit and wait and wonder
Does anyone else feel like me?
Someone so tired of their routines and disappearing self-esteems

I'll sing along
Yeah with every emergency
Just sing along
I'm the king of catastrophes
I'm so far gone
That deep down inside I think it's fine by me
I'm my own worst enemy

I could be an expert on co-dependency
I could write the best book on underage tragedy
I've been spending my time at the local liquor store
I've been sleeping nightly on my best friends kitchen floor
So I sit and wait and wonder
Does anyone else feel like me?
I'm so overdosed on apathy and put down on sympathy

I'll sing along
Yeah with every emergency
Just sing along
I'm the king of catastrophes
I'm so far gone
That deep down inside I think it's fine by me
I'm my own worst enemy

Let the meaning slip away
Lost my faith in another day
Self deprecation seems okay
I never thought I'd make it anyway

I'll sing along
Yeah with every emergency
Just sing along
I'm the king of catastrophes
I'm so far gone
That deep down inside I think it's fine by me
I'm my own worst enemy

That I'm my own worst enemy
I'm my own worst enemy
And I'm my own worst enemy
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy
And I'm my own worst enemy
