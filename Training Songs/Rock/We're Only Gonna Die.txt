Early man walked away 
As modern man took control 
Their mind's weren't all the same 
To conquer was their goal 

So he built his great empire 
And he slaughtered his own kind 
He died a confused man 
Killed himself in his own mind

We're only gonna die from our own arrogance  
That's why we might as well take our time
