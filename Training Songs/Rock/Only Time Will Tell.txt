Whatever happened to the friends we had
Just a dusty picture on the shelf
We had our troubles but the times we had
I get this feeling when I'm by myself
And when I get it, I get it bad

I keep wakin' up with something new
Oh
Am I losing you
Only time will tell
Oh
I keep wakin' up with something new
Oh
Am I losing you
Only time will tell

You took a piece of me with you
There was nothing I could do
You took a piece of me
Now where are you
Are you dusting pictures too

You were the one I never had to tell
My darkest secrets or how I felt
When I get lonely and I'm by myself
I try to imagine what you're doing now

Oh
I keep wakin' up with something new
Oh
Am I losing you
Only time will tell
Oh
I keep wakin' up with something new
Oh
Am I losing you
Only time will tell

You took a piece of me with you
There was nothing I could do
You took a piece of me
Now where are you
Are you dusting pictures too

I keep wakin' up with something new
Oh
Am I losing you
Only time will tell
Oh
I keep wakin' up with something new
Oh
Am I losing you
Only time will tell

Oh
I keep wakin' up with something new
Oh
Am I losing you
Only time will tell
Oh
I keep wakin' up with something new
Oh
Am I losing you
Only time will tell
