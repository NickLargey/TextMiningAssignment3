One day things will turn out as planned
You'll have her in the palm of your hand
But it's not tonight, no not tonight

One day she'll look at you and say
I never thought I could feel this way
But it's not tonight, no not tonight

There will come a time
Where you will need your friends tonight
There will come a time
Where you will need someone tonight

One day she'll hang on to your arm
Chasing the night all the way 'til the dawn
But it's not tonight, no not tonight

One day soon you'll find a way
To learn to lie and what you're thinking you say
But it's not tonight, no not tonight

There will come a time
Where you will need your friends tonight
And there will come a time
Where you will need someone tonight

And when it feels like everyone's turning their backs on you
And when it feels like everyone's turning their backs on you
Oh well the sun's not out but you know you got to see it through
Oh well the sun's not out but you know you got to see it through

There will come a time
Where you will need your friends tonight
There will come a time
Where you will need someone tonight

There will come a time
Where you will need your friends tonight
There will come a time
Where you will need someone tonight

There will come a time
Where you will need your friends tonight
There will come a time
Where you will need someone tonight
