Don't you feel like talkin' to a man who's fed up walkin' all the time
Don't you feel like sayin' to a man who's fed up prayin' that you're mine
We fought a lot of battles from Nebraska to Seattle, I'm so tired
We hid in lonely places and we never seen the faces â€˜til they fired.

Well hear me talkin' (blood and glory)
I'm fed up walkin' (blood and glory)
I'll tell a story (blood and glory)
About blood and glory.

When we threw away our sabers and we joined with Preston's Raiders for a while
We looted and we plundered while the Yankee cannons thundered, we just smiled
But now back home in Kentucky, and I know I've been lucky to survive
I never want to see another cannon aimed at me while I'm alive.

Well hear me talkin' (blood and glory)
I'm fed up walkin' (blood and glory)
I'll tell a story (blood and glory)
About blood and glory.
