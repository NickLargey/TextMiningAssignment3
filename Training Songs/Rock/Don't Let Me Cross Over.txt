I'm tempted my darling to steal you away
Don't let me cross over stay out of my way
You know that I love you but I'm not the stealing kind
Though I'm faced with heartaches at love's cheating line

Don't let me cross over love's cheating line
You belong to another and you'll never be mine
I know one step closer would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line

I've tried to forget you but what else can I do
When your eyes keep saying that you love me too
I know if I lose you not a dream will I have left
I don't want to cheat dear but I can't help myself

Don't let me cross over love's cheating line
You belong to another and you'll never be mine
I know one step closer would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line
