Somebody, somebody put something in my drink, somebody

Another night out on the street
Stopping for my usual seat
Oh, bartender, please

Tanqueray and tonic's my favorite drink
I don't like anything colored pink
That just stinks, it's not for me

It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something

Blurred vision and dirty thoughts
Feel out of place, very distraught
Feel something coming on

Yeah, kick the jukebox, slam the floor
Drink, drink, drink, drink some more
I can't think
Hey, what's in this drink?

It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
In my drink
In my drink
In my drink
In my drink

So you think it's funny, a college prank
Goin' insane for something to drink
Feel a little dry

Oh, I couldn't care what you think of me
'Cause somebody put something in my drink
I can't think
Hey, give me a drink

It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something (in my drink)
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something (in my drink)
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something (in my drink)
Somebody put something in my drink
