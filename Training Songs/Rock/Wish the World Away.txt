I don't need anybody's love, I couldn't afford it anyway
With my penny's worth of hope, that's not funny but it's a joke
And I got a good one for the collection agency
It's a wish that I could wish the world away, I could wish the world away

Don't watch TV, it's all lies, I watch TV day and night
I believe everything I see and I can't turn it off
The only thing that kept me together in the good old days
Was a wish that you could wish the world away

Yeah, you could wish the world away
You could wish the world away
You could wish the world away

Where's the message in the bottle? Where's the miracle in the pill?
Where's the nurse with that needle? Where is all of my free will?
Count down backwards from ten and everything's okay
You can wish, you can wish the world away

You can wish the world away
You can wish the world away
You can wish the world away
I can wish
