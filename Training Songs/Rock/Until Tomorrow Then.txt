If the world did end
Would you be my apocalyptic friend?
Until tomorrow then
If the skies did fall
Would you pick up my last call?
Until tomorrow then
Navigate to the moon
Flee the planet this afternoon
Until tomorrow then
With the waves rising high
We'd be the first most likely to die
Until tomorrow then

I guess it's you I miss
'Cause I just stare at the ceiling
My stomach knots and twists
You've created this feeling
And I may be out of style
But do you know what true love is?
I'll make this all so worthwhile
So let's rise above this
Rise above this

So I dug a tunnel underground
And waited patiently to be found
Until tomorrow then
All my ideas make them laugh
But in the end you will see they're not so daft
And we'll have sorrow to spend

I guess it's you I miss
'Cause I just stare at the ceiling
My stomach knots and twists
You've created this feeling
I may be out of style
But do you know what true love is?
I'll make this all so worthwhile
So let's rise above this
Let's rise above this
Let's rise above this
