I'll never understand
(Come closer and I'll whisper)
Who was that standing in the rain?
If only I could, if only I could remember
What he said
(And how it all began)

Happy the man
With the face that smiles
Happy the man
With the face that smiles

But it has to have a name
(Something strong, something faithful, something pure)
How does he look so safe?

He'll never, he'll never turn away
Happy the man
He'll never turn away
Happy the man
Happy the man
Happy the man

Happy
