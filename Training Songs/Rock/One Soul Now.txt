Abandon all those precious things
One soul now
Carry only what twilight brings
One soul now
Watch the color drain from the sky
One soul now
Stillness settles, glides on by
One soul now

[Chorus]
I don't understand how these things
Move the way they do
Collide the way they do
Feel the way they do
When we touch the way we do

Fireflies drift on a midnight fog
One soul now
Twinkling gifts from a puzzling god
One soul now
Journey out into the fields
One soul now
Crane our necks and watch us wheel
One soul now

[Chorus: x2]

Feel the weight of all those slings
One soul now
Carrying only what twilight brings
One soul now
One soul now
