Shattered dreams, worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began, then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well
The many sounds that greet our ears
The sights our eyes befall
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever

Without despair, we will share
And the joys of caring will not be erased
What has been, must never end
The joys of caring will not be replaced
When the seeds of love have planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the songs of love I sing to you
Will echo in my mind

Hey!
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever. I said.
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever. yeah!
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever.
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever. yeah!

I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.
You know god has answered my prayers
Won't you listen to me now
God for sure will answer my prayers
Won't you listen to me now
God will answer your prayers
Just ask him and god is sure to answer all your prayers
Oh come on and lets fall in love

Your the one that I've been waiting for
Come on lets fall in love
Your the woman that I adore
Don't you want to
Fall in love with me baby
Don't you want to
Fall in love with me this time, this time, this time
Oh, no no no
Don't you want to fall

It will be forever
It will be forever
Don't you want to fall in love
Come on, come on don't you want to fall in love
With me forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
It will be forever
