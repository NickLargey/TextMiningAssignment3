Life goes on day after day, after day, after day
Who-ha who-ha
Who-ha who-ha

Ha
The animals are winding me up
The jungle call
The jungle call
Who-ha who-ha who-ha who-ha
In Xanadu did Kublai Khan
A pleasure dome erect
Moving on keep moving on-yeah
Moving at one million miles an hour
Using my power
I sell it by the hour
I have it so I market it
You really can't afford it-yeah
Really can't afford it

Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top
Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top

There goes a supernova
What a pushover-yeah
There goes a supernova
What a pushover

We're a long way from home
Welcome to the Pleasure dome
On our way home
Going home where lovers roam
Long way from home
Welcome to the Pleasure dome

Moving on keep moving on
I will give you diamonds by the shower
Love your body even when it's old
Do it just as only I can do it

Never, ever doing what I'm told
Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top
Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top
