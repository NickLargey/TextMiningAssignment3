I've been twisting and turning, 
In a space that's too small. 
I've been drawing the line and watching it fall, 
You've been closing me in, closing the space in my heart. 
Watching us fading and watching it all fall apart. 

[Chorus]
Well I can't explain why it's not enough, cause I gave it all to you. 
And if you leave me now, oh just leave me now. 
Its the better thing to do, 
Its time to surrender, 
Its been to long pretending. 
There's no use in trying, 
When the pieces don't fit anymore, Pieces don't fit here anymore. 

You pulled me under, 
I had to give in. 
Such a beautiful myth, 
That's breaking my skin. 
Well I'll hide all the bruises, 
I'll hide all the damage that's done. 
But I show how I'm feeling until all the feeling has gone. 

[Chorus]

Ooh don't misunderstand, 
How I feel. 
Cause I've tried, yes I've tried. 
But still I don't know why, no I don't know why. 
I don't know why, why! 

[Chorus]
