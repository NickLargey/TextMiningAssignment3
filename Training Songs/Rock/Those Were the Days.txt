There’s a teacher in the class
With a tight grip on my ear
And I know he won’t let go
Until I can force a tear
So I cry the best I can
To eliminate the pain
Now I forget what I did wrong
All I remember is the shame
Still they’re saying
Those were the days
So simple and so clear
Those were the days
With only God to fear
Those were the days
When people weren’t afraid
Those were the days of hoping
Father Father, I confess
In my ignorance and haste
I was caught out with this girl
Now I am no longer chaste
Human instinct is a flaw
In this theory you have built
Though it’s a blessing in disguise
Now I know it to be guilt
Still they’re saying
Those were the days
So simple and so clear
Those were the days
With only God to fear
Those were the days
When people weren’t afraid
Those were the days of hoping
Those were the days
When everything was right
Those were the days
When people used to fight
Those were the days
When people weren’t afraid
Those were the days
(Listen to me)
Those were the days
So simple and so clear
Those were the days
With only God to fear
Those were the days
When we weren’t afraid
(Those were the days)
Those were the days
So simple and so clear
Those were the days
