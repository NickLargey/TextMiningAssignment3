I will reach out
To switch you on
I will reach out
Till you come
I will reach out
To turn you on
I will reach out
Until you come
We're the masters
Of the superblaster
Don't start playing games
You can't finish
Don't open doors
When you don't know what's waiting
Don't try to close your hands
They're smaller than the rain
Have you got anything left to say
Before I shoot myself
I will reach out
To find the truth
I will reach out
To steal your youth
We're the masters
Of the superblaster
Don't start playing games
You can't finish
Don't open doors
When you don't know what's waiting
Don't try to close your hands
They're smaller than the rain
Have you got anything left to say
Oh no
Oh no
I will reach out
To switch you on
I will reach out
To steal your youth
An that's the god's honest truth
We're the masters
Of the superblaster
