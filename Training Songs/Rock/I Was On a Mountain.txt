I was hanging on by a little thread.
Just minutes before I was on a mountain.
I screamed "I can see all."
The ground broke from the sound.
It was all built on nothing.
And the pretty lights down below
Begged me to just let go;
To let myself be condemned;
To start again

I opened up my aching hands.
I went down like an avalanche.
I took with me the things I found.
I used them to help slow me down,
And start again.

Chorus:
Caution: The solid ground that you
Are on will slide from under you.
