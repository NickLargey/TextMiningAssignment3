Every evening when I walk through the door
I hear the same old lies that I've heard before:
you're going out for the evening, going out with a friend.
Do you really want me to believe that again?
 You're telling white lies, you're telling white lies.
 I can see right through that this disguise.
 Can't you tell I can tell when you're telling white lies?
Take these chains and set me free,
release me from this misery.
Now, don't you waste my time with your alibis
'cause your heart can't hide what I see in your eyes.
 You're telling white lies, you're telling white lies.
 I can see right through that thin disguise.
 Can't you tell I can tell when you're telling white lies?
Every evening when I walk through that door
I get the same old lies that I've heard before:
you're going out for the evening, going out with a friend.
Do you really want me to believe that again?
 You're telling white lies, you're telling whire lies.
 I can see right through that thin disguise.
 Can't you tell I can tell when you're telling white lies?
 You're telling white lies, you're telling white lies.
 I can see right through that thin disguise.
 Can't you tell I can tell when you're telling white lies?
 White lies
 white lies
 white lies
