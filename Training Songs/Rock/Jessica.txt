When you walked into the room looking like Jean Harlow
Oh Jessie, everyone looked at you, you're a lady
Though I know that you've been around the world
Maybe two or three times in your daddy's pocket
I'm gonna break that rich-bitch thing with you

Oh, Jessica, you're a lady
If it takes all night you're gonna be nice
Oh, Jessica, I think lady
That sold, hard front could melt like ice
Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, Jessica
Cold like a killer's eyes
Stay with me Jessica

You're a lady of the world, you've been to Paris and London
But Jessie, it doesn't mean a thing to you when you're lonely
Though you'd have to have a heart of stone
to put me on my knees
I know you ain't got it
I'm gonna get to you no matter what you do

Oh, Jessica, you're a lady
If it takes all night you're gonna be nice
Oh, Jessica, I think lady
That sold, hard front could melt like ice
Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, Jessica
Cold like a killer's eyes
Stay with me Jessica

Jessica, you're a lady
Jessica, you're a lady
Jessica, Jessica, oh
Jessica, you're a lady
Take me home in your big black car
Oh Jessica, I think lady
You're not as hard as they think you are

Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, Jessica
Fire up your cold heart
And stay with me, Jessica
Stay with me, Jessica
Stay with me, Jessica
Jessica, you're a lady
Jessica, you're a lady
Jessica, Jessica
