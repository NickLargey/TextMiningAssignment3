There are times, when you know
Love is lost to he who hesitates and you've got that
Feeling now you know it too well
Say O.K., to your dreams
Never let that chance go by again
If it's love you need then listen and listen well

You've got to run like a young love
You've got to love like young love
Believe me you'll be a young love
You don't need to be anymore
You can think like a young love
Be strong like a young love
You can run like a young love
You don't need to be anymore

Live it now, everyday
'cause you know there is no better way
And in time you'll understand it's all in your heart
Lightning strikes, in the rain
But you know inside you're strong again
You can hear the thunder roll
But you stand apart

You've got to run like a young love
You can love like young love
Believe me you'll be a young love
You don't need to be anymore
As long as you think like a young love
Be strong like a young love
You can run like a young love
You don't need to be anymore
