Hear me, I'm calling
I can't believe it's happening again
Help me, I'm falling
Making the same mistakes again

Hold me, just hold me
You told me what was right and what was wrong
And I can't stand the feeling
I never found the words to the song
If I hold myself together
The pain won't last forever

I've had an overdose, I've had an overdose of life
I've had an overdose, I've had an overdose of life
I've had an overdose, I've had an overload of life
I can't take anymore

It's too late to change the way you're feeling
About leaving me
It's so sad this is the way it has to be
But now I see
I gotta hold myself together
The pain won't last forever

I've had an overdose, I've had an overdose of life
I've had an overdose, I've had an overdose of life
I've had an overdose, I've had an overload of life
I've had an overdose, I've had an overload of life

Because I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
I want to tell you, wanna tell you, want to tell you I love you
I can't take anymore, oh no
And it's so sad that you're leaving
It's over now
I can't take anymore
