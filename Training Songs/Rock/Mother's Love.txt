Hey now Mama, do you feel your life is over now? 
Hey honey, don't you worry, I'll stay by your side
The time of your life is yet to come, but it's coming soon. 
Hold on and I'll take you to the end of another time

And you, you always believed me true
You always believed my heart's ache
I don't believe you know
I want you to see

Sitting here holding your hand 
I don't wanna sing this song for you
When you're gone
I want you to see

Sitting here holding your hand
And I never really wanted to say goodnight, oh no no no

Little sweet Mama you will be all right,
Goodnight
There are some things that I want you to hear from me
Why you, my god

Take my whole damn world instead
Listen closely and I'll tell you all these things that you will never see

And you, you always believed me true
You always believed my heart's ache
I don't believe you know

I want you to see
Sitting here holdinge your hand
I don't want to sing this song for you
When you're gone

I want you to see
Sitting here holding your hand
And I never really want to say goodbye
Oh no, no, no
