Jesus
I don't want to die
Alone

Jesus
Oh Jesus
I don't want to die
Alone

My love wasn't true
Now all I have is you

Jesus
Oh Jesus
I don't want to die
Alone

Jesus
If you hear
My last breath

Don't leave me here
Left to die a lonely death

I know I have sinned
But lord I'm suffering

Jesus
Oh Jesus
If you hear
My last breath

Repeat 1st verse
Jesus
Jesus

All my troubles
All my pain
Will leave me
Once again
X3

Once again
