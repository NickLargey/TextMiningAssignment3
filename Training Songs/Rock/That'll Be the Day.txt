Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yeah, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Well, you give me all your lovin' and your turtle dovin'
All your hugs and kisses and your money too
Well, you know you love me baby, but still you tell me maybe
That some day, well I'll be through

Yeah, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yeah, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

When cupid shot his dart, he shot it at your heart
So if we ever part and I leave you
You say you'll hold me and you, you tell me boldly
That some day well I'll be through

Yeah, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yeah, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Well, that'll be the day, yeah, that'll be the day
That'll be the day, that'll be the day, yeah, that'll be the day
Well that'll be the day

That'll be the day
