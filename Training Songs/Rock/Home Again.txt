I count the cars out on the highway
I think about you now and then
The stars are out and no one knows me
'Til I'm home again

The sun will breaks across the water
A warm reminder on the wind
The days are sweet but what I want is to be home again
To be home again and I'm home again

And the stars keep shining but I'll never look back
Let the stars keep shining but I'll never look back

The map is tearing at the corners
I can't remember where I've been
The world unfolding while the highway takes me home again
And I'm home again, and I'm home again

And the stars keep shining but I'll never look back
Let the stars keep shining but I'll never look back
'Cause I'm home again

And I'm home again, wanna be home again
Gonna go home again, gonna go home again
Wanna be home
