Here's to your garden here's to your kids
I heard you were in the neighbourhood
I've been a long time on the skids
And baby I'm beside you - you run from the river

When it long ran over you
This is for you standing up to a bone-chilling wind
This is for the failures you collected from my sin
And this is for your lonesome tears I never dried

This is for you hanging in in the hope that it never dies
And baby I'm beside you - you run from the river
When it long ran over you
This is for you waiting up though the call never came

For the milk of human kindnesses you collected from our dream
And this is for your lonesome tears I never dried
This is for you hanging in in the hope that it never died
And baby I'm beside you - you run from the river

When it long ran over you
And now I'm running here beside you
And now I'm running here beside you
This is for the traveler on a blinding desert road

Good fortune smile upon you and may love be your only load
And this is for the only one who could quell my burning rage
To anyone whose been a broken man and anyone seen better days
Baby I'm beside you

And now I'm running here beside you
And now I'm running here beside you
