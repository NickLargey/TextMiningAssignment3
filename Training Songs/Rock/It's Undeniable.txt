It doesn't matter what you need just where you go to get it
It doesn't matter what you've done there's no need to regret it
If you're a loser just like me then life hasn't been easy
Maybe you were waiting for the wake up call
And when it came, your line was busy

I know it's happened to me. And it will happen again
If I don't slow down and listen (and listen)

It's undeniable; we're so much smaller than we think we are

The first step that I needed to take was giving God control
That's a struggle for me everyday, and I'm letting you all know
There's a willingness that comes alive
When you begin tearing down the walls
But the first step is so very hard if you take a first step at all

I know it's happened to me. And it will happen again
If I don't slow down and listen (and listen)
If I don't sit down and listen (and listen)

When we've built up walls around us our hardened hearts can't bear
The healing hurts so badly that no one seems to care
And after all, and after all
