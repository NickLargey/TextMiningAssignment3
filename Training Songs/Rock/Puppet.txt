What is that look up on your face
A simple mood
Have I fallen from grace
Don't you tell me nothing is wrong
For just have more
Should this be going on
Is the sky too grey
Did your milk taste bad today?
Did I fade it bad, was it something I have said, was it something I have said?
There we go on and on again
The same old game

Of me to blame, of me to blame
Here I go jumping round the bed
A stupid me
'cause you're the king
And I'm your puppet on a string, and I'm your puppet on a string
Is it so hard to understand
This situation is getting out of here
But maybe there's something I've missed
A brand new love
That's why you look so pissed

Did I drive you mad in my wearing that old hat
Tell me what to do
Should I paint the Grey sky blue, the Grey sky blue?
I wish I could look into your head
And read your thoughts
They're so instead, they're so instead
Here we go on and on again
The same old game
When you're the king
And I'm your puppet on a string

I'm your puppet on a string
I'm your puppet on a string
Ouhou
Should I leave or stay
Should I kiss your blues away
Tell me what to do
I do anything for you
Do anything, 'cause I'm not
I#m just like your puppet on a string
You've cupet me

Just hanging on
Now hear my song
I'm just like a puppet on a string
Oh can't you see
You're killin' me
Ouhou well I've had the thought to leave
I'm just like your puppet on a string
For in this game
You always win
I'm your puppet on a string, I'm your puppet on a string
