Take a run at the sun 
When you think of the one
Brings a cloud to your eye
Every moment you smile 
Rain lets up for awhile
Sun starts clearing your sky

Every night you cry alone 
Every tear a raindrop
And every time you're on your own
And you wish the hurt would stop
The sun will never hurt you 
The warmth of rays will hold you
And every time you wonder why 
Remember what I told you

You've been waiting for a sign 
You wouldn't need if you were mine
The littlest clouds could feel the sun shine

Take a run at the sun 
When you think of the one
Brings a cloud to your eye
Every moment you smile 
Rain lets up for a while
Sun starts clearing your sky
Let the rays come inside 
They'll make everything right
Let the sun embrace you
All the feelings you hide 
Let 'em go with the tide
Give the moon a place too

You been hurt the cloud's rolling 
Your heart is close to broken
Don't want to move you're feeling down 
Catch the rain it's coming 'round
The sun would never hurt you 
The warmth of rays will hold you
And every time you wonder why 
Remember what I told you

Take a run at the sun 
When you think of the one
Brings a cloud to your eye
Every moment you smile 
Rain lets up for a while
Sun starts clearing your sky
Let the rays come inside 
They'll make everything right
Let the sun embrace you
All the feelings you hide 
Let 'em go with the tide
Give the moon a place too
Take a run at the sun
Take a run at the sun
Take a run at the sun
Take a run at the sun
