He likes to argue
She likes it loud
He likes his bath water hot
She's not to read his paper, wow
He wants another daughter
But she's through with labor
It's so much more exciting
Somewhere pleasant
Like Hawaii in the winter
Like Hawaii in the fall
Like Hawaii spring or summer
It's Hawaii after all

He wants a macaw
She doesn't mind
They watch the X-Files
Sundays at nine
She said we'll make a daughter
It's gotta be just perfect
It's so much more exciting
Somewhere pleasant
Like Hawaii in the winter
Like Hawaii in the fall
Like Hawaii spring or summer
It's Hawaii after all

The plane is overcrowded
The hotel is too tall
The souvenirs are cheesy
Little dancing hula dolls

And he's her big kahuna
With plastic lai and all
And she is still his cheesy little dancing hula doll
In Hawaii in the winter
In Hawaii in the fall
In Hawaii spring or summer
It's Hawaii after all

Aloha
