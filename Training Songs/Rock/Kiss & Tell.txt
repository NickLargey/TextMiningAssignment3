When you walk, you don't leave tracks
When you talk they don't talk back
Believe in every word you say
But they don't know, they don't, don't know
Secrets that you just cant keep
Promises that you made me
You twisted it to suit yourself,
But now I know, I know, I know
Ooh everything that I told you
Ooh you just smile and then you

Kiss and tell
Everything I say
Stuck inside your little web
Everybody wants to know, yeah
Lips that lie
Cover your track
Sold me out and
You just laugh
Say we're friends until the end, yeah, but you

Don't mean it
You don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it, no

I wish I could take it back
You want it all but you cant have that
People falling at your feet,
But they don't know, they don't, don't know
You're gonna figure out real soon
The dirty deeds will catch up to you
Its crumbling beneath your feet,
But you don't know, you don't, don't know
Ooh everything that I told you
Ooh you just smile and then you

Kiss and tell
Everything I say
Stuck inside your little web
Everybody wants to know, yeah
Lips that lie
Cover your track
Sold me out and
You just laugh
Say we're friends until the end, yeah, but you

Don't mean it
You don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it, no

Ooh everything that I told you
Ooh everything that I told you

Ooh you just smile and then you

Kiss and tell
Everything I say
Stuck inside your little web
Everybody wants to know, yeah
Lips that lie
Cover your track
Sold me out and
You just laugh
Say we're friends until the end, yeah, but you

Don't mean it
You don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it, no
