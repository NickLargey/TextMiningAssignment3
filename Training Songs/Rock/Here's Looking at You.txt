As I sit staring into this liquid amber
Ripples move out to the edge of the glass
Is that really your reflection in there?
I just want to jump into the warm depths
And be there with you one more time!
Oh alright
Hit it boys!
My initials sprayed across a pavement
Cut into your private winter room
Talk to me now
Step into my room we'll have a word or two
If I ever had a million dollars
If I didn't give it all to you 
Would you lose interest?
Show me indifference?
Foot in another shoe?
Not very high heels
Not wearing sneakers too
A magazine ad a printed canvas
A basic mid shade blue suede shoe
Thought I'd like to have a little party
Thought I'd like to have a little do
Sure I stopped drinking 
But for the moment honey here's looking at you!
I'll stop my drinking give you my promise true
Clean out the closet
Be existential and cast a vote for the president too
But for the action of the moment
Nothing does what it ought to do
Instant depression I learned my lesson
Nothing that I'd rather do
Come on over my place
Can't see him sideways
Honey here's looking at you
