Could've kept the cigarette
Could've always had a handgun
Could've been exterminator
Could've had a lot of fun

It's the legal drugs that wear most down
They say what's done is done
Parabolic louver lighting
Really got have some

First things first
Gotta know the brake, the accelerator
Save the jokes and save your soul
You're gonna need them later

[Chorus]
Another day to face up
Another day to wake up
On the feed kill chain 
Another day to face up
Another day to wake up
On the feed kill chain

Feed kill chain

Off hand mouth mind
Watch out, don't let your guard down
Been through the mill and now
It just goes round and round

Bells and whistles left and right
Goodbye to the altered turning
Don't want to get caught up
Just knowingly burning

First things first
Gotta know the brake, the accelerator
Save the jokes and save your soul
You're gonna need them later

[Chorus]
