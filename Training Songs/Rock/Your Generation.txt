Trying to forget your generation
You know all the ways when in what I see
The ends must justify the means
Your generation don't mean a thing to me
I say your generation don't mean a thing to me
I say your generation don't mean a thing to me

Might take a bit of violence
But violence ain't our only stance
Might make our friends enemies
But we gotta take that chance

There ain't no time for substitutes
There ain't no time for idle threats
Actions are rather hard to place
'Cause what you give is what you get

So, that's your generation
It's your generation
Well it's your generation
It's your generation

It time for generation
