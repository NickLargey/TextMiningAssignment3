Sometimes you can't cope with life,
You think there's nothing you can do
The whole world seems to be caving in and burying you
All the hatred and the hypocrisy, the punishment of truth,
The sickness and the cynicism, that strips away your youth
If you could find a crack in this faceless wall
And push your fingers through,
Your hand will touch another hand 'cause I'm buried here, too.

Come on! Let's join up!
Let's rise out of this dirt,
Escape from this oppression, this anger and this hurt
The ignorance, intolerance, stupidity and lies,
Spreading like a virus and ruining our lives
All we need is honesty to push away this night,
Let's hang on to our innocence and hold each other tight

And we could cure ourselves if we believe it's possible,
Let's lie down on this couch and make ourselves more comfortable
We've come to the oasis that we've both been searching for,
So let's lay down our weapons and forget this stupid war
We'll listen to each other, our wounds will start to heal,
It's starting out as role-play, but it ends up being real

I heal you,
If you take care of me
And we lose ourselves
In soul therapy

We'll dive into our deepest fears, delve into our souls
We'll face up to our nightmares until the fear dissolves
And when you meet your enemies, I'll be there by your side,
From man or god or devil you will never need to hide
All we need is honesty to push away the night
Let's hang on to each other,
Let's hold each other tight

I heal you,
If you take care of me
We lose ourselves
In soul therapy

I heal you,
If you take care of me
And we lose ourselves
In soul therapy

I heal you,
If you take care of me
And we lose ourselves
In soul therapy

And we'll find ourselves
In soul therapy
