It was a young and angry summer
A song that changed my mind
I heard it on the radio
And if everyone else heard this
It wouldn't be so sad
It was the best I ever had
It was the best I ever had

I remember April '94
September '96
And every day of '99 (all of '99)
Whether I waited for those records
Or helped Seattle cry
It was the best I ever had
And I know we'll never die

Yeah we were right about it
We'd be lost without it
Yeah what could ever take that?

I miss it too
And I miss the songs we knew
And if I could go back
I'd do it all again
It was the best I ever had

While the world was waking up and
Putting on their suits
I was planning my escape
And when I had that conversation
With my mom and dad
I said I'm never looking back
It was the best I ever had

And they were wrong about us
We showed them not to doubt us
Yeah what could ever take that?

I miss it too
And I miss the songs we knew
And if I could go back
I'd do it all again
It was the best I ever had

I'd do it all again

I've been everywhere now
Searching far and wide
But she was down the street
She looked just like an angel
Flying down to me
But I was underground
Where the devil comes to feed

And everything felt so right
I could show it to do wrong
But she taught me everything
And I don't know where she is now
But I'll never forget
She was the best I ever had
Or ever will again
The best I ever had

And if everyone else heard this
They wouldn't be so sad
It was the best I ever had
