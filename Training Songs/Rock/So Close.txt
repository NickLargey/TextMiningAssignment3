There is a better way to live our lives
And I must find it if I can
But when I speak of change you look at me strange
Sometimes you just don't understand

So close (so close) yet so far
So close (so close) yet it's au revoir
So close (so close) but it's not the way it seems
So close (so close) but dreaming different dreams

I always try to tell you where I came from
What I believe and who I am
I just can't see how we could ever agree
We always end where we began

So close (so close) yet so far
So close (so close) yet it's au revoir
So close (so close) but it's not the way it seems

So close (so close) but dreaming different dreams

I don't believe in the things you believe I can't stay
tonight
Can't compramise we must say our goodbyes the feeling
isn't right
Although we are far apart I know we've been close
It won't be easy to forget
Our world is upside down and when it's turned round
I won't deny that once we met

So close (so close) yet so far
So close (so close) yet it's au revoir
So close (so close) but it's not the way it seems
So close (so close) but dreaming different dreams

Repeat chorus (x3)
