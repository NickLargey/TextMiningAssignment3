All he needed was PR
A million box of business cards
Careful image consultation
Securing reputation 

A clever market plan
He didn't understand
That's all it really takes
He could have played for higher stakes 

Now
Somehow
We've gone wrong

[Chorus]
This Jesus thing, it's a smash hit
It's packaged right
All stocks have split, it's a smash hit, 
It's gone worldwide

Join His name to any cause
Drop His name to get applause
They never get enough
Nothing here to be ashamed of

Those ever loyal fans
They want to get their hands
On His newest merchandising
Ignoring overpricing

Now
Oh Wow
We've gone wrong

[Chorus]

It has no explanation
It smells like exploitation

[Chorus]
