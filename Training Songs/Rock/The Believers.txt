Muddy trail beside the water
Leads the lambs into the slaughter
Hands and knees, we all atone
Path is paved with blood and bone
Trembly hands reveal their purpose
Blisters form beneath the surface
No one gonna make us leave
We're the ones that still believe

Fear comes piercing through the silence
In the air, the scent of violence
Watching from above the trees
We're the ones that still believe
We're the ones that still believe
We're the ones that still believe
