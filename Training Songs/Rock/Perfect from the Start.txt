I was born a fortunate son
Mother gave me all her fear and attention
I worked to prove my worth to everyone
Earned my degree in self-destruction
There is little reward
For all that glorified pain
I got this soul-search hunger
You got this deep-heart desire
Though we try to deny
We were perfect from the start
Perfect from the start
Perfect from the start
I was torn from my little-girl trust
By dad who left me with nothing but silence
I've looked to drink and sex ever since
To find reprieve from this life sentence
There is no hiding
From the world inside
I got this soul-search hunger
You got this deep-heart desire
Though we try to deny
We were perfect from the start
Perfect from the start
Perfect from the start
There is no hiding
From the world inside
I got this soul-search hunger
You got this deep-heart desire
Though we try to deny
We were perfect from the start
Perfect from the start
Perfect from the start
