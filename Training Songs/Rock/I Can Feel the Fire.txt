I can feel the fire
I can feel the fire, oh yeah
I can feel the fire, burnin'
I can feel the fire, burnin'

I can see you by my side
Picture you here by my side

I can feel the fire, buzzin'
I can feel the fire, ragin'up inside
I can feel the fire, burnin' oh yeah
I can feel the fire, burnin', burnin'

I can hear you calling me
Prettiest girl that I've ever seen

I can see you in the alley
(whatcha doin' down there baby)
I can feel you in the alley
(got ya uppa my mind)
I think I can hear you in the alley

I can see you by my side
Gimmie a chance to slip inside
I can feel the fire
