Distant, but alive
The soul of a wounded child
A million remedies tried
A million and one tonight
Do ya wanna face it or hope?

You can't let go of your heart and soul
Hey, do you wanna show me?
Do you wanna feel this from the inside?

Looking for a sign
She rides a wounded sky
A million symmetries hide
Escaping her wandering eyes
Do you wanna chase it or hope?

You can't let go of your heart and soul
Hey, do you wanna show me?
Do you wanna feel this from the inside?

And I know you can't let go
You won't open up

You can't let go of your heart and soul
Hey do you wanna show me?
Do you wanna feel this from the inside?

I wanna show you
What this feels like
Come in and feel me from the inside
