Could this be real, it's not a dream
I'm not in touch with the same old scene
Won't break my heart to sacrifice
Tomorrows lies for a higher price
You took my heart and you turned it into heat
Then you chewed it up and threw it in the street

Say goodbye to all the girls who want to hold your hand
That kind of girl is yesterday, she's no longer in demand
You took my heart and you turned it into heat
And then you chewed it up and threw it in the street

I never wanted, you never wanted love
But you take it from me
But you take it from me

I could sleep for a thousand years
I would never share
We can't go on pretending
We would never dare

I never wanted, you never wanted love
But you take it from me 
But you take it from me
