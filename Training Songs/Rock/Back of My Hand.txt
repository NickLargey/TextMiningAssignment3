You only call me if your feeling blue
You tell me I don't pay attention to you
But if you only knew, just what I'm going through
You wouldn't phone those guys who mess around with you girl
When I call you I get stack of lies
You whip 'em out before you dry your eyes
I'm not a fruit machine a nineteen sixties dream
And in the 'bet you' list I bet you've never seen her

Your not unreadable,your not unbeatable,
I know just what you are, don't push your luck too far
Your not untouchable, not just another girl
I'd get in touch with you, I only wish you knew that

[Chorus]
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand 
I've got your number

I had a dream I met another girl
But in the morning she was just a kick inside,
I hope I'm gettin' through the interference too
My money's running out I don't know what to say now
The operator's saying cut the line
You want to call here for the very last time,
You're only young at heart, but there's a time to start
Just realizing what I've got down here girl!

Your not unreadable,your not unbeatable,
I know just what you are, don't push your luck too far
Your not untouchable, not just another girl
I'd get in touch with you, I only wish you knew that

[Chorus]

Say don't you realize
Is there nothing left inside
Hey did I get you wrong
Say where's your number gone

You only call me if your feeling blue
You tell me I don't pay attention to you
But if you only knew, just what I'm going through
You wouldn't phone those guys who mess around with you girl

Your not unreadable, your not unbeatable,
I know just what you are, don't push your luck too far
Your not untouchable, not just another girl
I'd get in touch with you, I only wish you knew that

[Chorus]
