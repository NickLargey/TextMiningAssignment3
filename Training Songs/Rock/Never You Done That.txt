Well who would've guessed?
Well I guess I should
The second night was just as good
By the end of the week we were living as one
Gone two years now we're still together

Day in and day out
For however long
It's the kind of love
That could last forever
Day in and day out
For however long
Each time we kiss you're the perfect stranger

So me say
Don't never you go
Too far away from me girl
Never you done that
Don't never you go too far away
Don't even think of saying it

Don't never you go
Too far away from me girl
Never you done that
Don't never you mention certain words about
No no
Never you done that
Never you done that
Never you done that

Take another stab
Try another play
Maybe a little drink will take the edge off
I'm trying not to slip
Trying to get a grip
But each time we kiss you're the perfect stranger

So me say
Don't never you go
Too far away from me girl
Never you done that
Don't never you mention certain words about
No no
Never you done that
Never you done that
No never you done that
Never you done that

Tired all day
Can't sleep at night
Out of control since
You've been in my sights
Day in day out
It's such a fright
Till you hold me close
And say that it's alright

Don't never you go
Too far away from me girl
Never you mention certain words about
No no
Never you done that
Never you done that
Never you done that
No, never you done that
Never you done that
Never you done that

Well who would've guessed?
Well I guess I might
Another cheerless restless night
Another day gone none too bright
Gone two years do you still remember?

That all the while my mouth was saying "Go"
My heart was screaming no no no
Turn around and look at me
You'll find me on my knees
Saying please please

Don't never you go
Too far away from me girl
Never you done that
Don't never you go too far away
Don't even think of saying it
Don't never you go
Don't never you go far
No never you done that
Never you mention certain words about
No no no no no no no no no no

No, never you done that
Never you done that
Never you done that
Never you done that
Never you done that
Never you done that

No never you done that
Never you
Never you
Never ever ever you
