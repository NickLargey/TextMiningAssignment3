Yesterday's gone
And I'm on the road again
Well, leaving all my problems
Playing out my fantasies

If you wondered how I feel
You get by love soon

I wish I could turn back
I wish I could turn back
Start all over and over again
Oh, oh, yesterday's gone

I'm traveling down this highway
It's all an answer to it all
Never really see
Where we play, yeah, yeah

If we never come back home
I want you all to know

I wish I could turn back
I wish I could turn back
Start all over and over again
Oh, oh, yesterday's gone
Oh, and I'm all alone

On a lonesome highway
Singing my song

I wish I could turn back
I wish I could turn back
I wish I could turn back
Yesterday's gone

I wish I could turn back
I wish I could turn back
I wish I could turn back
Yesterday's gone

I wish I could turn back
I wish I could turn back
I wish I could turn back
Yesterday's gone
