Think back on what you did
How you’d punk all the new kids
The new wave of exclusive
As if there's something new, kid

We're the patient performer
The kid in the corner
We were just tuning you out

We are young and unafraid
We are young and unafraid

Allow me to weigh in
On this conversation
Here's your invitation
To chew someone else's heel
Your concessions are useless
A filter to diffuse this
Now you have to excuse us
We are moving on

It’s the rats in the basement
Trying our patience
We are just tuning you out

We are young and unafraid
We are young and unafraid

Did you think we couldn't feel you there?
Did you think we couldn't feel you there?
Did you think we couldn't hear you there?
Did you think we couldn't hear you there?
We were just tuning you out
We were just tuning you out
We will keep tuning you out

We are young and unafraid
We are young and unafraid
We are young and unafraid
We are young and unafraid
