Finally made contact
She touched my soul and I
Felt the full impact
And the night stood still

Then I kissed her eyes with mine
As she knelt before me
Poured the wine
And told me her story
We lit a fire and watched it grow higher

 Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me (Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me)
 Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me (Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me)
 Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me every night
 It's so perfect

Magic all around, like I never felt before
And the only sound was the cracklin' fire

Then all at once the day was melting the night-time
Shades of dawn burst into sunshine
I took her hand and ran through the mornin'

 Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me (Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me)
 Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me (Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me)
 Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me every night
 It's so perfect

We watched the day melting the night-time
Shades of dawn burst into sunshine
I took her hand and ran through the morning

 Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me (Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me)
 Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me (Sunshine girl, won't you stay with me)
 Sunshine girl, Sunshine girl, Sunshine girl, Sunshine girl
 Sunshine girl, Sunshine girl, Sunshine girl, Sunshine girl
 Sunshine girl, Sunshine girl
