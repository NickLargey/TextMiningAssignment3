Here we goooo....come on

You talk so much
You scream in my face
Don't know how to let it go
My nose gets punched every time I say

“We're only friend you know”

I feel jealousy baby
Jealousy coming
Your face turns ugly and old
Midnight lady
Precious little baby
Woman your ego has grown

Why don't you just wash your ugly mouth

 
My good reputation give me a friend that I don't know
It´s Tricky situation cause my girl think she's a whore
She's a midnight lady
Precious little baby
Woman your ego has grown
My good reputation give me a friend that I don't know
