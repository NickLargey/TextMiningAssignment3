Her heart is like a fortress.
She clings to her silence like a lover.
She wishes you were cold and heartless
So she wouldn't...
Wouldn't have to... feel.
Oh and when she lifts her head,
And your eyes meet,
She walks to your effortless,
With suffocating grace.
And you're caught up in the moment
And someone speaks,
And whisks it all away.

But this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends.
This moment never ends.

I've loved her forever, and in my dreams,
When the evening meets morning,
We're riding bareback moonbeams.
She belongs to different spaces.
She belongs to different times.

And this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends,
This moment never ends.

At these moments it was clear,
It's taken all my life... to get here.
Se waits for me at
The door way while I draw her pictures
Of my perfect world ...

And this moment never ends
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends,
This moment never ends.
