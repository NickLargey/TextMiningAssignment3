Go down to the sea
And tell me what it is that you wanna be
I said go, down to the sea
And tell me what it is that you wanna be

Gonna' take this boat and drive it out into the sea
Gonna' fly this place so high that I won't know what's real
Gonna' paint the sky so red that I won't wanna feel
What my mama and my daddy said was real

'Cause I can feel it, I can see it, 
Yeah I wanna show anybody who wants to see it
'Cause I can feel it,
And I won't be there to see

Got something, got something to say
Got something, got something to say

Can you see it in your thoughts? 
Can you reach it does it make you wanna walk
Can you taste it any feeling that you got
Tell me something over nothing ain't so wrong

'Cause I can feel it, I can see it, 
Yeah I wanna show anybody who wants to see it
'Cause I can feel it,
And I won't be there to see

What you, don't know
Is that I'm feeling strong
I'll have my eyes set on you
Forever

Got something, got something to say
Got something, got something to say
Got something, got something to say
Got something, got something to say
Got something if you only, only, only stay
