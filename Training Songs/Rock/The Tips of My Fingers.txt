I reached out my arms and I touched you 
With soft words I whispered your name 
I held your love on the tips of my fingers 
But that was as close as I came 
My eyes had a vision of sweet lips 
Yielding beneath my command 
I held you right on the tips of my fingers 
But I let you slip right through my hands 
Yes I let you slip right through my hands 

Somebody took you when I wasn't looking 
I should have known from the start 
It's a long, long way from the tips of my fingers 
To the love hidden deep in your heart 
To the love hidden deep in your heart 

Somebody took you when I wasn't looking 
I should have known from the start 
It's a long, long way from the tips of my fingers 
To the love hidden deep in your heart 
To the love hidden deep in your heart 

I held your love on the tips of my fingers 
But I let you slip right through my hands 
Yes I let you slip right through my hands 

I held your love on the tips of my fingers
