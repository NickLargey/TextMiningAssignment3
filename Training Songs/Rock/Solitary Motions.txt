I still have a place for you to be quiet, silently
I still have my lap here for you, for you
And the box that I gave you
Keeps you safe from the world
Crawl inside, surrender to the hands of time

I was looking for something that was already there
Understand now life has always been to me
Solitary motions, solitary motions, solitary motions
Solitary motions, solitary motions, solitary motions

On the edge of the breaking down, we sit and we cry
When the feeling is too strong, we just crawl up and hide.
I call it solitary motions, motions, motions
I call it solitary motions, motions, motions

Missing feeling fills the light in my mind, painting it black
That missing feeling sneaks up on me and makes me
Makes me hollow, makes me hollow

I was looking for something that was already there
Understand now life has always been to me
Solitary motions, solitary motions, solitary motions 
Solitary motions, solitary motions, solitary motions

On the edge of the breaking down, we sit and we cry
When the feeling is too strong, we just crawl up and hide
I call it solitary motions, motions, motions
I call it solitary motions
