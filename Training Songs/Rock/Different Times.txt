You came at a crazy time 
But you picked a perfect time 
You could not come at a better time I know
You've chosen a brilliant time 
To learn how to be strong 
We find strength in ourselves 
They wonder
How dare I believe in this world 
And how we're going to live through this sickness
And that there are miraculous moments 
To take us through these insane times. 
You've chosen such beautiful eyes 
To see everything. 
You've chosen such a beautiful life 
I know
You've earned it and still you wonder 
How it is that you are the beloved 
And why you're so extremely important 
Because you may cry a few times 
You may feel sad at times I know 
It's all to learn how to live and to love 
It's all to learn how to trust 
There are no 
Wrong colors
