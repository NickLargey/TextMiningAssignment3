Chorus
Just let me take it, my mind can't make it without ...
I can't take it, said I just can't make it.
Just let me take it, my mind can't make it without ...
I can't take it, so you best not take it.

I've been waitin' for such, such a long, long time,
To tell you all about these feelings of mine.
Something tells me there just has to be a better day,
And that's why I came here to say ...

Chorus

Growing up, I was free in my childhood years,
And now they tell me I can wash away my tears.
These tears explain the way, it's the way that I feel,
Because the freedom they give me is real.

Chorus

Chorus

I want freedom, the kind that they promised me,
Just for livin' in this country.
I want the freedom, the kind that makes me feel strong,
But, let me tell you, something is wrong.
