You are, you are
A sad, sad person
Always been
A sad, sad person
It's not that bad
You just [?]
And question everything you do
You're never satisfied

Love is a disease
The strongest addiction I know
What happens in the brain
Is the same as the rush of cocaine
The more you have
The more you crave
[?]
Since [?]

I'm not gonna hurt you
'Cause I'm flirting with you
I'm not gonna hurt myself
So what else? What else? What else?
What else?
What else?

I wanna know why I hesitate
To brace myself and love you
To brace myself a good, good, girl
To face myself and hear me roar
You wanna know why I change my mind
And when I did everything was fine
Sometimes the truth is right there, right there
If you're beautiful here, you're beautiful there

I am, I am
A sad, sad person
Always been
A sad, sad person

What do I do?
I'm not gonna hurt you
'Cause I'm fluttered with you
I'm not gonna hurt myself
So what else? What else? What else?
What else? What else?

I'm not gonna hurt you
I'm not gonna hurt myself
'Cause I'm flirting with you
So what else? What else? What else?
You can [?]
We can [?]
All the truth is right here

I'm not gonna hurt you
'Cause I'm flirting with you
I'm not gonna hurt myself
So what else? What else? What else?
