A train roll on, on down the line
Won't you please take me far away?
Now feel the wind blowing outside my door
Means I, I'm leaving my woman behind

Lordy, Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Gone again

And I don't know, oh where I'm going, see ya
I just want to be left alone
Yeah, now this train ends I'll try again, Lords call in
Leaving my woman at home

Lordy, Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
I tell you, Tuesday's gone, oh she's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on, oh Tuesday's gone

Tuesday's gone, yeah

Tuesday's gone with the wind
I tell you, Tuesday's gone, oh she's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on, oh

My baby's gone
I'm right now, now Tuesday
Ride on train, ride on train
Oh, Tuesday
