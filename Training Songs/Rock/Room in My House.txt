There's room in my house for love and affection
Spread out your arms I could give you infections
A passionate point to the whole operation
I'll build you a kingdom
We'll call it, "Our Heaven"
Yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh, room in my house
Oh oh oh oh oh, there's a room in my house
Oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah

Wherever I go you stop and you stare
But I’m not out tonight I’m washing my hair
With it's a spiritual love I can feel a connection
I look in your eyes but I see no reflection
Yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh, room in my house
Oh oh oh oh oh, there's a room in my house
Oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh, room in my house
Oh oh oh oh oh, there's a room in my house
Oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury find me
Not guilty
And release me
Set me free
Oh hear my plea
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh hear my plea (oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh

And you were the type
To slow down for a car crash
Yours is a hype
That can vanish with a flash
I don’t know if I'm coming or going or back
But I'm impeccably dressed
And I’m ready to attack you
Yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh, room in my house
Oh oh oh oh oh, there's a room in my house
Oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh, room in my house
Oh oh oh oh oh, there's a room in my house
Oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
