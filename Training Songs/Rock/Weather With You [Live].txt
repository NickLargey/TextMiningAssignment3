Walking 'round the room singing 'Stormy Weather' at 57 Mt. Pleasant St.
Well it's the same room but every thing's different
You can fight the sleep but not the dream

Things ain't cooking in my kitchen strange affliction wash over me
Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire couldn't conquer the blue sky

Well there's a small boat made of China
Is going nowhere on the mantle piece
Well do I lie like a lounge room lizard or do I sing like a bird released?

Everywhere you go always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go always take the weather
Everywhere you go always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go always take the weather, the weather with you

Everywhere you go always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go always take the weather
Everywhere you go always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go always take the weather
You take the weather, the weather with you

Everywhere you go always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go always take the weather
Everywhere you go always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go always take the weather
Take the weather, the weather with you
