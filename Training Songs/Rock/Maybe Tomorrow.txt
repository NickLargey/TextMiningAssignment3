I tried to win your heart-that's when I lost my head
I should have saved up all of my feelings, but I squandered them instead
And in one fragile moment, I could almost see
Just how things might have changed for better
I guess what is, was meant to be
Now I know...it's gonna take some time to let you go-ohhh
Maybe tomorrow, my heart will mend
Maybe tomorrow, we'll be friends
Maybe tomorrow, who's to say?
But tonight, it seems like tomorrow, is so far away-oh yeh
Tell me what can I do, to fill the space that once held you?
I see your face in every corner, hear your voice in every room
And I know this feeling, is the ghost of all our tears
Will you be hauntin' me forever...and ever?
I know.....i don't think that I can let you go-no
(chorus)-hey
What am I gonna do without you baby..since you've been gone?-ooh
(chorus)-yeh
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow-who's to say-hey!
But tonight, it seems like tomorrow is so far away
Oh no...there's just no way that I can let you go.....no
