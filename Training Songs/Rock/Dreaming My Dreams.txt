I hope that I won't be
That lone anymore
Maybe I've learned this time.
I hope that I find what
I'm reaching for,
The way that is easin' my mind.

Some day I'll get over you,
I'll live to see it all through,
But I'll always miss
Dreamin' my dreams
With you.

But I won't let it change
Me, not if I can,
I'd rather believe in love.
I'll give it away as much as I can
To those that I'm fondest of.

Some day I'll get over you,
I'll live to see it all through,
But I'll always miss
Dreamin' my dreams
With you.

Some day I'll get over you,
I'll live to see it all through,
But I'll always miss
Dreamin' my dreams
With you.

But I'll always miss
Dreamin' my dreams
With you.
