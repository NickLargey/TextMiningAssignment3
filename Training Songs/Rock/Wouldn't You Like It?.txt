Wouldn't you like to come and spin me
Round, round, round.
Wouldn't you like to come and take me,
Down, down, down.
So come around, round, round.

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like it, (like it)
Wouldn't you like it maybe we could be lovers,
So come up and see me,
Please let me please you,
Maybe we could be lovers,
Wouldn't you like it, (like it),
Wouldn't you like it lets spend the night together.
Come up and see me,
Please let me please you,
I wanna love you so come on now,
Wouldn't you like it

We'd be alone and we could turn the
Lights down low,
Just you and me and we could take it
Nice and slow,
Come on I won't let go.

[Chorus x2]

Wouldn't you like it,
Wouldn't you like it
