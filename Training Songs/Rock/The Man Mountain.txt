He's my man, he's my man mountain, he's my lover and dear oh to me
He's my man, he's my man mountain, Lord, delivers his soul onto me, Lord
Delivers his soul onto me, Lord, delivers his soul onto me
He don't breathe, he don't sleep, he don't even wash his feet
He don't breathe, he don't sleep, he don't even wash his feet

[Chorus]
He's my man, he's my man mountain, he's my lover and dear oh to me
Oh I love him, my man mountain, Lord, delivers his soul onto me, Lord
Delivers his soul onto me, Lord, delivers his soul onto me

He don't lie, and I don't know why
He told me he loved me and that made me cry
He don't lie, and I don't know why
He told me he loved me and that made me cry

[Chorus]

Delivers his soul onto me, Lord, delivers his soul onto me
