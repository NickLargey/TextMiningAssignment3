Behold, the blue horizon line
We see Orion rising
The stars are ours

The stars are ours tonight
They sparkle and shine so bright
Because you're mine tonight
The stars are ours

The moon that's up in the sky
Is shining for you and I
Because you're mine tonight
The stars are ours

We've come a long way from Andromeda
We've got a long way to go, I know, I know
Interplanetary wanderers
Like comets around the sun
We come and we go

The stars are ours tonight
They sparkle and shine so bright
Because you're mine tonight
The stars are ours

The moon that's up in the sky
Is shining for you and I
Because you're mine tonight
The stars are ours

Relax, the galaxies dance and spin
To the music of the spheres
No charted course for the space that we're in
The stars are ours tonight, to light the years

The stars are ours tonight
They sparkle and shine so bright
Because you're mine tonight
The stars are ours

The moon that's up in the sky
Is shining for you and I
Because you're mine tonight
The stars are ours

Because you're mine tonight
The stars are ours
Because you're mine tonight
The stars are ours

Behold the blue horizon line
We see Orion rising
The stars are ours
