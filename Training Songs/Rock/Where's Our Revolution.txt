I’ve been living alone now for six months
I’ve been lost inside my head
Carrying on a cryptic conversation with myself
 This was not in the plans now
Not what I imagined my life would be
Ain’t it sad, ain’t it sad when everything’s crumbling
Well slow down, take your time or you will not survive
And I know this to be true but it’s so hard to do

So where’s our revolution
Maybe something’s getting in the way
Waiting for a solution that gets
Farther off everyday
The only thing I know is we’ll never make it alone
No, no, no, no way

I’ve been walking along this 
Lost and lonely road without an end
I’ve started contemplating that I might not find my way again
Well do you remember where
Where to go from here
Is it okay to ask you now cause I might need a little help

Where’s our revolution
Maybe something’s getting in the way
Waiting for a solution that gets
Farther off everyday
The only thing I know is we’ll never make it alone
No, no, no, no way

Slow down, dry your eyes,
Revolutionize
Cause it’s time to believe again
And I think, I’m sure, I know, 
We can, we can, we can yeah

Where’s our revolution
Maybe something’s getting in the way
Waiting for a solution that gets
Farther off everyday
The only thing I know is we’ll never make it alone
No, no, no, no way
Where’s our revolution
Where’s our revolution baby
Where’s our revolution
