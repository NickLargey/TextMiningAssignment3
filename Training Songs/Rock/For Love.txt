For love I have given you the very best, yeah 
Any woman ever can 
For love I would follow you everywhere you go 
My friends don't understand 
I would tie you with a chain 
If that would put you in the frame of mind I think's so cool 
I want you so badly 
Don't you know I'd gladly give my life for loving you 

[Chorus: ] 
For love 
Do most anything for love 
Listen to me 
For love I would suffer kisses from another 
If that was what turned you on 
For love I have done less and still felt the best 
When I'm with you, nothing is wrong 
I would tie you with a chain 
If that would put you in the frame of mind I think's so cool 
I want you so badly 
Don't you know I'd gladly give my life for loving you 

[Chorus: ] 

Do most anything for love (for love) 
Baby, come and take me, any way you make me 
I'll be good and that's for sure 
Baby, if you love me 
I'm the one and only doctor that's got the cure 

Baby, I would tie you with a chain 
If that would put you in the frame of mind I think's so cool 
I want you so badly 
Don't you know I'd gladly give my life for loving you 
For love 
I'll do most anything for love 
For love [Repeat: 4X]
 
I'd do, I'd do 
Do, I'd do, I'd do 
Looka here 
I will do anything, anything for loving you 

Uh, kaleidoscope of musical colors, ooh, hit me! 
Sounds so good, uh 
Mmm (Coca-cola), ha ha 
Yeah! 
(What's that?) 
For love, for love, for love
Hang on, uh 
I gotta go feed the dog 
Oh, oh, oh, yeah! {mimic dog barks} 
Good dog
