Woah, woah, woah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah, woah, woah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
All though I love you so
Oh you don't know
You don't know just how I feel
For my love I daren't reveal
I am so, I'm so afraid
You might not care

Every time you pass me by
Oh you don't know, you don't know
What I go through
Seeing someone else with you
Oh I wish the one with you, were me
But you don't know

I would tell you, if I believed
That you might care some day
But until then I'll never give this away

So a secret it must stay
And you don't know, you don't know
How hard to bear
Is this one way love affair
For it breaks my heart to be in love
When you don't know

I would tell you, if I believed
That you might care some day
But until then I'll never give this away

So a secret it must stay
And you don't know, you don't know
How hard to bear
Is this one way love affair
For it breaks my heart to be in love
When you don't know
Woah, woah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah, woah, woah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
