You can grin, but you can't hide
All the emptiness inside
Since she left
You like
Spit in the rain.

Without doubt, it is true
She was the only love you knew
Now she's gone,
It fades away, like
Spit in the rain.

And you can try, to find her
But you'll be looking in vain
Because love disappears like
Spit in the rain.

You can try, to figure out
Why you mean nothing to her now
But you might,
Just as well go
Spit in the rain.

And maybe then, you will find
Her sweet memory, in your mind
Washed away,
Out of sight, like
Spit in the rain.

Without doubt, it is true
Without her, there's only you
But with a little luck,
With a little time,
You'll pull through...

And you can try, to find her
But you'll be looking in vain
Because love,
Disappears, like
Spit in the rain.

Because love,
Disappears, like
Spit in the rain.
