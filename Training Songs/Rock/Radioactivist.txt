My generation without a name
The TV waves gave birth to mutant brains, you let go
Chaos pollution contaminates your comfort zone
From mainstream lies to underground pride
I'm insane, I'm the son, democracy disowned

We're toxic wasted non complacent

We're rust on the iron curtain
We're ghosts in the machine of the government trust
We're a generation of toxic wasted, sex and drugs the antidote
Won't waste my life, won't waste my life
On chicken-shit conformity for no one

We're toxic wasted non complacent

No conciliation
(Coming)
Insides insane just can't be still
It's in my brain, pure Cain pissed
Pollution, head is for rent
(It's a blessing)
Vacancy is evident
In my brain, pure Cain pissed, pollution

I'm ready for the wind to fan the flames
I'm ready for the wind to fan the flames
I'm ready for the wind to fan the flames
Ignite this today

The kids converging on the streets
One shot when everyone gets some
Drawn from our blood frustration
Everyone gets some, everyone gets some
Everyone gets some, everyone gets some

Toxic wasted non complacent
We're toxic wasted non complacent
Toxic wasted non complacent
We're toxic wasted non complacent
