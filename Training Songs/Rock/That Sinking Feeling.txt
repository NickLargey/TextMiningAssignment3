Can't fight this feeling
That is coming on the second wave
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
It's gonna be a fight today

I think I'm reeling, crazy's got a new face
She gets up, she gets down
She gets off, comes around
Running out of cost to play

Can't fight this sinking feeling, no
Can't fight this sinking feeling, oh
Can't fight this sinking feeling, oh

I'm on emotion, heading for a new face
I see up, I fall back
I see gives, I see cracks
No one's gonna win today

She lost commotion, gonna hit a new grade
She gets high, I get low
She gets fast, I go slow
I think we are gonna fight today

Can't fight this sinking feeling, no
Can't fight this sinking feeling, oh
Can't fight this sinking feeling, oh

Can't fight this sinking feeling, no
Can't fight this sinking feeling, oh
Can't fight this sinking feeling, oh
