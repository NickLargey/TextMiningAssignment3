You're breakin' my heart
You're tearing it apart so f*ck you

All I want to do is have a good time, now I'm blue
You won't boogaloo
Run down to Tramps, have a dance or two, ooh
You're breakin' my heart
You're tearing it apart but f*ck you

You're breakin' my heart
You're tearing it apart, boo-hoo

You stepped on my ass
You're breakin' my glasses too
You won't drive my car
Buy a lot of stuff 
I've had enough of you, ooh
I'm goin' insane
There's no one to blame so f*ck you

You can't have your way
There's nothing left to say
There's nothing left to do, ooh
You're breakin' my heart
You're tearing it apart so f*ck you

You gotta have your way
There's nothing left to say
There's nothing left to do, ooh
You're breakin' my heart
You're tearing it apart but I love you

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
