I don't mind 
Just what you say
I never heard you, baby
Never heard you anyway

I don't care 
What you do
Just so long as
It ain't me and you

Sly, sly, sly
Like a demon's eye

Everything's good
I said, everything's fine
You don't know, don't know
It's the end of your time

How does it feel 
To be turned away?
I've known it, baby
Almost every day

Sly, sly, sly
Like a demon's eye

I don't need you 
Anymore
I don't want you, baby
Hanging round my door
You slip and slide 
Round my brain
You think you're so clever, yeah
But you know you're insane

Sly, sly, sly
Like a demon's eye

I do-do-don't mind
Just what you say
I never heard you, baby
Never heard you anyway

Everything's good, I said
Everything's fine
You don't know
It's the end of your time

Sly, sly, sly
Like a demon's eye
Like a demon's eye
Oh, oh yeah
It's so sly baby yeah
