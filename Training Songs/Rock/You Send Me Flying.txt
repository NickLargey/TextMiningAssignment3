I don't want to make a habit of this
But seeing you is like getting a fix
Every time I kid myself; I'll never do it again
Definition of love on a cliff
A lemming has no alternative
I want to die in your arms
That's my suicide wish

It's only thirteen hours till I leave the ground
And I may never come down again
So will you meet me there on a ride?
Somewhere
Just turn left at the sun, before it sets
Let's go naked
Would you dare?

[Chorus]
You, you, send me flying
You send me flying
You send me flying, knocking me over
You, you send me flying
You send me flying
You send me flying
Flying over the moon for joy

I don't want to make a fool of myself
Especially since you're with someone else
Outwardly demure - I would die for you
Will you forive my inclination to tell?
I throw my wishes down your wishing well
I want you now in a not-too-subtle way
Do you want me too?
So will you meet me there, on a ride some where?
Just a right at the moon, before it moves
Lets go naked
Would you dare?

[Chorus]

You send me flying
You send me flying
You send me flying

[Chorus]

Definition of love on a cliff
A lemming has no alternative
I want to die in your arms
That's my suicide wish
