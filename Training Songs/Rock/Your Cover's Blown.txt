"So how do we know each other?
And how do you have my number?
Well why don't you guide me
You be the driver"

Say what you want and leave your shyness home
And you should do what you want and write a little poem
Leave it for her and live another day
And you should leave it for her, the girl around the way

Write down a list of things you wanna do
And then you leave it in work because you wanna live a little
Pick up the girl in someone's borrowed Mini
Take her to dinner, use her boyfriend's money

Hey lady, put the phone down
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it
Your cover's blown, I wanna see you alone
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it
Your cover's blown

Planning a freak is such a tricky thing
Because you move through the country, she comes back again
And then you move through the city, but she goes abroad
Is she telling you something, is she getting bored?

I make a rough plan to sleep around a minaret
I need a change, I'm a lazy rat if I am honest
But my bold change of tact will fade out with the summer
I've got no appetite and all the girls are bummers

My baby doesn't look at me the way I want her to look
She doesn't comprehend
My baby's got it going on
She's got a friend in every street in this town

I want to go out but there's nobody home-
I'll go on my own

Thus starts the lonely walking
There's always too much talking
I, I, I should have stayed home
She starts her cold caressing
The kid she starts undressing
I, I, I should have stayed home
The DJ's picking up speed
That's something I just don't need
I, I, I should have stayed home
The gossip's bearing down on me
The kids are pairing up in front of me
I should have stayed home
I should have stayed home
I think I'll go home

Listen lady, put your phone down
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it
Your cover's blown, I need to see you alone
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it

Listen lady, leave your phone down
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it
Your cover's blown, I need to see you alone
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it

Hey lady, meet my mom and dad
You're a strange operation in this land of potted plants
And funslide houses where the girls like mouses
Breathe a long sigh of resignation
You resign yourself to keep on growing
Like the seeds you're sowing
For a strange operation in this land of grammar schools
And galloped days, the lady's set in her way
Behind a long conversation from a kid named Stole
He's a little slow but in your favour it shows
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to move out to the sticks

Listen lady, leave the boy home
Cancel all operations, tell your friends there's more to you than this
