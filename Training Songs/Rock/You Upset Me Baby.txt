Well she's 30 in the bust
24 in the waist
44 in the hips, man
She got what it takes
You upset me baby
Upset me baby
Like being hit by a falling tree
Woman, what you do to me
I'd like to describe her
It's hard to start
I better stop now
I got a very weak heart
You upset me baby
Upset me baby
Like being hit by a falling tree
Woman, what you do to me
She's not to tall
Her complexion is fair
Man she knocks me out
The way she wears her hair
You upset me baby
Upset me baby
Like being hit by a falling tree
Woman, what you do to me
She's not to tall
Her complexion is fair
Man she knocks me out
The way she wears her hair

You upset me baby
You upset me baby
You upset me baby

Woman, what you do to me
You upset me baby
You upset me baby
You upset me baby
You upset me baby
Like being hit by a falling tree
Woman, what you do to me
