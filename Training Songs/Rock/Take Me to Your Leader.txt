Isabelle is a belly dancer
With a kleptomaniac's restraint
Tried stealing Helena's hand basket, made a fast getaway,
But McQueen she ain't
At the courtroom Joshua judges her ruthlessly
On account of Ruth walking out on him
In the Big House Isabelle is a-telling all
To the chaplin who's become her friend

She says,
I don't know why you care
I don't know what's up there
I don't know where or how
Just take me to your leader now
Take me to your leader now

Justin is adustin' to
The odor from Theodore's Evergreen Incense
But aroma therapy don't make him any younger
Than Oliver's All Liver Supplements
His late mate Marrilee merrily said immortality
Can't be bought in a jar
This just in: Justin's had enough of cure-alls,
Gonna quiz the neighbor kid with the
Fish on his car

He says,
I don't know why you care
I don't know what's up there
I don't know how it's done
Just take me to your leader, son

I see you've got the joy
I've seen you live it, boy

It's real, it's free, it's fun,
So take me to your leader, son
Take me to your leader, son

They don't know why we care
They don't know what's out there
They don't know how it's done
Let's take 'em to our Leader's Son

They see we've got they joy 
They see us live it, oi
It's real, it's free, it's fun,
Let's take 'em to our Leader's Son
