(I keep falling over)
My overcoat is hung and I'm too far gone to see
When the last drinks bell is rung you can carry me
Carry me
Carry me, push me through the door
Shovel me up when I'm sinking to this tear stained floor
Carry me
And sometimes I go over
Over the bar I'll go
Sometimes the pole is only one inch short
And sometimes I go over and you get me on a barrel
And your careful and your loving hands get caught
So carry me
Carry me
But I'm sorry if I showed you
How to lift this truck up off the ground
Yeah I'm not sorry if I moved ten tonnes or more
And I'm not sorry if I showed you how to wriggle round and round
As long as you could push me through the door
So if my overcoat is hung and I'm too far gone to see
And the last drinks bell is rung you can carry me
Carry me
