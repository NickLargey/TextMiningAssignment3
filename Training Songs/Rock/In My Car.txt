Doesn't make a diff'rence,
Don't care how far.
We can go the distance in my car.
 
Don't bother with directions,
Doesn't matter where we are.
Cruisin' down the highway in my car.
 
Hey!
In my car.
I don't need no back seat drivers,
So I leave them all behind.
And problems, they can't find me in my car.
 
In my car.
Hey!
In my car.
