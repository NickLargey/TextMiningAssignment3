From the moment You opened my eyes
I have seen the world in a different light
From the dawn to the setting sun
I am overwhelmed
By all that You have done

[Chorus:]

Adore, adore, adore
Jesus I adore you,
Yes I adore,
Adore, adore, adore
Jesus, I adore You
And I lay my life before You, O Lord

There's a union of two becoming one
Deep inside my heart
I know that I belong
You have given everything to me
The least that I can do
Is give it back to you

And all I am and ever will be
Is for You, Lord
And everything within me cries

Adore, adore, adore
Jesus, I adore you,
Yes I adore you
And I lay my life before You
Adore, adore, adore, adore, adore
Jesus, I adore you

And I lay my life before You
I long to love and adore You
I lay my life before you, O Lord
I adore you
