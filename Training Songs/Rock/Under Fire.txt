Curtains you made let the sun rays shine right thru
But your never gonna fix a thing
They only shine on you
Living our fairy tales we see on tv
And I'm singing all your lullabies from memory

'Cause I'm under fire
And I'm burning down slow
I'm walking on a wire
Won't you let me go

I've listened to the mothers and fathers and lovers, too
Can't help but see the good in you slip right on thru
All the while I've been fishing for a second chance
But we're never gonna make it out alive on romance

'Cause I'm under fire
And I'm burning down slow
I'm walking on a wire
Won't you let me go

'Cause I'm under fire
And I'm burning down slow
I'm walking on a wire
Won't you let me go

'Cause I'm under fire
And I'm burning down slow
I'm walking on a wire
Won't you let me go
