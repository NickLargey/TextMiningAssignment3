Listen while I'm talking to you
I tell you what we're going to do
There's a new thing goin' around
And I'll tell you what it's puttin' down
Move your body all around

And do, shake
Early in the morning
Shake
I said, later in the evening
Shake
I'm long gone baby, now
Shake

Shakin' like a bowl of soup
Legs go loop the loop
Put you hand upon your hip, now
Come on, and let your back bone slip, yeah
Move your body like your hip

Now, do, shake
Early in the morning
Shake
I said, later in the evening
Shake
That's the way you do it, now
Shake, come on

Ding a ling a ling
Oh baby, shakin' is the latest thing
You wanna really roll
You got to do this thing with soul

If you wanna really roll
You gotta do this thing with soul
Shake it, shake with all your mind, yeah
If you do it, do it right, now
Make you body loose

And do, shake
Early in the morning
Shake
I said, later in the evening
Shake
I'm long gone baby now
Shake

If you wanna really roll
You gotta do this thing with soul
Shake it, shake with all your mind
If you do it, do it right, now
Make you body loose

And do, shake
Early in the morning
Shake
I said, later in the evening
Shake
I'm long gone baby, now
Shake, oh yeah

All right
Early in the morning
Later on the evening
I says, come on children
You gotta get on the sea with me
