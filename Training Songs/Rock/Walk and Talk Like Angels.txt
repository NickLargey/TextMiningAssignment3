You walk like the angels talk
Where are you from
You want to walk and talk like angels talk
Tell me then some

With a room by the sea
And a voice in the sand
Telling me your truth
And telling me your view
In how you see the world
Spinning, spinning round
And what is love and what is death
The fears you have to put to rest
And so you walk
Like angels talk

You want to walk and talk like the angels talk
This I hear
You want to walk and talk like the angels
Tell me then dear

With a smile in the sun
And a face in the sand
Sitting on a swing
Unfolding bits of string
The face is innocence
But the words are something more
It's in the voice
It's in the sound
It's in the way the world is round
And so we walk
Like angels talk

You want to walk and talk like the angels talk
This I hear
You want to walk and talk like the angels
Tell me then dear
You see it's easy running angels down
And I can't help but shutter from the sound

It's that small girl
Down by the sea
Found the angel in me
The words are such
I'll always recall
As they faded into day [Repeat: x4]
