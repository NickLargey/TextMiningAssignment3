Have you ever seen the Sunset Strip?
Your dream, down to the bone
We used to try
To live a deep, dark life
But we were all alone
Went to the Emerald City
To keep that dream alive
We saw gold
And a light, bright life
But there was no sun inside

You make me feel
Like falling down is falling up
You make me feel
Like loving you is just my luck
Just my luck

Now we live up in the canyon
With the coyotes and the falling stars
And I've got you
When the day gets dark
To light my way

You make me feel
Like falling down is falling up
You make me feel
Like loving you is just my luck
You make me feel
Isn't that enough?

With the century quickly slipping away
We try to find the balance
Let's divine a nursery rhyme
And turn it into practice
And let's let down our guard
So we can raise this love

You make me feel
Like falling down is falling up
You make me feel
Like loving you is just my perfect luck
You make me feel
You make me feel
