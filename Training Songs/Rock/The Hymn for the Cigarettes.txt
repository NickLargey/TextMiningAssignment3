No one called, no one wrote, no one phoned,
So no one knew that I was with her on my own.
She smoked on my bed cause she thought it would annoy me,
But I love to watch the girls smoke in my bed.
I love to watch the girls smoke in my bed.
I love to watch the girls smoke in my bed.

How can she love me when she doesn't even love the cinema that I love.
What does she feel if she doesn't have the feeling that I have in my fingers.
This joy I have could lift this ceiling from its rafters but I'm not laughing.

We feel nothing, so we search for nothing, so we achieve nothing, love.

Lucky Strikes remind me of my friends out on the west coast,
Camel Lights remind me of my ex-girlfriend at Christmas time,
Marlboro Reds remind me of giving up in Berlin,
B&H remind me of not giving up but giving in.
B&H remind me of not giving up but giving in.
B&H remind me of not giving up but giving in.

How can she love me when she doesn't even love the cinema that I love.
What does she feel if she doesn't have the feeling that I have in my fingers.
This joy I have could lift this ceiling from its rafters but I'm not laughing.

We feel nothing, so we search for nothing, so we achieve nothing, love.

I don't want to stay in love
