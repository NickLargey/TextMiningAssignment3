Well the boys and the girls all dancing around
Dancing all night to the crazy sound
Well it's the newest thing to hit the fan
The boys and the girls are holding hands
I said go buddy go buddy go
Buddy go buddy go go go
A well I'm with my friend bob
And we're having a chat
I got the right speed and I'm doing fine
But bob is not dancing no shery
He's got a lazy eye on a litlle lady
I said go buddy go buddy go
Buddy go buddy go go go
Wow let's say now
Go buddy go buddy go
Buddy go buddy go go go
..go go go go
As the wimen display around the floor
Disappearing in a space behind the door
You tell the chick who stands right to us to get some more
Go buddy go buddy go
Buddy go buddy go go go
Go buddy go buddy go
Buddy go buddy go go go
A well I see we're changing partners
But that's not for me
I noticed she's a fucker So tight in her body
I'm standing on the outside Lookin' in
Who's that litlle girl she was with him
I said go buddy go buddy go
Buddy go buddy go go go
Solo...Let's go
As the wimen display around the floor
Disappearing in a space behind the door
You tell the chick who stands right to us to get some more
Go buddy go buddy go
Buddy go buddy go go go
Go buddy go buddy go
Buddy go buddy go go go
A when the party is over and we're all going home
I can't find bob so I'm leavin' allone
But wait a minute who said I can't see
No lovers and bob with a girl on his knee
I said go buddy go buddy go
Buddy go buddy go go go
Go buddy go buddy go
Buddy go buddy go go go
