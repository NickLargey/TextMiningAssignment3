Day by day
Someone we really love
Seems to feel the pain
We're always thinking of

But you know
If only we were the men
That we're supposed to be
That wouldn't happen again

I wish I could cry
I wish I could cry
I wish I could cry I cry today
I wish I could die
I wish I could die

I do wish I'd die away
Now I fear
We must accept the fact
That what happened here

Was simply a vicious act
And you know
I just can't help wondering how
Long it will be before
Somebody else must bow

I wish I could cry
I wish I could cry
I wish I could cry I cry today
I wish I could die
I wish I could die
I do wish I'd die away
