Let's got to the moon
Let's got to the moon
Let's got to the moon
For a day out babe !

Let's got to the moon
Rocking living true.
Get yourself aboard
For a day out babe.

Venus in winter time
Venus in the sky.
Anything's just for kids
And a day out babe -

Gonna see marge
On Friday afternoon
With everybody rushing home
To see the Equals's show.

Beautiful moon-beans
I'll catch them in my hand.
Then I'll give one to you
For a souvenier.

We'll take a walk
Through the crowded avenues
Then I'll whisper in your ear
I'm in love with you.
