You're unchanging
I'm unchangeable
That's a difference
We have to recognize
Some folks never row
Their ways seem like paradise
But inside we all know
That this is the life

You're the greatest
Thing I've ever seen
You make my eyes bleed
And others turn to green
Make the road open
The future all gold
Make my world spin
When I open the door

This is the life
You'd better get used to
You know you don't choose it, but
This is the life
This is the life
Anything goes
Oh if anything goes
You can wave it away

This thing won't come back again
And take me round
And let me see
What was I thinking about
Cause now is the time
For you to see me
We can walk away, darling
Or we can say

This s the life
The best thing yet
You'd better not change
Cause this is the life
This is the life
Anything goes
Oh if everything goes
You can wave it away
