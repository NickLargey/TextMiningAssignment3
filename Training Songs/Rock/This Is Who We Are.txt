Between the future and the past tense
Lies the present in the distance
So you think we're never coming back
Scoring points for passion and persistence

Between the lines and the highway
Lies a dead you in the safety
You never thought this was gonna last
I always knew you'd never take it back
I always knew (i always knew)

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
I know it seems like we're never coming back
I know it feels like we're never coming back
You tried your best and you knew it wouldn't last
These were the words that she placed on her casket

Between the sadness and the smile
Lies the flicker of the fire
You always said this never hurt you
I always said you were a liar
With the all the towers and the wires
There still lies a little silence
Two hearts and one connection
One voice lets emotion out
I always knew (i always knew)

[Chorus:]

Instead of flowers like words they never mattered
Close it up forget about the sadness (close it up forget about the sadness)
He always said she should of stop crying
But he knew at least she was lying down

I'm coming back (I'm coming back) [x2]

[Chorus:]
