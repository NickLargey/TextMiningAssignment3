Woo.

Get in there.

In the mornin' a don't say you love me
'Cause I'll only kick you outta the door
I know your name is Rita, 'cause your perfume's smellin' sweeter
Since when I saw you down on the floor. Guitar, woo.

You won't need to much persuadin'
I don't mean to sound degradin'
But with a face like that you got nothing to laugh about
A-red lips, hair and fingernails
I hear you're a mean old Jezebel
Let's go upstairs and read my tarot cards. Come on honey.

Stay with me, stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me. Woo yeah
Stay with me, stay with me
For tonight you'd better stay with me. Ah wacko.
Oh ho.

So in the mornin', please don't say you love me
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door
Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home, you can even use my best cologne
Just don't be here in the mornin' when I wake up. C'mon honey.

Stay with me, stay with me
'Cause tonight you're gonna stay with me
Sit down, get up, get out
Stay with me, stay with me
'Cause tonight you're gonna stay with me
Hey, what's your name again?
Oh no.

Get out. Woo.

Oh, oh no.

Woo.

Get yourself home.

Slow down there. Woo, hoo hoo.
Wait a minute. Woo.
