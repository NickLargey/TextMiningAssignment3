Wouldn't it be fine if you could say you love me
Just one time with a sober mind?
Wouldn't that be fine, now wouldn't that be fine?

Wouldn't it be great if you could love me first
And let the bottle wait?
Now wouldn't that be great, now wouldn't that be great?

Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Lord, it's for our sake, now wouldn't that be great?

In the name of love, what's the man so great?
Keep thinking of, in the name of love
What a man he was

Love went to waste when the sexy lace couldn't turn his face
The bottle took my place, love went to waste

Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Lord, it's for our sake, now wouldn't that be great?

Wouldn't it be good? And I know you could if you just would
Wouldn't that be good? Lord, I know you could

Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break

Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Lord, it's for our sake, now wouldn't that be great?

Now wouldn't that be great?
