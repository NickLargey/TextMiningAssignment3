A light on your shoulder
Cool as ice and bright as lightnin'
Thunder in your eyes
Talk to me and tell me

I'm in deeper every move
'Till I'm almost lost in you
Can you feel the way that I can't hold back
There's no limit to what love can do

Girl, it's only
You and me against the night
In the shadows
Finding love could save your life

In a world of strangers
The lovers will survive
It's all that we have
You and me against the night

We should be movin'
Like a thief, time steals your chances
Now we got the fire
But you wonder how long can we

Keep the spark alive
If it takes us through the night
Then it's all that I need and I won't take less
For the moment I know you're mine

Girl, it's only
You and me against the night
In the shadows
Finding love can save your life

In a world of strangers
The lovers will survive
It's all that we have
You and me against the night

Can we keep the spark alive?
'Cause it takes us through the night
Then it's all that I need and I won't take less
For the moment I know you're mine
You're mine, yeah

Girl, it's only
You and me against the night
In the shadows
Finding love can save your life

In a world of strangers
The lovers will survive
It's all that we have
You and me against the night

You and me against the night
Against the night
