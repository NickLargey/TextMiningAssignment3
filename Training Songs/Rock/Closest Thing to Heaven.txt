I've been going 'round in circles, trying to make my life complete,
Searching for that special woman, I was about to fall,
admit defeat,
But I waited just a bit longer, held on a bit stronger,
now she's here, right on time, the closest thing to heaven,
I'll ever find.

Verse

Now everybody's lookin' for an angel they can call their own,
A little taste of paradise, nothing like you've ever known.
I want to hold her just a little bit closer, so much love,
I want to show her, cause she's here, she's one of a kind,
and she's the closest thing to heaven I'll ever find.

Chorus

Closest thing to heaven I'll ever find,
and when she looks at me I go out of my mind,
Closest thing to heaven and she's one of a kind,
she's the closest thing to heaven, oh baby.

Bridge

Yeah, I want to hold her just a little bit closer, so much love,
I want to show her, cause she's here, she's one of a kind,
and she's the closest thing to heaven, I'll ever find.

Repeat Chorus
