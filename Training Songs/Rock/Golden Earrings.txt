There's a story the Gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings
She belongs to you

An old love story that's known to very few
But if you wear these golden earrings
Love will come to you

By the burning fire they will glow with every coal
You will hear desire whisper low in your soul

So be my Gypsy
Make love your guiding light
And let this pair of golden earrings cast their spell tonight

By the burning fire they will glow with every coal
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul

So be my Gypsy
Make love your guiding light
And let this pair of golden earrings cast their spell tonight

Let this pair golden earrings do their work tonight
Yes, let this pair golden earrings cast their spell tonight
