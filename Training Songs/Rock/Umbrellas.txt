I'm walking down the street in the rain, my umbrella high above my head,
High above my head.
Puddles along the wet sidewalks and gutters, (pitter patter)
Rain lightly falling from the sky (pitter patter)
Rain lightly falling from the sky.

Red and green and free design,
Umbrellas are in bloom, nourished by the rain.

I'm walking down the street in the rain, my umbrella high above my head,
High above my head.

Though the clouds, the blackness and rain
I see the lightning strike as though it were pain.
Rain falling hard on a sea of umbrellas,
A colorful bottomless ocean.
Then the wind it blows and it blows,
I see the umbrellas bend, they creak and they groan.
Gusting down alleys and through streets of cars
Causing unbottled unspent commotion.

I spy a patch of blue through a cloud,
A patch of blue through a shroud.
Hopefully umbrellas hide and shrink and close
As the noonday sun peeks through the clouds.
