With only fear and good judgment
Holding us back
We sailed out on the Northern Sea
With a boat load of crazy people
Including the shotgun and me

Does somebody know how to drive this thing
Yelled the captain as he fell to his knees
I think I mighta had a little too much today
Take me to my cabin, please

Cruisin' on a sardine boat
Loaded with crazy people
And we shall be the Santa Maria
Looking for a brave new world

The first mate shouted from the crow's nest
I think I might see land out there
Nobody moved
From where they were laying
Cause nobody really cared
