If ever you heard all of these words
Silent my point of view
If ever you found all of my doubts
Sorry what I put you through
Sorry what I put you through

If anyone could make it happen
If anyone knows how to be
If anyone would stay
Never walk away
She's standing here in front of me

If ever you knew how I need you
Waiting every waking day
If ever you hurt it's only much worse
Knowing that I made you wait
Knowing that I made you wait

If anyone could make it happen
If anyone knows how to be
If anyone would stay
Never walk away
She's standing here in front of me
She's standing here in front of me
La da da da da...

If anyone could make it happen
If anyone knows how to be
If anyone would stay
Never walk away
She's standing here in front of me
Yeah she's standing here in front of me
La da da da da...
