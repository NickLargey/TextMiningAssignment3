This is the first day of the future
And all I want is you
I wear a pair of socks you left here
But I know, I know, I know
Nobody could ever fill your shoes

I can see so clearly
When your smoke gets in my eyes
Please me with your promises
And hurt me with your lies

Baby can you hear
The message I am sending?
Love me like the world is ending

This is the last day of existence
And all I want is you
And there's a certain sadness
But I know, I know, I know
The sky is what makes the ocean blue
I know, I know, I know
The sky is what makes the ocean blue

I can see so clearly
When your smoke gets in my eyes
Please me with your promises
And hurt me with your lies

Baby can you hear
The message I am sending?
Love me like the world is ending
Love me like the world is ending

And they all say to pour it has to rain
So don't complain if we get wet in the deep end

I can see so clearly
When your smoke gets in my eyes
Please me with your promises
And hurt me with your lies

Baby can you hear
The message I am sending?
Love me like the world is ending
Love me like the world is ending
Come on and
Love me like the world is ending
