No one could say
How she caught my eyes
To this day,
I don't know why
Oh well her eyes
So much like diamonds,
And her heart
So much like gold
I knew that i'd
Win her in time,
When i felt her heart
Beat close to mine
And once in her arms,
Then i knew anything i would do,
Just for the love of a woman,
Just for the love of a woman
I prayed that i'd never have to walk alone
I'd have a love of my own
I thank my stars,
I found an angel
Never again
Will i walk alone
She brought a light
Into my heart,
Like the brightest star,
That's ever shone

Money and gold

To a king,
When you're alone,
Don't mean a thing
And once in her arms
Then i know anything i would do,
Just for the love of a woman,
Just for the love of a woman,
I prayed that i'd never have to walk alone.

Now i have a love of my own
I could paint a masterpiece,
I could walk through fire
I could shout it from the roof,
From the smallest flame to a fire this love has grown,
Just for the love of a woman,
Money and gold mean nothing
Never again will i have to walk alone,
Now i have a love of my own

Love of my own, love of my own
I can't face this world all alone
