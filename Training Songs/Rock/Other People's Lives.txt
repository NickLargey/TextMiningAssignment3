Can't believe what I just read, gossip on the Internet
Now the tabloids have the news
Cross my heart, it just ain't true
I never thought it of you

Name, names and every line
Is feeding their suspicious minds
I'm not bitter or angry, I'm only feeling sympathy
You really found the time

To feed the reporter with your views
See the reporter, break the news
Read the reporter, join the queue

Spread the news, scandalize
Words cut like a thousand knives
Take the cash, bag the prize
For playing games with other people's lives

See the reporter, break the news
Read the reporter, join the queue

Eat it up, take a bite, feed the reader's appetite
They'll swallow anything you write
As long as it's in black and white
And full of titillation

I can't believe what I just read
Excuse me, I just vomited
Tell your story, it's your call
So autobiographical but oh, so trivial

Feed the reporter

They put it on the Internet
To help improve the circulation
They'll pepper it with lies
It's only other people's lives

Feed the reporter
Read the reporter

Politicians dressed in drag
Careers stopped with a quick back stab
While anonymous informer flees
And leaves us with our fantasy and erotic visions

Who did what, when, to whom
In the dominatrix room?
Tabloids daily titillate
Each sordid tale reverberates
All across the nation

(What can I say?)
Feed the reporter
(It's a vendetta)
Read the reporter
([Incomprehensible])

A rumor then a vicious phrase
A poison pen can wreck your day
And weather words that crucify
As tabloid judges sharpen up their knives

Read the reporter, black and white
See the reporter victimize
See a poor sucker crucified

To stop the truth, to tell your lies
Betray your friends and get the prize
The dagger's in, now twist the knife
The gutter's full of other people's lives
