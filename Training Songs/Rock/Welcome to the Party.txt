Welcome to the party, there's a new kid in town
Looking like a million, gonna bring your burden down
And he's talking about love, stamping out hate
He's gonna fight for the welfare state
He's got a vision of a better day
Rip up the past and throw it all away

Welcome to the party, there's a feeling in the air
Can't you feel the vibrations, bringing everybody here
We got the right face at the right time
Leading from the front, racing for the line
This train's a rolling so get on board
C'mon everybody, you know that you'll be heard

Oh oh, there ain't no better place to go
And all the doors are open wide
So come on in, don't you worry about a thing
You can't fight against this tide
Say welcome to the party tonight

Welcome to the party, where the future's looking bright
See the people comming from the left and from the right
'Cause everybody knows there's got to be a change
So many things we've got to re-arrange
We've got to bring a sense of freedom back
for everybody, yellow white or black

Oh oh, we'll be watching the fat cats roll
When all of the dogs have had their day
Can't you see, tomorrow's down to you and me
So don't you hang around outside
Say welcome to the party tonight

You're gonna love the show, I know
So won't you step right up today, yeah yeah
