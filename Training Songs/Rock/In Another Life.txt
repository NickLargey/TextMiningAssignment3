If my loving you
Could change the river's flow
I would not let you drift away from me
I'd never let go
I want to be by your side
But the water's too deep and wide

[Chorus:]
In another life
In another place
I have held you close
I have known your grace
In another world
In another time
You'll be mine
You'll be mine

If I touched you now
I'd only lose my mind
In a cruel world we live in
One life at a time
I don't know where or when
But we'll pass this way again

[Chorus 2x]
