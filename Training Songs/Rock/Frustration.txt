To the floor, stop the beat
Punch out a guy and a guy is beat
Hey dreams song, I'm bigger than you
Hey dreams song, I'm bigger than you

Frustration find a fellow wrapped up his tail
Frustration find a fellow running back and forth
Frustration find a fellow rams his body of a man
Frustration, it's frustrating

Octavio
It's who you know
It's sexual
It's where it goes
Hey dreams song, I'm bigger than you
Hey dreams song, I'm bigger than you

Frustration, once you turn grey
Frustration, change you color and make you green
Frustration, another major dream then make you miss

Smoking man
Find a fool
Be too hot
And close to rule

Frustration, it'll make you feel like it won't break out
Frustration, a strength to break you mum and child
Frustration, movie man put a hex on me
Frustration, rub it in, work it in

Hey dreams song, I'm bigger than you
Hey dreams song, I'm bigger than you

Frustration, makes you do the thing
Frustration,
Frustration, movie man put a hex on you
Frustration, rub it in, work it in

Hey dreams song, I'm bigger than you
Hey dreams song, I'm bigger than you
Frustration, hey dreams song, I'm bigger than you
Hey dreams song, frustration, I'm bigger than you
