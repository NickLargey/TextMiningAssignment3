(Jo-Ann)

I had a sweetheart, her name was Jo-Ann (Jo-Ann)
And if you saw her, you'd understa-and (Jo-Ann)
Why I can't forget her
The girl with the name, Jo-Ann

(Jo-Ann)
I was in heaven when I held her ha-and (Jo-Ann)
And all of her kisses, they were so gra-and (Jo-Ann)
And I really loved her
The girl with the name, Jo-Ann

Then one day she broke my heart
Why did she make me cry?
She said to forget her, but I never can
And I'm sure that I'll never try
