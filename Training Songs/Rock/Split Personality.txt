Tip, tip, tip, tippy-toe around 
Never getting with the brand new sound 
The almighty one 
And the unforgiving zero 

You should see a doctor about your voice 
And it's codes of choice 

My fist, the trappings and the door 
For those elementally poor 
Because you're hanging from a limb 
That's 'cause you never learned how to swim (yeah!) 

Can't give you the info 
I can't give you the time 
Can't clot your blood from behind 

Unified by my split personality 
Double strength, super size 
Unified by my split personality 
You're a baby blinded by surprise 

You were given time to waste 
But were you chewing gum or chewing paste 
Because it's easy to swallow, but hard to digest 
Like branding a 666 on your chest (whoa) 

'Cause you're the button, I'm the pusher 
Yeah! 

Unified by my split personality 
Double strength, super size 
Unified by my split personality 
You're a baby blinded by surprise 
Surprise! 

Follow me 
Follow me 
'Cause if you want to, you will see 
You will see 
If you're ready 

Can't give you the info 
I can't give you the time 
Can't clot your blood from behind 

Unified by my split personality 
Double strength, super size 
Unified by my split personality 
You're a baby blinded by surprise 

Unified by my split personality 
Double strength, super size 
Unified by my split personality 
You're a baby blinded by surprise 

Surprise!
Oh!
