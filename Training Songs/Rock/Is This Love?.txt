You're so much different than me 
Yes I know
And I'm only enemy 
Pain is all that I can see oh

I see you're climbing a tree
And I know
That it's easier to be up high in
The air than on the ground

And it's love, etc

You say you can't say anymore
You've already said it before
In a million different ways 
Which where all not quite right

The rain is loud on the ground
Yes I know
But I don't even make a sound when
I come around oh

And you say I'd be better of dead
Well I know
But its no use hiding this pretty
Head in the ground

And it's love, etc

And we can do the zarathustra
We can do the broken fist
We can tear down all the borders 
Or abbreviate the list
And when finally the finish line
Emerges from the mist
We'll sound a soft alarm

Woah oh
