My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
Oh Oh Oh

I saw this beautiful girl today
And yes she took my heart away
My old Lyida Oh Lydia
Oh Oh Oh

See she looks so pretty and she looks so gay
And yes she took my heart away
My old Lyida Oh Lydia
Oh Oh Oh

Well I'm wanderin around in circles since I saw her
And I don't know what to do
You see I've been cryin on my pillow, in the afternoon
When Lydia that's not so fun I should be outside wanderin around, if I could meet ya

See she looks so pretty and she looks so fine
That yes I wish that she were mine and I wanted to meet
My old Lyida Oh Lydia
Oh Oh Oh

I've just been wanderin around in circles
So I don't know what to do
And I've been cryin on my pillow, in the afternoon
And I should be outside but I'd only look for Lydia

You see she looks so pretty and she looks so fine
That I just saw her and I wish that I was hangin around with her
My old Lyida Oh Lydia
Oh Oh Oh

My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
Oh Oh Oh

My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
Oh Oh Oh

My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
Oh Oh Oh

My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
My old Lydia, Oh Lydia
