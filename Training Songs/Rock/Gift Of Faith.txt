All this pain surrounding me; hopelessness is all that I see now
Does it have to be this way?
Brought up on hypocrisy
the seeds they sow don't last forever
They just fade away

Don't be confused by the lies of the fools and deceivers
Hope and believe in the things that we need to survive

We can make it if we'd only take the gift of faith
We can change it if we'd just accept the gift of faith

Take away my dignity
Take away my hope and my freedom
You got a world full of rage
Don't cover me with apathy
Don't buy and sell what I believe in
Don't lock me in a cage

In a world where no one's alone, trust should come easily
Just reach out your hand, and I'll give you mine

We can make it if we'd only take the gift of faith
We can change it if we'd just accept the gift of faith

Don't be confused by the lies of the fools and deceivers
Hope and believe in the things that we need to survive

We can make if if we'd only take the gift of faith
We can change it if we'd just accept the gift of faith
We can make if if we'd only take the gift of faith
It's yours to choose but only fools refuse the gift of faith
