Hey there mister
Let me tell ya
I got something here
Gonna blow your mind
The way that it is
There's no turning back
They can burn it out of your blood
Never out of your mind
No way out of this place
My neighborhood
House and garden topiary
Just like Hollywood
On the mainline to Harlem
You want to live
Desmona waiting for ya
Something's gotta give
