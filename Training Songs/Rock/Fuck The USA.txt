There really is nothing nice about USA
You go to the hospital you have to pay
The dollar is the language that they all speak
They don't really bother about the radiation leak

F*ck the USA

They keep their secrets undercover
The rich don't bother about those that suffer
This ain't the land of milk and honey
Cause all they want is money money money

F*ck the USA

Nuclear bombs are f*ck all new
You'd better start running when they drop on you
Run into a shelter, play hide and seek
Cause when you die your body reeks

F*ck the USA
