Cracks in the ceiling, crooked pictures in the hall
Countin' and breathin', I'm leaving here tomorrow
They don't know I never do you any good
Laughin' is easy, I would if I could

Ain't gonna worry
Just live till you die, want to drown
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone
There's nothing to save I know
You live till you die

Live till you die, I know

Loosing feelin', but I couldn't get the way ?
Countin' and breathin', disappearin' in the fade
They don't know I never do you any good
Stoppin' and stayin', I would if I could

Ain't gonna worry
Just live till you die, want to drown
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone
There's nothing to save I know
You live till you die
