I'll catch your smile on someone's face
Your whisper in the wind's embrace
Through diamond stars and songs, and dreams
I find your love in everything

The sun, the sky, the rolling sea
All conspire to comfort me
From sorrow's edge life's beauty seems
To find your love in everything

I've come to trust the hope it brings
To find your love in everything
Even as I fall apart
Even through my shattered heart

I'll catch your smile on someone?s face
Amazing grace
