We are taking it easy
Bright and breezy, yeah
We are living it up
Just fine and dandy, yeah

And it really doesn't matter that we don't eat
And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep
No it really doesn't matter
Really doesn't matter at all

'Cause we are so young now
We are so young, so young now
And when tomorrow comes
We can do it all again

We are chasing the moon
Just running wild and free
We are following through
Every dream and every need

And it really doesn't matter if we don't eat
And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep
No it really doesn't matter
Really doesn't matter at all

'Cause we are so young now
We are so young, so young now
And when tomorrow comes
We can do it all again

Yeah, we are so young now
We are so young, so young now
And when tomorrow comes
We'll just do it all again

All again, all again, yeah
All again, all again
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So young now
We are so, so young now
And when tomorrow comes
We'll just do it all again

Yeah, we are so young now
We are so young, so young now
And when tomorrow comes
We'll just do it all again
