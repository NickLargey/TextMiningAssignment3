I used to be contagious
Like the blue waves on my wall
The 19 years I didn't know you 
I still love you for them all
Climbing out of highway crashes 
Throwing away your gun
Do you ever think maybe we're similar 
Just looking for someone
 
All summerlong
You made me high when I was down
All summerlong
The city smiled when you were around
Now the summer's gone
I gotta say something feels wrong
Now the summer's gone
I gotta say something feels wrong
 
I used to be infectious
Now I feel a continent away
Chasing the ghost that haunts you
Has nothing to do with you today
I've been tangled up for two years straight
I guess the blueprints didn't show
Why must you be so dramatic
You always say you've got to go
 
You don't know the way I feel about you
Now the summer's gone
I gotta say something feels wrong
Now the summer's gone and I think I'll end my song
'Cause something feels wrong
