You runnin’ around in circles
But you won’t find no better than this
And after all your searchin’
You come back to the place that you missed

But I’m closin’ up for the season
I see you out there you’re freezin’
But I’m never lettin’ you back in again

Oh no, oh no
I’ll never go back there no more
Oh no, oh no
I’ll never go back there no more

Lookin’ at my heart beat
Like I’ve never seen it before
Too alive to ever sleep
And this street is keeping me warm
I’m pushin’ up on the ceiling
I’m beatin’ back all my demons
And I’m never lettin’ you back in again

Oh no, oh no
I’ll never go back there no more
Oh no, oh no
I’ll never go back there no more

I can’t take it no more, this
Scratches on my soul
I can’t, and I’ll never let you near my heart again

Oh no, oh no
I’ll never go back there no more
Oh no, oh no
I’ll never go back there no more

Oh no, oh no
I’ll never go back there no more
Oh no, oh no
I’ll never go back, never never go back no more
