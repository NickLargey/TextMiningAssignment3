I kissed your lips and I tasted blood
I asked you what happened and you said theire'd been a fight
You said I've been fighting for your honor but you wouldn't understand
I said hold on your honor I'll get ice for your hand
Oh you been fighting for my honor and I don't understand
But hold on your honor I'll get ice for your hand
You said c'mon baby let's just make love
It's the only thing to make me better
You said come on let's just get you out of that sweater
I said I don't kiss losers and I don't kiss winners
And I don't fight for honor cause we all are born sinners

Gargle with peroxide
A steak for your eye
But I'm a vegetarian so it's a frozen pizza pie
You tell me that you care and you never do lie
And you fight for my honor but I just don't know why

Mary had a little lamb it's fleece was white as snow
You've got me and I'm just a common ho
But I know what I am and I know what I ain't
So don't get cut cause I still won't be no saint

Gargle with peroxide
A steak for your eye
But I'm a pizzatarian so it's a frozen pizza pie
You tell me that you love me and you never do lie
And you fight for my honor but I just don't know why
You fight for my honor and I don't understand
But hold on your honor I'll get ice for your hand
