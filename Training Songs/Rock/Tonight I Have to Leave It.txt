Don't you come up to me and say you like it
It's better if you say you hate it, that's the truth exactly
When we go out dancing I don't want to be bothered
Just want to be bothered with real love

So I heard it's no good to run
But it feels so much better now that it's done
And tonight I have to leave it
Yes, tonight I have to leave it

So, so I heard you know how to write it
Does it mean you're good at putting things on paper?
Rumors say that you're very sorry
Oh no, you're not sorry, no, you're not

So I heard it's no good to run
But it feels so much better now that it's done
And tonight I have to leave it
Yes, tonight I have to leave it

Yes, tonight I have to leave it
Yes, tonight I have to
Yes, tonight I have to leave it

Give love, give love
Why won't you give love, give love?
Why don't you give love, give love, give love?
Why won't you give love, give love, give love?

Yes, tonight I have to
Oh yes, tonight I have to leave it
Yes, tonight I have to
Yes, tonight I have to
Yes, tonight I have to leave it
