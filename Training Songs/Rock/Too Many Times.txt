Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times

Too many times I've seen the sun come up through bloodshot eyes this week
No matter what I do since we broke up I find it hard to sleep

The room is spinning from too many drinks I've drunken by myself
I know that staying here and drinking beer is no good for my health

What is there left to do
But to drink and watch the view
I think that it might rain this afternoon

Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times

The doctor that I went to couldn't do any good
He gave me pills for sleeping,
I took more than I should, than I should.

Too many times I've seen the sun come up through bloodshot eyes this week
No matter what I do since we broke up I find it hard to sleep

What is there left to do
But to drink and watch the view
I think that it might rain this afternoon

Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times [fade]
