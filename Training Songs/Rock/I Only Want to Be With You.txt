I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never want to let you go
'Cause you've started something, oh, can't you see
That ever since we met, you've had a hold on me?
It happens to be true, I only wanna be with you

It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I want to spend each moment of the day with you
Oh, look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true, I only wanna be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
And asked me if I wanna date
And I fell into your open arms
Oh, and I didn't stand a chance

Now hold on, baby
I just wanna be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, baby, I don't care
'Cause you've started something, oh, can't you see
That ever since we met, you've had a hold on me
No matter what you do, oh, I only wanna be with you

Oh, oh, you stopped and you smiled at me
And asked if Id care to dance
I fell into your open arms
And I didn't stand a chance

Now listen, honey
I just wanna be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, baby, I don't care
'Cause you've started something, oh, can't you see
That ever since we met, you've had a hold on me
No matter what you do, oh, I only wanna be with you

No matter what you do
I only wanna be with you
