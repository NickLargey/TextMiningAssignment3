Crawl off the faces
With my nonsense
And clog your ears with ashes
And boiled the sound to dry
It's not your fault you're not my hero
It's not your fault I can't make it clear enough
It's not your fault at all
Do do do
Break off my jaw
Scrape off my teeth
Pull off my leg
Drop off my load
For a quarter, you can give him a quarter
You can go into town with a reason to have an erection
I like your tatoo depiction
South Carolina
Because I've been dying
And I've been trying
For ways to get through
Days to get through
And I chew my grass
Just my grass
My grass, my grass, my grass, my...
Do do do
Do do do
South Carolina
Carolina
Carolina
South Carolina
Because I've been searching for you
I've been praying for you
I've been saying for you
I've been waiting for you
South Carolina
Do do do
Do do do
