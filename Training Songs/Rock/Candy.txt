Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

I'm so addicted
To the lovin' that you're feeding to me
Can't do without it
This feeling's got me weak in the knees

Body's in withdrawal
Every time you take it away
Can't you hear me callin'
Begging you to come out and play, oh yeah

So baby, come to me
Show me who you are
Sweet to me
Like sugar to my heart, baby
I'm cravin' for you
I'm missin' you like candy

Sweet, sweet lovin'
Got me going to the extreme
Won't go without it
This vibe has got a hold on me, oh baby

Satisfying, baby
Let me show you what I'm made of
No doubt about it boy
Got me feeling crazy, can't get enough

Baby, baby, baby, won't you come to me
Show me who you are
Sweet to me
Like sugar to my heart, baby
I'm cravin' for you
I'm missin' you like candy

So baby, come to me
Show me who you are
Sweet to me
Like sugar to my heart, baby
I'm cravin' for you
I'm missin' you like candy

You know who you are
Your love's as sweet as candy
I'll be forever yours
Love always, Mandy

Boy, I'm cravin'
Missin' you like candy

So baby, come to me
Show me who you are
Sweet to me
Like sugar to my heart, baby
I'm cravin' for you
I'm missin' you like candy

So baby, come to me
Show me who you are
Sweet to me
Like sugar to my heart, baby
I'm cravin' for you
I'm missin' you like candy
