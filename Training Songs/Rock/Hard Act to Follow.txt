Pickin' up the pieces
Sweepin' off the dust
I thought it would be better
But it's never been so rough
Flippin' through old numbers 
Dependin' on the past
It helps to have some company
But it seems to never last

Then it comes
The loneliness within
Like a stone
Crushin' me again

You're a hard act to follow
I can't find nobody, baby quite like you
You're a hard act to follow
Yeah yeah

Yesterdays were easy
Gentle on my mind
I'd run to you for shelter from the storm 
And leave the world behind
The way you cleared my senses
The way you soothed my soul
If only I had faith in you
My tears would never flow

Now you're gone
My hope is all in vain
I was wrong
I couldn't make you stay

You're a hard act to follow
There ain't anything, baby quite like you
You're a hard act follow
Yeah yeah

Everything I done
I can't change
One to many crosses to bear
Who's to blame?
Oh just to have you back today

Oh then it comes
The loneliness within
I was wrong
It's crushin' me again

You're a hard act to follow
I can't find nobody quite like you
You're a hard act to follow yeah

You're a hard act to follow
There ain't anyone like you
You're a hard act to follow yeah
There ain't anything like you
I can't find nobody quite like you
