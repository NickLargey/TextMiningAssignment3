She goes to bed
She goes to bed with a smell
Of another woman
Of another man

Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho

My nowhere heart
Strained through years of one-hand worship
Longs for 
Your naked body clothed
My burned-out heart
Behind the eyes that search for nowhere
Calls me 
Out from the blank page into
My nowhere heart
My burned out heart

She goes to bed
She goes to bed with a smell
Of another woman
Of another man

Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
Oh

Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho

My nowhere heart
Strained through years of one-hand worship
Longs for
Your naked body clothed
My burned-out heart
Behind the eyes that search for nowhere
Call me
Out from the blank page into
My nowhere heart
Your burned out heart

She 
She goes to bed with a smell
I still remember
I still remember very well
She
She goes to bed with a smell
That silver (?) 
That silver flower jezebel
She
She goes to bed
She goes to bed with a smell
She
She goes to bed with a smell
I still remember 
Very well
