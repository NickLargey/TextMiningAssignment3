There are ways I've been fallin'
There are times when I've been so weak
There are moments, I hear redemption call them
But I'm too far down to speak

So come sweet fire of mercy, cover up my skin
Warm me like the sun, oh, won't you let me in

So come, come undone
So come, come undone

There are scars that I've been hiding
There are ghosts that I do not name
There are closets I don't like ever open
But they open all the same

So come sweet fire of mercy, cover up my skin
Warm me like the sun, oh, won't you let me in

So come, come undone
So come, come undone

I come, come undone
Come, let me come undone

So come, come undone
So come, come undone
