He'll laugh and say that he can't sleep
And he don't know the reason why
Maybe it's the evil eye
Oh, that awful evil eye

Remember how he used to hold you close
Now in the middle of the night
Oh, the evil eye
Oh, that awful evil eye

Someone must really have it in for him
The way they're stickin' him with pins

I know he's sick but we can't be sure
Still, from everything I've heard
It's hard to cure the evil eye
Oh, that evil eye

Has he lost weight and his lips gone pale?
Covered in little white lies
Oh, the evil eye 

You've got me worrying about your health
'Cause you don't look so good yourself

Somebody must've gotten hurt a lot
By somebody crueler than you thought
Now you've got the evil eye
Oh, that awful evil eye
Evil eye
