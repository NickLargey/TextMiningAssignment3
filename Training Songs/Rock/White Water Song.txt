I'll finish this jigsaw
I'll find the pieces behind the couch
I dream we were slow dancing
I dream I knew your name
Between sleep and waking we're drinking flavored vodka in bed
And when I wake I'm all the King's horses and all King's men

I make wild laughing rivers
From streams
Above white water noise
No-one can hear my screams

I threw my eyes to heaven
And I asked for a sign
They said I can get back my yesterday
If I cross the date line

But I'm sick of all this hope
Sometimes the stars are not enough
I'm sick of all this hope
Sometimes the stars are too much

I make wild laughing rivers
From streams
Above white water noise
No-one can hear my screams

Quite please
