You had a little skull
Where all the silly thoughts would run
They started heading south
Went down and came out your mouth

You say some stupid things
Some very stupid things
But you hit your head
Think you're a little dead

Stand back a little more
So you can see what's around you
They're coming through your door
Like before with a strait jacket

You say some stupid things
Some very stupid things
But you hit your head
Think you're a little dead

Hey yeah yeah
You felt numb from all the drugs
They made you numb
They shot you from the hip

And tied you up for madness
You say some stupid things
Some very stupid things
But you hit your head

Think you're a little dead
Hey yeah yeah
You say some stupid things
Some very stupid things

But you hit your head
Think you're a little dead
You say some stupid things
Some very stupid things

But you hit your head
Think you're a little dead
Hey yeah yeah
