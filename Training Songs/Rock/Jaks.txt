I ain't goin to work today yea why not? 
'cause id rather work on breakin my own bones with some style ya know 
Go 45 M.P.H Go down hill on a skate there's a 
Code that ya better know and there's A style & that's to skate 
We skate in packs our flag is 
Jaks there's always time to race only a fool has a pool 
And keeps it full only a trader won't tradehis pools 

[chorus] 
There I am skatin' solo down 9th Ave. 
A couple bikers pull up one on each side 
They're wavin back and forth they try to lock me in 
And here comes a bus these scumbags want me dead I know they want my head 
A jak pulls up, pulls a drumstick out of his pocket 
Sticks it in the spokes, and the biker slams don't laugh 
'cause he was a jak we gotta go
