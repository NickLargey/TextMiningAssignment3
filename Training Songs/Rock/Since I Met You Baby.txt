I used to wake up in the morning with an aching head. 
I couldn't remember anything I'd said. 
My friends told me I was getting out of line. 
If it wasn't for you baby, I'd be doing time. 
Since I met you baby, 
you've made a new man of me. 
Since I met you baby, 
I'm happy as a man could be. 
Yes, I am. 
I used to think I was better than the rest. 
Ain't no doubt about it, I was no second best. 
Didn't seem to matter what was right or what was wrong. 
I did some crazy things before you came along. 
Since I met you baby, 
you've made a new man of me. 
Since I met you baby, 
I'm happy as a man could be. 
Yes, I am. 
Since I met you baby. 
Since I met you baby. 
Since I met you baby. 
Since I met you baby. 
Since I met you baby, 
I'm happy as a man could be. 
One more time! 
Since I met you baby. 
Since I met you baby. 
Since I met you baby. 
Since I met you baby. 
Since I met you baby. 
Since I met you baby. 
Since I met you baby. 
Since I met you baby. 
Well, since I met you baby, 
I'm happy as a man could be. 
Yes, I am. 
Happy as a man can be. 
You tell 'em Gary! 
Yeah!
