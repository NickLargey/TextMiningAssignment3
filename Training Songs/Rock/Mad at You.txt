When you're fixing your make-up
You know you take too long
And when you mix me a drink up
You know you mix it too strong
And when you fix me a breakfast
You know you fix it too late
With the wrong kind of egg-cup
And the wrong kind of plate
But honey look at your eyes
You got the innocent eyes
And now you're asking me why
I'm mad at you
Mad at you

So come on what's your problem
You know we'll miss half the show
How come I'm walking so fast
How come your walking so slow
After fixing your make-up
For an hour and a half
You say your new shoes are hurting
And you expect me to laugh
But honey look at your eyes
You got the innocent eyes
And now you're asking me why
I'm mad at you
Mad at you
