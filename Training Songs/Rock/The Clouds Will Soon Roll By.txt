Somewhere the sun is shining
So, honey, don't you cry
We'll find a silver lining
The clouds will soon roll by

I hear a robin singing
Upon a treetop high
To you and me he's singing
The clouds will soon roll by

Each little tear and sorrow
Only brings you closer to me
Just wait until tomorrow
What a happy day that will be

Down Lovers Lane together
We'll wander, you and I
Goodbye to stormy weather
The clouds will soon roll by
