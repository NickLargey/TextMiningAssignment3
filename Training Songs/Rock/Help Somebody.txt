Well grandaddy was a hillbilly scholar, 
blue collar of a man...
He came from the school 
where you didn't need nothin' if you couldn't make it with your own two hands
He was backwoods, backwards, used words like: 
no sir, yes ma'am, by god, be darned, hell yeah I'm American..
and all the years he walked this earth 
I swear all he did was work.
He said the devil dreams on an idle horse
so you listen to me squirt..

Don't get too high on a bottle, 
and get right with the man. 
Fight your fights, find your grace 
and all the things that you can't change, and help somebody if you can

Now Granny said sonny
stick to your gun if you believe in something
no matter what
cause it's better to be hated for who you are
Than beloved for what you're not.
She was 5 feet of concrete
New York born and raised on a slick city street.
She'll stare you down, stand her ground, 
still kickin' and screamin' at 93
I remember just how frail she looked 
in that hospital bed
taking her last few breaths of life
and smiling as she said

Don't get too high on a bottle, 
just a little sip every now and then,
fight your fights, 
find your grace,
and all the things that you can't change
and help somebody if you can,
and get right with the man

I never let a cowboy make the coffee
yeah that's what Granny always said to my Grandad
and he'd say never tell a joke
that ain't that funny more than once
and if you want to hear God laugh, 
tell Him your plans

Don't get too high on a bottle, 
get right with the man, son.
fight your fights, 
find your grace,
and all the things you two can't change
and help somebody if you can
and get right with the man

and get right with the man
