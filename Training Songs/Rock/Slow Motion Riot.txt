What have we here storm before calm.
Strung out on fear so pass me the napalm
Break Bread with me before it is stolen
Sleep with one eye open silence is golden
Life a magazine Death a Reality
Drug dealer heroes thug celebrities
Rush hour gridlock may seem drastic
An open road compared to drug traffic

Starving to death on a Quaalude diet
Living in a Slow Motion Riot
Concisness it has been gagged and bound
Better make your last confession
The worlds doing its best impression
Of a ship with nowhere to go but down

Skyscraper fantasies Ghetto realities
Dreams watered down like softcore pornography
Watch your step gang related death
Funeral day wonder who's next
Crime is the standard built up Immunity
Only care if it's our community
Smokescreen safety can't trust the Government
In this world hell seems heaven sent

Were in a Slow Motion Riot
Life a Fantasy Death Reality
Life a Quarantine Death a courtesy
Life a Brevity Death Finality
Life a foul disease Death a Remedy
