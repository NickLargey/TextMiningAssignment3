She came to me 
With her arms 
Open wide
Learnt my style
There she stood 
Like a child

With her hair
Flowing down in blue cascades
Love, lapping at her feet
Life, dancing in a masquerade
My completeness

I could say no words
None would breathe
With my heart
On my sleeve
All was clear
There she was

With her hair
Flowing down in blue cascades
Love, lapping at her feet
Life, dancing in a masquerade
My completeness

Alright
She's everything to me

She came to me
With her arms 
Open wide
Learnt my style
There she stood 
Like a child

With her 
Hair, flowing down in blue cascades
Love, lapping at her feet
Life, dancing in a masquerade
Hair, flowing down in blue cascades
Love, lapping at her feet
Life, dancing in a masquerade
My completeness
She's everything to me, yeah
