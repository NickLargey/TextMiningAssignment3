Back in the day
Even circles were squares
Radio waves
Move like pollen in air

When there ain't no water
And there ain't no trees
Just a dry wind singing
Through the telegraph keys

And generations
Leave resonations
From demonstrations
To all the destinations

Let's go burnin' down the road
Let's go burnin' down the road

Bright in the city
Wars spread in the world
You're out buying pajamas
For your four year old girl

Cheap on the rack
Feel like dirt
Oh do you feel like dirt
Cos you can see into the shaft
But it's self-assured

And generations
Leave resonations
From demonstrations
To all the decimations

Let's go burnin' down the road

Back in the day

And generations
Leave resonations
From demonstrations
To all the decimations

Let's go burnin' down the road
Let's go burnin' down the road

Let's go break down the walls
(?) together

Let's go burnin' down the road
Let's go burnin' down the road
