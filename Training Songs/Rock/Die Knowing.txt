I was searching the streets where we lost our stride
Making our way through the earth
My heart was marching to a different beat
While my choices were making it harder to find 

You took the straight and narrow
Prying eyes watching from overhead
I took the other
Down, but recovered 
And I would do it all over and over again

Disappointment, dedication
Elevated catastrophe

Die knowing that you lived to find 
Die knowing where your friendships lie 
Die knowing you gave nothing less 
Die knowing it was imminent
Die knowing what your failures find
Die knowing where your friendships lie 
Die knowing you gave nothing less 
Die knowing it was imminent.
