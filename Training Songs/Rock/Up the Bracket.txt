I saw two shadow men on the Vallance Road
Said they'd pay me for your address
Oh I was so bold

I said you see these two cold fingers
These crooked fingers I show
You a way to mean no

Well they didn't like that much I can tell you
Said sunshine I would n want to be in your shoes
And they chased me up three flights of stairs
Caught me in the lift how I sighed and said
Help 'cause you're impossible

But it's just like he's in another world
Doesn't see the danger on show
He'll wind up like Joseph bloody in a hole

And it's just like she's in another world
How they suit each other oh
But you never get close
Its impossible

Saw the same two men on the Cally road
Said they'd double their offer I was so bold
To say you see these two cold fingers
These crooked fingers I show
Oh You's a way to mean no

But it's just like he's in another world
Doesn't see the danger on show
He'll end up like Joseph bloody in a hole

It's just like she's in another world
How they suit each other oh no
Oh you never get close
Unstoppable

I said you see these two cold fingers
These crooked fingers I show
You a way to mean no

But it's just like were in another world
How they suit each other oh no
But you never get close
That's close enough
