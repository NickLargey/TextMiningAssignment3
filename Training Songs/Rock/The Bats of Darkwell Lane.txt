In Darkwell Lane there's bats in the sky tonight
They breathe the same
And we come to life at night
Our eyes become bright

Fly all the night
Sleep when its light

They seem insane,
To circle for hours and hours
What's in their brains
But dreams of the sea, relief
Can we get some sleep

Fly all the night
Sleep when its light
Fly all the night
Sleep when its light
