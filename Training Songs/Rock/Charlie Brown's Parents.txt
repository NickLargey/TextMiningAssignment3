And I can't hear
What you're saying, what you're doing to me
And can't you see
It would take the jaws of life to pry open your words
So pry open your words

I don't want to talk about Elvis
No I don't want to go on pretending, no
Because if feels like I'm talking to
I'm talking to Charlie Brown's parents
It feels like I'm talking to
A lonely man without a vision
Stuffed his mouth with indecision

Why he's a lonely man without a vision?
Stuffed his mouth with indecision

'Cause I can't hear
What you're saying and what you're doing to me
And can't you see
It would take the jaws of life to pry open your words

I don't want to talk about Jesus
And I don't want to go on converting, no
Because it feels like I'm talking to
I'm talking to Charlie Brown's parents
It feels like I'm talking to
A lonely man without a vision
Stuffed his mouth with indecision

Why he's a lonely man without a vision?
Stuffed his mouth with indecision

'Cause I can't hear
What you're saying and what you're doing to me
And can't you see
It would take the jaws of life to pry open your words

Why he's a lonely man without a vision?
Stuffed his mouth with indecision
Why he's a lonely man without a vision?
Stuffed his mouth with indecision

'Cause I can't hear
What you're saying and what you're doing to me
And can't you see
It would take the jaws of life to pry open your words

Pry open your words, pry open
And pry open, and pry open your words
Yeah pry open your words
Pry, pry open your words, pry open your words
And pry open your words
