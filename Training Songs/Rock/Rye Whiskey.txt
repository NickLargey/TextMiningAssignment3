Jack of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds, I know you most of all
You've robbed my poor pockets of silver and gold
And whiskey, you villain, you've been my down fall
You've cuffed and you've kicked me but I loved you of old

Oh, whiskey, rye whiskey, whiskey, I cried
If I don't get rye whiskey I surely will die

Well, I go yonder mountain and build me a still
And I send you a gallon for a five dollar bill
Well, it's beefcake when I'm hungry, whiskey when I'm dry
And it's greenbacks when I'm hard off and hell when I die

I said, "Whiskey, rye whiskey, whiskey", I cried
"If I don't get rye whiskey I surely will die"

If the sea were made of Whiskey and I was a duck
I'd swim to the bottom and never come up
Oh, but the sea ain't made of Whiskey and I ain't a duck
So I'll play Jack of Diamonds and trust on my luck

I said, "Whiskey, rye whiskey, whiskey", I cried
"If I don't get rye whiskey I surely will die"

I said, "Whiskey, rye whiskey, whiskey", I cried
"If I don't get rye whiskey I surely will die"

Ohh, if I don't get rye whiskey I surely will die
