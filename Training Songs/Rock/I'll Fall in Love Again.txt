You do what you wanna do
I'll leave it all up to you
In time, I'll find love again

Hot love growin' cold
Just when you thought you'd found a heart of gold
Looks like, I've been fooled again

Oh but it's all right with me now
I'll get back up somehow
And with a little luck I'm bound to win
And I'll fall in love, I'll fall in love again

And you're always sittin' ring side
Just a rollin' with the changing tide
The tide has washed you from my mind

And I guess you think you've got it made
Oh but then you never were afraid
Of anything that you've left behind

Oh but it's all right with me now
I'll get back up somehow
And with a little luck yes I'm bound to win
'Cause I'll fall in love, yes I'll fall in love again

Yea, yea, yea, oh yea
Yea, yea, yea, oh yea
I'll fall in love again
I'll fall in love again baby
I said "I, I'll fall in love again"
Yes I'll fall in love again

Here's something to compare it to
Like the little things you used to do
Like giving more than you take

Funny how the reasons grow
Then the very next thing you know
The odds change, dividing up the cake

Hey but it's all right with me now
I'll get back up somehow
And with a little luck yes I'm bound to win
'Cause I'll fall in love

Yes it's all right with me now
Don't worry 'bout me baby I'll get along somehow
Yes it's all right
Yes it's all right
Yea will you do what you wanna do?
Oh yes it's all right with me now
