There was a time I would’ve given my life
For another day with your touch
Never quite added up
The way you made such a fuss
About nothing at all

I thought you were crazy in love
But you were just crazy oh oh
I was pushed to the edge
Cleaning somebody’s mess
Well never again will I let you
F*ck with my head
Well never again will I let you
F*ck with my head

I thought you were crazy in love
But you were just crazy oh oh
I was pushed to the edge
Cleaning somebody’s mess
Well never again will I let you
F*ck with my head

From the girls to the government
Your boy Champs see the world on some other shit
Scotty gotta beam me up to the mother ship
I'm runnin’ undercover but I'm one of them runnin’ it
And I'm wonderin’ if this is not just another fake slumber from which I will arise
I am a problem, a threat and a virus in the eyes of your government, eyes of your god
You could say what you really want
No
You could say but you really won't know
You could say what you really want
But you really won't
Cuz you really don't know

You had me going
Without a warning
You turned into someone else
Maybe I was blind
Couldn’t see all the signs
But now I see so damn clear

I thought you were crazy in love
But you were just crazy oh oh
I was pushed to the edge
Cleaning somebody’s mess
Well never again will I let you
F*ck with my head
