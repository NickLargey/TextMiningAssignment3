Yeah oooh
Yeah oooh
Yeah oooh
Yeah oooh

I do not own you
Don't wanna control you
Oh, you're my vision
How foolish I've been

I'll paint a picture
You'll be the victor
There's no illusion
I'm here to choose it

This is how it feels, when
Love it gets too real, yeah
Oh, I got no ransom
I had my chance man

This is how it feels when
Love it gets so real, yeah
Are you still a holding
Onto what we had?

Yeah oooh
Yeah oooh
Yeah oooh
Yeah oooh

Oh she went straight for my veins
And now I'm back home again
And I'm waiting for
The sun to come again

She went down straight through my veins
Now I'm back home again
I've been waiting for
The sun to come again, yeah

I can't control you
Don't wanna own you
'Cause you're my vision
How foolish I've been

You were the witness
To all my darkest days
I said I'm sorry but it
Can't take that pain away

This is how it feels, when
Love it gets too real, yeah
Oh, I got no ransom
I had my chance man

This is how it feels when
Love it gets so real, yeah
Are you still a holding
Onto what we had?

Yeah oooh
Yeah oooh
Yeah oooh
Yeah oooh

She went down straight through my vein
Now I'm back home again
And I'll be waiting for
The sun to shine again

She went straight for my veins
And now I am back home again
I'll be praying for
The sun to come again

Ahh straight for my veins
Now I am back home again
Oh I've been praying for
The sun to come again
She went straight for my veins
Now I am back home again
Oh I've been praying for
The sun to come again
Oooh
Ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo ooo
Oh straight through my veins
I'm back home again
I'll be waiting for
The sun to come again
Ooo ooo, ooo ooo, ooo ooo, ooo ooo
