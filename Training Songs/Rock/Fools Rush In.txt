Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.
And so I come to you my love,
My heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there.
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Fools rush in where wise men never go.
But wise men never fall in love,
How are they to know
When we met, I felt my life begin.
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Though I see the danger there.
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care
Fools rush in where wish men never, never go.
Ah but wise me never fall in love
So how are they to know.
When we met I felt my life begin.
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in
Open up your heart because I'm coming in
I said open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Yes, open up your heart and let this fool rush in.
