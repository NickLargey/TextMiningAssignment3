Sweet heart fever
Standing over
When my smiles are made

Sweet heart fever
Taking over me
Under starlight

And I, I won't lie in the way
Of my smile getting the right attention

Let it burn out, shining brighter
I'll find a place to play

Sweet heart fever
Take it, take it away
From this body

I won't lie in the way
Of my smile getting the right attention
