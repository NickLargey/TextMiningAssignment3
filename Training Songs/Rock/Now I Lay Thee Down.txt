Oh, I want to know
How it feels when we die
Can you take me under?

Dream over, grieve no more
And I breathe one last time
Now I lay thee down

Oh, she watched me leave
Me bleeding on the floor
As she takes me under

Dream over, grieve no more
And I breathe one last time
Now I lay thee down

Oh, godless mimicry while lights cemetery
Flashes of the angel's ivory wings
Images so many broken dreams

Of pain, terror, fear crippling
Follow the light into the tunnel
Or will it end up in a black hole?
Follow the light into the tunnel, dead in its end

Was it lost? Was it murdered?
Within the eye of the beholder
Was it lost? Was it murdered?
Within the eye of the beholder

What have I done?
I've gone and killed
The only one I love
How could I do this?

I'm screaming at God
Why do you curse me?
F*ck it, loaded, sever the day

Dream over, grieve no more
And breathe one last time
Now I lay thee
Now I lay thee down, underground
