Catch your breath,
Paddle to the shore,
Let the sunset,
She won't see him no more,
Asleep in the archways,
With wisemen and tramps,
Thinking about letters, lights and tramps.

If you turn back the clocks,
You'll fall asleep in the Ocean.

But it's gone just for a minute,
And i was away just for a minute,
The stars exploded,
Man you should have seen it
