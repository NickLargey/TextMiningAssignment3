Wait
The fact you did it
But don't admit it
Won't make you innocent

Fate
Will find you wicked
And turns you victim
For everything you have done
So justify the reason to kill

Reason to kill
I bet you will
You're fooling no one but yourself
But yourself
I wish you well
Oh what tangled webs we weave
When we practice to deceive
I know you well
I know you well

Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out

I just get it
How you manage
To justify who dies
Like judge and jury
You're the very
One who crucifies
Don't get your hands dirty to kill
Dirty to kill
Use someone else
Know all your lies are measured in hell

Measured in hell
I wish you well
Oh what tangled webs we weave
When we practice to deceive
I know you well
I know you well

Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out

Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out
