Be brave my love
The time has come
To cross the Tintagel sea
The fragrant air, the apple blossoms
Have all been beckoning
And there we’ll stand
Looking out upon the world that we’ve known
All fear will be gone
When we reach the shores of Avalon

You’ll be greeted there
By maidens fair
With eyes of the royal sea
In the garden they will braid your hair
With violets and rosemary
And there we’ll stand
Looking out upon the world that we’ve known
All fear will be gone
When we reach the shores of Avalon

Feel the wind on your face
As we cross the stormy sea
Close your eyes, don’t look back
There’s nothing left to see

The other night you came to me
Like an angel you appeared
And we climbed the endless sky
And held each other near
And there we’ll stand
Looking out upon the world that we’ve known
All fear will be gone
When we reach the shores of Avalon

Be brave my love...
