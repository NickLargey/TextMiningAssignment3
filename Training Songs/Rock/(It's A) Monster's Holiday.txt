Frankenstein was the first in line, and the Wolf Man came up next
Dracula was doing his stuff, breathing down my neck
Jump back, make tracks, here comes the Hunchback, better get out of his way
Fee fee, fi fi, fo fo, fum, it was a monster's holiday

Well, I hopped into bed and covered up my head
Said, "I'm gonna get a good night's sleep"
I got woken up about twelve o'clock and I jumped right to my feet

There was gremlins, and goblins, dragons, and zombies
Lordy, what an awful sight
I said, "good buddy, you may get me, but brother, let me tell you
That it's going to be after the fight"

Uncle Bill, well, he took ill, and they sent for me to come
Well, I had to pass by the old graveyard so I went on the run
There was screaming and moaning, wailing and groaning
Scary as a mummy's curse
