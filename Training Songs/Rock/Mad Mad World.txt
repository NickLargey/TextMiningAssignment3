I was standing with my paper there 
Minding my own news 
For everything that someone said 
Someone else had a different view 

I watched the whole thing there 
Unfold upon my TV screen 
"A new world order is on its way" 
Well pass the popcorn please 
You don't mean to tell me 
No one here is going to get hurt 
When there's folks at home who 
Eat dog food they can't afford a shirt 
Sure find out real fast who's a sitting duck 
When it's a

Mad mad world shake your hands 
And say good luck it's a 
Mad mad world I can not believe this stuff it's a 
Mad mad world getting madder every day     
Mad mad world get involved and they'll blow you away 
Sure find out real fast when you're a sitting duck 
That it's a mad mad world 

A little man sits up way high 
Way above the crowd 
Can you make them dance real fast 
Can you make them cheer real loud 

Money doesn't talk it swears 
It sounds like a big machine 
A voice on high says you reap what you sow 
Just keep your own nose clean 

More smoke fills up the air 
More toxins up the creek 
That's when the cash it changes hands 
So we turn the other cheek 
Sure find out real fast just when you've 
Had enough when it's a    

Mad mad world shake your hands 
And say good luck it's a 
Mad mad world I can not believe this stuff it's a 
Mad mad world getting madder every day     
Mad mad world get involved and they'll blow you away 
Sure find out real fast when you're a sitting duck 
That it's a mad mad world 

He walks into the office and 
He finds a big pink slip 
It's says "you are no longer needed here 
So take a good long trip" 
You can take your gold watch and 
Stick it you know where 
Cause he's fired up and he's jacked up and 
He's loaded up for bear 

Mad mad world shake your hands 
And say good luck it's a 
Mad mad world I can not believe this stuff it's a 
Mad mad world getting madder every day     
Mad mad world get involved and they'll blow you away 
Sure find out real fast when you're a sitting duck 
That it's a mad mad world
