You say, you're sorry once again, dear
You want me to take you back once more
You say, you need a helpin' hand, dear
Well, that's what you told me once before

Walk softly on this heart of mine, love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet, love
Walk softly on this heart of mine, walk on

I know someday, you'll find a new love
I'll feel your heart has turned to stone
But please, let me down real easy
'Cause loneliness moves in as you move on

Walk softly on this heart of mine, love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet, love
Walk softly on this heart of mine

Walk softly on this heart of mine
Walk softly on this heart of mine, oh
