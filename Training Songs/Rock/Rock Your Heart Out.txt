Got the devil in you
Got the devil in me
Play a dangerous tune
Come on and dance with thee
You got to throw your fists up
Shout your mouth out
Beat the walls down
Got to freak out
Rock your little
Rock your little
Rock your little heart out

(You gotta rock it on down)

Got everything you want
Got everything you need
Don't worry about the cost
Just sell your soul to me
You gotta bring the house down
Beat the drums loud
Bleed your life dry
Climb on lets fly
Rock your little
Rock your little
Rock your little heart out

Rock, rock your little heart out
(Rock it on down)

(Cut your teeth on this)

You gotta put your foot down
Beat your chest hard
Blow your brains out
Feel her shout loud
You gotta rock your heart out
Rock your heart out

Rock, rock your little heart out

(You rocket of love)
