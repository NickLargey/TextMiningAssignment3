High above the forest in an unseen place
Where the clouds will gather on another race
In the dungeon depths of an unknown cave
There's a stream that springs with a world to save
And it gathers up strength as it rolls along
And it gathers up hope for everyone
But it runs to plains where the farmlands weep
Through the brand new gardens where rich men sleep
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna prove it
And show the whole damned world how to use it
When I find it, when I prove it
I know that some damned fool is gonna lose it
For it's the river of hope, from the pool of tears
It's the river of hope, it's the river we lost for years
Past the chemical plant where the junk flows in
By the nuclear project where the children swim
Under bridges in a city where the bodies float
And the summer smell keeps the flies remote
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna prove it
And show the whole damned world how to use it
When I find it, when I prove it
I know that some damned fool is gonna lose it
For it's the river of hope, from the pool of tears
It's the river of hope, it's the river we lost for years
Through the swamp of a ghetto where the mission was lost
Where the dope is king and the silver boss
Past the trash and wreckage from the garbage trucks
Past the oil slick where the jail boat docks
To a home in some sea at the nations end
Where the submarine is freedom's friend
If we need that river like we did before
There can be no need for it lives no more
I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna prove it
And show the whole damned world how to use it
When I find it, when I prove it
I know that some damned fool is gonna lose it
For it's the river of hope, from the pool of tears
It's the river of hope, it's the river we lost for years
For it's the river of hope, from the pool of tears
It's the river of hope, it's the river we lost for years
