When I cry, I cry for you.
When I'm blue, it's just for you.
When I'm sad, it's always you.
Someones' livin' for their lover, someones' livin' for their lover.

Teardrops start, and it breaks my heart.
Teardrops fall, I want to drive ya home.
When your feeling blue, I'm thinking just of you.
Someones' livin' for their lover, someones' livin' for their lover.
And I love her, I love her!

A teardrop starts, and it breaks my heart.
And when a teardrop falls, I want to cry, cry, cry alone.
When your feeling blue, I'm waiting just of you.
Someones' livin' for their lover, someones' livin' for their lover.
And I love her, I love her!
