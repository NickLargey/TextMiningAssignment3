People of Earth we have heard your station
Sold your song to the United Nations
all on a debt to
the heads of state (yeah)
what could you do in this situation?

Throw
The voice you know
Wouldn't say yes 
the body says no
no no no

The body says no, no no no
I said man can you believe that she didn't need me?

Heavens to Betsy
come on let's see
What could be worse than the wheel of history
Rolling around all the rooms you prayed (played?)in
What can you do in this situation.

Throw the voice you know
wouldn't say yes
the body says no

Man can you believe she didn't need me
anymore than I needed her too?

Am I repeating myself to tell ya
Dreaming is what's left of psychadelia
caught in the wrath (laugh? grasp?) of an outlaw nation
what would you do in this situation?

Throw, the voice you know
wouldn't say yes, the body says no

Man, can you believe that she didn't need me
Anymore than I needed her too.
