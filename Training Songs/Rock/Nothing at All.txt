Anything we should know about your change?
Well there's an ideal inside of me
That we're nothing at all
There's nothing threatening controlling me
In fact there's nothing at all
And still the wheel turning's all I'll be
It carries on til you crawl
You gotta know what you want to be
But there's no number to call

You got a feeling nothing here is free
'Cause you grew up in a mall
On T.V.
And you can still hit a ball
You got a milllion things you want to flee
Smuggle an ounce in a doll
I cut you eyes so you can finally see
That they're nothing at all
Turns out there's nothing at all

There must be a flaw in this fatal eye
Have to contend with all night

Wasn't alive back in the sixties
Somehow that was my fault
I'm just a shell empty as can be
Yeah, I've got nothing at all
You want to put your trust in some solid thing,
Yeah, its a drug to us all
But there's no ideal inside of me
So I got nothing at all
No I got nothing at all
and I got nothing at all

Must be a fault in this fatal eye
Have to contend with all night
Such a danger so we gotta slide
Into the depths of the salt mine

There's nothing at all
