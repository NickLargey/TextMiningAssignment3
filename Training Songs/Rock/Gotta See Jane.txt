Red light, green light
Speedin' trough the dark night
Drivin' trough the poundin' rain
I gotta see Jane
Windshield, wiper splashin', splashin'
Callin' out her name 
Just gotta see Jane
I left her arms to find my way
To find a place for me in the world outside
I wasn't alive, I could not survive
The frantic pace
The constant chase
To win the race
Turned my heart cold inside
I gotta find what I left behind
Red light, green light
Speedin' through the dark night
Drivin' through the poundin' rain
I gotta see Jane
Freeway, byway
Tearin' up the highway
Runnin' up a world insane
Just gotta see Jane
A ton of steel that isn't real 
It could not feel what's in the heart of me
I was so alone in a world of stone
I missed her arms, that once held me 
That made me see, I was the lonely one
But now and then I was runnin' scared
And I could feel the touch of time
Turnin' the wheel of life to yesterday
When love and happiness were mine
I gotta find that world of Jane and me
Liked it used to be
Oh, I gotta see Jane, Oh, I gotta see Jane
Her love for me I pushed aside 
Walked out alone
To face a world turned cold
Although I tried I could not survive
The frantic pace
The constant chase 
To win the race
It's not a part of me
I've gotta find what I left behind
Oh, I gotta see Jane, I gotta see Jane
