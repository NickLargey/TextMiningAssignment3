Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight, to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven

Sally, take my hand, travel South 'cross land
Put out the fire but don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here but it's warm out here
Let's get together before we get much older

Don't cry, don't raise your eyes
It's only teenage wasteland

Sally, take my hand, travel South 'cross land
Put out the fire but don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here but it's warm out here
Let's get together before we get much older
