Nowhere bound and without a care
Livin' our lives in a way of "no fear"
Floatin' around in a storm
That blows us away from today

Step on it, baby don't let go
Follow the stupid,
Enlighten your soul
See the light,
Like an everlasting flame,
Burning bright

Every day the same,
Madness is the game
It's time for us to hit the road
Money more or less,
Sometimes it's a mess
But on and on confusion grows

Chorus:
Time keeps spinning in the afternoon
Our minds are up on the moon
In a state of permanent confusion
Life is just an illusion

Nowhere bound and without a care
Livin' our lives in a way of "no fear"
Floatin' around in a storm
That blows us away from today

Step on it, baby don't let go
Follow the stupid,
Enlighten your soul
See the light,
Like an everlasting flame,
Burning bright

Every day the same,
Loosing our brain
Reality's out of control
Women more or less,
Sometimes it's a mess
But on and on confusion grows

Chorus
