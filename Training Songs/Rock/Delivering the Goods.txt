Feeling rock queers, we're ready to kick tonight
No time to hesitating, my body's aching
Looking for some action, satisfaction all right
Charging, vain grace, as active as the hundreds size of proof
Megation, reliving on, we're ready to hit  the room

You better watch out and hold on tight  
We're here and your way like a dynamite  
Delivering the goods  
Delivering the goods

Shake down, rock them boys, crack that whip strip me
Want straight, airwaves, find a rather newer places down
Stealing your hearts all across the land
Hot blood doing good, we're gonna load it with our friend

You better watch out and hold on tight  
We're here and your way like a dynamite  
Delivering the goods  
Delivering the goods

Hey your way, stay your way
Oh it's all gonna punches, we aim with the crunches
Laugh until we send it to your brain
If we look before we fell, we knock but more than yell
Gonna do it again and again
We'll beat you into submission so you might as well surrender
Do come over and listen, just the angle by you're hearing the picture
Bust up, ah, 'til the seams that we're gonna break
Shoot further, giving more than you're ever gonna take
Leading your heads crushed down on the floor
Begging for mercy, be careful or I'll do it some more

You better watch out and hold on tight  
We're here and your way like a dynamite  
Delivering the goods  
Delivering the goods
