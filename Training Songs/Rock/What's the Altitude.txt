She said she couldn't stay when 
Her night had just begun 
She wanted me to know what, 
She didn't know herself 
Said I was one among others
Hey now that's somethin' else 

She played a vocal mission 
I played the cosmic (heart) 
Wanted to paint her picture 
She said don't even start 

She said loves like a drug and 
That this was chemistry 
But with these chemicals then

Lets go down by the bay now 
She turned her (hair) my way now 
Watch out, what you say now? 

Now the things you've been through make it seem like 
Nothing could ever really last forever but if you try, 
Girl we can do some things 

She gave me headphones 
Said have you heard this sound? 
I think I've heard this one it's 
Totally underground and 
I wouldn't let her go then 
She wouldn't let me go 
Just ask the neighbors man
