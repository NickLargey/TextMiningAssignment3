Born free, as free as the wind blows
As free as the grass grows
Born free to follow your heart

Live free and beauty surrounds you
The world still astounds you
Each time you look at a star

Stay free, where no walls divide you
You're free as the roaring tide
So there's no need to hide

Born free, and life is worth living
But only worth living
When you're born free
Born Free

Oh, no man should choose your life for you
No man has the right to say you'll live or die today

Born free, and life is worth living
But only worth living
When you're born free

Born free
