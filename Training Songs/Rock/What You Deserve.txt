Failing and unsure why am I losing my nerve
Wasting my time why do I only see this through the hurt

[Chorus]
I can't get it out of my head I can't get it out that
I do this to myself me and no one else
So help me tell me how to break free
I'm to blame and that's what really hurts
That's what really hurts
You get what you deserve

Jaded and broken
Out of place waiting my turn
Guilty fractured
And like you I don't know the answer

[Chorus]

I can't get it out of my head I can't get it out of my head
I heard the words you said to me

I do this to myself me and no one else 
So help me tell me how to break free
I'm to blame and that's what really hurts
That's what really hurts
You get what you deserve
