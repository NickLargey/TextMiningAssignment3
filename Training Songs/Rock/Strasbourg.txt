I'll meet you in West Germany
October 1983
I know that freedom was a lie
I know your husband was a spy
You say that words are impotent
But they can help us pay the rent
I knew for sure there was nothing left
Except the vodka on your breath

We meet in Strasbourg
In Strasbourg
Dann sind wir Helden
We meet in Strasbourg

The courage that your father plucked
From inside a cattle truck
Will help us fix the exit polls
Our children must have rock'n'roll
Surveillance cameras captured dawn
Breaking on the autobahn
I knew for sure our chance was blown
When rifles made you feel at home

We meet in Strasbourg
In Strasbourg
Dann sind wir Helden
We meet in Strasbourg
We meet in Strasbourg
In Strasbourg
Dann sind wir Helden
We meet in Strasbourg

Eins, zwei, drei, vier
Ideas can change the government
But they never listen to our arguments
On TV our friends smashed cement
And pulled down the bastards monuments
I went outside for a cigarette
I could see things I had tried to forget
The news showed us who we had left
And I could smell the vodka on your breath
