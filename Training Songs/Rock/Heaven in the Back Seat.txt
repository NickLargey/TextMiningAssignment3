Young girl looking to take a ride
Gonna get to love you
If it takes all night
Oh, yeah, next to you

She's got what I want
I got what she needs
Me and my baby
And the mirror makes three

Heaven in the backseat
Heaven in the backseat
(Backseat, baby)

You can't turn it down
You won't turn me round
(You won't do it)
I know you like it
I love what I see
I got your number
Your number is me

Oh, baby, start me up
(Heaven in the backseat)
I'll drive you crazy
With my backseat love

Come on, fire me up
(Heaven in the backseat)
You'll be in Heaven
In my backseat, baby

(Come on, start me up)
Come on, start me up
(Come on, fire me up)
You got to fire me up
Oh, oh

Television off, radio on
Shook my magic
Have a little fun
I smile like a private eye
I'm looking for the woman
With the perfect plan

Heaven in the backseat
(Backseat, baby)

(You can't turn me down)
You can't turn me down
(You won't turn me round)
You won't turn me round

(You won't do it)
I know you like it
I love what I see
I got your number
Your number is me

Oh, baby
Come on, start me up
(Heaven in the backseat)
I'll drive you crazy
With my backseat love

You'll be in Heaven
In my backseat, baby

Blood pressure going up
Exploding

Whoa, oh
