Day after day
He goes out of his way
'Cause he knows you're gonna be there
And if he doesn't say too much
At least he keeps in touch, to show his care

And it ain't like he never loved before
And it ain't like he'll never love no more
It's just that someday, maybe
He'll find some way baby
To turn you around

He may just be right
Why, is he so in love with you
Why, don't he find something else to do

Well, it ain't what he loves you for
And it ain't that you got so much more
It's just that sometimes someone
Got to play the dumb one to get along
(And you may just get along)

My my my my
He's a fool for you
No one else will do

Laugh and be gay, ooh
You look so nice that way
You know you'll get a smile
Wear a ribbon in your hair
He'll notice that it's there
Just his style

You just state your case and sing the song
And you take it as it comes along
Who knows someday maybe
You'll take a look out baby, and find you care

And I know you'll be there

My my my my
He's a fool for you
No one else will do

My my my my
He's a fool for you
No one else will do
