Sitting in a cornfield looking at a cob
Thinking of a long line waiting for a job
And I'm alone and that's a fact
I'm alone and that's a fact

Sitting in a full car someone at the wheel
Going to a new stop, I wonder if it's real
And I'm alone and that's a fact
And I'm alone and that's a fact

I need to maybe talk to you
Said I need to, and said I need you
I need to, I need to be with you
I said I need to, I gotta see you

Sitting at a new stop, didn't get the job
Couldn't find a long line, took another drop
And I'm alone and that's a fact
So I'm alone and that's a fact
And I'm alone, and I'm alone

Sitting at a new stop didn't get the job
Couldn't find a long line, took another drop
And I'm alone and that's a fact
So I'm alone and that's a fact
And I'm alone and that's a fact
That's a fact, that's a fact
