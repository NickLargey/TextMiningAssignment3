Peace and understanding is the wisdom of her world,
She loves without a reason, she gives without a word,
There are those who make me smile, brighten up my day,
But oh this woman she is something else again;

All the nights I've ever known are waiting in her eyes,
Sparkling like the silver, brimming like the wine,
Other lovers laid me down, took my breath away,
But oh this woman she is something else again; 
Oh she is a friend to me,
Holds me in my tears,
She said "Yes, you will be young again
When you look back through the years"
So take your woman by the hand, love her till she dies,
Be strong when she needs you, hold her when she cries,
And if a man should say to you, love just brings you pain,
You tell him "No, my woman's something else again,
Oh my woman's something else again, oh my woman's something else again"
