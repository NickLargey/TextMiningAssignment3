big city all scratched out,revenge is not so sweet
once proud once so devout they're tired and they are weak
they came from east to west,counting up the cost
red star soon to arrive,they know that all is lost

(chorus :)

and only the wounded remain
the generals have all left the game
with no will to fight
they'll fade with the light
there's nobody left they can blame

what once was decadence,now's nothing but raized land
the end so imminent,big city's not so grand
they came they saw they conquered ,people hid in fear
they looted, raped and plundered angry russians bare

(repeat chorus)

reichstag,flies red flag, signalling the end
party now bad bad, suicide the end
there's some who think that golden years might lie ahead
no leaders anymore, in the bunker ,dead

(repeat chorus)

and only the wounded remain
the generals have all left the game
with no will to fight
they'll fade with the light
the whole world is going insane
