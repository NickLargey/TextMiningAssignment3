Heroes are hard to find
Alright

Listen
Everybody says they want to change the world
Everybody's got a banner to unfurl
Man, woman, boy and girl
On the corner down the road and up the block
There's somebody who needs all what you've got
And they ain't asking for a lot

Well, God knows you can hear the people praying
You know you can turn away, you gotta give it a shot

Heroes are hard to find, won't someone take the time
Heroes are hard to find, we need you, come on and try
Heroes are hard to find, you've got to cross that line
Heroes are hard to find

In the movies, in the news or on TV
All the heroes seem so different but you see
They're the same as you and me
It don't matter who you are or what you've done
You don't need to have a badge or knife or gun
You can be the chosen one

Well, God knows the world could use some saving
You know that we'll lose, you gotta give it a try

Heroes are hard to find, won't someone take the time
Heroes are hard to find, is it you, come on and try
Heroes are hard to find, you've got to cross that line
Heroes are hard to find, ow

Oh yeah
Well, God knows you can hear the people praying
You know you can turn away, you gotta give it a shot

Heroes are hard to find, won't someone take the time
Heroes are hard to find, is it you, come on and try
Heroes are hard to find, you've got to walk that line
Heroes are hard to find
