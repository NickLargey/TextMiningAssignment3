You put a smile upon my face
When there was nothing left but sorrow
You showed me how to live again
And I'm so grateful for your love.

I bless the day you came to me
For God has sent me down an angel

And you have turned the tide
And made the world seem bright.
You and you alone
Have turned the dark to light.
You're my everything
No one can make me feel the way you do,
There can be no one,
No one but you.

All of my lonely days are gone
You gave me strength when I was falling
I pray we never say goodbye
I can't go on without your love.

I know there might be troubled times,
But we can work it out together

And you have turned the tide
And made the world seem bright.
You and you alone
Have turned the dark to light.
You're my everything
No one can make me feel the way you do,
There can be no one
No one but you.

I know there might be troubled times,
But we can work it out together

'Cause you have turned the tide
And made the world seem bright.
You and you alone
Have turned the dark to light.
You're my everything
No one can make me feel the way you do,
There can be no one
No one but you.

And when our life on Earth is over,
And all our worldly things are through,
I know we still will be together
Forever more, just me and you.
