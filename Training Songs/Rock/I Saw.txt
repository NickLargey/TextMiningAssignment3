It's amazing the look in your eyes
Like you could save me
But you won't even try
Then you tell me again
How everything will be alright
If I told you that I'm sorry
Would you tell me you were wrong?
Or would you hold me down forever
If I came to you for answers

I saw pictures in my head
And I swear I saw you opening up again
And I would be heavenly if baby you'd just rescue me now

While I'm surrounded, you spill
All alive and brand new
And I'll forget about you long enough

To forget why I need to

I saw pictures in my head
And I swear I saw you opening up again
And I would be heavenly if baby you'd just rescue me now

The days are drifting away from me
I still wake up burning through everything
It's all I know
Somebody save me now

I saw pictures in my head
And I swear I saw you opening up again
And I would be heavenly if baby you'd just rescue me now
