She was fading
Couldn't save her with my cursing 
At the laughing Lord in his golden chair 
She said "Leave me alone boy 

Can't you see I'm dying here" 
And the chapel was as empty as the bus station on Sunday 
And she was sad in her rented gown 
And the preacher had his stock quotes 

Hiding behind our wedding notes 
And his shares were going down

But I can't stop loving you baby
But I can't stop hating myself

So I stole her sunflowers hours before the service
She was nervous and I was broke
I couldn't be seen as I slipped between 
Some warm Jim Beam and my petticoat

Didn't hear from her family 
They were somewhere between San Fran and San Antone
Oh, sweet Lord had his mercy 
When he cursed me with a woman 
And I was damn sure happy being alone

I didn't have the courage to tell her I was nervous 
And I was worthless to the bone
She was laughing like a siren through the service 
'Cause she knew that I hated being alone

Baby was a bruiser 
But she was the only girl I had ever known
