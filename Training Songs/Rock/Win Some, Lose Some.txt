Now you know
That I stood outside your window just a little too long
Whatcha gonna do
When the hours pass away and you know that I'm gone

Jokin' bout your mother went a little to far
But you caught me - out with the others til the early dawn

There may be a time - if we played it right
I'm six blocks over and you wouldn't spend the night with me
Now and the hours and the minutes just fly away

You win some and you lose some
You gotta get right
Or I'll be saying bye bye bye bye

Thinkin' 'bout you
The way you're holdin' me down I'd be better off dead
Now you know
That the time is runnin' out on the things we said

Well it may be a week - it may be a day
I'm six blocks over and i don't know what to say to you
Now and the hours and the minutes just fly away

You win some and you lose some
You gotta get right
Or I'll be saying bye bye bye bye
