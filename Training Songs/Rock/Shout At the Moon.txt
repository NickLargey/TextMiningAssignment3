These streets they are so cold
I've been freezing here for days
I've been longing for your company
Like the sun you've cast astray
Well it's lonely in these bones
There's no feeling in this face
If you look into my eyes my dear there's no hope for saving grace

Oh is it lonely where you are tonight?
Oh is it lonely for you?

So every night I shout at the moon, shout at the moon
I'm walking with a stranger chasing shadows in my room
Yeah every night I shout at the moon, shout at the moon
I'm holding on to questions I don't know the answers to
And now hold on to me if you love me
Do you love me?
'Cause every night I shout at the moon, shout at the moon

So we'd wander on our own
Chase the night and seize the day
Waste no time for insecurity in the life that creates
So I thought you wouldn't have me any other way
But that didn't seem to be okay
So you walked out, out of everything we had and I find myself alone

So every night I shout at the moon, shout at the moon
I'm walking with a stranger chasing shadows in my room
Yeah every night I shout at the moon, shout at the moon
I'm holding on to questions I don't know the answers to
And now hold on to me if you love me
Do you love me?
So every night I shout at the moon, shout at the moon, woah

Oh

Every night I shout at the moon, shout at the moon
'Cause every night I hold on to you, hold on to you
And now hold on to me if you love me
Do you love me?
'Cause every night I shout at the moon, shout at the moon
(Shout at the moon, shout at the moon)
'Cause every night I shout at the moon, shout at the moon
(Shout at the moon, shout at the moon)
Yeah every night I shout at the moon, shout at the moon
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
