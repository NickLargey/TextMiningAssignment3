I remember feeling like this
Diggin' was as a child
Inspiration in my fingertips
Imagination running wild

Oh oh, you get me high
You get me high
You give me something so deep
You get me high

I remember feeling this way
You can lose it without knowing
You wake up and you don't know which way
The wind is blowing

Oh oh, you get me high
You get me high
You give me something so deep
You get me high

I ain't afraid of what people say
Ain't afraid of the great deception
Every bad dream comes my way
Trying to smoke on closer inspection

Oh oh, you get me high
You get me high
You give me something so deep
You get me high

You get me high
You get me high
You give me something so deep
You get me high
