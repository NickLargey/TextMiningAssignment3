When you think it's safe, and you're out at night.
Be careful, will you know what to do? 

There's times you hide, when there's footsteps behind.
Is anybody looking for you? 

Try to run, but you're out of breath.
So you turn and there's no one in view. 

Walk on humming, hear the footsteps start.
Do you know who's looking for you? 

Ducking into alleys, hiding in a dark doorway.
Hope you don't get spotted 'cos there's no way out.
Dare not to breathe, did you know who's listening?
A hand touches you, but you can't cry out, cry out. 

You're scared to death and you're nerves' on edge,
No escape, does it mean that you're through?
Deep inside your heart begins to pound.
Do you know who's looking for you? 

You've got to run, you have no choice,
And a shadow jumps out of the blue.
You see his face and the terror strikes,
Now you know who's looking for you! 

Ducking into alleys, hiding in a dark doorway.
Hope you don't get spotted 'cos there's no way out.
Dare not to breathe, did you know who's listening?
A hand touches you but you can't cry out,cry out. 

When you think it's safe,when you're out at night.
Be careful, will you know what to do?
Time to hide when there's footsteps behind.
Is anybody looking for you? 

They're looking for you!
Do you know who's looking for you?
They're looking for you!
Do you know who's looking for you?
They're looking for you!
They're looking for you! 

Now you know who's looking for you.
They're looking for you!
Now you know who's looking for you.
Now you know who's looking for you.
Now you know who's looking for you.
They're looking for you! You!
