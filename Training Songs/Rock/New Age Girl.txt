I've got a new age girl (Tell us what she's like)
An environmentalist girl (Does she ride a bike)
She has crystal necklace (She spend a lot of cash)
Though her vibes are rather reckless (She's heading for a crash)
Oh her flowing skirt is blowing in a transcendental wind
And she wonders without knowing where did she begin..

Mary Moon... she's a vegetarian (Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
Mary Moon... will outlive all the septuagenarians (Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
Oh, she loves me so
She hates to be alone
She don't eat meat
But she sure like the bone

You knew she drives a wind car (How does she like it)
It doesn't get her far (Why doesn't she bike it)
But it gets her to where she's going to (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
Where that is, I wish I knew
I don't know where she's going
And I don't know where she's been
All I know that loving her has gotta be a sin

Mary Moon... she's a vegetarian (Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
Mary Moon... will outlive all the septuagenarians (Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
Oh, she loves me so
She hates to be alone
She don't eat meat
But she sure like the bone

Mary Moon will you hesitate
Don't segregate your thought from your emotions
I know that devotion isn't way up there

Mary Moon... she's a vegetarian (Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
Mary Moon... will outlive all the septuagenarians (Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
Mary Moon... she's an intellectual (Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
Mary Moon... despite that fact remains quite sexual (Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
Mary Moon... she's the one for me, me, yeah
