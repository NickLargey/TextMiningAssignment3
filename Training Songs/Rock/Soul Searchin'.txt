The time in coming to do some soul searchin 
No more running, no more bridges burning 
The time is coming for you and me 
To take a look inside, no matter what we see 
Let's do some soul searchin', just you and me 
Our lives are changin', this old world keeps turning 
And I sit here wondering baby, what we're really learning 
I know you're just a woman, I'm just a man 
Let's be true to each other, do the best we can 
Let's do some soul searchin' -soul searchin' 
Some soul searchin-soul searchin' 
Let's do some soul searchin, just you and me 
There's a big train rollin' -big train rollin' 
I can hear it hummin' -hear it hummin' 
But the river is risin' -river is risin' 
And the rain keeps coming-rain keeps comin' 
It's time to get onboard, before we're washed away 
It's time to leave behind some things from yesterday 
Let's do some soul searchin' -soul searchin' 
Little bit of soul searchin' -soul searchin' 
Let's do some soul searchin', just you and me 
Just you and me 
Come and talk to me-the time is comin' 
You know the time is comin' -to do some soul searchin' (do some soul searchin') 
No more runnin'- they be no more running 
No more bridges burning-no more bridges burnin' 
It's time for every woman and every man 
Build a new world together, workin' hand in hand 
It's time to stop pretending that you're somebody else 
You know you can't change this world, but you can change yourself 
Let's do some soul searchin' -soul searchin 
Little bit of soul searchin' -soul searchin' 
We're gonna take a look inside, forget our foolish pride 
It's time to search our souls-search our souls 
And make a good thing whole 
Soul searchin. soul searchin, soul searchin'...
