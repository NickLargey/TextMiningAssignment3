Hubble, bubble, toil and trouble

Drivin' down the street just the other day
I saw this real fine girl and stopped and said "you're goin' my way?"
She said, "thanks for the ride but before I get inside
There's just one thing that I wanna say"

I drove to her house and dropped her by the gate
I thought, I'm doin' all right, so I asked for a date
She said "meet me at nine and you'd better be on time
'Cause I'll offer you to death if you show up late"

(Na-na) what in the world is wrong with this chick, now?
Somebody tell me, what makes her tick, now? (na-na)
Some chicks do you wrong but this one wrongs you doubly (na-na)
I never saw a girl who was so hubbly-bubbly (na-na)
