Is anyone out there? 
Does anybody listen or care anymore? 
We are living on a dying planet, 
We're killing everything that's alive, 
And anyone who tries to deny it 
Wears a tie 
And gets paid to lie 
So I wrote these songs for a dying planet, 
I'm sorry but I'm telling the truth, 
And for everybody trying to save it 
These songs are for you, too. 
Is anyone out there?
