Another wish didn't work out
Another nothing we can scream about
All fall down
Until the noise around us
Breaks down the light that found us everything
All fall down

She's so tall with her hands up
I'm so small whenever she's around
Someday soon I'm gonna tell her but
I'm not twentyone

Another dream didn't work out
So you found a way to let it out
All fall down
In the space between the heartbeats
Where the head and the heart they don't meet in the need
All fall down

My girlfriend tells me what people say
She's so tall with her hands up
I'm so small whenever she's around
Someday soon I'm gonna tell her but
I'm not twentyone, I'm not twentyone

Another circle I can run around
Another dark corner I can get lost in
All fall down
And if she and if she comes again and scares me
I'm gonna conjure up a prayer to be stronger
All fall down

Girlfriend tell me
She's so tall with her hands up
And I'm so small whenever she's around
Someday soon I'm gonna tell her but

She's so tall with her hands up
I'm so small whenever she's around
Someday soon I'm gonna tell her but
I'm not twentyone, I'm not twentyone

No I'm not twentyone
Someday I'll buy a gun
