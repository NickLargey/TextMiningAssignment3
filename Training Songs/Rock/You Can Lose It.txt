She tells you she loves you, calls you her man
But you're only just a small part of her plan
One minute she'll make you feel just like a king
The next make you crazy and forget how to sing

You can lose it and it won't be back at all
You can lose it and it won't be back at all

Everything that you do is just for her needs
But she's never said thank you and she's never said please
She'll destroy any talent that you ever had
And curse you for not being more of a man

You can lose it and it won't be back at all
You can lose it and it won't be back at all
(Won't be back at all)

Time and again she's had you up against the wall
Friends of all told you but she does not hear them at all, no, no, no
Dance in the fire before life goes by
'Cause you're gonna end up alone

She tells you she loves you, calls you her man
But you're only just a small part of her plan
One minute she'll make you feel just like a king
The next make you crazy and forget how to sing

You can lose it and it won't be back at all
You can lose it and it won't be back at all
(Won't be back at all)
