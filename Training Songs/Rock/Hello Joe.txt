Hello hello Joe it all went wrong 
But I know I'm not alone 
Play this tune all over the town 
Hello hello Joe I keep on strumming 
And I know I'll get it done 
Cause I'm not the only one 

I got it playing on my stereo who 
I'm never ever gonna let it go 
And I try to sing along 
And I know I can't go wrong 
Oh no no 

Hello hello Joe I'd like to have advice 
But you won't tell 
I strain my ears to straight to hell
Down in London town 
In these times of war 
You won't raise your voice no more 

It's still playing on my stereo 
I'm never ever gonna let it go 
And I try to sing along 
And I know I can't go wrong 

Hello hello Joe 
Yeah! 
Am I not the only one? 
Yeah!
Am I the only, am I the only one? 

It's not over, it's just begun 
Try to sing along 

I got it playing on my stereo who 
I'm never ever gonna let it go 

Hello hello Joe 
Hello hello Joe
