Here I am, God knows I'm stranded in our times
Suffocated, a champion in his prime
Call me a computer illiterate
Label me, non existent, null and void

Humble flowers stifled in our glorious backyard
Scurrying lovely little big brothers recording my life
Tamed children under the latest spell
Nice and pretty, better them than me

Overloaded realm, homeland of the genius and the lamebrain
Do I have my place 
Or will I keep digging through the sand 
Will me to be a leader as your slave
Or label me, non existent, null and void
