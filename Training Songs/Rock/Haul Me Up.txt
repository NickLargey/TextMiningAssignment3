Haul me up, please help me I'm drowning
Haul me up, to where I can breathe
Haul me up, where the air is sweeter
Stretch out a hand, a hand brother please

Oh I'm walking in a sea of molasses
Every step I take oh it sucks me down
The more I fight, the more that it grips me
If I sink much further, I'm looking to drown

Haul me up, well I'm lost in confusion
Haul me up, I'm up to my knees
Haul me up, I'm back in the quicksand
Stretch out a hand, a hand brother please

Haul me up, please help me I'm drowning
Haul me up, to where I can breathe
Haul me up, where the air is sweeter
Stretch out a hand, a hand brother please

Now here comes Jezebel, sweet as the morning
Holds out a cup and I'm tempted to drink
Six thousand voices ringing in the rafters
How can I dream when I can't even think

Haul me up, now the banshees are wailing
Haul me up, now the sirens are singing
Haul me up, now the furies are screaming
Stretch out a hand, a hand brother please

Haul me up, please help me I'm drowning
Haul me up, to where I can breathe
Haul me up, where the air is sweeter
Stretch out a hand, a hand brother please

Now I'm fighting but oh, the disease has got me
Now what is this sickness that has no name?
Who are these friends that kill me with kindness
I don't know the rules but I'm trapped in the game

Haul me up, well I'm lost in confusion
Haul me up, I'm up to my knees
Haul me up, I'm back in the quicksand
Stretch out a hand, a hand brother please

Haul me up, now the banshees are wailing
Haul me up, now the sirens are singing
Haul me up, now the furies are screaming
Stretch out a hand, a hand brother please

Haul me up
Haul me up
Haul me up
Haul me up
