They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
But I doubt it, I really doubt it
Playing ping pong over oceans, messing with emotions
Messing with my head
Messing with my head

13 hours ago, I'm no longer at home
Fast times in Tahoe
Three thousand miles away
What can I say
Fast times fast times to fast for me

And I don't care what you say
To get me out of the way
I got to get my message through to you

Baby,baby,baby,baby,baby,baby,baby

Playing in the Snow
Who oh oh oh
Times in Tahoe
Playing in the Snow
Who oh oh oh

They say, makes the, grow , but I, I really , playing, over
Messing with
Messing with

Fast times in Tahoe
Playing in the Snow
Who oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh
