Please don't stop me from drinking
It's my only joy
Please don't stop me from smoking
This is my reward

For all the things I have spoken
And all the times I fell
For one taste of the good life
I would kill

When this storm passes
When the clouds starts to break
I will stand in the sunshine
Awaiting my fate

I hope it comes quickly
I hope I feel no pain
Just hold me in those arms again
Please don't stop me from drinking

Oh, It's my only joy
Please don't stop me from smoking
This is my reward
At the Tower of London

I swear I heard you cry
"For one taste of a good man, I would die"
