One thousand people say
It has to be this way
We never taste our food
Our research goes unproved
Only geodesic domes can save us now

The circles that we draw
Reflect the dreams we saw
Far away from town
The trees grow upside down
It's so easy to live in a vision

Time is breaking down everything in the ground
We live vertical lives
Who wants to be flat in this habitat
We live vertical lives

The last building I saw
Was a thousand stories tall
Everyone I knew
Walked through the lawn, and they were gone
Sometimes I can see them through my window

We finally have it right
No longer 'fraid of heights
We hope you come around
We'll show you what we found
Only geodesic domes can save us now
