Anne Boleyn she kept her tin
Which all her hopes and dreams were in
She plans to run away with him forever
(Never to be seen again)

Leaves a note and starts to choke
Can feel the lump that's in her throat
It's raining and she leaves her coat in silence

We're sorry but we disagree
The boy is vermin, can't you see?
We'll drown his sins in misery
And rip him out of history

People marching to the drums
Everybody's having fun to the sound of love
Ugly is the world we're on
If I'm right then prove me wrong
I'm stunned to find a place we belong

Who is your lover? I couldn't tell
When hell freezes over, that's when I'll tell
Who is your lover? I couldn't tell
When will this stop?!

Racing, pacing in the dark
She's searching for a lonely heart
She finds him but his heart has stopped
She breaks down

We're sorry but your majesty
Refusing orders from the queen
Results in a monstrosity
(Remembers a voice and hears him sing)

People marching to the drums
Everybody's having fun to the sound of love
Ugly is the world we're on
If I'm right then prove me wrong
I'm stunned to find a place we belong

Who is your lover? I couldn't tell
When hell freezes over, that's when I'll tell
Who is your lover? I couldn't tell
When will this stop?!

Who is your lover? I couldn't tell
When hell freezes over, that's when I'll tell
Who is your lover? I couldn't tell
When hell freezes over, that's when I'll tell

Who is your lover? I couldn't tell
When hell freezes over, that's when I'll tell
Who is your lover? I couldn't tell
When hell freezes over, that's when I'll tell
