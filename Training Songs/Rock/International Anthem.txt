Listen to this
I'm transcending English
Something's bigger
Than the national hymn
If you're thick,too thin
Green,blue or pinkish
Hum together with a cellophane skin
A holy karaoke
Prayer in stereo
Here it comes
Here's to You
To the kings and queens
And all the President's men
It doesn't matter if you're strong
King Kong
Lose the things between yourself and Heaven
And then, when you're ready,
you can hum along
Our holy karaoke
Prayer in stereo
From down to here below
In gratitude
From Coco to Moscow
We hope You're pleased
With these rhyme schemes
And musical score
Like never before
