I'll walk with god 
From this day on
His helping hand I'll lean upon
This is my prayer my humble plea
May the lord be ever with me

There is no death though eyes grow dim
There is no fear when I'm near to him
I'll lean on him forever 
And he'll forsake me never

He will not fail me as long as my faith is strong
What ever road I may walk alone

I'll walk with god 
I'll take his hand
I'll talk with god he'll understand
I'll pray to him
Each day to him

And he'll hear the words that I say
His hand will guide my throne and rod
And I'll never walk alone
While I walk with god
