Whose garden was this?
It must have been lovely.
Did it have flowers?
I've seen pictures of flowers,
And I'd love to have smelled one !

Whose river was this?
You say it ran freely?
Blue was its color?
I've seen blue in some pictures
And I'd love to have been there!

Ah, tell me again I need to know
The forest had trees
The meadows were green
The oceans were blue
And birds really flew
Can you swear that was true

Whose gray sky was this?
Or was it a blue one?
Nights there were breezes?
I've heard records of breezes,
And you tell me you felt one.

Ah, tell me again I need to know
The forest had trees
The meadows were green
The oceans were blue
And birds really flew
Can you swear that was true
