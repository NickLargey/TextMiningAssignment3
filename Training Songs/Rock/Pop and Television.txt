You're itching from the fever
You get from your receiver
Forever gonna be there
Always tuning in the news
On your radio hoping for
A brainstorm bullet
Write a letter to a talk show
Hosted by a one eyed ghost
Don't deny imagination

In a hopeless situation
Hide in your own pocket
Ride your silver rocket
Sing a simple song
Nothing can go wrong
Pop & Television turns you on
Electric meditation strong enough
To be my little doll
Pop & Television sings your song
And never tells you
You are wrong

And that's what really turns you on
Acting really brave
'cause you know you got it made
Another pop slave always
Looking for a dream on your life screen
A little something in between
You're throwing out yourself on the net
Rocking with a three legged mermaid
Sadness can be education

Madness perfect explanation
Hide in your own pocket
Ride your silver rocket
Sing a simple song
Nothing can go wrong
Pop & Television turns you on
Electric meditation strong enough
To be my little doll
Pop & Television sings your song

And never tells you
You are wrong
And that's what really turns you on
Buy your pleasure friend
Play it 'til the end
Then you start again
Without the lonely desperation
A brand new guaranteed relation
You'll be a famous star
A perfect what you are

Funny situation
Enjoy your reputation, now
Pop & Television turns you on
Electric meditation strong enough
To be my little doll
Pop &Television sings your song
And never tells you
You are wrong
And that's what really turns you on
