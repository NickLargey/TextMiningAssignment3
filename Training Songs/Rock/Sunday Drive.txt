Honey, want to see
What you, what you can be
You, you make it easy
For me to want to know you

I can't pretend to hate you
‘Cause I will always love you
And when you try to leave me
I wanna say:

Please don't go
I need your love
Waiting for the rain to behave
So you come around
Take me on a Sunday drive
Take me on a Sunday drive 

Wait, to the end
Who will you defend?
See what I can do
With this life
That was made for two

I can't pretend to hate you
‘Cause I will always love you
And when you try to leave me
I wanna say:

Please don't go
I need your love
Waiting for the rain to behave
So you come around
Take me on a Sunday drive 
Take me on a Sunday drive 

I can't pretend to hate you
‘Cause I will always love you
And when you try to leave me
I wanna say:

Please don't go
I need your love
Waiting for the rain to behave
So you come around
Take me on a Sunday drive 
Take me on a Sunday drive
