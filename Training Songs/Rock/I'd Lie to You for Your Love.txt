I watched you walk into the room
I want to say this just right
If you ain't waiting for somebody special
Would you be with me tonight

I'm a doctor I'm a lawyer 
I'm a movie star I'm an astronaut
And I own this bar
And I would lie to you for your love

Yes I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love
And that's the truth
I could tell you what you want to hear

And some secrets about myself
I could tell you you're the only one
And there could never be nobody else
I'm a doctor I'm a lawyer 

I'm a movie star I'm an astronaut
And I own this bar
And I would lie to you for your love
Yes I'd lie to you for your love

I'd lie to you for your love
And that's the truth
I'm a doctor I'm a lawyer 
I'm a movie star I'm an astronaut

And I own this bar
And I would lie to you for your love
Yes I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love

And that's the truth
And I would lie to you for your love
Yes I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love
And that's the truth
