Making an appearance at a club tonight
Playing some songs that I think are alright
I´m not post-modern just a man who can bark
and bite with teeth that leave a mark
In the winter your eyes are grey
But in the spring they sparkle away
I´m on a mission to make some amends
For whilst I´m gone this might all end

Oh it´s like I´m part of the jetset
Respectively, I haven´t been that reckless....yet

Drift through the air like a paper plane
Rainbow colours pulsate through the brain
I´m aware that I´m speaking but the words come out wrong
So I´ll put it across in a simple song

Oh it´s like I´m part of the jetset
Respectively, I haven´t been that reckless

Never have I been part of any scene
Just remember this: it´s just you and me
When you´re alone it´s true
I break my bones for you
My soul is constantly beaten black and blue
Never have I been part of any scene
Just remember this: it´s just you and me....

Oooooh  Jetsetter
Oooooh  Jetsetter
Oooooh  Jetsetter
Oooooh  Jetsetter   etc...
