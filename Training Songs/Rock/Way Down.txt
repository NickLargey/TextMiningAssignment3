Somebody tell me
Where did I go wrong
Oh, what a fool am I
Sometimes
You can feel you don't belong
want to die

Way down
I've been all the way
And I know the reason why
Way down
Is the price I paid
Oh, but now I realize

Somebody tell me 
that you understand
Oh, that I'm not alone
Sometimes
When you need a helpin' hand
Oh, I know

Way down
I've been all the way
And I know the reason why
Way down
Is the price I paid
Oh, but now I see a light
Way down

Way down
I've been all the way
And I know the reason why
Way down
Is the price I paid
Oh, but now I realize

Way down
I've been all the way
And I know the reason why
Way down
Is the price I paid
I don't want to go no more
Way down
