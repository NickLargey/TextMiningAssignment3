Blackberry Way
Absolutely Pouring Down With Rain
It's A Terrible Day
Up With The Lark
Silly Girl I Don't Know What To Say
She Was Running Away

So Now I'm Standing On The Corner
Lost In The Things That I Said
What Am I Supposed To Do Now

Goodbye Blackberry Way
I Can't See You
I Don't Need You
Goodbye Blackberry Way
Sure To Want Me Back Another Day

Down To The Park
Overgrowing But The Trees Are Bare
There's A Memory There
Boats On The Lake
Unattended Now The Laughter Drowned
I'm Incredibly Down
Just Like Myself They Are Neglected
Turn With My Eyes To The Wall
What Am I Supposed To Do Now

Goodbye Blackberry Way
I Can't See You
I Don't Need You
Goodbye Blackberry Way
Sure To Want Me Back Another Day

Run for the train
Look behind you 'cause she might be there
'Cept I think it's the air
Blackberry Way
See the battlefield of careless sins
Cast to the wind:
So Full Of Emptiness Without Her
Lost In The Words That I Said
What Am I Supposed To Do Now
