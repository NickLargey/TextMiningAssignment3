It’s 9 o’clock on the dot At the spot
And I’m hanging’ with her friends again
Great taste, Beautiful place
And you’re fashionably late (hey)
And I don’t wanna be that guy,
That makes you sad, makes you cry, again
Without a doubt sorry about,
Making out with your friends (go)

I love the way that this began
Started off right, so innocent
I’m letting you know
I’m letting you go
I want your best friend
I’m giving’ it up and asking why
You seem so shocked and so surprised
I’m sorry it hurts, I’m surely a jerk
I understand why you’re mad

Don’t talk that crap when you call me back
As a matter of fact, don’t act like that
Everybody knows you’re right
Everybody knows I’m wrong (wrong)

It’s got nothing to do with how you look
Just another excuse to write a hook
I’m letting you know
She liked my post up on my Facebook
And after all you’re not my type
But all your friends are pretty nice
You know what I mean, stop making a scene,
And take some want of advice

Don’t talk that crap when you call me back,
As a matter of fact, don’t act like that
Everybody knows you’re right,
Everybody knows I’m wrong (right?)

And I know I’m running out of time (yeah)
It’s on an honest demonstration now
You’re not the only one, not the only one

Everybody sing along (ah)

Fucking all your friends (what?)
