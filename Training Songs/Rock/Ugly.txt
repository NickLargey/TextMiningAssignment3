Darlings of this primitive age
Count your blessings, you know you're gonna need 'em
All that's been done gets undone today

I feel your rage and the pain I have too yeah
We're in dire fuckin' straits
You know we need luck now
You know we need luck now more than ever

[Chorus]
All I see is ugly, All I hear is ugly
I play these chords, I sing these words
They chain my cage, Till I'm swelled to burst
All I feel is ugly, Oh yea

Piece together one more reward
Shine your courage, bury all those evils
All that's been killed in you can come alive again

Your fist full of faith, 'round your cane of your hope yeah
Your boots limp away from disgraceland
You know we need luck now
You know we need luck now more than ever

[Chorus]

Black and white TV, drown full color dreams
Bleak and bleached, the filth is preached
Color coded candy, my spine's a hollow tree
Branches wound, and cut I bleed

[Chorus]
