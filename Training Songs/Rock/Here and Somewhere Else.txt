There's a warmth in your eyes, so far away.
There's a place in my mind for you today.
If you follow me down to the shore tonight
I'll show you a town, this town was right.

There's a place in my mind, like a bridge for shoes,
I can cross anytime just to be with you;
And it feels like I only got here yesterday;
And it feels like I'll never see the sun again.

There's a road up ahead that I think I'll take.
It's a light by some dread; it's the road he made.
If I follow you down this way again,
Believe in that sound, it's awakened them.
And it feels like we all just got here yesterday,
In between here and somewhere else.

Rain on the world down there, I can only smile.
Rain anywhere just not here, just not here.
There's a warmth in your eyes, so far away.
There's a place in my mind for you today.
