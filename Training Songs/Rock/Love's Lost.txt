Love's lost and rolling, rolling down the street
Eight miles and rising, rise above defeat
Aim high and feel low, low will make you grow

Love's lost and rolling, tumbling lone and free
Someday when I'm hiding, love will then find me
Set sail in ruins, the things you'll find and see
Will make for better days for you & me

That's how I got to be bigger
That's how I got to be braver
That's how I got to be bolder

(Skip one round)

Eight miles and rising, well I'm coming home at last

Set sail in ruins, the things you'll find and see
Will make for better days for you and me
(Love like there's no tomorrow, dream like there's no today,
Live life the only way you feel is the right way)

That's how I got to be bigger
That's how I got to be braver
That's how I got to be bolder
That's how I got to be (alone and free)
