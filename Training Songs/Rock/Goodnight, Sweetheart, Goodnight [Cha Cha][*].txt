Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
I hate to leave you, but I really must say
Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight

Well it's three o'clock in the mornin'
Baby, I just can't do right
Well, I hate to leave you, baby
I don't mean maybe
Because I love you so

Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
I hate to leave you, but I really must say
Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight

Mother, and, oh, your father
Won't like it if we stay out too late
Well, I hate to leave you, baby
Don't mean maybe
You know I hate to go

Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
I hate to leave you, but I really must say
Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight
