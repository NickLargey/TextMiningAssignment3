Barbedwired Baby's Dream
I am runnin' round in circles
Misery was here
Acted so sincere
Now I'm runnin' round in circles with a friend
I can't find you
Where are you barbedwired baby?
Are you hidin'?
Please tell me what's inside the screen
Is it a barbedwired baby's dream?
Sittin' all the time
Tryin' to make it rhyme
But I'm stoned for a moment
Diggin' in the moon
With a silver spoon
Yes I'm stoned for a moment
With a friend
I can't find you
Where are you barbedwired baby?
Are you hidin'?
Please tell me what's inside the screen
Is it a barbedwired baby's dream?
I can't find you
Where are you barbedwired baby?
Are you hidin'?
But the objection's overruled
Why do I always play the fool?
Please tell me what's inside the screen
Is it a barbedwired baby's dream?
