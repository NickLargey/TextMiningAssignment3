Come, take a breath
Make this moment last
Be here right now
This is the place and time

Forget the world
And leave it all behind
It doesn´t take a word
And all i need to know is here

There´s comfort in the silence
When you´re near
Give me shelter
When the day comes

Crashing down on me
I´ll tide you over I will give you
Everything (you need)
Let´s take a breath

It might be our last one
Make this moment last
Make it the best one
We´ll find ourselves

Finding something new
Feels good to share
A room with a view
It doesn´t take a word

And all i need to know is here
There´s comfort in the silence
When you´re near
Give me shelter

When the day comes
Crashing down on me
I´ll tide you over I will give you
Everything (you need)

Give me shelter
When the day comes
Crashing down on me
I´ll tide you over I will give you

Everything 4*
Come, take a breath
Make this moment last

When the day comes
Crashing down on me
I´ll tide you over I will give you

Give me shelter
When the day comes
Crashing down on me
I´ll tide you over I will give you
