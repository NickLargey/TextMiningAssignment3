Sometimes tonight I'm late
Knock on your door
Something keeps telling me
There's got to be more
It's time for a new beginning
Before it's too late
I'm changing the life I'm living
You know I can't wait

I know there is another way
Somewhere inside
Deep in my heart I know
I've got nothing to hide
Looking for new horizons
Ready for change
I make my own decisions
Set up this change

Can you hear the call?
You're not aware where it's coming from
If you want it all you're gotta do it right
Can you hear the call?
Doesn't matter where it's coming from
You can have it all make a move tonight

Sometimes tonight I wait
Outside your door
Someone keeps telling me
There has to be more
It's time for a new beginning
Before it's too late
I'm changing the life I'm living
You know I can't wait

When you hear the call?
No matter where it's coming from
If you want it all you're gotta do it right
Can you hear the call?
Doesn't matter where it's coming from
You can have it all make a move tonight

Make a move tonight

When you hear the call
No matter where it's coming from
If you want it all you're gotta do it right
Can you hear the call?
It doesn't matter where it's coming from
You can have it all to make a move tonight
When you hear the call
No matter where it's coming from
If you want it all you're gotta do it right
