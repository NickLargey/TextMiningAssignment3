I don't need a seance
I don't read grey lines
I signed it away, way long
I hate, slow songs

Oh yeah, I don't even care
Oh yeah, I go over there

My hair is, real long
No brains, all groin
No shoes, just thongs
I hate, slow songs

Oh yeah, you cry like I care
Oh yeah, buck naked and there

Hooray for, hooray for you (6x)
