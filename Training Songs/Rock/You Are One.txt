Laying in bed barely awake.
You feel content, you feel strong.
Nothing can hurt you because you are happy.
You are one.
You dream of a place you are there where problems are none.
Happiness abounds. Nothing can hurt you because you are happy.
You are one.
You awaken you come back.
Feelings of remorse its only a dream pressure returns.
They aren't as strong.
You are one.
Each day is tough, life is tough.
Feelings of hatred, you can't handle.
Something is lacking, your day ends.
You are one.
You lay awake you realize life's a game that can't be won.
So you do your best, that's enough.
You are one.
