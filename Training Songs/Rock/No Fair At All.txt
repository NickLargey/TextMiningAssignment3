I've never seen this side of you before
Till now
I never knew that you could feel this way
Till now

After all the time we spent together
Just doesn't seem fair
At all
No fair at all

Never seen the moonlight through your hair
Till now
Never heard the sweet things you could say
Till now

After all the time we spent together
Just doesn't seem fair
At all
No fair at all
