Ain't nobody out there, just me and you 
It's one on one, just we two 
I got somethin' like a heartbeat 
Only you control 
And I'm up as far as I can bear to go
This is the road so welcome home 
Where nothing real abounds 
There is no reason we must wait 
Let's take these pleasures now
Now...
Ain't nobody out there gonna disagree 
We're all hiding something under lock 'n' key 
You don't like it but you just can't stop 
(But) keep your screws on tight 
We'll undo all that's been done to you tonight
This is the place it all begins 
There's no time to back down 
There is no reason to pretend 
Just take these pleasures now
Now...
