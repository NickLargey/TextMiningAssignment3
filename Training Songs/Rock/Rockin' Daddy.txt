1) Well I'm a-going get me some rockin' shoes 
And then I'm going to rock away all my blues 
I'm a rockin' daddy, yeah a rockin' daddy 
I'm a rockin' daddy from Ding Dong Tennessee 

2) Well I told little mama if she'd be good 
We'd stay up and rock all night 
We're rockin' daddy, yeah rockin' daddy 
I'm a rockin' daddy with my brand new rockin' shoes 

3) Well I told little mama she could hold me tight 
We'd stay up and rock all night 
I'm a rockin' daddy, yeah a rockin' daddy 
I'm a rockin' daddy from Ding Dong Tennessee
