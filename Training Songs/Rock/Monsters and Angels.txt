I'm nobody's wife and I'm nobody's baby, 
I like it that way but then again, maybe. 

I'm nobody's valentine & I'm nobody's pearl 
When you get right down to it I always seem to always find just 
Some girl singin' 

There are monsters, there are angels. 
There's a peacefulness and a rage inside us all. 
There's sugar & there is salt 
There's ice and there is fire. 
In every single heart, there are monsters, there are angels. 

I'm nobody's promise and I'm nobody's chore 
And I ain't got nobody that I feel I gotta 
Live for - nobody to live for. 
I'm nobody's work & I'm nobodys' company 
And every time I turn around I always seem to find 
Just me singin' 

There are monsters, there are angels.
There's a peacefulness and a rage inside us all.
There's sugar, and there's salt.
There's ice and there's fire
In every single heart there are monsters there are angels.

I'm nobodys' wife, I'm nobodys' baby, 
I like it that way, but then again, maybe.
Then again maybe.

I'm nobody's valentine and I'm nobody's pearl.
When you get right down to it I always seem to find just
Some girl.

Singin' there are monsters, there are angels.
There's a peacefulness and a rage inside us all.
There's sugar, and there's salt.
There's ice and there's fire.
In every single heart there are monsters there are angels.

Singin' there are monsters, there are angels. 
Singin' there are monsters, there are angels. 
I'm nobody's wife, and I'm nobody's baby.
