I just kissed the one I love for the last time
And never has her soft lips felt so sweet
She's gone away and won't be back forever
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
Just before she said goodbye she called me darling yes she did
Then slowly ran her fingers down my cheek
And I thought I'd die when she said she still love me
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep not because I'm sad because I'm weak
I can't stand the thought of life alone without her
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
