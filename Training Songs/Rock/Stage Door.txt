A long way we have traveled
Just to see your name in lights
We're writing you this letter
Because we're with you tonight

Your mama she misses you so
And your papa wants you to know
That babe, we want you to have your say
We don't want to stand in your way

The last time that we saw you
And we heard those curtain calls
We held hands and we loved you
And we shouted for more

Your mama she misses you so
And your papa wants you to know
That babe, we want you to have your say
We don't want to stand in your way

But call us and say
When you're passing this way
And let us still know that you care

Clean sheets on the bed in your room
And a place
At the table and in our hearts

Every night is a first night for someone
Someone's makin' their debut
On starry eyes
The curtain will rise

Your mama she misses you so
And your papa wants you to know
That babe, we want you to have your say
We don't want to stand in your way

But call us and say
When you're passing this way
And let us still know that you care

Clean sheets on the bed in your room
And a place
At the table and in our hearts

Such a long way we have traveled
Just to see your name in lights
We're writing you this letter
Because we're with you tonight

Your mama she misses you so
And your papa wants you to know
That baby, we want you to have your say
We don't want to stand in your way

Every night is a first night for someone
Someone's makin' their debut
On starry eyes
The curtain will rise

Every night is a first night for someone
Someone's bringing the house down
We want you to know
They're stealing the show

'Cause baby
We don't want to stand in your way
