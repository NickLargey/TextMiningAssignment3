Crackin' walls inside my head
With a bottle full of rain
I promised to the coaster
I wouldn't tear it up again

Flick a peanut, break a glass
I wish I didn't sleep at Mass
And everything is closin' up
And yet again I come in last

I saw it in a dream
It was another time
And everything was blue
Everything was fine

And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
You were always mine

Rise above it, rise above it, rise above it

I see her on the ceiling
She's staring down in her gown
I had to make allowances
Between my love and goin' out

Now everything is closing up
The last call is well asleep
At gigs I danced with a Blue Nun
Now heartburn is goin' cheap

I saw it in a dream
It was another time
Everything was true
Everything sublime

And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
You were always mine

I saw it in a dream
It was another time
Everything was true
Everything sublime

And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
You were always mine

Rise above, rise above it
I wouldn't tear it up again
