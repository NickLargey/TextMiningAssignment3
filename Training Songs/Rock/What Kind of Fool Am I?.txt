I wonder who she's seein' tonight
Is she really goin' out with him, he's not her type
And doin' all the things she used to do to me
Well, I'd say something to her, but I get so jealous
When I think of her lovin' somebody else
And I can't think why we ever let go
I must have been crazy
Tell me what kind of fool am I to just let go
To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I, to lose you
She was cold sometimes, but she made me feel alive
She was such a spoiled baby, but baby, she could love
And she loved me like nobody ever will again
I thought we'd be together when the world went down
When the curtain fell and the lights came up
But the gods or whatever make the world go around
Shuffled when they should have cut
(Chorus)
Did it come too easy to the two of us
Did we go too wrong to ever make it right
Were we too busy checkin' out the left hand
That we didn't see the right
And tell me what kind of fool am I to just let go
To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I, oh baby please
Oh baby, please come back
I meant to say in time, baby we could work it out, but
I never meant to say goodbye
Tell me what kind of fool am I
What kind of fool am I
What kind of fool am I...to lose you
