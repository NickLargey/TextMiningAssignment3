Do you remember how you wore that dress?
It slipped my sight beneath the eye glint
Do you remember what you said to me?
What course has given you the right, to stray?
And in your living tune unstuck my teeth
The clocks are ticking fast with every breath

Since we've been wrong
I've been poured away
Since we've been wrong
You will never ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure all the way
But my heart it has just one more time
And Luseal remains

One day a rain will come to wash away
The earth that held us was no island
I have become ingrown inside this skin
I found a way out through those eyelids
When all the days become a castaway
I seem to think I don't belong here

Since we've been wrong
I've been poured away
Since we've been wrong
You will never ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure all the way
But my heart it has just one more time
And Luseal remains

I dont belong here
I shouldn't stay
The flowers inside me grow as empty
The walls between us will never break
Just sealed shut it grows empty

Since we've been wrong
I've been poured away
Since we've been wrong
You will never ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure all the way
But my heart it has just one more time
And Luseal remains
