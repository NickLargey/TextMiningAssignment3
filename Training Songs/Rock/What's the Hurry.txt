What's the worry, what's the hurry,
Do you hear me, do you fear me?
You've got the message, you read the story,
You want the power, you need the glory.

Clocks break, time goes by,
Hot sake along the fly,
She laughs on a spin,
He laughs, turns you in.

What's the panic, where's the static,
Do you see me, could you meet me?
I heard the rumor, you've got my number,
But now I see you run for cover.

So you thought you had it made,
Ain't it easy to be afraid,
Feel the pressure, take the bait,
Here it comes again.

Clock breaks, time goes by,
Hot sake along the fly,
She laughs on a spin,
He laughs, turns you in.
