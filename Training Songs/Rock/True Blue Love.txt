Oo, oo.
Had enough of my yesterdays, can't go back to mistakes that I made,
had enough of my downside, the hard life we've been through.
Now I know I've got so much to prove.
Don't let go, I've been a heart selfish fool.
It's a feelin' I'm rising above and I'll give you love true love,
true blue love, give you true blue love.
 
And I know into one heart that's shattered 
tenderness is the only thing that matters.
Don't turn away from true blue love.
 
Runnin' hard in an empty race,
Just take a look at the lines on this face.
In my eyes you can measure the miles,
But no one can measure desire.
 
So take my hand; can you feel how it burns?
Don't let go until your heart fin'lly learns
Why this wanderin' soul has returned to give you love true love,
true blue love, give you true blue love.
 
And I know into one heart that's shattered 
tenderness is the only thing that matters.
Don't turn away from true blue love.
 
And I know into one soul that's healing, 
loneliness is the only thing you're feeling.
Don't turn away from true love.  Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo.
Oh, I'll give you love true blue love, give you true blue love.
 
And I know into one heart that's shattered 
tenderness is the only thing that matters.
Don't turn away from true blue love.
Runnin' hard in an empty race,
Just take a look at the lines on this face.
In my eyes you can measure the miles,
But no one can measure desire.
 
So take my hand; can you feel how it burns?
Don't let go until your heart fin'lly learns
Why this wanderin' soul has returned to give you love true love,
true blue love, give you true blue love.
 
And I know into one heart that's shattered 
tenderness is the only thing that matters.
Don't turn away from true blue love.
 
And I know into one soul that's healing,
loneliness is the only thing you're feeling.
Don't turn away, away from true blue love.  Oo,
Into one heart that's shattered 
tenderness is the only thing that matters.
Don't turn away from true blue love.
Into one heart that's shattered 
tenderness is the only thing that matters.
Don't turn away from true blue love.
Into one heart that's shattered 
tenderness is the only thing that matters.
Don't turn away from true blue love.
