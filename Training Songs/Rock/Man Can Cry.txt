A man, can, cry
A love can surely die
They’re not fear to stay
The sunshine and the rain
But let me, oh let me, tell you baby
I’m still in love with you

Blue skies above
The towering mountain high
Is the rule my love, all this love have I
But let me, oh oh let me, tell you baby
I’m still in love with you

The rules of a game, we both know
I know that you love me, love me so
But someday little darling, I know you don’t no want me
I know you, know you want me, want me so

A man can cry
A love can surely die
They’re not fear to stay
The sunshine and the rain
But let me, oh let me, tell you baby
I’m still in love with you
