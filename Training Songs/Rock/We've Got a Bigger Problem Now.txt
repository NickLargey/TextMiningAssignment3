I am Emperor Ronald Regan
Born again with fascist cravings
Still, you make me president

Human rights will soon go 'way
I am now your Shah today 
Now I command all of you
Now your gonna pray in school
I'll make sure they're christian too

[Chorus]
California Uber Alles 
Uber Alles California

Ku Klux Klan will control you
Still you think it's natural
N*gger knockin for the master race
Still you wear a happy face

[Chorus]

Welcome to 1984 
Are you ready for the Third World War?!?
You too will meet the secret police 
They'll draft you and they'll jail your niece

You'll go quietly to boot camp
They'll shoot you dead, make you a man
Don't worry, it's for a cause
Feeding global corporations' claws

Die on a brand new poison gas
El Salvador or Afghanistan
Making money for President Regan
And all the friends of President Regan

[Chorus]
