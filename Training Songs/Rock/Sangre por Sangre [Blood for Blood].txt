Sangre por sangre, blood for blood

Betraying a trust is a must in your mind
The agenda's just business as usual
Remember the imbecile the fire's they light
Cities smolder with the innocent victims
Democracy is hypocrisy, dictatorship is what we need
Because really what's the fucking difference?
So come on in and take a seat, and listen to the lies they love to preach
Because the truth would just be fucking senseless

Eye for an eye and blood for blood you better get your gun (blood for blood!)
For every action reaction, and death is business
Eye for an eye and blood for blood you better grab your gun (blood for blood!)
Can't take it back, what's done is done I want blood for blood

Ashes to ashes and dust to the death of what we were to what we've become
I'll put my faith into our heroes that fight for our lives, until the war is won
Dishonesty is given to me, anxiety is my disease
But, the privileged they've got it made.
So raise a glass to the one percent that have it all
Keep me in the shit and send me in the screaming fits of fucking rage!

Eye for an eye and blood for blood you better get your gun (blood for blood!)
For every action reaction, and death is business
Eye for an eye and blood for blood you better grab your gun (blood for blood!)
Can't take it back, what's done is done I want blood for blood

Quarter oppressors, it's too late for surrender
Time to pay your penance all together, forever
This spinning web of deception, lies begin to constrict
The walls of fate have a gate that's sealed around you
Brick by brick

Eye for an eye and blood for blood you better get your gun (blood for blood!)
For every action reaction, and death is business
Eye for an eye and blood for blood you better grab your gun (blood for blood!)
Can't take it back, what's done is done I want blood for blood

Sangre por sangre!
Blood for blood!
Sangre por sangre!
Blood for blood!
