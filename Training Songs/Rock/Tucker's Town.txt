Staring back at you, did you see my lips 
or were you smiling right in front of me?
Your father called my name,
then he smiled with great relief 
'cause it wasn't me you were clinging to.
He made you turn around, you do that thing you do 
and then you laughed with me.
 
I don't know (I don't know.)
what I can't see. (I can't see.)
I don't know but I'm makin' time to call.
I don't know (I don't know.)
what I can't see. (I can't see.)
I don't know, but she's watching me leave.
 
Just wish they'd turn around, just wish they'd try to see,
but they don't understand and that's alright with me,
I'm leaving now.
Going down to Tucker's Town where I can lie for free,
nobody stares at me and I'd live to hurt the population.
She called last night; I said I'm about to leave.
Then I heard him scream, "I'll pack your bags."
 
'Cause I don't know (I don't know.)
what I can't see. (I can't see.)
I don't know but I'm makin' time to call.
I don't know (I don't know.)
what I can't see. (I can't see.)
I don't know, but I'm leaving here 
to see the world through your rosy glasses.
I'll teach her to fly, but they teach greed.
We live the belt, but I can bleed.
 
I don't know what I can't see.
I don't know what I can't see.
I don't know (I don't know.)
what I can't see. (I can't see.)
I don't know.  I don't know.
I don't know (I don't know.)
what I can't see. (I can't see.)
I don't know.  I don't know.
