Come on confess with confusion... spread it around
They trickle down your cheek...tears fall like seed on barren ground
Your thoughts are scattered like paper everywhere
Tiny piece of laughter and despair

But you cry true tears of joy

Passion is your weakness but you feed it everyday
Like a moth to the naked flame... you just can't keep away
You twist the truth and you turn the other cheek
But everybody knows it's just salvation that you seek

And you cry true tears of joy
Yeh you cry true tears of joy... oh yeah, alright

It flickers on your face
I can see it in your eyes
I knew for you a moment
So don't be so surprised

It's only pleasure that you can't resist
But say one word of truth and I'll see you cry
True tears of joy

Yeah you cry true tears of joy
[repeat]
