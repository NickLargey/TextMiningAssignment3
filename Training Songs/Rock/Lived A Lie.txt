Well somebody told me
That I would be a dreamer for life
Somebody told me I would never reach the other side
Well you say I'm old news
But cross your fingers, Iâ€™m yours to lose
What if I told you things will never improve?

And if I lived a lie
Will someone meet me on the other side
So I can burn up bright?
So I can burn, so I can burn

The grass is always greener
Someone else's past is always cleaner
But I'm a believer that there's a fool in all of us

And if I lived a lie
Will someone meet me on the other side
So I can burn up bright?

Oh, I don't really know where our ghosts go
No, I don't really know where our ghosts go
So live a lie just tonight, tonight

We are believers, we are believers
We are believers, we are believers 
We are believers, we are believers 
We are believers, we are believers 
We are believers, we are believers 
We are believers, we are believers 
We are believers, we are believers 
We are, we are

If I lived a lie
Will someone meet me on the other side
So that I can burn up bright?

And if I lived a lie
Will someone meet me on the other side
So I can burn up bright?

Oh, I don't really know where our ghosts go
No, I don't really know where our ghosts go
So live a lie just tonight
And burn up bright
