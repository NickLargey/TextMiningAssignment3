I've made it, my dear face it, 
I still kiss the darkness
What I've wasted, I still taste it, 
I'm sickened and hardened
I'm gonna tear, I'm gonna tear your walls down
I'm gonna tear, I'm gonna tear your walls down

I stole into your hideout

I walked with you, I talked with you, 
I still can't help thinking
Your drugs bleeding, so sweet yet fleeting, 
my memories are sinking.
I'm gonna tear, I'm gonna tear your walls down
I'm gonna tear, I'm gonna tear your walls down

I stole into your hideout
And It's cold there now,

And everything outside the truth, 
there's nothing more to cut it loose,
I've left the path, the road just disappeared.

Gray shadows and white meadows, 
a bitter snow is falling
My legs fail me, the ground hails me, 
distant lights are calling

Into your hideout, into your hideout dear, tearing my heart out now

And you say,
And i say, 
I stole into your hideout
