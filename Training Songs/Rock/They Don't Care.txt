They don't really care for you.
They don't wanna know what you're going through.
They will never do anything for you.
They won't move an inch they don't have to.

I'll try anything I can do.
I will walk as far as I have to.
Walk around the world if I have to prove 
This world isn't here for me and you!

I'll do anything I can
Storm across their patriotic land
Scraping flag decalls off of custom vans
Yellow ribbons round the garbage cans.

You'll find anything you want if you look for it long enough.
Anything you need you'll have, but you will look long.
