Rare birds, we are out in space
And at the moment we're weightless
This feeling will last as long as we like

Charming the views as we orbit the earth
And it is constantly changing
It's living with pain
It's telling us this

We will take off
From the belts of radiation
And at the moment of impact
We feel a powerful
Shockwave from the sun

Colliding we see
Results of beta decay
Still the earth's not withstanding
Demand is growing
We're breaking her back

Falsetto folkies with pitchfork at your side
Your tunes they will be forgotten
Way out in the desert boy there's nowhere to hide
From your face in the sun's daily mirror
Black pirate paradox
Silver and gold
Floating just over your head

Weeping, once upon an angel we cried
But the whole tone was changing
Our friends, they did not follow us here
Yeah we were rare birds
We made magic on some fallen star
And we were perfectly timeless, working
Loving and losing our fear

Well it's a hand me down riddle
With god on it's side
His tone and his trumpet forgotten
Way out in the desert boy
There's nowhere to hide
See your face in the suns daily mirror
Pelican cases on Jesusâ€™s flight
With no room in the overheads
La la la
