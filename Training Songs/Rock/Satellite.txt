Thirty more channels than you need
I could tune in free
Some rabbit ears, some foil, and a hanger

Static on channel 13 cleared, long enough for a scene.
A jet flew over head, and it faded.

Couldn't find you any place upon my screen...
Bought a satellite, bought a satellite, bought a satellite
...Satellite

Dug up from the depths of old man sewers southern flow.
A boy I couldn't name, I knew well.
And still I render, useless to my call,
You're nowhere to be found on the airwaves

Couldn't find you any place upon my screen
Bought a satellite, bought a satellite, bought a satellite
...Satellite

So far from my reach
Close enough to see
I sleep beside the set at night and I can't let you leave

Couldn't find you any place upon my screen
Need to (spy???) and I'm coming for your love over there
Nothing along the ?????
Nothing I want to see but your face

Couldn't find you any place upon my screen
Bought a satellite (repeat)
