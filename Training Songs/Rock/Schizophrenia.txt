Yes I can,no I can't,
yes I can, no I can't, 
yes I can, no I can't, 
yes I can
I swear to it,
that's just how my brain works.

Yes it is, no it isn't, 
yes it is, not it isn't, 
yes it is, no it isn't, 
yes it is
I know that,
I know it sounds absurd but

We first met in the summer of my twenty-second year,
I got scared and they appeared out of thin air.

Here they come, here they come,
here they come, here they come, 
here they come, here they come,
they're after me.
I don't know anything.

They got guns, they got knives,
they got guns, they got knives,
they got guns, they got knives and spies,
I am no informant.

We first met in the summer of my twenty-second year,
I got scared and they appeared out of thin air

They knew my name,
they screamed and screamed,
they knew everything.

You could say that I'm well liked
but I'll never be friendles

You could say that I'm alright
or you could say schizophrenic
