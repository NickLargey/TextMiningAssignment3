Start wearing purple, for me now
All your sanity and wits, they will all vanish
I promise, it's just a matter of time

But thought that some years from now
A purple little little lady will be perfect
For dirty old and useless clown

From Lozgechkin to Paspartu

Schto muzika poshla ot Zvukov Mu!
