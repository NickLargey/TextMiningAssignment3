I had seven faces thought I knew which one to wear
I'm sick of spending these lonely nights training myself not to care
The subway is a porno pavements they are a mess
I know you've supported me for a long time
Somehow I'm not impressed

New York Cares (got to be some more change in my life)
New York Cares (got to be some more change in my life)
New York Cares (got to be some more change in my life)
New York Cares (got to be some more change in my life)

Subway she is a porno and the pavements they are a mess
I know you've supported me for a long time
Somehow I'm not impressed

It's up to me now turn on the bright lights
It's up to me now turn on the bright lights

New York Cares (got to be some more change in my life)
New York Cares (got to be some more change in my life)
New York Cares (got to be some more change in my life)
New York Cares (got to be some more change in my life)

It's up to me now turn on the bright lights
(Got to be some more change in my life)
Oh, it's up to me now turn on the bright lights
(Got to be some more change in my life)
