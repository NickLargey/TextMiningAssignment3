I've been chasing you for a long time
Layin' out my best lines
But you just run away
There you are, starin' at me from a distance
So whyy all the resistance
What is the game you play

Why tell me why
Should there be this escapade
Why make me cry
When you just slip away

Runaway love
Whatcha feelin' inside
Runaway love
And why do you deny that it could be love
Ooh, my runaway love
Runaway love
You won't let me near
Runaway love
And what is it you fear about fallin' in love
Ooh, my runaway love

Why is it so hard to get close to you
Whatcha tryin' to put me through
I'm dyin' for your touch
Seems to me you've been holdin' out too long
Your whole outlook has grown
'Cause you're alone too much

Runaway love
Whatcha feelin' inside
Runaway love
And why do you deny that it could be love
Ooh, my runaway love
Runaway love
You won't let me near
Runaway love
And what is it you fear about fallin' in love
Ooh, my runaway love

Runaway love
Runaway love

Why tell me why
Should there be this escapade
Why make me cry
When you just slip away

Runaway love
Whatcha feelin' inside
Runaway love
And why do you deny that it could be love
Ooh, my runaway love
Runaway love
You won't let me near
Runaway love
And what is it you fear about fallin' in love
Ooh, my runaway love

Runaway love
