You don't mean it

You need a uniform
So you won't be ignored
You are affected
And so you're accepted

It's time you invested in a bottle of poison
So we don't have to hear about you bitchin and moanin
You think you could afford a fuckin bottle of asprin

Boo fuckin hoo you're not the only one whose live's a piece of shit
And yet miraculously somehow we all seem to deal with it
Did anybody think that you would really seriously slit your wrists
In fact I think that everybody thinks you're seriously full of shit

You think you're saying something relevant as you connect the dots
You never reaqlized you have to get in line to suck a cock
You're telling me that fifty million fans are never wrong
I'm telling you that fifty million fans are fucking morons
