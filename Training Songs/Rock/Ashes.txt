Rising only now and then 
'Cause you're worlds away.
Nothing stands to reason when
You're believing all they say.
Because I'm not, I'm not the one
To talk to now.

[Chorus]
And she said: "I'll never be
A part of all you'd like to see
So take your time, 'cause summer's over now.

Drive away the days
That I would never understand.
Nothing brings you from the cold
Like emptiness of hand;
And I'm waiting, waiting for
The final hour.

[Chorus]

And it's over now...
Distance shining.
Ashes for the dying.
Heaven help the face that's crying now.
And if I wanted more,
Would I dream it up somehow,
And try to leave the skies just like before?
