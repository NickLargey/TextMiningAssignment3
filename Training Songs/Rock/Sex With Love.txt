Now you can do it on the land
And you can do it out at sea
Ya see it in the movies
And ya see it on TV
Some do it for money honey
But the real thing's free
Aw you can have it in the afternoon
Or have it in the night
Some people like the dark
Some do it in daylight
Any way you want to do it
As long as it feels right
We're all part of a new generation
(Everybody wants a new sensation)
There's got to be some givin' and some takin' I say...

I say we need a little sex, with love
(Sex with love sex with love)
No better way now
Everybody knows that sex, with love
(Sex with love sex with love)
Feeds a hungry mind and satisfies the soul
Oh sex, with love
(Sex with love sex with love)
An old idea that never gets old
(S-E-X) with love

Some ladies are conservative
And others like to play
Some guys make a lot of noise
Some don't know what to say
You can sing and dance baby
If it makes ya feel that way, whoa
Ooh sometimes it's bad and then
There's times it's real good
So folks do it all the time
Some only wish they could
If you don't watch what you're doin' now
Ya better knock on wood
We're all part of a new generation
(Everybody wants a new sensation)
There's got to be some givin' and some takin' I say..

I say we need a little sex, with love
(Sex with love sex with love)
No better way now
Everybody knows that sex, with love
(Sex with love sex with love)
Feeds a hungry mind and satisfies the soul
Oh sex, with love
(Sex with love sex with love)
An old idea that never gets old
(S-E-X) with love

And if you're just startin' ta do it
(You gotta put your heart in to it)
It's too cold in the world today
A little heart goes a long long way..

We're all part of a new generation
(Everybody wants a new sensation)
There's got to be some givin' and some takin' I say..

Ya know we need a little sex, with love
(Sex with love sex with love)
No better way now
Everybody knows that sex, with love
(Sex with love sex with love)
Feeds a hungry mind and satisfies the soul
Oh sex, with love
(Sex with love sex with love)
An old idea that never gets old
(S-E-X) with love
That's what ya need baby
