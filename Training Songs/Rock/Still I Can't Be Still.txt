Well I don't believe in god 
But she talks to me all the time 
And I banish my mother 
But she holds me when I cry 
And I have been unfaithful but 
With me he'll spend the rest of his life 
Yes I have been forgiven 
By all whom I've betrayed and loved 
And I have everything I want 
Is it ever enough? 
 
[Chorus]
Still I can't be still 
Still I can't be silent 
Still I can't be still 
Still I can't be saved 
Still I can't be still 
I can't be silent 
Still I, still 
 
Well I don't believe I'm beautiful but 
At least I've got my sister's smile 
And I resist the muses yet 
They sing to me in exile 
And destiny is not deafening 
But it hushed me like a child 
And every time I feel as though 
I'm closer to the eye 
The storm winds blow 
I run inside, and though I feel revived- 
 
[Chorus]
 
The insatiable peace 
Of my quest for true serenity 
No matter how hard the rain 
The thirst is never ending 
No matter how many friends 
Or angels been sent down to take me away 
They can't make it okay 
And every time I feel as though I'm 
Closer to the eye 
The storm winds blow 
I run inside, and though I feel revived- 
Yes every time I feel as though I'm 
Closer to the eye 
The storm winds blow 
I run inside, and though I feel revived- 
I don't believe I'm beautiful 
But least I've got my sister's smile 
And I resist the muses yet 
They sing to me
