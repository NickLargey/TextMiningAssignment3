I walk the lonely streets, 
I watch the people passing by. 
I used to smile and say hello. 
Guess I was just a happy guy. 
Then you happened, girl, 
This feeling that possesses me. 
I just can't move myself. 
I guess it all just had to be. 

[Chorus:]
I can't see nobody, no, I can't see nobody. 
Mine eyes can only look at you, you. 

I used to have a brain, I used to think of many things. 
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing. 
Don't ask me why, little girl. 
I love you and that's all I can say. 
You're ev'ry ,ev'ry breath I take.
You are my nights; my night and day. 

[Chorus]

Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine. 
I never felt like this before
A love like yours so young and fine. 
And now as I try to forget you
It doesn't work out any way. 
I loved you such a long time ago
But in my eyes you'll always be. 

Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine. 
I loved you such a long time ago
Don't know why,
And I don't know why, baby

[Chorus: x2]
