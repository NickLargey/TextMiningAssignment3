Ow!
Come on!
Yeah!
See-see-see-see-see-come on!
Would you please look at this mother next to me
Frontin' more booty than Peru got keys
Damn, if I don't get that
Wait right there and I'll be right back
Got a new trick in the back of my car
It's kinda like a movie but you're the star
Lights, camera, make a scene
The Endorphinmachine

Go baby
The Endorphinmachine 
Yeah, go baby (Go baby) 

Tippy, tippy, tin my friend or shall we begin?
Step right up and I'll strap you in
Don't be shy, this won't hurt a bit
Unless of course you don't believe in it
As sure as the dippy dippy wave of my 'do
You'll believe in somethin' before this night is through
Press one for the money, press two for the dream
And get ready for somethin' that you've never seen
The Endorphinmachine

Go baby
The Endorphinmachine
Go baby (Go baby)

Tommy Barbarella, turn it on

Hold up, wait a minute
Ain't no good unless somebody else is in it
You there with the cynical disposition
Perhaps you'd like to join us in a mission 
Of fishin' for logic in a think tank
Unless, of course, you're feelin' like a punk and take the bank
But every now and then there comes a time you must defend
Your right to die and live again, live again, live again
Get up, get up, get in
The Endorphinmachine

It's alright, baby (Go Baby)
Don't be shy (The Endorphinmachine)
Yeah, I ain't gonna hurt you
Go baby

Come on, come on (Endorphinmachine) 
Well, I told ya (Go baby)
The Endorphinmachine
Go baby, go baby, go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Don't make me!

Prince esta muerto {Prince is dead}
Prince esta muerto {Prince is dead}
Que viva para siempre el Poder de la Nueva Generacion
{Long live the New Power Generation}
