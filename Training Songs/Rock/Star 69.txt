You don't have to take the bar exam to see
What you've done is ignoramus 103
What've I got to hang my hat on
You don't have a pot to pee in
All this just to be your friend
I was there until the end
Extortion and arson, petty larceny

[Chorus]
I know you called, I know you called, I know you called
I know you called, I know you called, I know you hung up my line
Star sixty nine

I know all about the warehouse fire
I know squirrelys didn't chew the wires
Three people have my number
The other two were with me
I don't like to tell-tell but I'm not your patsy
This time you have gone too far with me

[Chorus]

Why'd you put your quarter down on me?
This reads like some dork inside edition hard copy
I can't be your character witness
I can't be your alibi
Doorbell rings it's the FBI
We learned spy vs. spy
You my friend, are guilty as can be

I know you called, I know you called, I know you called
I know you called, I know you called, I know you hung up my line
I know you called, I know you called, I know you called
I know you called, I know you called, I can't be your alibi
Star 69
