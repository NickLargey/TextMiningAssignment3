Kim Simmonds-Chrysalis Music Ltd.
Standing by the highway
Looking for a ride
Standing by the highway
Looking for a ride
Sad out on the streets you know
The only friend the blues by my side

Wait a second hour
Seems like forty days
Wait a second hour
Seems like forty days
People passing by and stare
The looks they gave makes you send me in my grave

Hitch-hike on the highway
I ain't no one to fear
Hitch-hike on the highway
I ain't no one to fear
Headed for the open road
Pack on back, I'm doing what I can
