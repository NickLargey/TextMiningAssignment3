Here we go again, just you and I, alone
You take me to the point of no return
I question where you stand, how can you complain?
I wonder if you're ever gonna learn

It's a crying shame, alright
We've come so far to be so far away
You and me in the middle of the night
So don't be surprised if you hear me sayin'

"Will you, will you, will you or won't you?
Do you wanna do it or don't you?
Will you, will you, will you or won't you?
Do you wanna do it or don't you?"

First you say you're ill, then you disappear
And I'm the fool who wants to carry on
But I can't say goodbye after all this time
Are we at the ending of our song?

It's a crying shame, alright
We've come so far to be here, tonight
You and me in the middle of our dream
So don't be surprised when you hear me screamin'

"Will you, will you, will you or won't you?
Do you wanna do it or don't you?
Will you, will you, will you or won't you?
Do you wanna do it or don't you?"

Will you, will you, will you or won't you?
Do you wanna do it or don't you?
Will you, will you, will you or won't you?
Do you wanna do it or don't you?

Will you, will you, will you or won't you?
Do you wanna do it or don't you?
Will you, will you, will you or won't you?
Do you wanna do it or don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you?
