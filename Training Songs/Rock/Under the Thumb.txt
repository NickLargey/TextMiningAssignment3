(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

You twisted a nerve, you
Put your hand on your heart and
You said, "Hey don't worry
You're fit woman, that's all that counts"
And yes

I ignored all the usual signs
Not really knowing quite why
I let you decide, yeah eh
Ain't it funny how
I'm finding out now
It makes me laugh
How I let you have your way and your say
I've got it now
So i'm asking you babe

Did I ever even cross your mind
Cause it's not a game of who is under 
The thumb
I think you took me for a ride, ride, ride
But I didn't see,
I, didn't even realize boy that we 
Were playing
Games of under the thumb
I think you took me for a ride, ride, ride
What a waste of me

A pro at the sweet talk
Back into your bedroom again like
A fool I went blindly
As soon as I got the invite, yes
I ignored all the the usual signs
Swallowed it down with my pride
Let you decide, yeah eh

Ain't it funny how
I'm finding out now
It makes me laugh how

I let you have your say and your way
I've got it now so I'm asking you baby
(Wooh, wooh, wooh, wooh)

Did I ever even cross your mind
Cause it's not a game of who is under 
The thumb
I think you took me for a ride, ride, ride
But I didn't see,
I, didn't even realize boy that we 
Were playing
Games of under the thumb
I think you took me for a ride, ride, ride
What a waste of me

Oh I thought you were for real
So I kept giving more
Oh now I want you one your knees
Begging on the floor

Did I ever even cross your mind
Cause it's not a game of who is under 
The thumb
I think you took me for a ride, ride, ride
But I didn't see,
I, didn't even realize boy that we 
Were playing
Games of under the thumb
I think you took me for a ride, ride, ride
What a waste of me

Did I ever even cross your mind
Cause it's not a game of who is under 
The thumb
I think you took me for a ride, ride, ride
But I didn't see,
I, didn't even realize boy that we 
Were playing
Games of under the thumb
I think you took me for a ride, ride, ride
What a waste of me
