what tomorrow, what tomorrow. What tomorrow lifr will give me, I don't know.
I see no worries, I see no hurries. when that morning light embraces me, then I know there's a way out.
At that time I sit, under the big, big sky. For a while I sit, my friend, and sing:
what tomorrow, what tomorrow. Ehat tomorrow life will give me, I don't know and I don't care.

You see my frinds, they go around the world to see. and now they're talking about the way they want to live.
di di dam, di di dam MAKE LOVE, di di dam, di di dam EAT di di dam. di di dam
but they never sing:
what tomorrow what tomorrow. what tomorrow life will give me.
