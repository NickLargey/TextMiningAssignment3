If I could only touch your heart
Maybe I could feel what you're going through
If I could only read your thoughts
Maybe I know what I need to do
Something's pulling us together
Something's stronger that we knew

It's part of me, part of you
Reaching out for part of something new
Loving me, loving you
And I wonder if you feel it too
I wish I knew

If I could feel the way you feel
Maybe all the words would come easily
If I could know what's in your mind
Baby, there a clue that I failed to see
Something's brought us here together
Something's trying to break through

It's part of me, part of you
Reaching out for part of something new
Loving me, loving you
And I wonder if you feel it too
I wish I knew

It's part of me, part of you
Reaching out for part of something new
Loving me, loving you
And I wonder if you feel it too
I wish I knew
