Where are the roses that I brought you, my love
Where are the poems that I wrote
You cast your eyes down when I watch you, my love
Have I been too long on the road

[Chorus]
I came back to find a stranger in tears
She was once the girl I used to know, for some years
Marian, tell me you still care for me
Marian, remember how good those days used to be

Marian, for don't you believe

What kind of music fills your head now my love
What kind of place became your mind
You tried to find out 'bout your feelings my love
Were you ever thinking of mine

[Chorus]

Marian, for don't you believe

[Chorus]
