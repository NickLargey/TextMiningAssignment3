That sign upon your shop front
Is it for sale or rent?
I need a sign just like that
I'm willing to pay cash

No reason why
Just to fill the time
I know exactly why
I'm where I should be

I really don't get anxious
I leave it up to fate
Our lives are so at random
It really don't make sense

And any holes found empty
We'll fill with summer lawn

Reach for the sky
I only want what's mine
I know exactly why
I'm where I should be

Not trapped by the burden of parody
Shooting cold stares that could freeze ice cream
Thieves in the garden have turned to stone
Nothing is left now for babylon

No reason why
Just to fill the time
I know exactly why
I'm where I should be

Reach for the sky
I only want what's mine
I know exactly why
I'm where I should be
