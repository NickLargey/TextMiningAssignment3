I wanna try that pill that people take 
Make you believe all the things that people say 
Sick of shuckin' 'round with a screwed up face 
With my heels dug in trying to leave a trace 
Now come on put me down somehow 
How you lose your faith 
(just take my hand and lead me where you wanna) 

[Chorus]
Pay no more mind to what you think you've seen 
It's as they do only 
Say what they say 
'Cause there's only one way 
They-Say Vision 
It takes you back to just where you want 
Like when you ain't know no way 

Industry's down think I've died and I've flown away 
So so long to them thieves who came and took all the things to say 
I play the joker sometimes but then those moments slide back my way 
'Cause for real I'd give my soul away 
Give it all away 
(so take my hand and lead me where you wanna) 

[Chorus]

I know where they all go find someplace 
Where they don't mind loafing about the waste 

They-Say Vision takes you back to where no conscience 
Free from how you really see 

And if you think that you know 
Take the back road 
They got you where they want 
They got you
