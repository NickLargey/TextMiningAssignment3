Don't want to let you down
I've been lucky I was lost
Now I'm found
You could be the first

In the universe, who's glad
They're watered down
That's why I get that shallow feeling that you like
That you're her won't change a thing

Don't want to make a row
You do and it's your loss
I'm around
I don't mind doing everything

Hallelujah you're the one
Come back now
Sometimes I get that shallow feeling that you like
I'll never learn that I can't win

Because my weakness is none of your business
Somehow it always collects to one big melting point
And all my weakness is none of your business
The bad will always collect to one big melting pot

This could be our time
This could be our time
