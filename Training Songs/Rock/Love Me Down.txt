If I go crazy
And my feet come off the ground
If I get too high
Like the high-strung get wound

Love me down

When I lose my confidence
Everything turns red
It's like there's nothing inside my head
I'm a kite on a string
Waitin' for what fate brings to me
Tangled up in somebody's telephone wire
Please

Love me down

In the sky
Can't see the water
Would you forgive me
I lied

If I go crazy
And my feet come off the ground
If I get too high
Like the high-strung get wound

Love me down

If I lose my mind
Would you be so kind
As to point me in the right direction
I love the way you are
God sent me an angel down to protect me

Love me down
Love me down
