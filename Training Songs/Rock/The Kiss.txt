I know we don't belong
Everyone says it's wrong
We come from different ways
So I tried to erase everything that I felt
That I felt

But then you kissed me and suddenly I don't care any more
Something in me tells me you're the one I'm looking for
But then you kissed me and suddenly I don't care any more
Something in me tells me you're the one I'm looking for
From the kiss
From the kiss

My heart is getting loud
I'm trying to keep it down
I wish the world could hear
But I can't help but fear that they'll take you away
You away

But then you kissed me and suddenly I don't care any more
Something in me tells me you're the one I'm looking for
But then you kissed me and suddenly I don't care any more
Something in me tells me you're the one I'm looking for
From the kiss
From the kiss

Palm to palm
Let lips do what hands do
They pray
Is it a sin
To do what we want to?
Don't care where we've been
Give me my sin again

But then you kissed me and suddenly I don't care any more
Something in me tells me you're the one I'm looking for
But then you kissed me and suddenly I don't care any more
Something in me tells me you're the one I'm looking for
From the kiss
From the kiss
