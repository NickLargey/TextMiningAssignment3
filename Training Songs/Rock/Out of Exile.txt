When I first came to this island
That I called by my own name
I was happy in this fortress
In my exile I remained
But the hours grew so empty
And the ocean sent her waves
In the figure of a woman
And she pulled me out to sea

Oh oh when you come down to take me home
Oh oh send my soul away
Oh oh when you come round you'll make me whole
Oh oh send my soul away

On the altar of a sunrise
Was a wedding in the waves
And inside her shown a young light
From her labor I was saved
Though I've traveled long in darkness
In her harvest I'm embraced

Oh oh when you come down to take me home
Oh oh send my soul away
Oh oh when you come round you'll make me whole
Oh oh send my soul away

Now the spires and gables 
Grow in orchards to the sky
And the blessings on the table
Multiply and divide
Oh oh when you come down to take me home
Oh oh send my soul away
Oh oh when you come round you'll make me whole
Oh oh send my soul away

Yeah, when you come down to take me home
When you come round you'll make me whole
When you come round to take me home
Send my soul away 
Send my soul away 
Send my soul away 
Send my soul away
