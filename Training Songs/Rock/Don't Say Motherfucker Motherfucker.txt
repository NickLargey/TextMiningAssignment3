Don't need no budget boob
Don't need no funky lube
You wanna deal? I wanna snitch
Such a wild-ass bitch
But you can't touch this
So, don't say motherfucker, motherfucker
Don't wipe your sole on the curb
Li'l puppy needs a guiding hand
To rub your face in the turd
Don't need no vintage tits
Don't need no tight ass lips
You wanna thrill? You gotta learn
Better step back as the deathpunk burns
They say that rats ain't got no friends
They say that stink will never end
Gimme that dirty food
Gimme that angel's lude
You wanna rock? You gotta roll
Washing your gold in a toilet bowl.
So, don't say motherfucker, motherfucker
Don't wipe your sole on the curb
Li'l puppy needs a guiding hand
To rub your face in the turd
Don't say motherfucker, motherfucker
Don't spend it all in one place
Li'l puppy need a helping foot
To kick the sand in your face
Just don't say it
