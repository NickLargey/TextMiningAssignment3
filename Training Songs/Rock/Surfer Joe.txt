Down in Yohee where the surfers all go
There's a big beach blondie named Surfer Joe
He's got a green woody & a board to match
And when he's riding the waves, man is he hard to catch

Surfer Joe, now look at him go-o-o
Surfer, surfer, surfer Joe
Go man go
Oh-o-o Surfer Joe

Joe went to Huntington's Meet one week
Where the annual surfing convention meet
He was hangin' five and walkin' the nose
And when the Meet was over, the trophy was Joe's

Surfer Joe, now look at him go-o-o
Surfer, surfer, surfer Joe
Go man go
Oh-o-o Surfer Joe

Surfer Joe joined Uncle Sam's marines today
They stationed him at Penalton, not far away
They cut off his long blond locks I'm told
And when he went on manouvers, Joe got cold

Surfer Joe, now look at him go-o-o
Surfer, surfer, surfer Joe
Go man go
Oh-o-o Surfer Joe
