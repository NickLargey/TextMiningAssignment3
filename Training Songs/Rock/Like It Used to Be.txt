Well it's been a hard week
Chasing down these miles
Trying desperately
To find a reason to smile
It's been some time now (too long)
So long I do not know
So baby put on your favorite dress
And just let go

We'll go downtown
Stop at the first bar we see
Yeah we can throw 'em down
Hot baby just you and me
We'll shoot the lights out
So no one else can see
And we'll close our eyes 
And wish it was like it used to be

You know everybody falls
When a wolf comes to your front door
And those big shots yeah they got it all
And all they want is more
I'll spend my last dime 
To see you smile tonight
So tell me baby what can I do 
To get this right

We'll go downtown
Stop at the first bar we see
Yeah we can throw 'em down
Hot baby just you and me
We'll shoot the lights out
So no one else can see
And we'll close our eyes 
And wish it was like it used to be

We'll go downtown
Stop at the first bar we see
Yeah we can throw 'em down
Hot baby just you and me
We'll shoot the lights out
So no one else can see
And we'll close our eyes 
And wish it was like it used to be
Yeah we'll close our eyes 
And wish it was like it used to be
