She sits so quietly
At the window by the door
Wondering if she'll
Ever smile again
Her eyes filled with memories
And her life in sad array
Unaware of the colours of the day
She dare not cry for fear
Her hope might disappear
But if she cared to try
I know it all could be so clear

But she's living in the past
She didn't know it wouldn't last
And it's a long, long, lonely road
Oh, to go down

The treasured names
You call each other just for fun
And as you woke
She kissed your eyes
You killed it all when it had
Only just begun
What's it take to make you realise

Love isn't easy though
Many like to think it is
But you must learn
To give and take or know
What you will miss

But she's living in the past
She didn't know it wouldn't last
And it's a long, long, lonely road
Oh, to go down
