You've been looking at me like you've got something to say
You got flaws in your step
You're miles away from anything anyway

Let's get to the point
The words that fell of your lips didn't mean anything
They didn't mean shit to you or him

But tonight we will be alright
Yes the champagne is on ice for you and I
And you're right for we will be alright
'Cause we've got it all and it's all that is left inside
Let's just keep on talking

I smell your scent on my skin and the clothes that I wear
It's a thought in my head and I can't shake it
Of you and him, sh-sh-shake it

I am at the party too, I am in the room next to you
With your back to the door and your ear to the floor
And you were desperate

But tonight we will be alright
Yes the champagne is on ice for you and I
And you're right for we will be alright
'Cause we've got it all and it's all that is left inside
Let's just keep on talking

And don't let me down
And don't let me down
And don't let me down
And don't let me

But tonight we will be alright
Yes the champagne is on ice for you and I
And you're right for we will be alright
'Cause we've got it all and it's all that is left inside
Let's just keep on talking
