Here them come
The boys in the bright white sports car
Waving their arms in the air
Who do they think they are?
And where did they get that car?

There they go
The boys in the bright white sports car
Honking at all the girls
It's jack-of-all-trades Stan
And Jerry's a garbageman

There they go
The boys are really rollin'
Some old lady called the cops
Said the car is probably stolen, stolen
