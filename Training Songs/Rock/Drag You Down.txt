It's biting it's teething it's biting I'm bleeding
It's calling it's crawling it's calling and I'm falling
The perfect sound of middle ground
Pull me under before I try to drag you down

Someone has to pull me under before 
I try to drag you down
They're fighting they're growing they're fighting and I'm growing
I'm biting I'm teething I'm bleeding
