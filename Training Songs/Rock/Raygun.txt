Shoot me with your Raygun
Full of holes so the daylight can get to what's dark
I remain trapped inside your body
The vice above your head
The hole inside your heart
Shoot me with your Raygun
Full of night and daylight savings
Armour me with futile aspirations
The knives of many nations
A shovel and some dirt

Digging down you'll find you're old inside
Shoot me with your Raygun
Full of holes of indignation
We've never been there before
You and me

Take me with you
To the place where everything is unsaid
I remain trapped inside my body
Wishing it was over
Shoot me with your Raygun
Through the night
So the daylight finds you
Wishing it was over

Digging down you'll find you're old inside
Shoot me with your Raygun
Full of holes of indignation
We've never been there before
You and me
