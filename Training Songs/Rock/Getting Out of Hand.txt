A friend told me yesterday
You've been lookin' for me
If I've been stayin' out of your way
I've done it intentionally

Saw you walking with her (walkin' with her)
Always kept that few steps behind, yeah
Wonder if she knows for sure (she knows for sure)
Her man's goin'on walking the line

Then I say to myself 'beware'
It's getting out of hand (out of hand)
It's getting out of hand (don't look now)
If he's lovin' you, he's not being true
He's got another woman, yeah

Look me right in the eye
Tell me I'm the one that you love
Right back into your lies
Forgetting how determined I was

Then I say to myself 'beware'
It's getting out of hand (out of hand)
It's getting out of hand (don't look now)
If he's lovin' you, he's not being true
He's got another woman, yeah

A friend told me yesterday, hey
