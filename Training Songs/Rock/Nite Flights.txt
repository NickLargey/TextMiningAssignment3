There's no hold
The moving '
Has come through 
The danger 
Brushin you 
Turns its face 
Into the heat 
And runs
The tunnels 
Its so cold 
The dark
Dug up 
By dogs 
The stitches 
Torn and broke 
The raw meat fist 
You choke
Has hit
The bloodlight
Glass traps 
Open and close 
On night flights 
Broken necks 
Feather weights 
Press the walls 
Be my love
We will be GODS 
On night flights 
With
Only one promise 
Only one way
To fall
