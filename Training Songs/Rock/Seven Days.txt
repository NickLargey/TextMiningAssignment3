Seven days away
Think I thought
I heard you say
Where I want to be
Is with you my sweet mystery

Seven days ahead
For a week I stay in bed
Now where I want to be
Is with you my sweet mystery

Don't leave me broken
Don't leave me sad
Now where I want to be
Is with you my sweet mystery

Seven days I'll wait
Seven days you're much too late
In everything I see
Is you my sweet mystery

Don't leave me broken
Don't leave me sad
Now where I want to be
Is with you my sweet mystery

In everything I see
Is you my sweet mystery

You my sweet mystery
