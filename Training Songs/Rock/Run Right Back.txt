Before she hits the ground
She's gonna want to explode
Better step aside
Better run and hide

She holds it all under hood
That pretty hair of hers oh
Screaming out
In an electric shout

She's the worst thing
I've been addicted to

I run right back
Run right back to her
Yeah, I jumped the track
And I run right back I'm sure
I run right back to her

Well she's such a special thing
She doesn't read too much oh
There is no doubt
She's written about

Finest exterior
She's so superior, oh
But she won't allow
And I want it now

She's the worst thing
I've been addicted to

I run right back
Run right back to her
Yeah, I jumped the track
And I run right back I'm sure
I run right back to her
