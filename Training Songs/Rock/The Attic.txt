Take her by the sun bath
I do it all and I see it clear
All day I am lonely
Pretty about my ? cloud
Baby come home
Down by the ? tell me know
Come on hanging on this waterfall
What is how I just don’t know baby come home
Down by the ? tell me know
 
Come on hanging on this waterfall
What is how I just don’t know baby come home
? to the ashes crush back to the attic and him
Baby come home baby come home
Baby come home
Come home come home Baby come home
Come home come home
