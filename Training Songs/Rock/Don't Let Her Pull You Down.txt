It's time that I rain on your parade
Watch as all your hopes explode to landmines
You ask for help but people turn away

You're living so far away from the truth
That you're believing in your own lies
It's no surprise that you sleep at night
Drowning in your prize

You made him feel so welcome
Make him forget about
The poison running through his veins
You may say that you love him
Now lie in the mess you've made

Don't let her
Don't let her pull you down
Don't let her
Don't let her pull you down

Don't let her
Don't let her pull you down

It's time I get a few things straight with you
You haven't been in for the whole time
Your stories, like your lifestyle, distorted, yeah

You're living so far away from the truth
That you're leaving me with no choice
But to put you back in your place
With every sentence

You made him feel so wanted
You make him feel that there is
Nothing more beyond your door
You may say that you love him
Now tell me what the love shit's for

Don't let her
Don't let her pull you down
Don't let her
Don't let her pull you down

Don't let her
Don't let her pull you down
Don't let her

I hope that this isn't a sign
Of things to come
I'll kill myself for blaming you
Please tell me now
Is this a sign of things to come?

Don't let her
Don't let her pull you down
Don't let her
Don't let her pull you down

Don't let her
Don't let her pull you down
Don't let her

It's time that I rain on your parade
