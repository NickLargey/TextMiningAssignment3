Taste of mercury
Needles in your eyes
Creating the need
Shaping hearts to kill 
Searching for the catch
Settle for some change
Learning to adapt
This is, this is a crackdown

A look of contempt
It's just a passing wave

Models for the program
Sharpening up to suit your part 
Talk in flying colors 
Take your orders from above 

Make your bid for calm
Pushing for restraint
Learning to obey
Down on your knees and pray

A look of contempt
A flash in the pan
And you're up for sale
But it's not your day
You just bite your tongue
'Til it starts to bleed
Nowhere left to run
From me

Sharpening up to suit your part 
Talk in flying colors 
Take your orders from above 

I'm not qualifying 
Satisfy your basic need 
Falling short of targets 
Whose agenda is it now?

Sharpening up to suit your part 
Talk in flying colors
