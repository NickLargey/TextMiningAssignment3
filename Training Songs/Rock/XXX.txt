She said goodbye with a look in her eye
That would leave most men perplex
And I knew by the note that she pulled from her coat
What she meant when she signed it with an X-X-X
X-X-X

She left so soon, she left that exit
Would she had just left where the roads intersect
And the last thing I saw before my heart hit the floor
Was a license plate reading X-X-X
X-X-X
X-X-X

With a criss and a cross
A whole day's lost
I'm hiding in a multiplex
The lights go dim
The wheels begin to spin
The picture is certificate X-X-X
X-X-X
X-X-X
