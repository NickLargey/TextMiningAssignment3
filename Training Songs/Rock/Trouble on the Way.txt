Almost midnight
I see the look in your eyes
Almost my time
Come on baby let me take a bite
And we go slow
Look to the rhythm of what you know
Where this gonna go?
In the shadow?
Scream for your life baby go go

Ooh we got it all
Ooh we got it all
Ooh we got it all
There's trouble on the way

Ooh we got it all
Ooh we got it all
Ooh we got it all
There's trouble on the way

See your blood dance
Come baby come baby romance
Don't be scared just take a chance
Here's my blah blah blah blah
Take my hand and
Come and see me
Moonlight come in and greet meet
Oh inside you're screaming
But now I know you need me

Ooh we got it all
Ooh we got it all
Ooh we got it all
There's trouble on the way

Ooh we got it all
Ooh we got it all
Ooh we got it all
There's trouble on the way

I see you there and
I know you care
So I'm standing
Where you see me clearly
Don't fight
Baby don't you put up a fight
Come and just make you mine
Come in on the moonlight
Come in on the moonlight
There's trouble on the way

Ooh we got it all
Ooh we got it all
Ooh we got it all
There's trouble on the way

Ooh we got it all
Ooh we got it all
Ooh we got it all
There's trouble on the way

Trouble on the way
Trouble on the way
Trouble on the way
