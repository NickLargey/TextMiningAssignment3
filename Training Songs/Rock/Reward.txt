Bless my cotton socks, I'm in the news
The king sits on his face buttons all askew
All wrapped up the same (same)
All wrapped up the same (same)
They can't have it
You can't have it
I can't have it too
Until I learn to accept my reward

Princes stand in queues they stand accused
Death in solitude like Howard Hughes
All wrapped up the same (same)
All wrapped up the same (same)
Silence has it
Arrogance has it
I can have it ooh
Until I learn to accept my reward

Suddenly it struck me very clear
Suddenly it struck me very clean
All wrapped up the same
All wrapped up the same
You can't have it
I can't have it too
Until I learn to accept my reward

Until I learn to accept my reward

Until I learn to accept my reward

Until I learn to accept my reward

Until I learn to accept my
I learn to accept my
I learn to accept my reward!
