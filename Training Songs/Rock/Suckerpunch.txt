It's been about a dozen seasons
Since the boy became a man
Now he sees the forest for the trees
Now he touches just enough to feel
He's much stronger than he was just yesterday

Won't get suckerpunched again
Gotta sink so you can swim, you know?
You never really learn
Till you fall and feel the burn, you know?

He looks back and has to pity where he's been
And then he smiles and walks away
There were days when it hurt too much to handle
Foolish boy had to learn how to dismantle
All those memories that wouldn't seem to leave

Won't get suckerpunched again
Gotta sink so you can swim, you know?
You never really learn
Till you fall and feel the burn, you know?

There is a reason, some reason for all of this
Affliction is a contradiction to our happiness
Except to those who know
Those who know, oh yeah

Won't get suckerpunched again
Gotta sink so you can swim, you know?
You never really learn
Till you fall and feel the burn, you know?

Won't get suckerpunched again
Gotta sink so you can swim
You know, you know, you know, you know
I know these things [Incomprehensible] won't matter
