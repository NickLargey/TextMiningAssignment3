I plan to do it everyday, but I couldn't care
It's not as if I worry I'm never there
And what do you want in this, oh
Something's got to give
The lines are there
It's all for you take, you give

Sometimes you put your back up
'Cause it's the only way to see
That you're going nowhere today

I plan to do it everyday, but I couldn't care
It's not as if I worry I'm never there
You know just as well as I, I am going down 
Wednesday is far to early

Sometimes you put your back up
'Cause it's the only way to see
That you're going nowhere today

'Cause, sometimes you put your back up
'Cause it's the only way to see
That you're going nowhere today

Wednesday is far to early
