Take the forward path
Have a big slice of the city
Get the upper hand
While you're still pretty

But you know what we're like
No, they will never respect you
The way you want them to respect you
I think it's very well understood

But I'm
I'm gonna hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you
You

Your cracked up shell
A dead opera house
You give yourself to them now
In a game of cat and mouse

From the storyboard
To the bedroom scene
Through eleven World Wars
Other people you have been

Well I'm
Gonna hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you
You

Oh I'm
Gonna hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you
You

I can come to terms
With slowly going mad
Things we used to fear in the dark
And what ever lies beyond that

But I've come to resemble
My own shadow
As it falls into the sidewalk
I'm no longer anyone I know

No-one here reminds me of you
Yet I see no-one else
On the crowded sidewalk

Well I'm
I'm gonna hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you
You

Oh I'm
I'm gonna hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you
Hold on to you
Hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you
