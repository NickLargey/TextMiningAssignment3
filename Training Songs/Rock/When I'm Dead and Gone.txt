Oh, I love you baby, I love you night and day
When I leave you, baby, don't cry the night away
When I die, don't you write no words upon my tomb
I don't believe I want to leave no epitaph for two

[Chorus]
Whoa, when I'm dead and gone
I want to leave some happy woman living on
Whoa, when I'm dead and gone
I don't want nobody to mourn beside my grave

Oh, my Melinda, she's out to get my hide
She gotta shotgun and a daughter by her side
Hey there ladies, Johnson's free
Who got the law, who got the love to keep a man like me?

[Chorus]

I said, oh na'n'na na

When I die, don't you write no words upon my tomb
I don't believe I want to leave no epitaph for two

[Chorus]

I said, oh na'n'na na, oh na'n'na na
Whoa, when I'm dead, when I'm dead
Oh, when I'm dead and gone
