She's getting married - looking at her life
Every time she turns around - she's somebody's wife
But no dice - she wants to break that chain tonight
He's been working sales - sleeping on the phone

Every time he wants to quit - he can't make his loan
But he'll drive - they'll make that Texas line tonight
See'mon baby - no more maybe
This could make us young again - for awhile

[Chorus]
If you're gonna love me - love me tonight
If we're gonna do it - let's do it right
If you're gonna love me - love me tonight

The devil's getting dusty - cause sin is outta style
Mommy's leaving daddy - found another man
They can't feed the family - sent the kids to uncle Sam
But he lied - he couldn't feed them if he tried

Let's get together - let's forget the ties
Let's be like in the movies - for a night

[Chorus]

Now and then we think that everything's changing
That we can see the light
Then we stop and see it's always the same thing
Reality comes into sight

Come on baby - no more maybe
This could make us young again - for awhile
