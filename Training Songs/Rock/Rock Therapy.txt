Well, I don't need a doctor I don't need a pill 
Anything you give me babe will only make me ill
I need rock therapy

Oh give it to me

Well I don't need vitamins

Swinging with my baby doing a rock and roll dance
I need rock therapy
I need rock therapy
I need rock therapy
Oh give it to me

Well, I don't need a doctor I don't need a nurse 
Anything you give me babe will only make me worse

Well, I don't need a doctor I don't need a pill 
Anything you give me babe will only make me ill
