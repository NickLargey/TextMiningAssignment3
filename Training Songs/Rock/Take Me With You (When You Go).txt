Day is done, night is returning.
Icy black, the muddy waters.
I've got to know, won't you please tell me.
Sinking like a stone, the icy water

(Chorus)
Each night when I go to bed I pray, take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed I pray, take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed I pray.

Past the house, where first they brought you.
Carried you to sleep, protected from harm.
And when they're gone, soon be returning.
The ones you lived by, they found a foothold.

(Chorus)

Like the sweet, sweet breeze that brought you.
Left by chance, broke down by your words.
What did I know, to ask you to leave me.
Evening will die upon my doorstep.

Each night when I go to bed I pray, take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed I pray, take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed I pray, take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed I pray, take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed I pray.
