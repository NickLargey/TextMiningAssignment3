My oh my, I'm seeing the potential 
Lets just see what we can do 
First we'll take you down back to the meathouse 
And then you'll hold their hands again 

I know tricks that you could only dream of 
Looks like it's your lucky day 
A killer key change 
Is all you'll ever need

But who needs enemies 
When you've got friends
Now your hands are tied 
And who needs accidents 
When you've got me
Now I'm on your side 

Now let's try and teach you how to mingle 
Then we'll teach you how to kill 
Lies will always be your best of best friends 
Never be alone again 

A killer key change 
Is all you'll ever need 

All these animals 
That you call friends 
Now they're on their knees 
Man, you tricked 'em all 

You played the fool 
So damn easy to please 
I made my name in function rooms 
And drifting through the walls 

Come on let me teach you boy 
Teach you 'bout it all 

All these animals 
That you call friends 
Now they're on their knees 
Man, you tricked 'em all 

You played the fool
So damn easy to please
