Who’d think our road would be so long when we started this ride together
Facing every storm by standing strong for worse or for better
Making memories with every passing day that will last us a lifetime
And even in the darkest of days your love makes me shine
Now under the summer moons sky lost in the sparkle in your eyes
So many things I want to say to you but no words would ever do 
Here in this moment

I just want to love you
Hold you in my arms and shut the world out
Don’t need any words when feelings speak so loud
I have a million ways to say how I feel for you
But sometimes words they just won’t do
I just want to love you, I just want to love you

Said good bye to my lonely days when you walked in to my life
Promise to give you all the love it takes to keep you by my side
Tender moments with you are more precious than words can say
I want to let this perfect night take us away

I just want to love you
Hold you in my arms and shut the world out
Don’t need any words when feelings speak so loud
I have a million ways to say how I feel for you
Not a single word can say what love can do
I just want to love you, I just want to love you

I just want to love you
Hold you in my arms and shut the world out
Don’t need any words when feelings speak so loud
With a million ways that I can say how i feel you
I don’t want to say a single word I just want to love you
