Maybe it's time to hold onto one side, one decision
Let go of the hand that holds me high above that great divide

And beauty is the ease required for you to understand
That single frame of animation

I think you know
I think you know
I realize when you wake up that sometimes
I appear unfamiliar but these prints can't lie
I realize when you wake up that sometimes
I appear unfamiliar but these prints can't lie
These prints can't lie

Possessing all the features I've predetermined to objectify
Effortless and rubenesque, yet so perfectly-ly aligned

And beauty is the ease required for you to understand
That single frame of animation

I think you know
I think you know
I realise when you wake up that sometimes
I appear unfamiliar but these prints can't lie
I realize when you wake up that sometimes
I appear unfamiliar but these prints can't lie

Nine or ten songs I had let pass before
I had broke that first thought progression
And there we were, in the same restaurant grazing legs underneath the table

And I will always, always
I will watch over you
I will always, always
I will watch over you
Over you, over you

I realize when you wake up that sometimes
I appear unfamiliar but these prints can't lie
I realize when you wake up that sometimes
I appear unfamiliar but these prints can't lie
These prints can't lie

I want you back
This means untouched and intact
(You always were so critical)
I want you back
This means untouched and intact
(You always were so critical)
I want you back
This means untouched and intact
(You always were so critical)
I want you back
This means untouched and intact
