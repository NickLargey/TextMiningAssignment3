You call me on the phone 
You say you're not alone
And will I take you away
Away from all the noise
From other nasty boys
Who want to kiss you

Afraid, afraid of what they'll see
Of who you just might be
If they look closely at
How you lost your way
And that's how you lost your way

So run
Run and hide from all the beasties that go bump in the night
Run, run and hide from all the noise
From all the nasty boys
Who keep you running

Youth, youth slipped away
There's no more glory day
Where is the cheering now
Now you hit your past
It's caught you out at last
When you weren't looking behind
Behind you all the time
Waiting there in line with all the others 

It's how you lost your way
And that's how you lost your way

So run
Run and hide from all the beasties that go bump in the night
Run, run and hide from all the noise
From all the nasty boys
Who keep you running

Now, the cares upon your face
You had a special place
What happened to it?
The things, the things you left behind
They're heavy on your mind
Why did you do it?

It's how you lost your way
And that's how you lost your way
You rolled the dice
You should've thought twice
And now you've got nowhere to turn to

Run
Run and hide from all the beasties that go bump in the night
Run, run and hide from all the noise
From all the nasty boys
Who keep you running

Run
Run and hide from all the creepies that go bump in the night
Run, run and hide from all the noise
From all the nasty boys
Who keep you running

Run
Run and hide from all the beasties that go bump in the night
Run, run and hide from all the noise
From all the nasty boys
Who keep you running
