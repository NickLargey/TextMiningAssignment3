I saw you there 
I stopped and stared 
The curly girlie smiled 
You really were 

Too close to her 
And people just went by 
I saw your face 
And her embrace 

Your whisper in her ear 
I know the score 
'Cause I've heard it before 
I read your lips with fear 

Your words were clear (you said) 
Lalalalalala 
Let's say forever  let's say it's true 
Lalalalalala 

Let's come together  me and you 
Lalalalalala 
Your new cuckoo
