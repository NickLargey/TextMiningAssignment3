Crashed out on the market,
Out blood on the floor
Busted man on show 
Bundled out of the City, out
Of the door
Thrown up against the wall
Put out of the picture, axe
About to fall
Walk before you throw (cry?)
Sinking to the bottom,
Screaming for air
The shark must get his share
You can see it coming, miles
And miles away
Women, drink and money are
Going to make you pay

[Chorus]
Snowballed, oh yeah
Snowballed, they've done it
Again
Snowballed, makin' me pay
Snowballed

Howl of the wolf, sneer
(snow??) in his eyes
Waiting to take you by
Surprise
Eye of the needle, head of
The pin
Watch those teeth 'cause
They're ready to bite
You can see it coming, miles
And miles away
Women, drink and money are
Going to make you pay

[Chorus]

Out of my mind
One more time
