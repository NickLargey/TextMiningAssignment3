It's been a long time
Since I held you in my arms
Oohh since I held you in my arms
I'm now alone so won't you please come home
If you don't want me no more
Why not you tell me so
Oohh why not you tell me so
If you don't want me
Down the road I shall go
It ain't what you do it's the way that you do it
Ain't what you eat it's the way that you chew it
Oohh
Oohh
Oohh
Baby ain't it good

It's been a long time
Since I held you in my arms
Oohh since I held you in my arms
I'm now alone so won't you please come home
Cause it ain't what you do it's the way that you do it
Ain't what you eat it's the way that you chew it
Oohh
Oohh
Oohh
Baby ain't it good
