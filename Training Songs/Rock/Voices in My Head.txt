I decide to listen to the voices in my head
Strange hallucinations I avoid
The people and the places, the living and the dead
Can I find some truth within the noise?

It gets cold and it gets lonely
Gets you down inside
When it's evening and I wander off
It's a long dark ride

Now I'm very conscious of the voices in my head
They multiply and amplify the fear
I can play the victim or get on with life instead
By finding resolution as they clear

We've had our final conversation
I remember that
Understand me: it's a long way back
If I decide to listen

No more time to listen to the voices in my head
Say goodbye, time to say farewell
To all the ghosts and demons and all the words they said
I decide to listen to myself
