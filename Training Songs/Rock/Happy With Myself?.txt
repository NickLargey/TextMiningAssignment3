I'm happy with myself
I'm happy with myself
And I don't have
What it takes
To please you

I've been trying 
To write you a letter
I've been trying
For two or three years
Maybe I
Could just say it better
Practice some 
In front of a mirror
Here
Oh

I've been trying
To build you a heaven
Crowns of thorns
In Mason jars
Angels that dance
On pins and needles
Maybe I've tried
A little too hard
Oh
