I got a dash-mount compass that won't direct
I got a get-rich guru who calls collect
I got a psychic adviser saying, "Get a lifeguard"
I'm getting bad vibes off of your Deal-a-Meal card

Tell me why their words ring hollow
Lead the way, and I will follow
If you can lead me out of this maze

I got shrinks that send me to victim class
I got talk-show show-offs giving me gas
I got assertiveness trainers yelling, "Shove! Shove! Shove!"
I got no one teaching me how to love

The more I chew, the less I swallow
Lead the way, and I will follow
If you can lead me out of this maze

Up we struggle
Down we slide
Scared to call on a bigger guide
I'm tired of getting slow
Speed the plow
Lead the way, Lord Jesus
I'm ready now

Lead the way, and I will follow
Lead the way, Lord
I will follow
Follow Your footsteps through this maze
