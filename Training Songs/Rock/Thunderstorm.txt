Sun is gone
And I'm on my own in a thunderstorm
But it's not about to turn me around
Hail is under my feet
And lightning is in my head
Deep inside I am tired of running
I don't mind if the rain is coming

Walking onto the water
Where I was meant to be
Deep inside I am tired of running
I don't mind that the rain is coming
Deep inside I am tired of running
I don't mind that the rain is coming down

Lost my way into you
And I don't know what else to do
But wait for a calm in the storm
Hoping it subsides
And nothing is wrong when it rains 
Even from my eyes

Broke your vision of love
As I saw through the sky above
And heaven was windy with change
Blowing through my time
And nothing is wrong when it rains
Even from my eyes

I wait for a calm in the storm
Hoping it subsides
And nothing is wrong when it rains
Even from my eyes

Yes I do
Believe the rain
And yes I do
Deceive it when I can
If I was running and I fell
If it's subsiding I can't tell
Looking at nature through a hole in the clouds

As you take a final bow
The earth creates
A dark and stormy now
But you must answer if it calls
Under the sky and when it falls
Looking at nature through a hole in clouds

Yes
I can explain
Anyone's pain
If It isn't mine to know
Yes
I feel it too
No
No I'm not you
Is that the way you feel

When the first light closes the night
And you feel unusually right

As sun streams it all around
Filling you up with desire

But I love you only to find
I can't have your heart inside mine
On the outside you run away
Having your day in sun

And you won't realize
'Til after it's done
You're back where your dreams began

Before I became who I am
And before you were ever like this
Even though you came to me
Everything but what I see
Having my day in the sun

And will I find myself
After it's done
Suddenly realize
I'm back where my dreams began

I'm on my own
I'm on my own
Sun is gone and I'm on my own in a thunderstorm
Sun is gone and I'm on my own in a thunderstorm
Deep inside I am tired of running
I don't mind that the rain is coming
Deep inside I am tired of running
I don't mind that the rain is coming down
