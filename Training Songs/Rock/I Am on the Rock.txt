I am on the Rock
Words and music by Bob Hartman and John Elefante
Matthew 7:24-27, Matthew 16:18

The earth is shakin?
It?s like a bad dream
This world is crumblin?
Comin? apart at the seam but
I am on the Rock
I am on the Rock

Everywhere I?m turning it?s only bad news
This bomb is tickin? and we?re getting to the end of the 
Fuse but
I am on the Rock
I am on the Rock

CHORUS
I am on the Rock, the sure foundation
I am on the Rock, on the Rock
I am on the Rock, His revelation
I am on the Rock
Though the winds may blow
And though the floods may grow
I shall not be moved, ?cause I am on the Rock

The storms approaching, I?m standing high and dry
Firmly planted on the Rock that is higher than I
I am on the Rock
I am on the Rock

Kingdoms failing, they fall around me
Plans eroded, and washing away to the sea but
I am on the Rock
I am on the Rock

Chorus

There is no in this world but our God

Chorus.
