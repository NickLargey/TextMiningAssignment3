Well, I can stand beside ideas I think are right
And I can stand beside the idea to stand and fight
I do believe there's a dream for everyone
This is our country

There's room enough here for science to live
And there's room enough here for religion to forgive
And try to understand other people of this land
This is our country

From the east coast to the west coast
Down the Dixie Highway
Back home
This is our country

And poverty could be just another ugly thing
And bigotry would be seen only as obscene
And the ones that run this land
Help the poor and common man
This is our country

From the east coast to the west coast
Down the Dixie Highway
Back home
This is our country

The dream is still alive
Some day it will come true
And this country
It belongs to folks like me and you
So let the voice of freedom
Sing out through this land
This is our country

From the east coast to the west coast
Down the Dixie Highway
Back home
This is our country

From the east coast to the west coast
Down the Dixie Highway
Back home
This is our country
