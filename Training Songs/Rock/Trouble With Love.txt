You've got a fever in the soul, nowhere to go
Cheap and ???
Nothing to show, 
Dressed to kill.
That's the trouble with love

Crocodile tears on a strangers shoulder, 
You've guessed his age but he thinks you're older.
Living on instinct.
That's the trouble with love.

Trouble with love, getting out of hand, trouble with love, dancing in no mans land, I'll take my chance...Taking my chance

In an up/down world it can make you push and shove, whoa oooh, that's the trouble with love. 

It's a message waiting from a distant planet, 
All night parties are the latest trend.
Missing in action, 
That's the trouble with love.

An overnight bag with a weekend pass,
Tea and toast with a touch of class.
Mission accomplished,
That's the trouble with love

Trouble with love, getting out of hand, trouble with love, dancing in no mans land, I'll take my chance...Taking my chance

In an up/down world it can make you push and shove, whoa oooh, that's the trouble with love. 

Everybody tells you it's a crazy thing to do, 
But you wont ??? and hope that your good luck will see you through

Well you got dressed up and said some grace, 
Had a blank expression on your face,
Choosing the moment, 
That's the trouble with love.

Your whole life's just one endless fight
Beauty search for somthing right, 
Chain reaction, 
That's the trouble with love...

Trouble with love, getting out of hand, trouble with love, dancing in no mans land, I'll take my chance...Taking my chance

In an up/down world it can make you push and shove, whoa oooh, that's the trouble with love. 

That's the trouble with love, I need to tell you baby, That's the trouble with love....
