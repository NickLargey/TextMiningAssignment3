Baby, I get sick and tired of hearing you
Talking 'bout the things you never get to do
You say that nothin's really wrong, it's just that nothin's right
You're on automatic pilot nearly every night

No, I don't want to hear no more
Why don't you do something about it
No, if you can't live with it
Let's see if you can live without it

Laura, come with me
Take me by the hand and run with me
Laura, come with me
And we can have a big-time love affair

Baby, I'm well aware of how it feels
To give it too much gas and only spin your wheels
Cause baby I get bored and lonely too
Now all I want to do is run away with you

No, I don't want to hear no more
Why don't you do something about it
No, if you can't live with it
Let's see if you can live without it

Laura come with me
Take me by the hand and run with me
Laura come with me
And we can have a big-time love affair
