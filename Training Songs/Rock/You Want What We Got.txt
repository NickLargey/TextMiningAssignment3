CHORUS:

I know what you want
You want what we got
I know what you want
You want what we got

Sometimes you drive me mad with the things you say and do
You act like we're so bad, well, I got a message for you
You don't fool anyone with your jealousy
You want it all and give us none, that ain't the way it's gonna be

REPEAT CHORUS

Checkmate we named your tune, don't give me your alibies
We burst your red balloon, maybe now you realize
When you laugh and put us down, you're tryin' to cover up your fears
Just like a circus clown, it's just a mask, just a mask to hide your tears

REPEAT CHORUS:

You want it, we got it
We got it, you don't
You want it, we got it
We got it, you won't
You want it, we got it
We got it, you don't
You want it, we got it
We got it, you won't

Solo - Jay Jay

REPEAT CHORUS (twice)

I know what you want (you want it)
You want what we got (we got it)
I know what you want (you want it)
You want what we got
I know what you want (I know what I got)
You want what we got (I got what they got)
I know what you want (we want what I got)
You want what we got (they want what we got)
