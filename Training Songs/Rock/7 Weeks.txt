GO!
So you're still the same
There's nothin' left in me
Do you really think that we can save this now
Get off your feet and really do something
Do you really think it matters anyway

{Chorus}:
You said that we were fine, lying all this time You're the thorn that's in my side 
Seven weeks go by, it's so hard to say goodbye Take your thorn

Take your pills so you can feel more of this 
And more of me, don't slam that door in my face Do you really think it matters 
Do you really think it matters anyway

{Chorus}
{2x}
My side, my side, take your thorn out of my side

{Chorus}
GO!
