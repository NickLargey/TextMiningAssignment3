Stay close, the water is rising
Silent cries
The shadows surround us

So we crawl out from under
The water, out of darkness
(We're almost home, no sleep, no, girl)

Look around, don't stare
Into the light too long
(There's nothing here to see
(Ain't seen nothing)

Frozen hands on the window
Crying out in your sleep

Look away now, look away now
(I never said that you were falling to pieces)
(I know the thought that
(We would never get out of this)

Now the time that falls into the cracks
(There's nothing here to see
(Nothing here to see)

So we crawl out from under
The water

And we crawl out from under
The water out of darkness
