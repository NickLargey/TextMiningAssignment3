Waltz into my arms
Let the music swell
These troubled times aren't here to stay

The world's a looking-glass
Let's find a place to be
Let the madness come and go

True love, true love, true love is ordinary,
New love, new love is what we have

Dash into my heart
Watch the sky go clear
Like childhood dreams now we can fly

The drum beats perfect time
Your heart beats into mine
Let the hard times pass us by

True love, true love, true love is ordinary,
New love, new love is what we have

A brave new world
I'll show you a day that never dies
New, new words I'll tell you
Look into my eyes

We will wander always
Places call us softly
Take me by the hand and run

True love, true love, true love is ordinary,
New love, new love is what we have.
