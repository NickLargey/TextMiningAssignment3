Won't you visit my town?
Ain't too far, you just go eight miles underground
And take The Diamond Mine straight to my street.
Everybody you know
Is dying to meet you ('cause they all told me so!)
And Tojo booked you HoJo's bridal suite.

Light a candle with a star,
Turn around, and there you are.
On my street you can drive no car.

Anybody could see
The Flying Doctor's been barking up the wrong tree,
Cecil B. De Mille lives on my street.
C.Y. O'Connor's feeling depressed
And Gypsy Rose Lee is always under-dressed,
While Liberace is playing with his feet

Fly Sinatra to the moon
You'll be back by afternoon
On my street you can call the tune

You're on my street.
