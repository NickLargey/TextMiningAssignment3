I see the look in her eyes
She was a fast talking woman with a master disguise
And she wore fake Gucci shades blowing rings with her smoke
And if you didn't know better, she'd let you know

Singing something about, everybody get drunk drunk
Yeah baby lets f*ck f*ck
Grab control to a major time and here comes the story so sing along yo
Grab control to a major time and here comes the story so she was singing bout

Starships and apocalypse, drifting to the great abyss
And hide, from tomorrow cause she just had tonight
She was singing about
Oh no, please don't go
Last call so lose control
Take my hand, off we go to
La la land

She gets me out of my head
And she's the only kind of woman that makes me understand
When I'm talking about, everybody get drunk drunk
Yeah baby lets f*ck f*ck
Grab control to a major time and here comes the story so sing along yo
Grab control to a major time and here comes the story so she was singing bout
