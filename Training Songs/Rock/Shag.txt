South Carolina down in Myrtle Beach; 
Dance to the music, twistin' to the beat. 
Shimmy shimmy shake it shimmy shakin coco pop 
Turn me on baby and don't stop. 
You make me want to shag you, baby; 
You know I want to shag you, baby; 
I gotta shag you, baby... 
You make me want to shag you, baby. 
Turn on the lights, I got to see ya comin' 
Turn on the key and get your motor hummin' 
I been smokin' lightening, make me hear the thunder, 
I feel your body tightenin' from under. 
You make me want to shag you, baby; 
You know I want to shag you, baby; 
I gotta shag you, baby... 
You make me want to shag you, baby. 
Shag you baby, you know I  want to shag you, honey; 
You make me wanna...I gotta shag you, baby. 
Turn on the lights, I got to see ya comin' 
Turn on the key and get your motor hummin' 
I like smokin' lightening, make me hear the thunder, 
I feel your body tightenin' from under. 
You make me want to shag you, baby;
