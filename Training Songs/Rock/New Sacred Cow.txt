Living in the blur of "id" 
Between the ego and the guilt 
Everyone is hiding something ugly 
I cant say that they're alone in it 

[Chorus]
The black cloud chases like satellites overhead 
I don't 
I don't have the patience to watch you looking down on me 
I wont 
I don't need a reason to feel love from anyone here 
Where your only love is yourself. 
Your only love is yourself. 

Crucify yourself for them 
Does it make you feel any better? 
Religion as the crutch 
All warped and delirious 
And I swear I cant take it anymore 

[Chorus]

And you'll crash, you'll burn, 
And you'll wreck and you'll earn the right to lose your mind 
When you rush, you will rage, and you war 
Just to make it right again 

[Chorus]
