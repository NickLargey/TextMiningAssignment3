There's a girl back home I use to know
She cried her self to sleep every night
We all knew
We all knew
Only girl who would ever compromise
Strike a deal with the devil to save a night
We all knew
We all knew
She tried to call me a month ago
To sing me a song that she just wrote
But I wasn't home
I should've know
That time had taken it toll
She had no place to go
They found her body resting by the river
Oh I never said good bye
I wish I would have tried
I couldn't hear her cries
As she filled her veins with lies
Until she saw the light

I remember we would hide behind the trees
Smoking cigarettes until our throats would bleed
Those were the days
Those were the days
Yeah
Never scared
Never worried that the summer would end
Invincible to every sharp end
We drove so fast
Thought it would last
But time had taken it toll
She had no place to go
They found her body resting by the river
Oh I never said good bye
I wish I would have tried
I couldn't hear her cries
As she filled her veins with lies
Until she saw the light
Madeline
Madeline
You will be remembered
Madeline
Madeline
We still have September
Madeline
Madeline
We'll see you on the other side
Die
If I could could turn back time
I'd find a way to remind you
That some how you could try to give in and fight the good fight
Oh you didn't have to die
You filled your veins with lies
My precious Madeline
