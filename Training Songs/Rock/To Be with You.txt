Forty days and forty nights
Pink and yellow neon lights
The skyline here is such a lovely sight
As far as I can see
How can time move so slow
Another flight, here I go
And diamonds dance on water down below
It never seems to end
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
And I can't wait to see your face again

So I walk these empty streets
To be with you, to be with you
'Til I find a place where I am free
To be with you, to be with you

Walking through these iron gates
I have learned to love this place
But nothing seems to fill this empty space
Here inside of me
And I'm standing here along
Left my heart when I left home
God, I wish that you were here with me

So I walk these empty streets
To be with you, to be with you
'Til I find a place where I am free
To be with you, to be with you

Even though I can't be where you are
You're always in my heart

So I walk these empty streets
To be with you, to be with you
'Til I find a place where I am free
To be with you, to be with you
