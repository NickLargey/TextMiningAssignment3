I've been down 
Now I'm blessed 
I felt a revelation comin' around 
I guess it's right 
It's so amazing 
Every time I see you, I'm alive 
You're all I've got 
You lift me up 
The sun and the moonlight 
All my dreams are in your eyes 

I want to be inside your heaven 
Take me to the place you cry from 
Where the storm blows you away 
I want to be the one to hold you 
Every bit of air you're breathing in 
A soothing wind 
I want to be inside your heaven 

When minutes turn to days and years 
If mountains form I'll still be here 
Holding you until the day I die 

I want to be inside your heaven 
Take me to the place you cry from 
Where the storm blows you away 
I want to be inside your heaven 
Take me to the place you cry from 
Where the storm blows you away 
I want to be the one to hold you 
Every bit of air you're breathing in 
A soothing wind 
I want to be inside your heaven 

Oh yes I do 
I want to be inside your heaven
