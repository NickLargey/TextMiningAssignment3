Grievin’ as natural as breathin’
He’s lovin’ and he’s leavin’
Watch him go let him go

Need him but you’re never gonna keep him
You should get used to this feeling
Watch him go let him go

Does anyone love anyone anymore
Does anyone love anyone anymore
Take what they want, take it and run out the door

He gets further away (stop thief somebody hey)
Yeah yeah (he just stole her heart and he’s gettin’ away)
With every step that you take (call up the romance police)
Yeah yeah (he’s got deep blue eyes, he’s disturbing the peace)

Changin’ he’s been actin’ strange
He talks but what’s he saying
Heaven knows let him go

Cheatin’ and you’re never gonna beat him
Just shake him like a demon
Make him go watch him go oh

Does anyone love anyone anymore
Does anyone love anyone anymore
Take what they want, take it and run out the door oh

He gets further away (stop thief somebody hey)
Yeah yeah (he just stole her heart and he’s gettin’ away)
With every step that you take (call up the romance police)
Yeah yeah (he’s got deep blue eyes, he’s disturbing the peace)
He gets further away (watch out cause everyone knows)
Oh ooh oh ooh oh (he’s beauty with pain, a thorn and a rose)
With every step that you take (seek help immediately)
With every step that you take (he’s walking off so casually)

Does anyone love anyone anymore
Does anyone love anyone anymore
Take what they want, take it and run out the door

He gets further away (stop thief somebody hey)
Yeah yeah (he just stole her heart and he’s gettin’ away)
With every step that you take (call up the romance police)
Yeah yeah (he’s got deep blue eyes, he’s disturbing the peace)
He gets further away (watch out cause everyone knows)
Oh ooh oh ooh oh (he’s beauty with pain, a thorn and a rose)
With every step that you take (seek help immediately)
With every step that you take (he’s walking off so casually)
