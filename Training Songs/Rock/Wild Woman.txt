I knew a feral girl, once upon a time
She grew into a werewolf, that monster was all mine
She was incarcerated, to the inside of my skin
And then I sat and waited, for my nice life to begin

But th-th-there's a wild woman
Livin' inside of me
A wicked, wicked wild woman
Dyin' to be free

I tried and tried to tame her, but she fought me tooth and nail
I couldn't even train her, so I held onto her tail
I never should have fed her, didn't know how much she'd grow
I cannot keep her in Kirk
And I think she's gonna blow

Th-th-there's a wild woman
Livin' inside of me
A wicked, wicked wild woman
Dyin' to be free

Just a little bit of danger, and I break out in a sweat
I'm trying to contain her, but she's slippin' through the net

Th-th-there's a wild woman
Livin' inside of me
A wicked, wicked wild woman
Dyin' to be free
Th-th-there's a wild woman (yeah yeah)
Livin' inside of me
A wicked, wicked wild woman
Dyin' to be free
