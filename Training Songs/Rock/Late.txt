My oh my it's a quarter to eight
Don't shoot me down dreamboat I'm a late date
Don't ask me no questions I ain't got a smooth line,
Please a' wait a little longer tryin' to make it there on time
Tickety tock, oh the clock don't stop
Lazy, dizzy, daisy it's a quarter to whoops, uh, oh
Doin' nothing honey just a' thinkin' of you
So don't you give me no suggestions
While I ain't got the time
Won't ya move a little closer 
And a kiss  me one more time
Tickety tock, oh the clock don't stop
It doesn't matter cause
I know that you would love me too
But I was late, late, late
