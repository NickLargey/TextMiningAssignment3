I know she's riding for a fall
She's a death-trap when used in war
How can you tell the beginning from the end?
There's something in her eyes
She can't pretend

[Chorus]
I promised myself that I
Would try to make you stay
But we play a losing game
I know when the time has come
Cause the numbers going bad
And I don't believe that you care

You hold a pistol to my head
?cause if I can't live
You want me dead
So many people
Floating with a dream
But tell me do they know
What it means to believe

[Chorus]

I've got nothing more to say
Where's that ace to play?
Our music is better
But it can't last forever
But if we play something else
Something without grace
I don't like to explain
It will take away the pain

[Chorus]
