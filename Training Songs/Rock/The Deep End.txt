And don't tell me, I'm afraid of waking up alone
When it's waking up to find you've gone
Why don't you make it clear?
I had my chances, only one way left to go
So I'll follow it down

She goes straight, straight for the deep end
Doesn't hesitate to dive right in
Be careful now, be careful now

So she's traded my love for comfort, gives it all away
So much for that happy ending, now you make it clear
You've got your options, only one way left to go
So I'll follow it down

She can't hold her own
Who would have known she is misery's company
She's got no place to go, no place to call home
She's got misery's company

She goes straight, straight for the deep end
Doesn't hesitate to dive right in
Be careful now, be careful now
Be careful, be careful now

She only comes to me in my dreams
So sleep becomes routine
It's not healthy, it's what makes you right
It's not healthy, it's what makes you

She only come to me in my dreams
So sleep becomes addicting
It's not healthy, it's what makes you right
It's not healthy, it's what makes you

Hold her strings to haunt my dreams
It's not healthy, it's what make you right
It's not healthy, it's what makes you

She goes straight, straight for the deep end
Doesn't hesitate to dive right in
She goes straight, straight for the deep end
Doesn't hesitate to dive right in
Be careful now, be careful now, be careful
