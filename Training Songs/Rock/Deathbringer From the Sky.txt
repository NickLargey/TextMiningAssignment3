High above the ground beyond the thunderclouds
A black shade is flying alone once so feared among men
Now the legend is becoming too old
But finally the horrifying truth is about to unfold

Death bringer from the sky, hunting victims in the night
Feel the terror as flames are burning bright
There is and no tower as high or cave so deep
That can save you from its endless spite
So bow down and face your wretched destiny

A den filled with treasures and gold
No longer calms his spirit so cold
Again it's time to spread the wings of doom
A growl shakes the ground

Flames blind men and smoke covers the stars
As he rises towards an ancient sky
The era of total chaos will arrive, men shall flee in fear
My name will haunt their mortal souls

I'll burn their flesh and I'll crush their bones
Your screams can't make me feel pity or regret
I only feel furious hatred with fire my domination is gained
Shall burn away and let my kind rule the world again
