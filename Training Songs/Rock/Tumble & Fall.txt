All this for nothing,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Praying and hoping,
Fooling yourself,
You know that you can give love a reason,
Give love a chance,

We tumble and fall,
Together we crawl,
Forever will be..
Tumble and fall.

Heaven's above us..
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Living in solace,
I give you it all, just for a day,
Just for a second,
Just for the way,

We tumble and fall,
Together we crawl,
Forever will be..
Tumble and fall.

Lifes not the same,
Since that day you went away, I recall,
Like the drops of summer rain that fell on me,
Come back to me,
Come back to me,

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

We tumble and fall,
Together we crawl,
Forever will be..
Tumble and fall.

Together we crawl,
Forever will be..
Tumble and fall.

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
