Ten out of ten for a race already run
Bleeding the world cause they can't figure out what's wrong
So come back down from your daydream high
Lost for words when you sympathize
There's a million ways to believe you tried
Well I'm unsatisfied

Unsatisfied

Just sick and tired of all I've tried
Unsatisfied

So long since someone lit up your life
So long since you heard from the world outside
Tell yourself its a part of the plan
Knock you low to find out where you stand
There's a million ways to believe you can
Well I'm unsatisfied

Unsatisfied

Just sick and tired of all I've tried
Unsatisfied

You should look where you're going
Or where you're gonna hide
You should be feeling something
Of another life

Unsatisfied 
Unsatisfied
Unsatisfied

So why'd you want to hide
Every little lie
Keeps it inside
Unsatisfied
