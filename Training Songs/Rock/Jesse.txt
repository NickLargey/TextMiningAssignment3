To save her from the beast
To save her from herself
And all the troubles
She imagines
In the world
Oh Jesse

You can do magic
You can do magic
You can do magic
It's a pleasure
How you stole her heart

They sail off to the Sun
He makes romance
The story always stops the same way
A happy end
Oh Jesse
Jesse

You can do magic
You can do magic
You can do magic
It's a pleasure
How you stole her heart

So strong and handsome
Like a raging river you tantalize
You sparkle

You can do magic
You can do magic
You can do magic
It's a pleasure
How you stole her heart

The only one she trusts
The only man
She runs her fingers down the index
And there she stops
At hero
Jesse

You can do magic
You can do magic
You can do magic
It's a pleasure
How you stole her heart
