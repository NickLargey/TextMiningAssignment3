I was catching up with my baby
When I saw you coming down the road
I thought mercy mama
Don't let him get me
I got a happy life at home

But as sure, as sure is you passed me
Of course I had to look
And as I turned my head I knew right then
I was gonna have to do it again

And I was singing
Mercy, mercy mama
Don't you dare let it get me
I love the one I love
And if I stray it's gonna hurt

I was drinking beer with a close friend
When I saw you walking in the room, I thought
Mercy me I can't keep a running
You're gonna get me, oh

As wrong as this is you touched me
Of course you had me hooked
And as I kissed your lips I knew right then
I was gonna have to do it again

And I was singing
Mercy, mercy mama
Don't you dare let it get me
I love the one I love
And if I stray it's gonna hurt

I was singing
Mercy, mercy mama
Don't you dare let it get me
I love the one I love
And if I stray it's gonna hurt

I was sitting down with my sweetheart
Making out I was sincere I thought
Mercy me I can't keep a lying
I got to get the air clear

As long as you stay with me
Forget the whole affair
I promise you I'll be true
I'm never gonna do it again

And I was singing
Mercy, mercy mama
Don't you dare let it get me
I love the one I love
And if I stray it's gonna hurt

I was singing
Mercy, mercy mama
Don't you dare let it get me
I love the one I love
And if I stray it's gonna hurt

Singing, mercy, mercy mama
Don't you dare let it get me
I love the one I love
And if I stray it's gonna hurt

Singing, mercy, mercy mama
Don't you dare let it get me
I love the one I love
And if I stray it's gonna hurt
