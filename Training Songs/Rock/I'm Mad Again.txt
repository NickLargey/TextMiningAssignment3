I had a friend one time, at least I thought he was my friend
For he came to me, said "I ain't got no place to go"
I said "take it easy man, you can come home to my house,
I'll get you a pillow where you can rest your head"
Took him home with me, let him in my house,
Let him drive my Cadillac that I could not afford
When I found out he'd been messin' around with my baby

You know I'm mad like Al Capone (I'm burnin' up)
I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
Like Sonny Liston yeah (I'm burnin' up)
You know baby I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
Like Cassius Clay (I'm burnin' up)
You know I'm mad (I'm burnin' up) you know I'm mad
Yeah baby, alright baby (I'm burnin' up)
I'm mad, come on (I'm burnin' up)

Took him home with me, introduced him to my baby,
He began to talk to her, made her think the moon was blue
You know I think I ought to tell you daddy
I'm mad, I said I'm mad with you
I don't know what I'm gonna do to you
I might drown you, I might shoot you
I just don't know because I'm mad

I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
You know I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
I don't have to tell you I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
I'm mad with you yeah (I'm burnin' up)
I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
Yeah yeah yeah (I'm burnin' up)
I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
You know I'm mad, oh baby I'm mad
Oh I said I'm mad, you know I'm mad, oh baby I'm mad
