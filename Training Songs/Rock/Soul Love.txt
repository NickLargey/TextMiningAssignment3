Demerara
Is that your name'
Did you put Georgetown's
White streets to shame'

Well I love you, baby
And I can't control
And in a StabrÃ¶ek market
I'll buy your body and soul

'Cause you give me that soul love
Baby, sure taste sweet
Just show me a man
That kind of loving wouldn't knock him
To his feet

Gimme that soul love
Baby, can't be beat
All you gotta do is call
To hear the patter of my bare feet

'Cause you gimme that soul love
Baby, can't you see
You got me cutting in a cane field
I'm working back some dignity

Well, you gimme that soul love
You get me banging on your coconut drum
I'm the shade of a monkey puzzle tree

Desdemona
Is that your name'
Did you put Venice
And her gods to shame

Well I love you, baby
And I can't control
And in the judge's courtroom
I'll buy your body and buy your soul

Slow like the river flows
It's slow, slow, like the still wheel turns
Slow like my lover's eyes to cry
Slow like the cane to burn
