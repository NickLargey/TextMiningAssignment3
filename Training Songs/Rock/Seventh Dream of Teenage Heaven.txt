Put all down to chemistry
Put it all down to the heat
The seminal spark of sexuality
Put it all down to the heat

There was magic in the air on a Saturday night
It was tragic, it's there on the street
The quicksilver and the warm jets
Make your leopard-skin dream complete

Intrigued by alcove whispers
So you tore off your osgood tie
Facination found in strangeness
And your sister's alien sigh
Your sister's alien sigh

Put all down to chemistry
Put it all down to the heat
The seminal spark of sexuality
Put it all down to the heat

To wake up sunday morning
With a rose and blue tatoo
So lay on the back of your skinny white hand
Suvonier of the brave and the new
Suvonier of the brave and the new

It's the seventh dream of teenage heaven
