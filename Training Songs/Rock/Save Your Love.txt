Go on out and gain the world 
But don't you lose your soul 
While you're trying 
Your truth is changing every day 
But your heart will let you 
Know when you're lying 
Well, you're running 
Running from me now 
Running like you've got a race to win 
Now you tell me our romance is over 
Time for you to start again 

[Chorus] 
Save your love and tenderness 
Don't get lost in bitterness 
Save the dreams you had when we started 
Do the things you have to do 
But don't forget the love we knew 
Don't lose your love cause we've parted 

You say you can't tell right from wrong 
Confusion's pulled the reins tight in your soul 
Tight in your soul 
Think it's all going to make sense 
That accomplishments are gonna make you whole 
Following 
Following confusion 
Running from someone who looks like me 
Stop and take a look inside you 
Now you tell me who it is you see 

[Chorus]
