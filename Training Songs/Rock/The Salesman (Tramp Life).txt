Loss assuming
Well see how you do
Make me an offer
No one can refuse
Just recognize me!
I know that you can
And you're looking thru me
Come on I act like a man
But I'm living like a dog (No nothing to see, nothing to keep, nowhere to be)
I'm living like a dog (No nothing to keep, nowhere to sleep, nothing to see)
I'm living like a dog

They're living alone
Let it die let it be
Are you feeling down on your luck?
I'll come down from the ceiling
Down to yr knees

Wherever you want
I'm living like a dog

Yeah leave it alone
Let it die let it be
Are you feeling down on yr luck?
Ill come down from yr ceiling
Drop down to yr knees
Do whatever you please
Just recognize the fact that Ill come bak
And leave it up to you
Just recognize me
Recognize me, recognize me, recognize me
Recognize me, recognize me, recognize me
Recognize me, recognize me!
Recognize me! Recognize me! Recognize me now
