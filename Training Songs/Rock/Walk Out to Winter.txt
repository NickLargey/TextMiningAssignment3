Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you, high and dry, you'll wonder why

Met in the summer and walked 'til the fall
And breathless we talked, it was tongues
Despite what they'll say, wasn't youth, we hit the truth

Faces of strummer that fell from the wall
But nothing is left where they hung
Sweet and bitter, they're what we found
So drink them down and

Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you, high and dry, you'll wonder why
Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chance is buried just below the blinding snow

You burn in the breadline and ribbons and all
So walk to winter, you won't be late, you always wait
This generation, the walk to the wall
But I'm not angry, get your gear, get out of here and

Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you, high and dry, you'll wonder why
Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chance is buried just below the blinding snow

Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you, high and dry, you'll wonder why
Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
You blind, snow blind, this is why, this is why
