So many times
I said that I love them
Looking over my shoulder at the door
So many times

I can't live without her
The wheel kept turning round
My feeling's changed
I went my own way

What can I say
To make you stay?
'Cause in my dreams
They smother all over me

And I'm trying to explain
So many arms
Reach from my memories
Pull all at once

I'm lost amongst
The folds in their skin
I did you wrong
But I'm sorry now

And I'll show you how
If you were here now
You couldn't change
you wouldn't understand

but I'm ready now I'm ready now
I'll make you proud I was your man
and sing a song
but it's so ugly now

and I'll show you how
'Cause I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now

I'm ready now
Hey I'm ready now
Can we start again?
so many times I said that I loved them

I'm ready now
but I'm ready now
Can we start again?
so many times

I can't live without her
The years was more than I could bear
It's turning round
But in my dreams Can we start again?

They smother all over me I'm ready now
And I'm trying to explain Can we start again?
So many arms reach from my memory
The wheels kept turning round
