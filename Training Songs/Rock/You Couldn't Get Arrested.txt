Were you 19 or 21,
A crazy outlaw living on the run
Your cowboy life we knows a lie 
You could'nt get arrested if you tried 

You were raised a rich boy now you live in your car
You give your money to dealers or spend it all in bars
Your criminal ways who can deny 
You couldn't get arrested if you tried 

You're an art-collector & a Russian spy
You run over animals never bat an eye
Your gamblin' days have all come up dry 
You could'nt get arrested if you tried 

Your manner with woman has always been cruel 
You're the clown prince of London a yankee fool
Your lover days have all run dry
You couldn't get arrested if you tried 

You're on the run now, how long can it last 
Someone with your reputation such a sordid past
Such a hard life don't make me cry
You could'nt get arrested if you tried 

I'm sure you'll blame others for where your at
Hell you been lucky...
