Baby boy
Dying under hot desert sun
Watch your colours run

did you believe the lie they told you
That christ would lead the way
And in a matter of days
Hand us victory

did you buy the bull they sold you
That the bullets and the bombs
And all the strong arms
Would bring home security

all eyes upon
Dry drunk emperor
Gold cross cross jock skull and bones
Mocking smile
He's been
Standing naked for a while
Get him gone, get him gone, get him gone
And bring all the thieves to trial

end their promise
End their dream
Watch it turn to steam
Rising to the nose of some cross legged god
Gog of magog
End times sort of thing
Oh unmentionable disgrace
Shield the children's faces
As all the monied apes
Display unimaginably poor taste
In a scramble for mastery

atta' boy get em with your gun
Till mr. mega ton
Tells us when we've won
Or
What we're gonna leave undone

all eyes upon
Dry drunk emperor
Gold cross jock skull and bones
Mocking smile
He's been
Naked for a while
Get him gone, get him gone, get him gone
And bring all his thieves to trial

what if all the fathers and the sons
Went marching with their guns
Drawn on washington
That would seal the deal
Show if it was real
This supposed freedom

what if all the bleeding hearts
Took it on themselves
To make a brand new start
Organs pumpin on their sleeves
Paint murals on the white house
Feed the leaders L.S.D
Grab your fife and drum
Grab yor gold baton
And let's meet on the lawn
Shut down this hypocrisy
