We are reminded every day of the way it will be, 
Will civilized lifestyle put an end to this we'll see, 
We got the dated book, we got the go 
You got the hated looks but I say so, 
We got the dated book but I say no. 

Hit and attack the new deals running dry, 
Who will believe you when you cannot say why? 
All on a world-scale, is it really so? 
But can I say no? 

This is a process to grow you know it could be a dream, 
Yeah, the happy consumption, super crappy, over-slappy they mean, 
We got the cargo-ships, we got the go 
You got the jargo-trips but I say so, 
We got the cargo-ships but I say no. 
What can I say?
