Johnny Walker leaves me black and red
And sick in the head
Cuervo Gold so I'm told
Will make you useless in bed
Gimme O.J. with my Stolichnaya
And the fires burn inside
Tanquerey gets me higher and higher
Don't like the Rock & Rye

Oh yeah need IntraVino
Oh yeah need IntraVino

Gimme wine, wine, I need IntraVino
Wine, wine, I need it every day-o
Wine, wine, Mis en bouteilles au Chateau
All the time, I need wine all the time.
Six o'clock gotta have Beaujolais
Eight o'clock I open up Pouilly-Fuiss?Love the ruby color. Grand cru classe
Never love another once I've savored that bouquet

Oh yeah need IntraVino
