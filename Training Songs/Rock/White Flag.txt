The battle rages on
As storms and tempests roar
We cannot win this fight
Inside our rebel hearts

We're laying down our weapons now

We raise our white flag
We surrender all to You, all for you
We raise our white flag: the war is over
Love has come, your love has won

Here on this holy ground
You made a way for peace
Laying your body down
You took our rightful place

This freedom song is marching on

We raise our white flag
We surrender all to you, all for you
We raise our white flag: the war is over
Love has come, your love has won

We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high

We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high

We raise our white flag
We surrender all to you, all for you
We raise our white flag: the war is over
Love has come, your love has won

We raise our white flag
We surrender all to you, all for you
We raise our white flag: the war is over
Love has come, your love has won

We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high

We lift your cross
We lift your cross
Passion, it's your time
It's your time
It's your time
Oh, for the glory of God
Oh, for the glory of God
