This ain't the new
It's the old generation
It's all real like a cheap imitation

Everything is good for me now
I don't want to work it all out
All I want to do is get my self home

Whoa! I'm the sick man of Europe
I'm the sick man sick man of Europe
Whoa! We ain't late for the British invasion
This ain't the last it's self-preservation

I don't want to work it all out
Everything is good for me now
All I want to do is get my self home

Yeah! I'm the sick man of Europe
I'm the sick man sick man of Europe
I'm the sick man of Europe
I'm the sick man sick man of Europe
