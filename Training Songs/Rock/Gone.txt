half a bottle of jack it hit me accross the back 
I said hey there mister well I feel like this is all wrong 
I asked him once again he just looked at me and grinned 
he said man I don't know where the hell we are 
too many nights at the bar can't find the keys to my car 
this night is growing grim and I just can't wait for the end 

Chorus 
cause we're all lost and gone o but I just wanna to go home 
twice on the highway I heard your song and it made me wanna go home 
cause I've been away too long but I just wanna go home 
Cause I am lost and gone but I, I just wanna go home 

Everything moves too fast I forget to stop and look at the past 
and I think I will try this thing yah I will try it one more time 
Maria sits across the bar sometimes she looks so far 
but I think to myself that I would like to stay a while 
wanting one more song surely it comes along 
She sits back a while just sits and enjoys my smile. 

I can't seem to get away three times we laughed today 
everybody wants to look away, they seem all kinds of scared 
well I fell down again I need a little help from my friends 
well I think that in the end we'll, we're going to be just fine 
we'll have just one more beer and then I swear we'll get out of here 
it's time for us all to go out and get lost
