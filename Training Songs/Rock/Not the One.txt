Lay you down, feel you up
Oh my Lord, oh
Built to spill, like your breath
Underneath my coast
I believe, I believe
I repent, oh
Take me back, take me in
Come for me, yours

'Cause I could be the one you want
The one you never have to like
If only for the night

Oh boy, I'm not the one
I'm not the one
I'm just the one you want for now
After all, the one you want
Never seems to come around
Cross your heart and let it slide
Straight into another life

Like a friend, once again
Just a hand you hold
I confess, I pretend
Never been quite sure

'Cause I could be the one you want
The one you never have to like
If only for the night

Oh boy, I'm not the one
I'm not the one
I'm just the one you want for now
After all, the one you want
Never seems to come around
Cross your heart and let it slide
Straight into another life
Oh, straight into another life
Straight into another life

Yeah, love can be deceiving
Waiting for a feeling
When there's no time, kiss the cure for living
But I still believe in
Believe in

I'm not the one
I'm not the one
I'm just the one you want for now
After all, the one you want
Never seems to come around
Cross your heart and let it slide
Straight into another life
Oh oh, straight into another life
Oh oh, straight into another life
Oh (oh, oh)
