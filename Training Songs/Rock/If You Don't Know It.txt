Makes no difference now what kind of life they hand me
I'll get along without you now that's plain to see
I don't care what happens next I'll get by somehow
And I don't worry cause it makes no difference now

It was just a year ago I first met you
I learned to love you and I thought you loved me too
That's all in the past I'll forget somehow
I don't worry cause it makes no difference now

Mhm now that we have really parted I can't believe we're through
I don't blame myself and I'm sure I can't blame you
There was something had to happen it happened somehow
I don't worry cause it makes no difference now
