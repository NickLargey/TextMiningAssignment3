I come from the land where the mullet attacks
Business up front
Party in the back
You gotta style in the south when you're stepping out
Put a gold tooth in your mouth
Lookin' good now
Your Tank top, your ball-cap, you think you're all that
But you're looking like Scott Stapp
You're just another redneck from back in the woods
Not a Kountry Gentleman that can bring the good 
(Tayo)

[Chorus]
My mama raised me in the durty south
A Kountry Gentleman
So you best watch you're mouth
My mama raised me in the durty south
A Kountry Gentleman
That is what it's all about
(x2)

IROC-Z, got an eagle on it
Rolling on some 12's
Don't you know I'm gonna flaunt it
Am I driving too fast for you now?
BACKFIRE!!
The muffler goes KA-PLOW!!

Now that I got your attention
Just let me mention that I'm pinchin' pennies
To buy some twenties. 
Cause I got plenties and manies, and moneys just to give to my friends
And that would certify me as a Kountry Gentleman....

Mama, what you got cookin' up in that kitchen?
Cookin' fried chicken?
You know I love that soul food
Everything you cook is so good
For a southern man like me
You gotta cook it up clean, cook it up mean
Mama don't like it when you got leftovers
Gimme me some of them collard greens

Got me some grub and I gotta go
Down to the Grocery store
Tailgate party at the PIG WIG
Jumpin' up and down in the back of a truck bed
Look at that kid tryin' to act all big
Trying to break-dance so break his leg
He ain't got what I got
Let's make it hot in this parking lot

[Chorus]
My mama raised me in the durty south
A Kountry Gentleman
So you best watch you're mouth
My mama raised me in the durty south
A Kountry Gentleman
That's what it's all about

[Breakdown]

The durty durty south [x3]

WATCH WHAT YOU SAY AROUND MY MAMA!
SHE RAISED ME IN THE DURTY SOUTH!!
I SAID WATCH WHAT YOU SAY AROUND MY MAMA!!
SHE RAISED ME IN THE DURTY SOUTH!! [x2]

[Chorus x2]
