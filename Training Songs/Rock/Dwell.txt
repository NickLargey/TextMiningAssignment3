I'm having trouble seeing through the haze I try and
Clear the fog away from my memory of those days I fought so hard
To make it through the rain it sickens me to look at you
All I see is pain I can't dare hold my stare I look at you
And all I remember how easy I lose how quick comes failure
I cry open up the sky now I look and don't know what to say
I look above with questions of long forgotten days
I can't forget past pain I felt the sun will shine and all of the
Ice will melt never again not this time never bring me down
With your hateful selfish lies I rip the blackness from the sky
And pray for light to fill my eyes
