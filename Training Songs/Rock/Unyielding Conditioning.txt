Unyielding Conditioning
Tune out from all that`s happening
Nobody deserves empathy
Nobody feels for me

We`ve all been trained by our worlds
I cannot see no one but me
No one can feel my emptiness
Everybody must fend for themselves
There is no openness

We`ve all been claimed by our worlds [X2]
But I have heard of ways
That say there`s light beyond the darkness
And everyone can keep their children warm
And togetherness will guide us safely
Through all Storms

Unyielding Conditioning
Remove all trace of memory
No one needs justice anymore
No voices raised in anger

We`ve all been tamed by our worlds [X2]
But I have heard of ways
Where people topple all injustice
No one lives their lives on bended knees
And all bigotry is like a disease
Drowned in the sea
And all can hold their head up high!
