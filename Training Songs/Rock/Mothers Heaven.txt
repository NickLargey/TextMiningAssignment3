Oh, can you heal me
Child I know you heal me

Embrace the wind
Hang your head no more
I feel like I'm falling
Like never before
Now open the sky
And let me in
Cause I want to feel
Feel the rain on my my skin

I want a heaven
A heaven of our own
All I want is a heaven
There is where we'll be alone

I held you to me
And felt my eyes grow dim
Took your hand
And felt the warmth from within
Unchain the storm
Then lose the way
Now paint the dark
A dew of silver grey

I want a heaven
A heaven of our own
All I want is a heaven
There is where we'll be alone

Heaven, oh
All I want is a heaven
There is where we'll be alone

Can you heal me
Child I know you can heal me
Reach and take the knife from the water now
Can you heal me
Child I know you can heal me
Reach and touch what I'm feeling

Cry for me now
