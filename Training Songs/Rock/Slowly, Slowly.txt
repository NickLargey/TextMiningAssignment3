I feel coarse and strain
Interrupt my mind again 
I am being clear
I am sad to say I'm living here 

I do it all the time
I do it all the time 

It tries to interrupt me
Interrupt my mind
In a quiet room you wait
In another room they fight 

They do it all the time
They do it all the time
They do it all the time
They do it all the time 

Single fear
Clearly defined I'm wasting time again
Slowly coarse and strain go
Counting fear again no 

Staring eye to eye
Then slowly me again
In another room they sit
Listening to other lies 

And do it all the time
And do it all the time
And do it all the time 

Single fear
Clearly defined I'm wasting time again
Slowly coarse and strain go
Counting fear again no 

Staring eye to eye
Then slowly me again 

Slowly, slowly 

Slowly me again X8
