Now you know that it's
All your fault
How are you doing with it?
Hey, are you nervous?
Everything that you've
Ever known
Will go up in flames
Tell me, are you nervous?

And the sky will fall
Down on you
And the world still turns
Round round round
And the sky will fall
Down on you
As your life goes on
Down down down

Everything that you've
Ever done
Will come back to haunt you
Tell me, are you nervous?
Now you know that it
Is for sure
How are you taking it?
Do you deserve this?

And the sky will fall
Down on you
And the world still turns
Round round round
And the sky will fall
Down on you
As your life goes on
Down down down

And the sky will, fall down
On you...

And the sky will fall
Down on you
And the world still turns
Round round round
And the sky will fall
Down on you
And your life goes on
Down down down

And the sky will fall
And the world still turns, round
And the sky will fall
And your life goes on
Down down down
