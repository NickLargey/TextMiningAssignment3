Why don't you write me, darling
Send me your letter
Tell me you love me, dear
Make me feel better

I love you
Yes, it's you I adore
(You I adore)

When I first met you, darling
I realized
And for you, dear
I did have eyes

Please, darling
Won't you send me a line
(Send me a line)

I miss you so each day
Although you're gone away
I guess I'll love you
More and more

And as the days go by
I sometimes often cry
To see your face

Counted my blessing
Read for us all
