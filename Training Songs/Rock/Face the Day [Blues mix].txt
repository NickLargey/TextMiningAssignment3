I don't want to face the day the day, today

Long nights leave me stranded
Black visions, danger signs
No love- I need protection
Feels like I'm on a production line
Daggers of dawn, cold hearted day
Why does if have to be morning?
Cover my head, stayin' in bed
Too late the luckless warning

Outside the screaming city
Red lights, hungry eyes
Sucks like a space invader
The vacuum of its lies
Stealin' my strength, stealin' my time
It's raining in a world of traders

Let me keep on sleeping
Forget that I'm alone
One day of faceless living-
is twenty-four hours too long
I don't want to face the day

Give me the night, it's more forgiving
Hold back the light from my eyes
Please stay invisible darkness
can't see the tears that I cry
I know it's comin', loaded with nothing
Trapped in a tunnel of time

I don't want to face the day
The day, today
