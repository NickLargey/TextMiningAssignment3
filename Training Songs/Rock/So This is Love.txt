Oh, yeah
Now check me out on the good side here

Well my baby's on the corner and she's looking so fine
Put one and one together and it blowed my mind
A man needs love to live, I'm the living proof
Catch that smile and I hit the roof

Big double take but ya keep on walking
Uh, I'm in love
Once over, I'm over done

So this is love?
Ooh, I need your loving, come on baby, take me home
So this is love?
Ooh I need your loving, I'm just skin and bone

Goin' outta my way, know my way around
The grass is never greener and there plenty around
All the other girls, they be put to shame
Over the edge and here I stay

Got me on pins and needles, and she knows
She's mine and
Ain't letting go

So this is love?
Ooh, I need your love, baby take me home
So this is love?
Ooh, I need your lovin', I know

Ow! Got me on pins and needles, yes she knows
She's mine and
Ain't letting go

So this is love?
Ooh, I need your love, wo, yeah
So this is love?
Ooh, I need your love

Ahh yeah! Baby, got to have your love
Ooh I, ooh I need, got to have that love
Baby, baby, waa, yeah, waa still love
So this is love?
So this is love?
Ow! Wow! Woo!
