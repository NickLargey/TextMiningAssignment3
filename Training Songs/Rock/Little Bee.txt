Little bee, little bee, she's the gal for me
Little bee, little bee, she's the gal for me
She's not so pretty but fine as she can be

She's forty two in the hip, thirty one in the bust
She's forty two in the hip, thirty one in the bust
She's got big fine legs and she knows how to strut her stuff 

Man she likes to ball and she likes to play
Man she likes to ball and she likes to play
I'll love that woman until Judgment Day
