My love for you is all but new
I'd give the rock to only you
It is the piece that can break through
The window of our love

My love for you is all but new
I'd give the rock to only you
It is the piece that can break through
The window of our love

My love for you is all but new
I'd give the rock to only you
It is the piece that can break through
The window of our love

Don't paint my picture
Sleeping on the ground
Come on, little sister
You know what you found
The heart beaten like a sinner
The sweat melting like a bad trip
The rock sits there dead

Don't hold me closer
It's all too sweet to last
Come on, fellow goner
The glory days have passed
The lungs crazy for your perfume
The tongue praying for renewal
The rock, no interest

Don't paint my picture
Sleeping on the ground
Come on, little sister
You know what you found
