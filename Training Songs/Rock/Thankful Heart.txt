I have a thankful heart that You have given me 
And it can only come from You 

There is no way to begin to tell you how I feel 
There are no words to express how you've become so real 
Jesus, You've given me so much I can't repay 
I have no offering 

There is no way to begin to tell you how I feel 
There's nothing more I can say, and now way to repay 
Your warming touch that melts my heart of stone 
Your steadfast love I'll never be alone 

I have a thankful heart that You have given me 
And it can only come from You 
I have a thankful heart words don't come easily 
But I am sure you can see my thankful heart 

Help me be a man of God 
A man who's after Your own heart 
Help me show my gratitude 
And keep in me a thankful heart
