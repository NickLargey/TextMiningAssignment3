You come around
To see your boyfriend
You come around 
To feel the pain
It was yesterday he tried to use you
But you still go through it

Again you took it away
Again you let yourself stay

I've been around
This lonely place
Lonely place before

You find out 
He's been lying to you
You find he had another girl
Still you never 
Stand up for yourself
You never stand up to him

He takes it away
Again you let yourself stay
Again you gave it to him
You said it's the last time 
He does it again

I've been around 
This lonely place
Lonely place before
You got a choice
To leave your place
Your lonely place behind
Be true to yourself
Now and let it go
It's better than you think
