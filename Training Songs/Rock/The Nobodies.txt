Today I am dirty
I want to be pretty
Tomorrow I'll know that I'm just dirt

Today I am dirty
I want to be pretty
Tomorrow I'll know that I'm just dirt

Feel the nobodies
Wanna be somebodies
We're dead
We know just who we are

Feel the nobodies
Wanna be somebodies
We're dead
We know just who we are

Yesterday I was dirty
Wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt

Wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt

Feel the nobodies
Wanna be somebodies
We're dead
We know just who we are

Feel the nobodies
Wanna be somebodies
We're dead
We know just who we are

Some children died the other day
We fed machines and then we prayed
Puked up and down in morbid faith
You should have seen the ratings that day
