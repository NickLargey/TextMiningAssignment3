My love is my rock in the long, low weary land, yeah
My love is my rock in the long, low weary land, in the weary land
My love is my rock in the long, low weary land

None of this moves me
I should be weeping but it only hurts when I yawn
I let it blow through me and it's gone

I'm dressed like a scarecrow
Stripped of all my powers as if some judge in judgement said
"Off with his great coat and his head"

Hey, my love is my rock in the long low weary land, yeah
My love is my rock in the long low weary land, my love is my rock
My love is my rock in the long low weary land

Meaningless movies
On the screen behind the band that's blowing, throwing shapes
Half of the music is on tape

My mentor and champion
Is busy tilting at the windmills of his stately home
The demon he's grappling is his own, oh

My love is my rock in the long low weary land
My love is my rock in the long low weary land
My love is my rock in the long low weary land
My love is my rock in the long low weary land

His letter lies open
His accusations flow like poison from his every word
My heart would be broken but for her

The fag end of winter
I'm in shock, I'm on the ropes, I don't know what's to come
She plucks the splinter from my thumb, hey

My love is my rock in the long low weary land, weary land
My love is my rock in the long low weary land, my love is my rock
My love is my rock in the long low weary land, in the weary land
Yes, my love is my rock in the long low weary land

In the weary land
In the weary land
In the weary land
