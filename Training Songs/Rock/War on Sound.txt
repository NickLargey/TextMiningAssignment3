Oh Sunday rest 
I'm a mess 
Put me in your arms
I called your home 
Heard the tone 
Just wanna be a part of
It could be wrong but I tried 
To tell you last night
I found it hard to explain 
I sleep and I can't talk

Don't say a word
My head ain't feeling right
Stay where you belong inside

Hey! It will be alright 
I just found myself in ways I couldn't help
It will be alright 
Just find a state where everything's passing by
I just found myself in ways I couldn't help

Sunday rest 
Still a mess 
Put me in your arms
See when she's down 
Girlie charm
Just wanna have a part of
I found it hard but I tried to tell you last night
The planet's grown turned to stone /see you on the safe side?

Don't say a word
My head ain't feeling right
Stay where you belong inside

Hey! It will be alright 
I just found myself in ways I couldn't help
It will be alright 
Just find a state where everything's passing by
I just found myself in ways I couldn't help
