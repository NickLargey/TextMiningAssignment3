After the storm there's the dead of night 
It seems there's no way back for me 
So little comfort in my lonely bed 
To know 
That it had to be 

And now I miss you in so many ways 
You know I miss you for so many 
Lonely days 
Oh
Why don't we try again 

In the dark there's a desert flower 
It blooms where no-one ever sees 
Our love was stronger than history 
Our love will never cease to be 
How can I live with you-as-a memory 
You hold 
The best part of me, oh 

And now I miss you in so many ways 
You know I miss you for so many 
Lonely days 
Oh
Why don't we try again 

No use in waiting by the telephone 
You're gone 
It ain't gonna ring 

And now I miss you in so many ways 
You know I miss you for so many 
Lonely, lonely days and nights 
I know you miss me for so many 
Lonely days 
Oh
Why don't we try again 
Oh
Why don't we try again
