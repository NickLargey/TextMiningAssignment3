We are the black sheep,
Dirty freak,
Red-headed step child

We are the born bad,
Turn it up and get wild,
We are the stones that keep rolling
We are the sweetest sin you welcome in,
Then leave before the morning

'Cause we are the crazy ones
The mavericks, the dreamers
The forgotten sons
We color outside the lines for fun
We are the crazy ones
Cause we are crazy ones
The badass, outcast
Son of a guns
We march to the beat of a different drum
We are the crazy ones
We are the crazy ones

We are the new school,
No rules,
Needle in the haystack
We are the outsiders,
All nighters
Scream if you’re a badass
We are the wheels that keep turning

We are the heartbreakers, risk takers
Anything but boring
'Cause we are the crazy ones
The mavericks, the dreamers
The forgotten sons
We color outside the lines for fun
We are the crazy ones
The badass, outcast
Son of a guns
We march to the beat of a different drum
We are the crazy ones
We are the crazy ones

We’re one-of-a-kind believe it,
So stand up and make 'em see it

We are the heartbreakers, risk takers
Anything but boring
'Cause we are the crazy ones
The mavericks, the dreamers
The forgotten sons
We color outside the lines for fun
We are the crazy ones
The badass, outcast
Son of a guns
We march to the beat of a different drum
We are the crazy ones
We are the crazy ones
