So you wanted 
To take a break 
Slow it down some and 
Have some space 
Well f*ck you too 
Give me my money back 
Give me my money back 
You bitch 
I want my money back 
(And don't forget to give 

Me back my black T-Shirt) 
Wish I hadn't bought you dinner 
Right before you dumped me 
On your front porch 
Give me my money back 
Give me my money back 
You bitch 
I want my money back 
And don't forget 
And don't forget
