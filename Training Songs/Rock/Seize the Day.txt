Don't know what it is, but I know that it 's somewhere inside of my head
Don't know what it looks like, only know that it is driving me mad
Whatever the cause, whatever the reason for it to be in me, maybe I'll be like this until eternity
I couldn't let go of it however hard I might have tried,
I couldn't get any control of it though I try to fight these thoughts in my head they're only driving me mad,
I never see the good, I only see the bad
I've gotta seize the day, so I can feel it!
I've gotta seize the day, so I'll feel it, I feel it, I'll feel it!

Don't know what I want, but I know that what I want is hard to get
Don't know what I have but I know what I would rather have instead,
Whenever I feel this way I hate myself 'cause I can't see,
Today is my day how happy I should be
I couldn't let go of it, however hard I might have tried,
I couldn't get any control of it though I try to fight
I'm locked up in my head, I think I'd rather be dead,
I never see the good, I only see the bad

I gotta know if this is real,
I gotta care for what I feel, 'cause what I am and who I'll be,
It's all my fault, it's up to me!
