Yeah, she's a kind of friend
She don't ask me where I'm goin'
She don't ask me where I've been
Well, she knows I can't be led
We live as two, and there's two souls bein' fed
She's a kickin' child
She hits a cold one-hundred, that little girl goes so wild

Goes so wild
Well, she don't walk no lines
She don't change to daylight savings time, no she don't
Oh, little girl's satisfied just to be till we say goodbye
Well, she's a kickin' child
She hits a cold one-hundred, that little girl goes so wild

Yeah, well you kind of women tryin' to get control of me
Trample me down like a wild ragweed
All that powder, perfume and paint
Makes me think you are what you ain't

My baby, she don't hop on me
She don't try to rule a fool, yeah, she just leaves me be
Oh, she does somethin' to my heart
Well she's a rollin' stone, tears me all apart
Well, she's a kickin' child
She hits a cold one-hundred, that little girl goes so wild
Whoa, goes so wild, goes so wild

Well, you kind of women tryin' to call your joy
By usin' your man for your whippin' boy
I'm gonna tell you babies, there'll come a day
You're gonna run up a bill your head can't pay

My baby, she don't hop on me
She knows I'm here, she just leaves me be
Does somethin' to my heart
Well, she's a rollin' stone when she tears me all apart
She's a kickin' child
She hits a cold one-hundred, the little girl that goes so wild
Goes so wild
Her smile
