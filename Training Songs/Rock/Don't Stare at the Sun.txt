Love just drifts us on, 
On our way, to the fields where we will play today. 
Louis brings his kite, 
With a homemade paper-chain. 
Strange to see the sight, 
Of the moon, in the daytime not the night. 
I will lift you up, 
So high, on my shoulders to the sky. 
Ah

Don't stare at the sun too long.
Don't stare at the sun too long.
Singing in the dark, 
On our way home, the day is done for sleepy ones. 
On the fire escape, 
My telescope, that scans the evening sky. 
If I could see it all, 
All to be lost, in the galaxy of distant stars. 
Did I see your face? 
It weighs so much, to be alone tonight. 
Ah

Don't stare at the sun too long. 
Don't stare at the sun too long. 
You scare everyone, 
If you stare at the sun. 
Don't stare at the sun too long. 

Don't stare at the sun too long
