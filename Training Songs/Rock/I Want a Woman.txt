C'mon baby
C'mon baby
C'mon baby
C'mon baby

Yeah!

Don't want to talk about it
And I don't want to hear what's for sale
Just move on baby
Time has got you by the tail
Your tail

You don't know what you got till it's already gone
And now this gone as you can get
I try to reason with you but there's no reason at all
While I'm banging my head up against a brick wall

I want a woman
Not some little girl
Who had to grow up
In daddy's big world
I want a woman
Who can really love me, yeah
Dead ringer of a woman

You think I'm like a truck
Even I ain't gonna walk on glass
Well no chance
I try to love ya baby
But sometimes you're just a pain in the ass

The problem with you is that I can't get through
And all this proves is I can get
I take you up north and then you want to go south
You're just leaving another bad taste in my mouth

I want a woman
Not some little girl
Who had to grow up
In daddy's big world
I want a woman
Who knows how to love me, yeah
Baby that's what I want

I want a woman
Not the teacher's pet
Who tried to grow up
But hasn't made it quite yet
I want a woman
Who makes me feel like nobody can

I want those legs
Groovy lips
(I want a woman)
With high heels
Shake those hips
(I want a woman)
Red dress
What a scene
(I want a woman)
C'mon baby
You'll be my wildest dreams, yeah!
(I want a woman)

I'm thinkin' now down the week so much
Think the chances that that woman's touch

I want a woman
Not some little girl
Who had to grow up
In daddy's big world
I want a woman
That knows how to love me, yeah
Baby that's what I want

I want a woman
Not the teacher's pet
Who tried to grow up
But hasn't made it quite yet
I want a woman
Who makes me feel like nobody can

I want those legs
Red dress
(I want a woman)
Groovy lips
Shake those hips
(I want a woman)
With high heels
C'mon baby
(I want a woman)
What a scene
You'll be my wildest dreams, yeah!
(I want a woman)
