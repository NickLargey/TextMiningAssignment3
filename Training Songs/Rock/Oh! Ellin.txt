Oh! Ellin what can I do

Oh! Ellin what can I do, there is nothing aside from you
Oh! Ellin what can I do, there is nothing aside from you

I hate to say I'm starting again to try
To Get you off of my mind
I must admit, it's so hard to do, oh Ellin, with no you by my side
I have the chance to land on my own two feet and, keep my chin off the ground
But now, your gone, I beat my self up about it, it sucks without you around, 
It sucks when your not around

Oh! Ellin what can I do, there is nothing aside from you
Oh! Ellin, what can I lose, there's nothing aside from you

Oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh, oh!!!

I trace your steps, but I get lost, i bet it's what you had in mind, 
And can't you see, that all is not well, 
Oh Ellin, not since you left me behind, 
I waste away, its miserable here, its stupid, to even try to pretend,
Cause when, you slip, my mind i start to panic, 
I'm scared to lose you again, I'm scared I'll lose you again

Oh! Ellin what can I do, there is nothing aside from you
Oh! Ellin what can I lose, there's nothing aside from you
Oh! Ellin what can I do, there is nothing aside from you
Oh! Ellin what can I lose, there's nothing aside, aside from you

Oh! Ellin what can I do, there is nothing aside from you
Oh! Ellin, what can I do, there's nothing aside from you
There is nothing aside from you
There's nothing aside from you

Oh! Ellin what can I do, there is nothing aside from you
