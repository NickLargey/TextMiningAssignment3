Caught up in something
You didn't wanna do
It's not your fault so I'll leave it up to you
I'm trying, You're buying
One thing left to say
That there must be a better way
Thought you were big and brave
Now it's the only thing you crave
You've blacked out your memory
Is there anything out there you can see
I'm trying, You're buying
One thing left to say
That there must be a better way
Know you need help but you won't admit it
Going to them might put in it
Trying to handle your addiction
It's in your blood it's an affliction
I'm trying, You're buying
One thing left to say
That there must be a better way
I'm trying, Your buying
One thing left to say
That there must be a better way
Cry to the world you wanna break out
