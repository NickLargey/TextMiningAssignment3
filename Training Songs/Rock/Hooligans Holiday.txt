Drop dead beauties 
Stompin' up a storm 
Lines of Hell on our face 
Bruised bad apples 
Crawling through the night 
Busted loose runaway 
Always always 
Thrill without a motive 
30 days just a haze 

(Chorus) 
Everybody wants a piece of the action 
Everybody wants a piece of the pie 
We're on a holiday hooligan's holiday 
I'm on a holiday hooligan's 
I gotta get away 
Hooligan's holiday 
We're on a holiday, hooligan's 

Cross-eyed derelict comin' 
An iron horse between our legs 
Tattoos and black manes flowin' 
Every day's a holidaze 

(Chorus) 
Modern times and new blood's pumpin' 
Only the strong survive 

(Chorus)
