White wash the whole world down
While I stand on peaceful ground with you
My faith entrusted in your soul
Sun sets on a rainy day
Well, good bad will come what may with me

And I want to give
And I
Oh well, we all must live
And I'll open up when everybody's laughing

So loud in decibels
I need the world to tell
I'd go with you on a road to nowhere
Sweet music in the back of my mind
I'm coming home this time to you
You make me feel good

And I want to give
And I
Oh well, we all must live
And I'll open up when everybody's laughing

And I want to give
And I
Oh well, we all must live
And I'll open up when everybody's laughing
