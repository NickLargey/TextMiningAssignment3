Fancy Dan, gamblin' man
Top hat of the peanut man
Talk about your pot of gold
With a silver lining

Tumblin' dice, hit it twice
The boats and the flushes
They sure look nice
On a pot of gold
With a silver lining
Stateline, give you a hard time
Don't you stay too long
Goodbye, pretty women I
Ain't stayin' on
Come on and

Get a bunch, bet a bunch
If you come to gamble,
Better pack a lunch
For a pot of gold
With a silver lining.

The less you bet, stayin' in
The more you lose even when you win
On a pot of gold
With a silver lining

If you don't know when to stop
Lady Luck she gonna see you're taught
That there ain't no pot of gold
And no silver lining

Easy money, come too fast
Come too quick turn a good man bad
On a pot of gold
With a silver lining.
