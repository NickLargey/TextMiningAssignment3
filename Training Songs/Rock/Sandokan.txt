Sandokan
Sandokan.
Warm and tender is the love
And people know the way to love
Cruel and bloody is the war
And people know how to make war
But the people can be unfair
And there's no one to help them there
I love my people
I love my land
And everybody seems to understand
All together
All together
Now together
Hand in hand let's go to the sun.

Make me warm and I'll fight every day
Every night every way

Make me warm and I'll fight every day

Love the woman
Love the man
And be a brother to your old friend

I love my people
I love my land
And everybody seems to understand
All together
All together
Now together
Hand in hand let's go to the sun.
