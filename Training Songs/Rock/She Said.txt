She said, "Why don't you come and stay with me
Far away from people we know?
We could live our lives together
Happiness wherever we go"
And I will always love her
And I will always care
And I will always love her

Wasn't long before she grew tired of me
And the life she thought would redeem
All the love she'd thrown away as a child
All the things she thought she had seen

And I will always love her
And I will always care
And I will always love her

And I will always love her
And I will always care
And I will always love her
