Unit three thousand twenty one is warming
Makes a humming sound, when its circuits
Duplicate emotions, and a sense of coldness detaches
As it tries to comfort your sadness,
One more robot learns to be something more than
A machine, when it tries the way it does, make it seem
Like it can love

Cause it's hard to say what's real, when you know the
Way you feel, is it wrong to think it's love
When it tries the way it does

Feeling a synthetic kind of love
Dreaming a sympathetic wish,
As the lights blink faster and brighter,
One more robot learns to be something more than
A machine, when it tries the way it does, make it seem
Like it can love

Cause it's hard to say what's real, when you know the
Way you feel, is it wrong to think it's love
When it tries the way it does
