Science has no soul
Science has no conscience
We are not fuel
We are not consequences
Unseen invisible ghost in a machine
No need for thought
Science is divine

We cannot lose control
We cannot play at God
We cannot play at God

We were chosen, thought we were good
But our job possessed us, and drank our blood
Science has no soul
Science has no conscience
We are not fuel
We are not consequences

Unseen ghost in a machine
No need for thought
Science is divine

Science is the hunter
Science is the beast
Impersonating angels
Short cut to hell

Unseen ghost in a machine
No need for thought
Science is divine
