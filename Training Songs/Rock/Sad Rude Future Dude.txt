Everybody wake up, welcome to the future
There's nothing going on here
It's just me and my personal computer
I don't love my family, I think they're boring
And when we get together
I'm so scared of talking to them about anything

I haven't had a friend in years, I only have sex with myself
I don't know where it went but all my love is gone
I haven't had a friend in years, I only have sex with myself
I don't know where it went but all my love is gone

Everybody wake up, welcome to the future
There's nothing going on here
It's just me and my personal computer
I don't love my girlfriend, I think she's boring
And when we get together
I'm so scared of talking to her about anything

I haven't had a friend in years, I only have sex with myself
I don't know where it went but all my love is gone
I haven't had a friend in years, I only have sex with myself
I don't know where it went but all my love is, all my love is, all my love is gone

Now, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
Gone!
