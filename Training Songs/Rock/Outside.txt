It's safe and it's warm inside this sanctuary
Where we come to worship, to witness and marry
But after we've gathered I have to confess
My soul feels a restlessness to take this remarkable light

[Chorus]
Outside where people are hurting
Suffering and searching for some place to hide
Inside God pulls us together from a world torn apart
To carry the love in our hearts, outside

It's time to leave self-centered thinking behind us
Expecting the whole world to seek out and find us
Jesus is making us people who care and if we will be willing to share
These graces can be multiplied

[Chorus]

Outside where people are hurting
Suffering and searching for some place to hide
Inside God pulls us together from a world torn apart
To carry this love in our hearts

Outside where people are hurting
Suffering and searching for some place to hide
Inside God pulls us together from a world torn apart
To carry this love in our hearts

Outside, outside
Let's all go outside
We got to take the love outside
Outside, outside, outside, outside
