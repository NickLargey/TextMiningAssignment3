She's been around me all the while
Try as I might, I can't forget her smile
In passing conversation, what did I hear her say?
Where did she come from? Who is that woman anyway?

What can I do to change her mind?
Maybe she thinks that I'm just not her kind
I think she wants me but she's trying to play hard to get
When she treats me this way, I wish we'd never met

Some information. Where did she come from?
Information, give me a lead
Some information

The lights go down, the music's loud
She's not around, I lost her in the crowd
I really want her, but she's just a mystery
What have I got to do to make her notice me?

If only I could find a way
What do I have to do to make her stay?
I've got to find her again and try to steal her heart
What I need is a lead, but I don't know where to start
