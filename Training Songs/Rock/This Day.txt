This'll take some time I know
I'm just going slow I know
You miss my friends more than you ever miss me
Me, me, me...

I'm if you could see
All the things I'm going through
It'll take a while, take a while...
Take a while with you

When you know I'm down
I'm in your town
You stay at home
You stay alone

I said I don't know how to live my life
The sun comes up in the morning and away tonight
And I've got the one, the only one I know

Na, na, na...
