In my heart there lives a little riddle
I’m always trying to find my way
Everything is older in the morning
I’ll find an answer someday

But I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But you know I’m alright
I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But the sunshine and bright
Don’t mess with me
I’m up for the fight

It’s a tangle cob web that I weave
The dusty room over naked mind
Anything that keeps the sun rising
I gotta see if I can find

But I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But you know I’m alright
I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But the future looks bright
Don’t mess with me
I’m up for the fight

Riding through like an outlaw drifter
Never knowing which way to turn
In the morning I think I got it
It’s gone

Pull the curtains open wide
Gotta know that I’m about it
Good god it’s never dead don’t never doubt it
Yo I’m alright, I’m feeling kinda fuzzy

In my heart there lives a little riddle
I’m always trying to find my way
I don’t know what it’s gonna take me
I only need a little break man
I know you know that I’m a good man

But I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But you know I’m alright
I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But the future looks bright
Don’t mess with me
