Can't run can't hide
No one here gets out alive
It don't get better that's the best you're gonna get
The deal is in now place your bets
Can't eat can't sleep
Knowing that nothing's gonna satisfy me
Another blip on a television screen
Among an ocean of stars

Tonight I will rage against the forces of fate
You best get outta my way
I'm not gonna fade away slowly 
I'm not gonna fade away slowly 

Inside my mind is a clock tick-tocking time
Not gonna stop until my last days done
You want to try me well come get some
Tempt fate can't wait
I gotta get out there's no time to hesitate
Not gonna waste it with the cynical fools
Can't bring me down
And if you want to try this disposition
Sacrifice all you knew
Sanitize your religion
Take your life and renew and do what you want to do
