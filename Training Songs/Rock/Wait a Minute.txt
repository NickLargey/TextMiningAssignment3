I tried to listen, I can't keep up
What was that you're saying, it was much too fast
You say they're born to lose and we live to win
And when all is said and done, all they do is sin
You say they're lazy and no good and they don't do the things they should
I see your mouth move and sound comes out,
But I can't hear you cause you're fading out
Oh I ain't here to try and spoil your fun and I ain't trying to be a cop
But my head is stuck in the guillotine and the blade is about to drop
Wait a minute now!

So B-B-B-B-Baby wait a minute now
If you want me to understand, cause this is getting out of hand
You say - "These kids they're all insane",
That "they got drugs instead of brains"
"They drink blood at night, yes they do, not every one of them, but a few"

But I ain't here to try and spoil your fun and I ain't trying to be a cop
But my head is stuck in the guillotine and the blade is about to drop
Wait a minute now!

My light's out but you don't stop, more wasted time it was all that I got
No need to worry, no need to fret, come on
You be good, you be gone, understood?
Well come on, wait a minute now!

So hold up you wise up, you wind up, you can't stop,
You don't stop and you won't stop, you won't stop, you don't stop,
You won't wait a minute now
