Leatherneck'n down the street like "Hey I'm joyrid'n" like a bad dog
Come on "Burn in!" X 2 demon got my soul and I said "Drive!" come on
Speed kills, but I'm alive yeah!
In my Durango 95 yeah!
Casino on the edge she move like a twister gravity crank
Solo my sista, come on
She said "Take me away" away away shout!
I'm deadly on the eyes an astro-spyder, baby
A powertripp'n, no - no - no - maybe, come on
Angel trumpets again yeah!
Motherfucker scream "Horrorshow"
Time a diamond ass right on my line come on
She said "Take me away" away away yeah!
Burning like fat in the fire the smell of red
Red groovie screamed mega-flow
A stalking ground without prey
A flash of superstition whimpering like a crippled animal
Dogs of the soul-crusher
Pulling closer like the blue steel jaws of hell
Digg'n in my heart I find a human generator
Duke of N.Y. see yeah! Eliminator all you need is love
Yeah! like a cool and crazy freak machineShe twanged off and out like I never seen
I gonna take her down, down, down watch out! Shack'n out in my skin
Flesh 'n' waves they begin
I going out like a holiday (shout it!)Then my mind generate a weepy young "D" to terminate
Takin' a trip I said, "Straight to hell" (shout it!)
Real country dark the street
Hog the road, swamp the beat
She gonna know just what I mean, yeah!Trip back on the serpent move z-man slowly bang the groove
Takin' a trip, "A real kick" to hell (shout it!)
Think'n that when she die, spirit go up to the sky
Devil come a stepp'n, brainiac a look'n below
Yeah! (shout it!)
