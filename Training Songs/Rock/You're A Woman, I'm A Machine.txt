Take what you want my head is full, take what you need, my price is good. 
You want it all, just like should. Your thoughts are pure, just like they should.
Be what you want, you want it all, I've seen it once, I've seen it all.

Now that it's over this weight is off my shoulder. 
Now that it's over this weight is off my shoulder.
Now that it's over I love you more and more.
Now that it's over I love you more and more.

Oh, I know that you, would take my hand, if that was true, give you a chance.
You want it all, just like you should.
My thoughts are pure, my thoughts are good.
Be what you want, you have it all, I've seen it once,we've seen it all.

Now that it's over this weight is off my shoulder. 
Now that it's over I love you more and more.
