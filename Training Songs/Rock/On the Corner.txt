From the feel the bottom
The on the corner
Look your lips desire
The layer the divider

All eyes with me
Will take your place
All rise with me
Will take your place

Spread your legs
ItÃ¢??s such a Ã¢?Â¦
Or hand some as you turn
Who to say

There is somebody else
Must have taken your place
Kiss your dead face
All ride with me

Will take your place
IÃ¢??ll ride alone
IÃ¢??ll take your place
Come tastes the party

Come on
Come waist the party
Come on
The body turn on

Baptize the body 
All eyes with me
Will take your place
All rise with me

Will take your place
As good as hell
Meet somebody else
