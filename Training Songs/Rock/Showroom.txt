Watch out! 
He's always up to something 
Cause he's so devious 
And he's so cynical 

And it makes me laugh 
He's trying so hard to pretend 
Acting oh so original 
When he's simply following the trends 

The book that you read, it is upside down 
The book that you read, it is upside down 
The book that you read, it is upside down 
The book that you read, it is upside down 

He's always saying that he's oh so right 
And won't admit when he's wrong 
But if I get him on his own tonight 
I'm gonna find it hard, cause we don't quite get along 

Too much 
Sitting in the window 
Sipping up your coffee 
And advertising yourself 

And it makes me laugh 
He's trying so hard to deceive 
Acting cool and cocky 
When there's clearly something up your sleeve 

The book that you read, it is upside down 
The book that you read, it is upside down 
The book that you read, it is upside down 
The book that you read, it is upside down 

He's always saying that he's oh so right 
And won't admit when he's wrong 
But if I get him on his own tonight 
I'm gonna find it hard, cause we don't quite get along 

Oh it's such a treacherous thing 
Little boy laugh and the little boys sing 
No when they come-a-calling 
You can't can't help falling over, no you can't help falling down 

It's evidential that you've not been taught 
Oh, you just can't see 
That respect is always earned not bought 
So we all bow down to this weeks class clown at the showroom 
Yeah, at the showroom
