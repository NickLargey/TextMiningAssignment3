Stars are wheeling in the sky,
I guard the last of my line,
Like a sleeping army I will wait.

So drum the devils out your dreams,
And send them all to meet me.
I will lay me down until you're safe.

So you'll have nothing to face, 
Close your eyes and wish 'em all,
Wish 'em all,
Wish 'em all, 
Wish 'em all away,
And everything will change.

Though the last of your defence,
Would crumble at the first test,
I will stop it all from happening.

Tomorrow you will rise and sing,
And never want for anything at all,
I will bring, I will bring.

Now you'll have nothing to face,
Close your eyes and wish 'em all,
Wish 'em all,
Wish 'em all, 
Wish 'em all away,
And everything will change.

Close your eyes and wish 'em all,
Wish 'em all,
Wish 'em all, 
Wish 'em all away.

Now if you look out you'll find,
Us standing in a line.
Just understand you're safe.
Understand that everything will change,
If you just wish 'em all,
Wish 'em all,
Wish 'em all, 
Wish 'em all away.

Everything will change,
Understand and wish 'em all
Wish 'em all,
Wish 'em all, 
Wish 'em all away.

Wish 'em all away.
Wish 'em all away.
Wish 'em all away.
Wish 'em all away.
