1,2,3,4 you know who's knocking at the door!
are you ready for a race ? Let’s hear a sigh of relief
time flies.... we are not ready to die
free your mind , be yourself and everything's fine
you know we can be late, we are the last rebels in this army
they say we are the new losers – but we’re falling honestly

They don't understand their own life
so please don't tell me who I am
cause I'm a rebel in this army
not the last one, I've got babies....

I can be late, things gonna change
I wanna do what I want… anywhere
I can be late, things gonna change
I wanna be what I want… anywhere

5,6,7,8, guess who’s knocking at the gate?
grab your stuff, get a move, don’t you dare make us wait!
time flies.... we are not ready to die	
free your mind, be yourself and everything's fine
you know, we can be late
emancipate yourself and feel the feeling
they say we are the new losers – but we’re living honestly

I can be late, things gonna change
I wanna do what I want… anywhere
I can be late , things gonna change
I wanna do what I want… anywhere
