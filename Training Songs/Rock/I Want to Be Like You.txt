When I'm down, You are up for me
When I frown, You have a smile for me
And when I'm weak, You are strong for me
You are there for me
You're always there for me

When I fall, You will catch me
When I call, You're quick to answer me
And when I weep, You will weep with me
You are there for me
You're always there for me

Chorus:
(And I want to be like You)
Take my cross and follow after You
(I want to be like You)
Speak the truth in everything I do
(I want to be like You)
Leave the many to go and find the few
(I want to be like You)
I want to be like You

When I thirst, You will quench me
When I hunger, You are the bread for me
When I kneel, you already heard me
You are there for me
You're always there for me

When I cried, You were there, You heard my call
When I fell, You were there, You saw it all
On my knees, You came and rescued me
And now in everything I say and do
I want to be just like you.
