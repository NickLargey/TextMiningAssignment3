That sweet little red-head's got her hooks in my back
She points her finger and she shows me what I lack
Her pale skin, it burns so hard in the midnight air
She paints the streets a shade of grey around my chair, so come on in

Her heartbreak on my skin and her scent on my fingers
Her taste is on my mind, it constantly lingers
'Til I can breathe her, 'til I can believe her
'Til I can breathe her, 'til I can leave her.

Every kiss is a little sickening
I can feel deaf fingers quickening
Tightening my passageways
If you can't count the years start counting down.

Try to remember that she hates you, 
And though she might elate you
She tries to kill the great that's in you now
She's hand picked the fate that awaits you, 
And despite her words
It's not too late

I wrote a goddamn love song to praise everything I hate
And the kids were wanting a chorus line and they sealed my picture's frame
She might run shit for right now, but I'll be damned if it's forever and always

As the chorus fades away like friends in high school hallways

Oh, I got this feeling that things will never ever ever be the same

"What about those rainy nights in London? 
What about the crippling desert heart?
What about all those times you swore you'd never leave me?"
"What about the hospital in LA?"
"You took me back after that night"
"What about that blackened image in my mind?"
"I swear I'll burn with a new light"
"What the frozen, dripping holiday bird that's cold?"

She's cold as ice
