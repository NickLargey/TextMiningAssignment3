The end of summer 
Finds us giving nothing
The end of summer
Finds us out so soon
The end of summer
Finds our hearts were bluffing
And pins us down with longing
Beneath the Harvest Moon
Around the fields the hedges darken
With displays of bitter fruit
The end of summer!
Oh summer!
Summer packs up her plump days
In her suitcase and drives away
Into distances and dreams

Knuckle down!

And we have spent all out green money
On a pair of golden shoes
And we walk with wounded armies
Singing painful autumn blues
Could you abandon all you've grown to love
Like there's nothing left to lose?
The end of summer!
Oh summer!
Summer, what can we do?
What can we say?
Except "Give it all away"?
Give it all away
Give it all away
Give it all away
