Moscow night life
You touched my heart
Got no Red Square connections
We're worlds apart

But if things were different
We could meet by the wall
But foreign relations
Are oh so cold

Young 'n' Russian
You're so young 'n' Russian
You're all so young 'n' Russian
You're so young 'n' Russian

In the shade of the Kremlin
My allegiance was sealed
I've changed my direction
Now the truth is revealed

The state will protect us
And the world can be ours
But foreign relations
Are oh so hard

Young 'n' Russian
You're so young 'n' Russian
You're all so young 'n' Russian
Oh, you're so young 'n' Russian

You're young 'n' Russian
In your furry hat
You're young 'n' Russian
Oh, baby, that's where it's at

Young 'n' Russian
You're so young 'n' Russian
You're all so young 'n' Russian
You're so young 'n' Russian

Young 'n' Russian
Young 'n' Russian
Young 'n' Russian
Young 'n' Russian
Young 'n' Russian
