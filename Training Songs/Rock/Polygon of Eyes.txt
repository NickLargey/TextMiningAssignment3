Dying tomorrow we stare at the sun
Summer of fame collapse in the fall
Rising and falling you're fighting with
Fear the ending is near
This enemy friend a truce in the night
I live on the mountain and dream of
The open sky
A time sent event horizon will leave our
Stories behind
Watching the frayed run for their lives
Bent by the silence erupting inside
Rising and falling you're fighting with
Fear the ending is near
Fighting religion to conquer the land
I live on the mountain and dream of
The open sky
A time sent event horizon will leave our
Stories behind
Now we live on the mountain and become
The open sky
A time sent event horizon will leave our
Stories behind
