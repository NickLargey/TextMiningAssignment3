(Bator/James)
Friends-Fiends-Foes-Fakers
Tonight you're gonna meet your maker
I bled for you an eternity
Show me your love won't'cha die for me?
Chorus
Making love like video nasty
I am the kiss of death
I love the pleasure and I love the pain
I am the kiss of death
Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum
I smell the blood of an Englishman
I wanna love ya' in the ultimate fashion
I'm only guilty of a crime of passion
Chorus
...c'mon an kiss me
I'm General Fuckin' Custer
I'm riding on a Trojan Horse
I'm gonna love ya'like Charles Manson
Show me your love won't'cha die for me?
Machine gun etiquette
Taste the kiss of death
A little crazy but I'm not insane
Taste the kiss of death
Chorus
Forgive me father, for I have sinned
Forgive me mother, for all my sins
You get the money, my gun's for hire
I'll kick your ass all the way to hell
This is the final curtain.......
