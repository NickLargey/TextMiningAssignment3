Faceless fall from this life and ah
If you can't see the stars
You've probably gone too far
Like the voice that cried
On the lonesome tide
Like the wave was
the only love it ever saw

"What's this dying for"?
Asks the Stork that soars
With the Owl high above
Canyons mighty walls
Owl said "Death's a door
That love walks through
In and out, in and out
Back and forth, back and forth"

Turn from the fear
Of the storms that might be
Oh let it free
That caged on fire thing
Oh hold its hands
It'll feel like lightening
Oh in your arms safe
From the storms
[Stork and Owl Lyrics On http://www.elyricsworld.com/ ]
Sky bends, the moon's dress's slung low,
slung low.
Dogstar taught a dance
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Arms out knees bend
The motion flows
Like the soft open petals
Of a Jessica Rose

So Sirius.
So it falls apart
It just reveals the perfect nothing.
Of everything you are
Of everything we are

Candle of life
Lights the blights and bruises
Oh lay it down
In the night
Let it soothe this
Oh hold its hands
And we'll know what truth is
Oh in its arms safe from the storms
