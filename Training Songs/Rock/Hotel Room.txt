If I came into your city
Hung up on a game
Would you give me your assistance
Though you didn't know my name

Though you didn't know my name
Though you didn't know my pain
Would you give me your assistance
Though you didn't know my name

I woke up in a hotel room
And felt the weather couldn't touch me
Had a dream at the heart of doom
If I couldn't hope, you wouldn't trust me

Injured part is in my bed
And someone said
they shouldn't touch me
Can the surgeon cut it from my head
If I couldn't hope, you wouldn't trust me

If I came into your city
Hung up on a game
Would you give me your assistance
Though you didn't know my name

Though you didn't know my name
Though you didn't know my name
Would you give me your assistance
Though you couldn't save my pain

Don't want to wake up far away
To hear them say, we found him
Would I see there's more to me
Than the shape I walk around in

Old men, young men
Tired and worn men
Raise your soul in the center of life
Old men, young men
Tired and worn men
Raise your soul in the center of light
Raise your soul in the center of life
