She can dance
When she walks down the street
Seems to float through the air
Like in a real good dream

Dark brown skin
This angel blues just under six
Feet tall now
And never sings the blues

Got to go, got to get away
Got to go, go, go, go, go
Before it's too late

Walked into my life
Around quarter to three
She ain't no angel you know
And it's getting to me

With a dirty little smile
And these eyes of blue
I'm telling you honey
This ain't no good for you

Got to go, got to get away
Got to go, go, go, go, go
Before it's too late

Now it's a quarter to six
And the sun begins to shine
You just woke yourself up
You start work at nine
You told yourself before a million times
This ain't no good for you

Got to go, got to get away
Got to go, go, go, go, go
Before it's too late

She said, walk this way, etc
