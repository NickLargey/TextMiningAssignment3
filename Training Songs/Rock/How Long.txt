How long how long must I wait for you
How long how long must I wait for you
I'm sad when you're not around me
But 'ere's nothing I can do

It's been a long time
Since I had you in my arms
It's been a long time
Since I had you in my arms
You know I need your lovin'
So won't you please hurry home
