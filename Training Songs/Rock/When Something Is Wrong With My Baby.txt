When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
If I know she's worried
Oh I would feel that same old misery
We've been through so much together
We spoke as one and that's what makes it better
Oh and just what just what she means to me now
Oh you just oh you just wouldn't understand
And the people say oh they say she's no good
Oh but she's my woman and don't you know
I'm her man
If she's got a problem oh yeah yeah
Oh I know I'm gonna have to help her solve it
If she's got a problem oh I know
I'm gonna help her
You know I'm gonna have
To help her somehow
Oh sing it again
When something is wrong with my baby
Oh sure now
When something is wrong with my baby oh
Then something is wrong with me
