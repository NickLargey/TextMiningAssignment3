There's a man outside my door tonight
He cries for help, he sings a pleadin' song
The times are tough for everyone
Gotta hold on to what I got, and just kinda cruise along

Well, I do 
Want to be helpful
But it's cold and I'm told 
You can't be too careful

Out of the mouth of a mother
And into the hands of a brother
And into the heart of a lover
And out of the hands of another
Do do do do do 

You can never tell who your neighbour is
Or what he's doin' tonight
Or who his friends are
Well, you don't know where he's from
Or where he's been, or who he knows
You know you can't be too careful
These days

Well, I do
Want to be helpful
Well but it's cold and I'm told
It might just be the devil

Out of the mouth of a mother
And into the hands of a brother (do do do do do)
Into the heart of a lover
And out of the hands of another

Well, I don't take chances
And I don't take time to see
And I don't take nothin' from nobody
No way, not me

Out of the mouth of a mother 
And into the hands of a brother (do do do do do)
Into the heart of a lover 
And out of the hands of another (do do do do do)
Out of the mouth of a mother 
Ho 
And into the hands of a brother (do do do do do)
Into the heart of a lover 
Ho 
And out of the hands of a child

Into the eyes of a child
Into the ears of a child
Into the heart of a child
Do do do do do
Into the heart of a child
Do do do do do
Into the heart of a child
