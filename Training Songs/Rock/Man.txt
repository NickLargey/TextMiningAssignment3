I do what I hate and don't understand

You're a real machine

But I can't get rid of the self

You're a real machine 
I'm a real machine

I'm a man and I'm a man 
I do what I hate and don't understand 
I'm a man and I'm a man 
I do what I hate and don't understand 

I'm a real machine 
You're a real machine 
I'm a real machine 
You're a real
