People running everywhere, just wandering about
Trading places, getting nowhere, what is it for?
You have changed in many ways, forever lost and found
Better face it, I don't know you anymore

Walking away, feel nothing, getting away from it all
Walking away, feel nothing at all

People riding circles always end up at the start
Finding places, living memories wasted before
You've become a stranger to, me we have grown apart
Can you face it, I don't know you anymore

Walking away, feel nothing, getting away from it all
Walking away, feel nothing at all

Search a way keep moving on, leave it all behind what's done
Clear your mind, you'll find out where you belong
People live in circles getting nowhere, lost in the dark
Follow traces not existing anymore

Walking away, feel nothing, getting away from it all
Walking away, feel nothing at all

Walking away, feel nothing
Running away from it all
Walking away, feel nothing
Running away from it all
Walking away, feel nothing at all
