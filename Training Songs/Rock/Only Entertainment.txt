Trans fixated on the big blue screen
Its your window to the outside
A melancholy dream
A medium upon which you build reality
This episodic currency
That everybody needs
Somebodies delivery lulls you to sleep

The man behind the weather map
The editor in chief
They control two worlds
Power and disease
And you cannot suppress you curiosity
But see it's only entertainment

Superficial urgency
Poster board mentality
Only entertainment
Tightly constrained
The buzz that remains
Is the story of how we run our lives
Many our the people poor and suffering

From the lack of coverage
From the transmission beam
And if it ever gets there
You'll be offended too
'cause you cannot distinguish
Chicanery from truth
See it's only entertainment
A superficial episode
As life continues to unfold
Only entertainment
Controlled and copied
They've planted the seed

That sprouts into your picture of the world
Can't someone protect me (turn away, turn away)
From this electron beam?
Hey you, Mr. FCC
Have you no advice for me?
