I was surprised
I was happy for a day in 1975
I was puzzled by a dream
It stayed with me all day in 1995
My brother had confessed he was gay
It took the heat off me for a while
He stood up with a sailor friend
Made it known upon my sister's wedding day.

Got married in a rush to save a kid from being deported
Now she's in love
I was so touched, I was moved to kick the crutches
From my crippled friend
She was not impressed
Cause I cured her on the Sabbath
I went to confess
When she saw the funny side, we introduced my child bride
To whiskey and gin
To whiskey and gin.

The priest in the booth had a photographic memory
For all he had heard
He took all of my sins and he wrote a pocket novel
Called The State That I'm In
So I gave myself to God
There was a pregnant pause before he said okay
Now I spend my days turning tables round in Marks & Spencer
They don't seem to mind.

I gave myself to sin, I gave
Myself to providence and I've
Been there and back again
The state that I am in.

I gave myself to sin, I gave
Myself to providence and I've
Been there and back again
The state that I am in.

Oh love of mine, would you condescend to help me?
Cause I am stupid and blind
Desperation is the Devil's work, it is the folly Of a boy's empty mind
Oh and now I'm feeling dangerous
Riding on city buses for a hobby is sad
Why don't you lead me to a living end
I promised that I'd entertain my crippled friend,
My crippled friend.

I gave myself to sin, I gave
Myself to providence and I've
Been there and back again
The state that I am in.

I gave myself to sin, I gave
Myself to providence and I've
Been there and back again
The state that I am in.

I gave myself to sin, I gave
Myself to providence and I've
Been there and back again
The state that I am in.

I gave myself to sin, I gave
Myself to providence and I've
Been there and back again
The state that I am in.

I gave myself to sin
And I've been there and back again
Oh yeah
