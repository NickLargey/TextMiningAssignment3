We've got time to wait
And we wait until it's too late
We always move in seconds in a world of hours and days
We've got bones and blood
Is this all what we've got
I thought there was a brain but maybe I just thought in vain

And this is not the time to wonder
And this is not the time to cry
And this is not the time to sleep while we fight
And this is not the time to die

Realities and dreams
Reality is not what it seems
It's not the way we want it it's just the way it gotta be
We've got love and hate
But we can't estimate
What's the right solution to kill the illusion of this world

And this is not the time to wonder
And this is not the time to cry
And this is not the time to sleep while we fight
And this is not the time to die
And this is not the time to wonder
'cause this is just a time to fear
Don't worry about the meaning don't worry 'bout the world
It's the question how to see clear

That's the time
That's the time
That's the time
Oh yes that's the time

We've got time to wait
And we wait until it's too late
We always move in seconds in a world of hours and days
We've got bones and blood
Is this all what we've got
I thought there was a brain but maybe I just thought in vain

And this is not the time to wonder
And this is not the time to cry
And this is not the time to sleep while we fight
And this is not the time to die
And this is not the time to wonder
'cause this is just a time to fear
Don't worry about the meaning don't worry 'bout the world
It's the question how to see clear

That's the time, oh, oh
That's the time, oh, oh

Go

And this is not the time to wonder
And this is not the time to cry
And this is not the time to sleep while we fight
And this is not the time to die
And this is not the time to wonder
'cause this is just a time to fear
Don't worry about the meaning don't worry 'bout the world
It's the question how to see clear

Oh this is not the time to wonder
And this is not the time to cry
And this is not the time to sleep while we fight
And this is not the time to die

That's the time
