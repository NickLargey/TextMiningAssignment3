When we get home
It'll be like a party
He's learned to move
Real slowly

See how we move?
Sudden and playful
We have it all
But I miss my lion

He's already there
Waiting to greet me

When you drive
There's no fooling me
Those roads invited me
When you drive
There's no fooling me
Those roads invited me

When we get home
It'll be like a party
He's learned how to move
Real slowly

He's already here
Waiting to greet me
