Today, love takes on a whole new meaning
In a face, I know I've seen somewhere before
Somehow, the mystery is over
Yet, just begun
To see the most perfect thig
Together, we've ever done
So what do we call this miracle we've made
And how can I find one word to say it
When all I'm feeling, here and now, is love
So that will always be you
Kama
Today, I just wrote a song about you
The words, they flow just like the air I breathe
The closest I've ever been
To truly understanding
The closest we'll ever be
To the meaning of life so sacred
So what do we call this miracle we've made
And how can I find one word to say it
When all I'm feeling, here and now, is love
So that will always be you
Kama
And every language has a word
But the meaning is always the same
Love is all you've got, to start out in the world
And love is all that remains
So what do we call this miracle we've made
And how can I find one word to say it
When all I'm feeling, here and now, is love
So that will always be you
Kama
