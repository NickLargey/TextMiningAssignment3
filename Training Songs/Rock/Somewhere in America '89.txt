Just play the game and throw the dice 
You might not win but you can't lose tonight 
Just watch this fairy tale unfold 
You won't believe all the things you've been told 
Young or old 

Somewhere in America 
Somewhere in America tonight 

Another town another place 
Another name but you don't know the face 
A joker deals and makes the rules 
A game of chance a game that was made for fools 
Like me and you 

Somewhere in America 
Somewhere in America tonight 
Tonight 

Don't wave a flag unless it's white 
Don't make a noise unless you're prepared to fight 
Wrong or right 

Somewhere in America 
Somewhere in America tonight 
Somewhere in America 
Somewhere in America tonight
