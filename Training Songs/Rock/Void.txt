I had certain pictures
That was an unspoken promise
You would build the frame
When you'll hear the whistle
I want that platform loaded
I'll be on that train
Harnesses familiar
Massive packs of cameras and listen
This is what we do
I hear, see the laughter
Feel it of my eye
I look for you

And all I see, all I say
Is a void
All I see, all I say
Is a void

Maybe if you keep your
Pen down on the paper
You can fill me up
I've been left to with
That's my support my windows
When I say hey

And all I see, all I see
Is a void
All I see, all I see
Is a void
And all I see, all I see
Is a void

Don't go wait for me,
No, don't go Wait for me
Because I don't believe
I don't believe everything I see
No, I don't believe
I don't believe everything I see
