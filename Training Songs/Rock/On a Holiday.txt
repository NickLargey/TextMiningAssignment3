A pirate with a tune on a holiday. 
Ol' lazy mister moon want a getaway. 
And isn't that a moon for a milky way? 

A ukulele lady, a roundalay. Rock, rock roll, Child!
Rock, rock, roll, Plymouth Rock roll over. 
For a holiday, with a roundalay. 

Abaft and forth, a starboard course with
North abeam, sherry of course. The men
Will share some sport ah-now me hearty!
Not the rum of Carib scum, it's Port
Tonight, drink up and come, un-weigh
That anchor yank and we will party!

A shanty town, a chanty in Waikiki, and juxtapose
A man with a mystery a blue Hawaiian, capture
His melody, and Liliuola Kalani will sing to me. 

Rock, rock, roll, Child! Rock, rock roll, Plymouth Rock roll over. 
For a holiday. Long, long ago, Long ago. 

Whisperin' winds send my 
Wind a chimes a-tinklin'.
