You're not sure what you want to do with your life
But you sure don't want me in it
Yeah you're sure the life you're living with me
Can't go on one single minute
And there's a new one waiting outside this door
And now's the time to begin it

You found a new world
And you want to taste it
But that world can turn cold
And you better face it

Who will you run to when it all falls down
Who's gonna pick you world up off the ground
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I

You won't know what it's like to live on your own
You've always had me there beside you
You think it's easy finding someone out there
Who's gonna care as much as I do
What's gonna happen baby when you find out
That there's no one there to cry to

You can tell the whole world 
How you're gonna make it
You can follow you heart 
But what you do when someone breaks it

Who will you run to when it all falls down
Who's gonna pick you world up off the ground
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I

You found a new world
And you want to taste it
But that world can turn cold 
And you better face it

Who will you run to when it all falls down
Who's gonna pick you world up off the ground
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I

Who will you run to when it all falls down
Who's gonna pick your world up off the ground
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I
