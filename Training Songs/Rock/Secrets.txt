Ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba bu ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
 
Turn around and I'll be there
Take my hand and climb the stairs
Throw your troubles to the wind
Summertime is happening 
 
Thank the sun up in the sky
Never had to reason way
Find a place where love can grow
Lets stay in the shadows 

We've got secrets
Nothing touches us
Secrets we walk in the sun
We've got secrets
You can't come with us
Secrets are not for everyone 

Ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba bu ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

Turn around and ill be there
In your dreams and everywhere
Put your worries in a jar
Take my hand we'll go far 

Empty sun up in the sky
Never had to reason way
Find a place where love can grow
Lets stay in the shadows

We've got secrets
Nothing touches us
Secrets we walk in the sun
We've got secrets
You can't come with us
Secrets are not for everyone 

Ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba bu ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

Secrets

We walk in the sun
Up in the sky
To reason why
Love can grow 

We've got secrets
Nothing touches us
Secrets we walk in the sun 

We've got secrets
You can't come with us
â€˜Cause our secrets are not for everyone 
Secrets are not for everyone
