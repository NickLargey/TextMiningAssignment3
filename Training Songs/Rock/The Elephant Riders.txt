I'll keep pulling on the towpath.
You keep floating on the river.
Yeah, until the day is done.
Keep on keeping on the low road, 
Chesapeake and Ohio.
Because on the higher ground you will find

Elephant Riders to the northwest bring news from father. 

Looking like it's always closing,
The Salty Dog is always open.
Here, I got an I.O.U.
Clickity clack clack, clickity clack clack, 
Baltimore and Ohio,
Clickity clack clack, clickity clack clack, 
Roll on, roll on. 

On our way to Washington where work is done by men with gavels,
I heard a sound that just about Removed me from my filly's saddle.

Elephant Riders to the northwest bring news from father. 

Don't be eating all the hard tack.
Between we two there's half a small sack.

Giddy up pony, Giddy up pony, 
Camptown Race is five miles long.
Giddy up pony, Giddy up pony, 
Ride on, ride on.
