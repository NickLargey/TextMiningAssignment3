You spend my money, you drink my best red wine
You think it's funny to see me all the time
Sitting with my head hanging down
You treat me just like a clown
You spend my money but honey you sure needn't waste my time

When you get older you'll see what you have done
You hung on my shoulder and loved me just for fun
Someday when I'm older too
I'm gonna come and make a fool out of you
You spend my money, but honey you sure needn't waste my time

You spend my money, you drink my best red wine
You think it's funny to see me all the time
Sitting with my head hanging down
You treat me just like a clown
You spend my money but honey you sure needn't waste my time
