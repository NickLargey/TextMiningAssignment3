My sole responsibility was getting things done
Well, I'll never know
But it was only a job I meant to quit

But there will always be tomorrow when I call up my boss
And say, "you're the one that said, not me"
Even if the water's a million miles away, it doesn't matter
It's all inside your head
Tell me how you feel, you already are
You can show me the shit for how good I feel
And this won't be that hard

Just get on
You need to see the more, just get on
And you know it's not getting any greater
And I need to think before I'm riding
On the fairy boat

It's like dancing
It's like if you're with me, I'm not scared of dying
We're not getting older, but we're not getting younger
We're just watching the tide
How young do you think I am since the fairyboat?

I'm not an allegory
I'm not the answer
To the questions you never ask
But if you're not paranoid
Then you better being hearing this
So yeah boy, you better open your eyes

Every-time I turn around
I realize my body's sitting there by your side
But we'll race on the way
If you give me a second, then I can catch up to myself

And if you'll ever beat me, you gotta run faster
You're gonna miss the boat
Oh I'm gonna give up
'Cause I don't want to hear you say "you can't seem to get it together"
'Cause I want it sooner
And I can't wait

We're going forward, riding for the many
And you see I'm alone
Riding on the fairy boat

And I'm sure you'll say it's a waste
But I can't wait for this any longer
And I hope that I never get to whatever I'm heading for

I know that you're hurting
But just 'cause it's turning
Doesn't mean you have to have each turn
