Generation x
Where'd you get that vibration
Did you buy it from a dealer,
Did you get it from a healer,
Or did you steal it from my imagination

Well you can take what you need
Tabitha it's not me;
It comes from the well-spring swing
Ask the girl in the green tee
Why else she'd want to keep it
'til her dying day

I got a fever from believing
Slow down
Got a head full of fire
Rebound
Can't fight with desire
Slow down
I guess i'm going to get, get
Low down
Where'd you get that vibe?

Tabitha's got the hollywood smile
Thinks that smile's gonna take her
To the nile river to deliver
A vibration high as the sky is wide

She just bought a black cadillac, well
Freedom is believin' you can never look back
To the vibe
Whether strong whether weak
Whether low
Where it takes you
You can never go

So fine, so fine
Oh, yes it is, lord
So fine, so fine
So fine i blew my fuckin mind
So fine, so fine

Generation x
When you meet your maker
Will you ask for a list
Of the one of the two
Of the three of the four
Vibrations
You can add to your fix

And tabitha blue
Will you ever be alive?
Spent your life chasin' after
Other people's vibes
Stuck with the dealer
Or lost with the healer
Will you make it to
Your dying day?
