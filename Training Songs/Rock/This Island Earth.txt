I have this feeling
It's so revealing
Silence surrounds you
You stand all alone
And in the darkness
I still can find you
For light is shining
From deep within
Is this all it's worth?
Oh! Is this all it's worth?
This island earth
I see the children
Lost in the city
We break the hearts
Of both the young and old
I see the need here
To feed the hungry
As dollar bills lie
Within your hands
Oh! Is this all it's worth?
Oh! Is this all it's worth?
This island earth.
I see you
 I give you
I feel you
 I take why
ou
I love you
 I'll mend you
I touch you
 I hate you
If I'm near you
 I bleed you
I want you I'll save you
But I fear you For I need you
What does it matter?
It really doesn't matter
What does it matter?
Really doesn't matter to me
This island earth
