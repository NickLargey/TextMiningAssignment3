Some folks like to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
Me, I'm takin' a Greyhound on the Hudson River line 
I'm in a New York state of mind

I've seen all the movie stars in their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockies under evergreens
But I know what I'm needin', and I don't want to waste more time 
I'm in a New York state of mind

It was so easy livin' day by day
Out of touch with the rhythym and blues
Now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, the Daily News, oh, oh

I'm in a New York state of mind

It was so easy living day by day
Out of touch, out of touch with the rhythym and blues
Now I need a little give and take
Something like the New York Times, the Daily News
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Come down to reality, it's fine with me 'cause I let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
Don't have any reasons
I left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind

I'm just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line
I'm in a New York state of mind, aah
