If I could kick his head in, fickle little boyfriend, I'd be satisfied
If I could smack some sense into his senses, I might feel alright

'Cause I spent the weekend, waiting all alone
For that rat to come back home
When all the while, he was with somebody new
And now that I know, his hours are few

'Cause I just can't forgive and forget
When I'm through with him
He will be wishing he was dead
'Cause I know what he's been up to
And I know that he's been untrue
When I am through with he
He will be wishing he was dead

If I could snap that neck, that broken record trainwreck
I might feel okay
If he could speak the truth or just say sorry
That would be the day

But he made me crazy, thinking I was wrong
That he wasn't cheatin' all along
When I gave him everything that I could give
Now he's gonna wish he'd never lived

'Cause I just can't forgive and forget
When I'm through with him
He will be wishing he was dead
'Cause I know what he's been up to
And I know that he's been untrue
When I am through with he
He will be wishing he was dead

And what can I do
And what can I say
To make it untrue
To take this pain away

'Cause I just can't forgive and forget
When I'm through with him
He will be wishing he was dead
'Cause I know what he's been up to
And I know that he's been untrue
When I am through with he
He will be wishing he was dead
