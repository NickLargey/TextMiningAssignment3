Meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say, "Everything's okay"
Bring me southern kisses from your room

Meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say, "Everything's alright"
Let me smell the moon in your perfume

Oh, Gods and years will rise and fall
And there's always something more
Lost in talk, I waste my time
And it's all been said before
While further down behind the masquerade
The tears are there
I don't ask for all that much
I just want someone to care
Answer right now

Meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say, "Everything's okay"
Come on out beneath the shining sun

Meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say, "Everything's alright"
Sneak on out beneath the stars and run, yeah

Oh, yeah, yes
Oh, yes

It's king and queen and we must go down 'round
Behind the chandelier
Where I won't have to speak my mind
And you won't have to hear
Shreds of news and after thoughts
And complicated scenes
We'll weather down behind the light
And fade like magazines

Meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say, "Everything's okay"
Bring me southern kisses from your room
Hey, hey

Meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say, "Everything's alright"
Let me smell the moon in your perfume
Oh, no

Meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say, "Everything's okay"
Let me see you smiling back at me
Hey

Meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say, "Everything's alright"
Hold me tight and lovin' love is free
Whoa oh
Okay
