Falling down, down to the ground 
We praise your name, sweet lamb of god 

I know you're there, I sing you this praise 
Although I'm scared, I still bless his name 

I can feel, your love, in my life 
All I can hear, is the sound, of your voice 

An army of men, can't stop the end 
Well I know you're scared, just take my hand 
I'll take you there, he's taking us there 

Just follow me there, he'll take us in 
Well he knows we're scared, cause this is the end 

I can feel your love in my life 
All I can hear is the sound of your voice 
And It's calling me, well you've called my name 
And I will go and praise your name
