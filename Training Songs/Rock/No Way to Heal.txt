I tear your heart out from behind
Remorse survives as mine
You're unaffected still unaware
Of the damage done

The shame it takes me
The pain it breaks me
What have I done

How do I have to
For all is gone now?

I feel the ice cold dagger
Make its way between my ribs again
I stand before disaster
Defiantly I lie then suffocate

I'm running on empty
I'm chasing a dead dream
I'm all out of time

Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal

I try to mend it to build it back
But the wounds become a scar
You're lying face down and you're veiled in red
The sight wont leave my head

The shame it takes me
The pain it breaks me
What have I done

How do I have to
For all is gone now?

I feel the ice cold dagger
Make its way between my ribs again
I stand before disaster
Defiantly I lie then suffocate

I'm running on empty
I'm chasing a dead dream
I'm all out of time

Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal

No way to heal

I stand before disaster
Defiantly alive and suffocate

I'm running on empty
I'm chasing a dead dream
I'm all out of time, I'm all out of time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal

I'm running on empty
I'm chasing a dead dream
I'm all out of time, time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
There's no way to heal
