Hey, it's me
I'm sorry it's so late
I can't sleep
I knew You'd be awake (Psalm 121:4)
You're always home
Waiting by the phone
For nights like these
When I'm feeling all alone

I wish it didn't always
Have to be this way
I wish that I could talk to You
Face to face
But nothing compares to the way
You always listen and know just what to say

Hold my hand
I can't stand alone
Here I am
Waiting for You to take me home

Oh, I just want to sing
I only wish there was a word
For what You mean to me
I would only say it once
In hushed tones
So it would not grow old
But all I have
Is "I love You"

You're my Jesus, You're my hero
Everything I wish that I could be

You're the one who comforts me
When everyone is gone away
I can't stand alone
Here I am
Waiting for You to take me home

And I will keep on singing
Because You hear me
And I will keep on smiling
Because You're near me

I'll sleep well on a promise tonight.
