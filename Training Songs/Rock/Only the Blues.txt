When you wake up in the morning
And can't seem to raise your head
You sit staring in the teacup
At the egg upon your bread
And the life that you are living
Doesn't seem to be quite real
You have only what the lonely call the blues

When you're feeling tired and weary
With your eyes cast to the floor
For a loved one who has left you
On a bleak and distant shore
You may think you're being picked on
But you are not the first
To have only what the lonely call the blues

- There are no rules to follow
No advice to take
You're the only one
Who can give yourself a shake
Someone will appear
To dispel all your fear
In a funny unexpected way -

Then you'll wake up in the morning
With a smile upon your face
And you'll look out on the world
And see it is a happy place
With no memory of misery
You will soon forget
You had only what the lonely call the blues
