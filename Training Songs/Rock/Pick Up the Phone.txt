Said good bye when I leff to your answering machine.
Then you jumped in a plane
Girl
You know what I mean.
Pick up the phone
Oh yeah - pick up the phone

Hearing your voice again.
Waiting so many years
Feeling closer to you -
Not a sign not a trace
Baby

Pick up the phone
Oh yeah - pick up the phone

Get in touch
Fill the shadow in my life.
Oh what you're doing now? Inter communication via satellite -
You can call me long distance
Whatever you like.

Oh yeah - pick up the phone
