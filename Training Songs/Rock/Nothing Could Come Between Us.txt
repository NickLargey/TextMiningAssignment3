Well I'm running back and forth from here to South Carolina
Wishing you were here, I guess I should watch what I wish for

You're right on time, so invite me in
This is where your trouble begins
But I like you better than the other ones
You say I'm right when you know I'm wrong
We could never just get along
Don't you hate when it gets stuck in your mouth
And then those words get in the way
She said...

Nothing could come between us
One of those favorite things that she used to say
That's just what she said
Nothing could come between us
Sorry to say but I don't feel the same

You're so damn relentless, and you will find,
The two of us are like two of a kind
But it hits you harder than the other ones
You said it loosely, when I'm just sitting here with myself
Don't you hate when it gets stuck in your mouth
And then those words get in the way
She said...

Nothing could come between us
One of those favorite things that she used to say
That's just what she said
Nothing could come between us
Sorry to say but I don't feel the same
Since home is where the hurt is

It's on your conscience, I'm not for sale
It's on your conscience, I'm not for sale

Nothing could come, oh nothing could come
She said...

Nothing could come between us
One of those favorite things that she used to say
That's just what she said
Nothing could come between us
Sorry to say but I don't feel the same
Since home is where the hurt is

Oh nothing, oh nothing, oh nothing
It's on your conscience, I'm not for sale
