Well I don't know what I'm looking for
But I know that I just want to look some more
And I won't be satisfied
'Til there's nothing left that I haven't tried
For some people it's an easy choice
But for me there's a devil and an angel's voice
Well I don't know what I am looking for
But I know that I just want to look some more

Well I don't know what I'm living for
But I know that I just want to live some more
And you hear it from strangers
And you hear it from friends
That love never dies, and love never ends
And I don't want to argue, no I don't want to fight
'Cause you're always wrong and I'm always right
Well I don't know what I am living for
But I know that I just want to live some more

I used to be involved, and I felt like a king
Now I've lost it all and I don't feel a thing
I may never grow up, I may never give in
And I'll blame this world that I live in
I visit hell on a daily basis
And I see the sadness in all your faces
I've got friends who have married
And their lives seem complete
Here I am still stumbling down a darkened street

And I act like a child and I'm insecure
And I'm filled with doubt and I'm immature
Sometimes it creeps up on me and before I know it
I'm lost at sea
But no matter how far I row
I always find my way back home
But I don't know what I've been waiting for
But I know that I don't want to wait anymore

Looking for
What I'm looking for
Looking for
What I'm looking for
Looking for
What I'm looking for
Looking for
What I'm looking for
Looking for
What I'm looking for
