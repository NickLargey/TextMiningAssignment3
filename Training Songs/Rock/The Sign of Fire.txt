Heart of stone
I tried to reach you 
Of the altar stone
I tried to warn you
But you were not alone
You wouldn't take the call
You wear brimstone
I tried to warm you 
Always the same desire

After the tone
They try to storm you 
You are a voice alone
And who dares to question
Forgotten at home
How do you live with 
Do you wear brimstone
Give me the call

Always the sign is fire
I'm being drawn by the heat
Always the same desire

Through the telephone
I tried to reach you 
But if you're not alone
I know your life is torn
I see your lover's tomb
Why don't you mention 
To me whenever I call
I'll try to warm you

Always the sign is fire
I'm being drawn by the heat
Always the same desire

You're not alone
Always the sign is fire
Heart of stone
Always the sign is fire 
You're not alone

You're not alone
Always the sign is fire
Heart of stone
Always the sign is fire
(repeat)
