Bobby's off on holiday
Away across the sea
Setting up his easel
A new scene to see
Says that he's had enough
Of standing in the rain
Now he's looking for the good life
With European pain
Did you know
Your garden's overgrown
And what is shown?
Meeting all these pretty girls
Singing golden hair
He's in touch with the painter's mind
And Syd's unflinching stare
Drinking wine in the Moulin Rouge
Sipping kaffee in Berlin
Might take in the colored lights
In the city they call sin

He could see
The writing on the wall
Ten feet tall
But oh there are times
He wished the world
Would fade just into sight
And oh, the feelings that changed
Were thicker than the brush
Strokes of fame
Now he rides the dirt roads
Of old southern Spain
And when senoritas sing
He can hear them say
Did you know
Your garden's overgrown
And what is shown?
He could see
The writing on the wall
Ten feet tall
