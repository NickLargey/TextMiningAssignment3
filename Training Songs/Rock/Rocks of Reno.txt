You and I couldn't get along
So our love, it wound up on the rocks of Reno
I loved you and you loved me
But all we did was disagree 'bout everything but Reno

All the love we'd ever found
We lost the night it ran around in Reno
On the rocks that break the ties
But heartaches in disguise, the rocks of Reno

We did wrong by leaving home
And coming here to part
And although I've taken off my ring
You're still here in my heart

So let's go back to our hometown
Try again to settle down
'Cause we know that our love just can't be stopped
Even by the lonely rocks, the rocks of Reno
