Once is never enough
Never is and never was
Here and now is all that counts
Here and now in large amounts

Be beautiful but shut up
The going can be real tough

You can keep your fancy bars
Clubby friends and fast cars
And when the going gets hard
You can eat your credit cards

I really tried to fight it
But what the hell I like it

There is always room at the top
Don't let them tell you that there is not
Made in England born and bred
An eighteenth century brain
In a twenty first century head

If some of this fits some of you
Or like the things that you might do
It's the pleasure and the pain
That makes us do it all again

They say be beautiful and shut up
The going can be real tough

There is always room at the top
Don't let them tell you that there is not
Made in England born and bred
An eighteenth century brain
In a twenty first century head

Room at the top - so eighteenth century
Room at the top - so eighteenth century
Room at the top
There's always room

Room at the top - so eighteenth century (move over)
Room at the top - so eighteenth century (move over)
Room at the top
There's always room

There is always room at the top
Don't let them tell you that there is not
Made in England born and bred
An eighteenth century brain

There is always room at the top
Don't let them tell you that there is not
Made in England born and bred
An eighteenth century brain

There is always room at the top
Don't let them tell you that there is not
Made in England born and bred
An eighteenth century brain

There is always room at the top
Don't let them tell you that there is not
Made in England born and bred
An eighteenth century brain
In a twenty first century
