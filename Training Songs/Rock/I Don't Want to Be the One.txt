I've begun to feel there's something wrong
Something's gonna break before too long
I don't know the reason for this feeling
And I can't put my finger on what's wrong

Do you feel it too is it so strong?
Do you feel it too or am I wrong
I've begun to get a sneaking feeling
That this is not the way that it should be.

I don't wanna be the one to say goodbye
I don't wanna look the problem in the eye
I don't wanna be the first to say
That maybe we should both call it a day
I don't wanna be the one to say goodbye
I could be wrong

What if I should throw it all away?
Just to want you back again someday
I find it hard to keep my feelings from you
But really is there any other way.

Is this always used to be?
Has it really changed or is it me
