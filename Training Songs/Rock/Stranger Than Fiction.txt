Please mister can't you help me try to find my baby's house
It's three in the morning in the pouring rain
I can't find the house and i forgot the number
But I gotta give her these roses to relieve her pain

Don't laugh, just tell me you've been there before
So we fight but we fight every evening
And I tell you every morning I just love her more
And life goes on, filled with disasters and friction

And life can be strange
But love can be stranger than fiction
Only love can be stranger than fiction
Excuse me operator, tell me what time it is

Me and my lover been in bed all day
I think I strained a muscle
I didn't know I had
And tell me what day it is anyway

Don't laugh, just tell me you hear what I say
I love her so much I don't even know what planet I'm on
Love her so much I wish she'd just go away
And life goes on, filled with bizarre contradictions

And life can be strange
But love can be stranger than fiction
Only love can be stranger than fiction
I know that sometimes love goes

But sometimes it comes back to getcha
And when love grows
It grows like a flower or grows like a tumor
Love shows that God has a sense of humor

Life goes on, ever immune to prediction
And life can be strange
But love can be stranger than fiction
Only love can be stranger than fiction
