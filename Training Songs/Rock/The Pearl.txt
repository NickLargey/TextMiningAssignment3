Oh, look I've found it, oh I've really found it
How could such a thing be happening to me?
Oh, please don't drop it, I'd die if you lost it
You see it means the world to me

Now everything we ever wanted
Lies within our reach
Patiently anticipating
The world lies at our feet

It could be the pearl
It could be our hope, our dream, our life
It could be the pearl
The end of all our pain and strife, could be the pearl

Run, keep on running, oh I hear them coming
How could they try to take what is ours?
Please run faster, oh they're right behind us
How much farther can we go?

It possesses me, controls me
It makes me run and it makes me kill
The very thing that made me strong
Has taken all my will

It could be the pearl
It could be our hope, our dream, our life
It could be the pearl
The end of all our pain and strife, could be the pearl

It could be the pearl
It could be our hope, our dream, our life
It could be the pearl
The end of all our pain and strife, could be the pearl

Oh, I must take it, throw it in the ocean
Far, far away from me
We were happy, oh we were so happy
When things were the way they used to be

It could be the pearl
It could be our hope, our dream, our life
It could be the pearl
The end of all our pain and strife

It could be the pearl
Hope, our dream, our life
It could be the pearl
The end of all our pain and strife, could be the pearl

It could be the pearl
