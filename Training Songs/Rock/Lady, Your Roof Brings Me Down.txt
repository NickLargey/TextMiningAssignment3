When your roof It drags me down -Drags me down 
I've become the painted clown -I'll paint your town 
When your roof It tears me down -Wears me down 
You stare me down - Down Down Down Down 

Lady 

When today I thought there was sun -But sun stole away 
I'll play by your rules I'd follow you anyway 
When your roof It tears me down -Wears me down 
I'll be your clown - Down Down Down Down 

Lady 

Pitchin' and reachin' and poundin' and fallin'
Now... Lady
