I dreamed I did a good job and I got well paid 
Blew it all at the penny arcade 
A hundred dollars on a kewpie doll 
I guess no white chick is gonna make me crawl 
   
On a T-W-A, to the promised land 
Every woman, child and man 
Gets a Cadillac and a diamond ring 
Don't you know we're riding with the king? 
   
He's on a mission of mercy to the new frontier 
He's gonna check us all on out of here 
Up to that mansion on a hill 
Where you can get your prescription filled 
   
On a TWA to the promised land 
Everybody come on and clap your hands 
Don't you just love the way he sings 
Don't you know we're riding with the king? 
   
A red cape and shiny cold 45 
I never saw his face but I saw the light 
Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings 
Don't you know we're riding with the king? 
   
Well I stepped out of a mirror at ten years old 
With a suit cut sharp, as a razor and a heart of gold 
I had a guitar hanging just about waist high 
I'm gonna play that thing until the day I die
