Whiskey please, I need some Whiskey please
So bring me consciousness
And kill my innocence
Please lay your eyes on me
Lead me in the dance
Give me no chance to reconsider, reconsider

I'm Queen of the world
I bump into things
I spin around in circles
And I'm singing, and I'm singing I'm singing
Why can't I stay like this?
Dear God.
Oh let me be young
Let me stay, please
Oh let me stay like this oh

Bring me home
I've got no plans for tomorrow
I've got no plans for tomorrow
I got no plans insight
In fact I'm free this week
I'm free this month
I lonely, lonely this year
I'm lonely forever
But today, oh

I'm Queen of the world
I bump into things
I spin around in circles
And I'm singing, and I'm singing I'm singing
Why can't I stay like this?
Dear God.
Oh let me be young
Let me stay, please
Oh let me stay like this oh

And I'm singing, I'm singing I'm singing

I'm Queen of the world
I bump into things
I spin around in circles
And I'm singing, and I'm singing I'm singing
Why can't I stay like this?
Dear God.
Let me be young
Let me stay, please
Oh let me stay like this oh
