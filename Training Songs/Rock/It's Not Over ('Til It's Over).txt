Listen 
We don't call the shots here 
We don't make the rules 
We take what we get, get what we can 
And it's learning the hard way 
Here on the streets 
You can't build a dream, without a plan 

(Passion speaks) Let them hear you speak 
(Play for keeps) They play to win, we play for keeps 

[Chorus]
It's not over 'til it's over 
It's not over 'til we get it right 

The odds are against us 
They say we don't stand a chance 
But there's no giving up, no giving in 
When push comes to shove 
You got to fight for what you love 
You do what you must, do what you can 

(Passion speaks) Let them hear you speak 
(Play for keeps) They play to win, we play for keeps 

It's not over 'til it's over (It's not over) 
It's not over 'til we get it right 
It's not over 'til it's over (Don't go giving in) 
It's not over 'til we get it right 

The odds are against us 
But you know we still stand a chance 
But there's no giving up, no giving in 
It's not over 

It's not over 'til it's over 
It's not over 'til we, 'til we, 'til we get it right 
It's not over 'til it's over 
It's not over 'til we, 'til we, 'til we get it right 
It's not over 'til it's over 
Don't go giving in now
