I'm trying
Denying
Why won't you ever talk to me
I know it
Can't show it
I guess it's kind of hard to see

I'm learning
Confirming
The lies a thousand times before
I know it
Can't blow it
Not long before you shut the door

Well I'm trying
Denying
I guess it's never s'posed to be
It's comin down now
It's comin down because of me

When I look into your eyes
You know you've got my hypnotized
All I want is to hold on
All these problems just begin
It seems as if they'll never end
And all I want is to hold onto you

Want to lay back and close my eyes
Dream of things I could not find
Just lay back and close my eyes

I'm trying
Denying
Want to lay back and close my eyes 
(i guess it's never s'posed to be)
Dream of things I could not find
(it's comin' down now)
Just lay back and close my eyes
(it's comin down because of me)
