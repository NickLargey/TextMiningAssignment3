She comes to find me way too soon
And leaves me leaves me way too fast
For my heart, to be anywhere but with the moon
You know, it's cold out there and it?s dark
Yeah, keep playing a part in this thing till the end
All good things have an end, oh, they do

And I wished upon a shooting star
And thought about the spaces between
Two hearts that can never ever let go
And I used to watch the way she moved
The way she crossed the park at night
To buy some milk after staying in bed all day

In the spaces between
In the spaces between
Takes so long just to kinda believe
In the scars that we've got

In the spaces between
Takes so long just to kinda believe
In the scars that we've got
In the spaces between

I truly love you, do, yeah
I truly love you, I do
