You call me up
I'd say a few words but
I'll try not to speak
Too long.

Please to be kind and
I'll try to explain
I'll probably get it
All wrong.

What does it mean when
You promise someone
No matter how hard
Or whatever may come

It means that I won't give in,
Won't give in
Won't give in
Cause everyone I love is here,
Say it once, and disappear.

Once in a while
I return to the fold
With people I call
My own.

Even if time
Is just a flicker of light
And we all have to
Die alone.

What does it mean when
You belong to someone
When you're born with a name,
When you carry it on.

It means that I won't give in,
Won't give in
Won't give in
Cause everyone I love is here,
All at once,
And I'll show you how to get here.

Come on now
Come on now
Can you feel it
I can see it in you.

Come on now
Come on now
Reveal it
Turn around won't you.

The right time
The right place
Right now
Turn around.

A chance is made
A chance is lost
I carry myself to the edge of the earth.

It means that I won't give in
Won't give in
Won't give in
Cause everyone I love is here,
Say it once, just say it,

And disappear
