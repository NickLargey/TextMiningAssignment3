As your lips turn blue it only reminds me 
I'm not free from your nightmare 
That I'm living in 
When grey skies turn blue 
I'm holding on to every scream 
Trying to wake you will you wake up now? 
Cut up on the floor 
Your arms hold on to me some how 
But that's all you'll get for now 
We can't pretend that this is
And as you turn cold 
And hold on to me this night 
Because the ground will only break you 
Like morning skies filled with glimmering sunrise 
I'd let you go if I knew 
That it would break you as your lips turn 
Every shade of blue 
Confusing everyone you look at 
Can you hear me now? 
Screaming out your name 
I won't give up on this grey night 
It's the pieces that we keep for ourselves 
When his lips won't do 
Keep mine in mind it's gonna take time 
But I'm gonna be fine 
When his lips won't do 
Keep mine in mind it's gonna take time 
I'm gonna be just fine 
If only you could mean more to me 
If only I could keep cool headed 
It's the pieces we keep for ourselves
