There is one thing. That I would die for.
It's when you say. My life is in your hands.
When you're near me. Your love is all I need.
Now I can't imagine.

What do you want from me?
It's not how it used to be. 
You've taken my life away

Ruining everything.

Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la

What do you want from me?
It's not how it used to be.
You've taken my life away
Ruining everything.

Give me something. I can rely on.
Far away from. The life that I once know.
But what does it matter. that's all I have to say.
And I can't imagine.

What do you want from me?
It's not how it used to be.
You've taken my life away
Ruining everything.
