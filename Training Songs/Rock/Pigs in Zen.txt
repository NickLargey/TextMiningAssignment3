Pig's in the mud 
When he tires 
Pig's in zen 
Pig's in zen 
Pig is nude
Unashamed 
Pig's in zen 
Pig's in zen

Talkin bout the pig 
The pig 
The pig - uh 
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pig 
Goddamned pig

Pig mounts sow 
When he's wound
Pig's in zen 
Pig's in zen 
Pig eats shit 
But only when he hungers 
Pig's in zen 
Pig's in zen

Talkin bout the pig 
The pig 
The pig - uh 
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pig
God damned pig

Oh, I know about war
But I just wanna f*ck
I know about pain and suffering and being cold
But I just wanna f*ck

The pig is led to the slaughter
Pig is led to the slaughter
This he says
Is the price some pay
For a simple life
How he feels
That's proof for him
Pig's in zen

Talkin bout the pig
The pig
The pig
The pig
The pig
The pig
God damned pig
The pig - uh
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pig
