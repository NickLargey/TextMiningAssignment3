1,2,3 cause I know

Sadness bring on violence night
No here today
I'm looking for truth in my arm

The madness bring on silence night
No here today
I'm looking for blue in my arm

No time to the end of century
Kioku-no naka-no so-no me-no(of those eyes in memory)
No time to the end of century
Kioku-no naka-ni kiete(disappeared into memory)

No time to the end of century
Because I know it's over
