I dreamed what what you were offering
Imagine lying next to me
You should, and your reputation talks
I will write our story in my mind
Write about our dreams and triumphs
This might be my innocence lost
I can taste the ocean on your skin
That is where it all began
I dreamed that we were elephants
Water, sun and clouds of dust
And woke up thinking we were free

I can taste the ocean on your skin
That is where it all began
We all go back to where we belong
We all go back to where we belong
This really what you want
This really what you want

I can taste the ocean on your skin
That is where it all began
We all go back to where we belong
We all go back to where we belong
This really what you want
This really what you want
