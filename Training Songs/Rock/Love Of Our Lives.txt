I opened my hands up to see what I've got.
My days slip like coins into a slot.
They are gone, the shadows lie long.

I've been banking on a broken machine.
Left unattended, like most of my dreams.
Rusted components of an unmarked song

We've been staring down a brilliant dream
The sun burns our eyes.
We've been fighting for the love of our lives

All around us things come apart.
Broken pieces. broken hearts,
Fix me, oil me, match me with the next best thing.

Person to person, nation to nation
Heels dug in no communication.
While the time speaks of weathering

We've been wanting to be helped by binding ties
We've been fighting for the love of our lives

And when it breaks down, I beg you don't go.
A sinking ship, I'm ready to blow.
I try to out think you with an army of words,
I strategize.
I am fighting for the love of my life

Fire and water, oxygen
Scotch and soda, or any combination
Starts the reaction.

Is there no mastermind of modern day
Who can blueprint a plan to make love stay
Steady and weatherproof usher in a new revolution?

After trying more, the hopeful ones still try.
How can we help it
When we're fighting for the love of our live?

(Trying more) The hopeful ones still try.
How can we help it
When we're fighting for the love of our lives?
