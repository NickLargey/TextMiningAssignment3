Found
Left was a needless contender extending
Comprehending
The balance to stand
Tall invested in cooperative landing contradiction in the flow
Drowning falling
Embracing careless default
It disproves upon the calendar day
Paused trailing
We're all lost in the day
Sinking to a place to call
Something, something making its way to function from
All logistic thoughts and cautious reactions are undone
While this high wire
We're strung from leaves us exposed and overcome
Accept, accept
Lasting elation bridging anticipation
All the while holding our breath
Can it, can it stop from dissoving my thoughts
Stranded broken withdrawn
A body left to steady and actualize
Now it's focused
Withdrawn
A body left to steady and actual
All logistic thoughts and cautious reactions are undone
While this high wire
We're strung from leaves us exposed and overcome
Accept, accept
