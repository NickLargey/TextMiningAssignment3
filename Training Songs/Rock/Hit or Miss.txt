Met on the dance floor of the palais de danse
Feelin' kinda lonely thought I'd take a chance
I never thought it would turn out like this
Another case of hit or miss

I gave you everything that money could buy
Things for your wardrobe things to get you high
I never wanted you to bring it back
I didn't see you stab me in the back

Another hit or miss another hit or miss
Another chance of hit or miss
Another hit or miss another hit or miss
And I was looking for a kiss

When you were fallen I put up with a lot
I took your cheating I took all you got
The sun was setting for what he had got
You took my money spent the whole damn lot

Another hit or miss another hit or miss
Another chance of hit or miss
Another hit or miss another hit or miss
And I was looking for a kiss

Why does it always end like this
Why does it always end like this

Another hit or miss another hit or miss
Another chance of hit or miss
Another hit or miss another hit or miss
And I was looking for a kiss

Don't be beaten dont you feel so down
About the rumours that you put around
I think I'll call this girl who lives nearby
Take her down and have another try

Another hit or miss another hit or miss
Another chance of hit or miss
Another hit or miss another hit or miss
And I was looking for a kiss
