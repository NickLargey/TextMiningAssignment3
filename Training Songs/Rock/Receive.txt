I wake up and search things first
I'm of service
I make sure your needs are met, I'm so selfless
I give hard and serve hard and now I, I need a break
I give in, I give all and now it’s time to regenerate

Today’s all about me, all about cup filling
Today’s all about me learning how, how to receive
How to receive,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I move on through offerings, I find exciting
In this slow on list of worth of understanding
I give hard, ṗrovide hard and now I need some relief
I look out, I prefer and now I need some respect and ?

Today’s all about me, all about cup filling
Today’s all about me learning how, how to receive
How to receive,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

My habit to love you first, in me it lingers
To renew is so knee-jerk leaves me a stranger
I give hard and fight hard and now I need to retreat
I give out, dedicate and now I need to acknowledge me

Today’s all about me, all about cup filling
Today’s all about me learning how, how to receive
How to receive,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

How to receive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
How to receive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
How to receive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
How to receive
