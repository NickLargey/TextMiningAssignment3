Operator
Never had a dream last for so long
You should have seen her
She wore the sound of all to come

Imitator
Telling lies when I need hope
Instigator
Setting fire to my rope

Inspirator
Seeds of good will grow in me
Animator
She shows me what I need to see

Annihilator
One step forward in a world of speed
Violator
She desires other men than me

Perpetrator
Doing wrong for all to see
Confiscator
She takes your heart then lets it bleed

Will I ever meet her
Is she for real and to be found
'Cause to me sir
She was that great October sound
