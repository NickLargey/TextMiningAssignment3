?SOMEBODY HELP ME?
Recorded by Gene Vincent on Capitol Records 1958
 Song written in 1957 by Bob Kelly BMI

I've got a bone to pick with this world,
I'm not very handsome, I can't find a girl.
I ask the aid of the whole Universe.
I'm not very happy, it could be worse.

Somebody Help Me----eeee.
Somebody Help Me----eeee.
Somebody Please, Somebody Please Help Me---eeee.

I'm in luck now that I've found,
the birds and the bees are helping me round.
The birds are singin' their songs of cheer,
Love will escape me, I fear.

Chorus
 =======SOLO======
Moon is a glitter from up above,
but I've yet to find me someone to love,
the breeze keeps whispering to my ear,
lonesome Baby without you here.

Chorus
 ========SOLO======
Stars are twinklin in the sky,
finally caught this little girls eye.
I've stopped roamin this country over,
Luck has found me, I've got a four leaf clover.

Chorus
Somebody Please, Somebody Please Help Me.
