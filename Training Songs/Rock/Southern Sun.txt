In all you'll see
What was it that came down on me that night
A conjuring, I held on to that moment
And lie just to make it alive

I stood out there in the covering
In the baskings of a holy night
And I was lucid and conscious
And hovering like a firefly
My mind stretched out on the canopy
It put its arms out slow
And I heard the whispers of silence floating down from the radio

So come on, come on I'm ready now
I got the feeling honey like I'm ready to roll
You see I'm not gonna wait till the end of me
'Cause I got the burning fire in bed of my soul

I saw the light from a kettle gun
Sixteen days under a Southern Sun
And there were times when I thought that
I wouldn't mind it if I lost my mind out there
You wouldn't believe me if I told you so
The things I saw were enough to make the man in me
A man in me, make a man of me

So come on, come on I'm ready now
Go get your things out honey, let's get ready to roll
Oh I can feel the wave coming over me
I've been waiting for this day too long just to let it all go

As a child I was wonder-eyed at the thought that I might know
A life in the ecstasy of Rock'n Roll
O-oh-oh i'm not taking it slow
I'm an arrow in a bow
You think that I don't know, what it is that makes me glow

So come on, come on I'm ready now
I got the feeling honey like I'm ready to roll
You see I'm not gonna wait till the end of me
'Cause I got the burning fire in the bed of my soul
