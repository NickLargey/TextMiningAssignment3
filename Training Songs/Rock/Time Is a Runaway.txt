Roll your windows down
The summer's nearly gone
And only hours stand between you
And the cold that's coming on

And you count your questions
In the sky lit blue
And every color there is
Telling you

Time is a runaway
Coming for you
Time is a runaway
Coming for you

In my dreams I see in red
She cannot stay
And the summer leaves you
Like the girl who gets away

We sit here stranded
In a careless hue
And every color that is
Telling you

Time is a runaway
It's coming for you
Time is a runaway
Coming for you

Time is a runaway
It's coming for you
Time is a runaway
She's coming for you

In the morning when I rise
She's coming on to tell me

Time is a runaway
Coming for you
Time is a runaway
Coming for you

Time is a runaway
Coming for you
Time is a runaway
Coming for you
