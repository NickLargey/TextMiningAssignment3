When tear gas falls and bullets fly
I’m going to stay right by your side
The police push and you just smile
They could never match your style

All winter we will march
By spring this town is ours

Oh Camila
You have a fire in your heart
They tried to say this was impossible
But I know you’ll prove them wrong

Oh Camila
You have the people in your palm
They’re overflowing in the plaza
Here to sing your rebel song

Assassins stalk and insults fly
I know you’re not afraid to die
And when I look into your eyes
I know that now neither am I

Hear the cacerolazos start
Banging down the boulevard

Oh Camila
Now the future is on the way
The workers are resisting
And the students chant your name

Oh Camila
We’ve been saving for today
Let me carry your umbrella
Let’s go walking in the rain

Oh Camila
You put a fire in my heart
I don’t know what’s going to happen
But I want to do my part

Oh Camila
If it all goes up in flames
Once the lies and greed and fear burns out
The truth is what remains remains remains
