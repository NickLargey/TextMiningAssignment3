I only meant to love you
Didn't you know it babe
Didn't you know it
Why couldn't you be content
With the love I gave oh yeah
I gave you my heart
But you wanted my mind, oh yeah
Your love scared me to death, boy
Oh it's the chokin' kind
That's all it is

You can kill a girl
With a bottle of poison or a knife
I know you can
And hurt her more to take her pride
And run his life
Oh it's a shame boy
Whatever it is boy
I surely hope you find, oh yeah
I tell you that hat don't fit my head
Oh, it's the chokin' kind

It makes me want to
Oh yeah, oh listen to me
When you fall in love again boy
Take a tip from me oh yeah
If you don't like the peach,
Then walk on by the tree
That's what you better do, honey
Find what you want boy
Keep it, treat it, sweet and kind, oh yeah
Oh let it breathe, don't make it the chokin' kind
Oh no, don't break my heart baby
Oh no, I know you love me truly I do, honey
But your love scares me to death boy
It's the chokin' kind
That's all it is
