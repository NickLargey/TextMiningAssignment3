She takes a swim then takes a dive
She takes a swing and she can hit
Muddy water
Dirty ditch

Take a swim and walk with me,
Make a steal, the Christmas Tree
Hold the water, hold my hand
Takes its time and time again

Oh, there is no reason
Time to go, oh there is
No reason, play the show
Oh there is no reason

Desperation number five
She takes a swim
Then takes a dive
She tries to hold her, hold

Her hand, the down the muddy
Hand again
