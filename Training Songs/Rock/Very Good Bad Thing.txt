It is a shame to see this go
But with a dig in the grave
Diggin' the black hole.
It was insane, the way we'd roll
You know the world at large
Is like a little rag doll
We were the big, bad pitbull

Try to get out but we just keep stickin' around
'Cause it is a very good bad thing we've found.

I am in pain to see this go
But we were putting a hole in our hearts,
With a poison arrow
It was deranged the way we'd roll
You know that everything around was like a little bitty town
We were the old tornado

Try to get out but we just keep stickin' around,
'Cause it is a very good bad thing we've found.
Try to get out but we just stay stuck on the ground, layin' down,
'Cause it is a very good bad thing we've found.

Stay another day, stay another night
I've got some cigarettes, I've got some stuff to try
We'll make sick silhouettes (sick, sick silhouettes)
We'll make our mamas cry
We'll play Russian roulette (play Russian roulette)
We'll play 'til we die
Die die d-die d-d-die die
You and I'm
Gonna kill you yeah
You gonna kill me, true
Gonna leave a little note,
Just a little bad poem,
Gonna say true love is just a good bad joke.
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Try to get out but we just keep stickin' around,
'Cause it is a very good bad thing we've found.
Try to get out but we just stay stuck on the ground, foolin' down,
'Cause it is a very good bad thing we've found.
'Cause it is a very good bad thing we've found.
('Cause it is a very good bad thing we've found)
'Cause it is a very good bad thing we've found.
