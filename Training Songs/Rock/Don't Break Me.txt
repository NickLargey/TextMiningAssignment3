Sitting in the corner 
Don't know what to think 
I can't speak 
I sink a little deeper with every drink 
I try to sleep 
I shut my eyes 
Like a leaky faucet fear floods the room 

The one that drips away 
Patiently by day 
It was either lost or it was stolen but 
It's been missing for too long 
I woke up one morning 
I couldn't see the sunrise 
I can't recall 

The exact moment now but 
It began some time ago 
And it makes me wonder after all I've done 
What have I got to show
What have I got to show
What have I got to show

I'm aggravated 
I'm what you created 
Now don't break me
