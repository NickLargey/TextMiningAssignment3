Woke up from our sleep
With the crying of a newborn child
Floating with relief
Yet a bubble heading for a spike
The sketch for a dream
And the moon competing with the stars
Now that I can smell the rain to wash the weight from us
'Cause we'll go far - without you
We'll go far - further than you
We'll go far - without you
It is in our hearts
In our beauty that we've found tonight
Revealing receipts
But I don't want to pay for what is mine
There's scars joining tears
What did take me so long just to find
That me within me I've left to leave it all behind
'Cause we'll go far - without you
We'll go far
Misunderstood
We'll go far - without you
We're dancing down there slow
Now burning down below
Knocked down but off we go
We're here to leave you
We've found our way home 'cause we'll go far - without you
We'll go far
Misunderstood
We'll go far - without you
We're dancing down there slow
Now burning down below
Knocked down but off we go
We'll go far
