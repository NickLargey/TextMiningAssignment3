All those Elvis records circling the earth
I think I've said four times over
Were you present at the birth?
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

How we wonder what you are
Spin a web of dreams
And die for us on a cross of pills
Your not too dumb to see

A manager of schools of thought
Parasites who scheme
I'm writing up the holocaust
Of all those broken dreams

Rock and roll Babylon on the brink
Gives a little slap come on, wink
To beckon the stars down from the sky

Rock and roll Babylon on the brink
Gives a little slap come on, wink
To beckon the stars down from the sky

Can you hear me lady diamond
In your home from home?
When your mommy calls you in
Are you oblivious to the throne?

That the farm's reserved for you
The effigy's in stone
We loved you lady diamond
Though we lost you in the zone

Tightrope walker
Take all our chances for us
Tightrope walker
Take all our chances for us

Oh, come on and be a tightrope walker
Take all our chances for us
Tightrope walker
Take all our chances

Who killed Johny Moondog
Was the assassin you and me?
To oversell the antidote
Or is it down to Jack and Jerry Lee?
If you bite a chunk out of the moon
Will it help you see?
