I've heard there's a place where we go to die 
It's a terribly overrated horse-shit shaped hole in the sky 
Kick off your heels and come with me tonight 
And we'll pack up your car and we'll board up the house 
And we'll die for our country though it never loved us 
And it didn't need us these wonderful wonderful people 
Will read of our love in newspapers and cry 

So may the bridges we burn light the way 
Out of the darkness of where we have been 
Though at times it may feel like a lie 
We both know nothing is quite as it seems 
When the debris comes falling from the sky 
Heaven will still be ours 

Load up Old Bill's twelve-gauge and meet me by the lake 
There's a place I know where nobody goes down by the old interstate 
The future gets shorter the longer we wait 
So let's step on the gas and if they come to find us 
We'll run to the hills they say hills never loved us 
But since we were children these wonderful wonderful people 
Will read of our love on our tombstones and cry 

And someone will get all the glory 
But I'll have yours and you'll have mine, you'll have mine 

So may the bridges we burn light the way 
Out of the darkness of where we have been 
Though at times it may feel like a lie 
We both know nothing is quite as it seems 
And I know when I look into the deep blue of your eyes 
Heaven will still be ours 

We'll be together until hell, 
Until hell, until hell freezes over 
Until hell, until hell, 
Until hell, freezes over. 
Together until hell, until hell 
Until hell, freezes over. 
Until hell, until hell, 
Until hell, freezes over. 

So may the bridges we burn light the way 
Out of the darkness of where we have been 
Though at times it may feel like a lie 
We both know nothing is quite as it seems 
Then when the world is itself about to die 
Our story will still play itself on the screens 
And all these stars that come falling from the sky 
Will always be ours
