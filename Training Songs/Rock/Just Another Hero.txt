A deal of pain he's taken
A pretty price he's paid
Got to join the forces
No need to be afraid
Good old times have gone now
He has to make a try
A shame to human nature
Country makes him fight or die

Just another hero with roses on his grave
Just another hero that Jesus could have saved
Just another hero drowning in his fears
Just another hero but Maggie has no tears

He was a criminal
With handcuffs on his wrists
But now they make him a hero
To fight with guns not fists
Three million is a problem
So they say the army's fair
Because the nameless government
Couldn't even care
