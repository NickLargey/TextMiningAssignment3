Open my grave and
Let the sun shine in
'Cause I am just a lost soul
Help me to grow
Show me the way
The way into your heart
Oh, can't you see
How I'm dying? I've got no
Reason to be proud
Drink this water around
Me before I drown
God save the queen
But why can't god save me
All the flowers die tonight
Tear drops falling
Down my face
And all the candles lose
Their flames
And the more we grow
The less we know
Until the time
We lose it all
Look at me now
I'm broken and empty
Why does it always
Rain on me?
Give me your heart
So I can live
God save the queen
But why can't god save me
All the flowers die tonight
Tear drops falling
Down my face
And all the candles lose
Their flames
