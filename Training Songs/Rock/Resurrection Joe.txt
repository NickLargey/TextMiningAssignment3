I said hep cats, sinners, brats
Suck on this for sunshine
This is the resurrection
Yea, of the good times
I said hep cats, sinners, brats
Sunshine
This is the resurrection
Yea, yea, yea, of the good times

I said hep cats, sinners, brats
Suck on me for sunshine
This is the resurrection, yea
Yea, of the good times

Resurrection Joe
Resurrection Joe

Two soldiers went marching
Well, down an open road
With a guilty load
One turned, the other said
I am dead
This is my calling on to you
My resurrection for you, yea

I said
Hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep
Suck on this
For the sunshine

Resurrection Joe
Resurrection Joe
