"I Don't Want to Know"
Hey!
I know where you live, yea
And I want to live there too
I drive buy almost everyday, its not even really on my way
When am I gonna get to see you?
It won't be misunderstood
It won't do you any good
Think I'm not the one you could
But I know that you would
I don't want to know if you don't want me, no
(Don't want me, no)
I don't want to know if you don't want me, no
Hey!
I have a shirt that belongs to you
And I use it to guess all the things you do
I already met your mom and dad
Said I'm the best one you never had
And I think you should really reconsider
It won't be misunderstood
It won't do you any good
Think I'm not the one you could
But I know that you would
I don't want to know if you don't want me, no
(Don't want me, no)
I don't want to know if you don't want me, no
I watched you through the window last night
And I thought I saw a girl in the candlelight
You think that's fair after all I've done?
Restraining orders one by one
And I sure hope that was your sister
I guess you misunderstood
Didn't do you any good
That you thought I never could
Now you know that I would
Now you know that I would
Now you know that I Would
I don't want to know if you don't want me, no
(Don't want me, no)
I don't want to know if you don't want me, no
