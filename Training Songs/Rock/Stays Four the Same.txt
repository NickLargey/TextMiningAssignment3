I could've wrote down
Every thought I've been thinking to myself all this past year.
But would it stand out
"Oh, I wanna make myself clear."
And baby, clearly
I need some balance in my ears right now
'Cause I've been freaking myself out
And I've been waking this whole town.

And then I turned myself inside out
La da da da da
And it's all about
The way your hips move
Side to side,
Left to right,
Guide me home tonight.

And I need a little more thunder, a little more lightning.
A little more you,
Be my lantern.
Help me shine on through.

So I said,
I, I gotta comb my brain for the words to say.
And if you don't feel right then it's a wasted night
The price to pay is so, so high.
And the irony could be cut with a knife.
'Cause its my first chance.
But it's my last chance.

And then I turned myself inside out
La da da da da
And it's all about
The way your hips move
Side to side,
Left to right,
Guide me home tonight.

And I need a little more thunder, a little more lightning.
A little more you,
Be my lantern.
Help me shine on through.

Baby,
Well I gotta have you loving me tonight.
And when my world has become a whirlwind
Will you be my white flag?

Speed it up like sugar,
I'm a wreck and you know that I can't do a thing about it, about it.
Break it down,
I'm on my knees,
Baby take another chance, oh please.
I'm affordable, I'm trainable
When you're taking me out, I'm taking you in.

I gotta migrate a catastrophe.
I stood strong,
It was the best for me.
My town is irrela-relavant.
Blue eyes match my green lies
Yeah!

And I need a little more thunder, a little more lightning.
A little more you,
Be my lantern.
Help me shine on through.
And I need a little more thunder, a little more lightning.
A little more you,
(Give me more of you)
Be my lantern.

Help me shine on through.

And when my world has become a whirlwind
Will you be my white flag?
