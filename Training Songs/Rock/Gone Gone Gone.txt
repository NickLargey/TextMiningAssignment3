Some sunny day, baby 
When everything seems OK, baby 
You'll wake up and find that you're alone 
'Cause I'll be gone 
Gone, gone, gone, really gone, gone, gone, gone 
'Cause you done me wrong 

Everyone that you meet, baby 
As you walk down the street, baby 
Will ask you why you're walkin' all alone 
Why you're on your own 
Just say I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, really gone 
'Cause you done me wrong 

If you change your ways, baby 
You might get me to stay, baby 
You better hurry up if you don't wanna be alone 
'Cause I'll be gone 
Gone, gone, gone, really gone, gone, gone, gone 
'Cause you done me wrong
