Now, things was looking golden, baby
Everything was fine
You never made no sign
That you had changed your mind

I guess I was mistaken, girl
To count so on you
What else could I do
Time to pay my dues

Well girl, I've been torn up before
But I can't handle that once more
Well I been down for a long long time
And now it's time to reach my mind
There's lots of pain upon this earth
Girl, I've had my money's worth
I have had my ups and downs and all around

Girl, I've tried to change your way of thinkin'
Tried to make you see
Well, livin' here with me
Is where you ought to be

But it didn't seem to make no difference
It never changed your world
Or stopped your social twirl
You're still the same old girl

And now, I've been torn up before
But I can't handle that once more
I been down for a long long time
But now it's time to reach my mind
'Cause there's lots of pain upon this earth
And girl, I've had my money's worth
I have had my ups and downs and all around

I've been up, down, all around now baby 
I've been up, I been down, I been all around now baby 
Yeah we've both been up and down and all around baby
You go up, you go down, you go all around now baby 
Yes, I'm up, I'm down, all around now baby 
Up and down and all around
