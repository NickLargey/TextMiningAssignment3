Here it comes again.
Don't let it pass you by like the city-bound train.
You know it's up to us
To lead the way and march toward victory.
Standin' on the right side; who knows what's right?

Don't look now; seems like we're trapped somehow.
I'm not sure if we'll ever make it out of here alive.
Don't look now; seems like we're trapped somehow.
Time is almost up, but the war has just begun.

We're stuck inside a place,
And soon we'll have to face the outside world.
The anger on the street
Begins to raise some heat, and we're almost out of time.
