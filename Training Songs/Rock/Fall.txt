Words are spoken, swallowed in vain 
Slowly, I'm choking 
I cough it up, cough it up, cough it up again 
Familiar, familiar 
Laughing, laughing at the man who 
Never had a chance to dream your dreams 
Find it funny here today, you know 
But, if by tomorrow, you might wonder then 
Why your seeds are weeds 
Familiar, familiar 
Familiar, is it familiar? 

[Chorus]
Open up - There's a river in us all 
Open up - From the cradle where we crawl 
Open up - It's so unusual 
Open up - Cause sitting on the wall 

Everybody's got to fall 
Oh, show me, show me a reason 
A reason for, anything I see 
Round and round and round and round, we go 
What happened to my brother? 
Will his flowers wither? 
Just like me, yeah 
Familiar, familiar 
Familiar, is it familiar? 

[Chorus]

I am no preacher, I know no teachings 
Sway my mind, dear with your primal screeching 
Buried under, your plastic cover 
You are me, and I am you 

[Chorus]
