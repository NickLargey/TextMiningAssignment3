Tangerine, turning green
Cellophane, window pane
Socialize, paralyzed
Plastic faces suck me dry

Tangerine, tangerine
Tangerine, tangerine

I know, it's sad
Life's just a piece of fruit
Touch down, new ground
Stop living on the moon

I know, it's sad
Life's just a piece of fruit
Touch down, new ground
Stop living on the moon

Twenty eight, suffocate
Take a ride, see me fly
Detonate, feel it break
See myself disintegrate

Tangerine, tangerine
Tangerine, tangerine

I know, it's sad
Life's just a piece of fruit
Touch down, new ground
Stop living on the moon

I know, it's sad
Life's just a piece of fruit
Touch down, new ground
Stop living on the moon

See it as I climb
The rain burns in my eyes
So catch me as I fall away

Tangerine, tangerine
Tangerine, tangerine
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I know, it's sad
Life's just a piece of fruit
Touch down, new ground
Stop living on the moon

I know, it's sad
Life's just a piece of fruit
Touch down, new ground
Stop living on the moon

I know, it's sad
Life's just a piece of fruit
Touch down, new ground
Stop living on the moon

I know, it's sad
Life's just a piece of fruit
Touch down, new ground
Stop living on the moon
