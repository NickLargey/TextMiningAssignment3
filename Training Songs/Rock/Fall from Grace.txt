We had no warning, now it's too late
The earth is trembling, is this our fate how
Long will it take? before all is lost lost,
There's no mistake shall every angel fall
We watch them turn into flames

into the heat, out of the night no end is
Yet in sight could it be? it's the end of all light

I see them falling all around me
Scorched by the fire, wings are burning

into the heat, out of the night no end is
Yet in sight could it be? it's the end of all light

to heaven I gaze the angels are
Descending and now as they fall from
Grace we pray and start repenting the
Heaven I face in awe, they are descending
And now as they fall from grace we pray

and start repenting I hear the people chanting his name
Without hope, within the dark no one else to blame all
We feel is fear and shame
