Well I'm sick of hanging out on the street
Every saturday night with the boys
Listening to the radio's big beat
We crank it just to hear the noise

Yeah we talk about the girls, girls, girls
And we talk, talk, talk all night
Sure we're all romeos and casanovas
But we can't seem to get it right

Seems I'm making it harder and harder
While everybody else is doing well
I get confused by their bodies
I get tangled in their curls
How do you talk to girls
How do you talk to girls
What's a poor boy to do
Tell me how do you talk to girls? 
How do you talk to girls? 

I see this girl over there right away
I'm trying to think of something to say
Well I think I'll have one more drink
I'll be ready to make my play
But this guy moves in and he talks to her
And she nods her head
Well I'm used to missing out on the girl
But I want to know what he said

Seems I'm making it harder and harder
While everybody else is doing well
I get confused by their bodies
I get tangled in their curls
How do you talk to girls? 
How do you talk to girls? 
What's a poor boy to do
I'm tangled up in their curls

How do you talk to girls? 
How do you talk to girls? 
Out of wisdom and out of pearls
Tell me how do you talk to girls

Am I stupid or misunderstood
I'd say something clever if I only could
We're only ten feet apart
But it feels like the world

How do you talk to girls? 
How do you talk to girls? 
Out of wisdom and out of pearls
Tell me how do you talk to girls
