You hurt me like a punch in the mouth
You didn't have to hurt me so bad
You coulda left me something to live for
But you took the only love that I had

I'm gonna go on down to the roller rink
And roll my blues away
Gonna strap on a pair of roller skates
And roll 

Blue, downhearted too
But I made up my mind
What I'm gonna do
