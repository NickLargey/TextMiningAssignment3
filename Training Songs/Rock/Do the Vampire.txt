In a car crash 
In a bedfire 
Do the backlash 
Do the vampire 
In the same place 
With a straight face 
Twist the knife out 
Do the hip-shake 

Dead on the inside 
Dead on the inside 
We don't wanna know 
Dead on the inside 
We don't want to know a secret 
We don't think it bears repeating 
We don't want to know what's really going on

In a car chase
On a tripwire 
Do the headcase 
Do the vampire 

Dead on the inside 
Dead on the inside 
We don't wanna know 
Dead on the inside 
We don't want to know a secret 
We don't think it bears repeating 
We don' want to know what's really going on
