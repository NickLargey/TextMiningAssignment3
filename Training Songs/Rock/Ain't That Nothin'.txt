You're pushin' a furnace
You're workin' too hard
You're setting things off all over the yard
You play with your 'top' till your eyes start to spin
Then you shrug your shoulders and ask me where I've been
Travel fulfills you but the distance it kills you
Oh oh ain't that nothin'
Why don't you tell me somethin'
Tragedy

Ain't that nothin'
I just wish you'd tell me something
The fan keeps whirling
The wind stays hot but I can't keep from slippin' a lot
I look in that purse
It's a blessing and a curse
Discover dishonor with its thousand commands
It ain't worth a shot
That target is sand
But I love disaster and I love what comes after
