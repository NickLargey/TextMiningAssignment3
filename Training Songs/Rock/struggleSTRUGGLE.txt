I only want you to know the pavement
With a distant move that ruins everything
One step on the ground, a crystal is born
If you ignore the siren, my hands will turn to ice

Let's steal from anything, everything resembling law
We don't really believe anything, everything the sky says to us
Let's hide from anyone, everyone that blew a ballon
We don't really believe anything, everything that helium cries

Struggle, struggle to the end
Struggle, struggle, that's the game
Struggle, struggle to the end
Struggle, struggle

You've gone as long as the day can last
With a stick of finite, it hurts to keep myself
Follow stone, you think you had it hard
Cheap trick, it's passing its way through

Let's steal from anything, everything resembling law
We don't really believe anything, everything the sky says to us
Let's hide from anyone, everyone that blew a ballon
We don't really believe anything, everything that helium cries

Struggle, struggle to the end
Struggle, struggle, that's the game
Struggle, struggle to the end
Struggle, struggle

Struggle, struggle to the end
Struggle, struggle, that's the game
Struggle, struggle to the end
Struggle, struggle
