When I saw him on the corner
Then I knew that I was a goner
I've had it, yeah, I've had it

When you say that I should phone
Then I do and there's nobody home
I've had it, yeah, I've had it

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I've had it, yeah, I've had it

When you say that you'll keep a date
Then you show up two hours late
I've had it, yeah, I've had it

When you say that I should phone
Then I do and there's nobody home
I've had it, yeah, I've had it

When I saw him on the corner
Then I knew that I was a goner
I've had it, oh you don't know,
But I've had it, yeah

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I've had it, yeah, I've had it
