I've walked beside you through a thousand dreams
Sometimes I wonder where the journey leads
We never seem to get to where we want to go...no...
I won't betray the trust you have in me
I'll never lose my faith in what can be
Don't ever be afraid to let your feelings show...no...
Nothing to fear, no place to hide
We got to face the truth inside

Let the light that shines in your eyes shine on me
Let it shine forever
Let the light shine on me
We can build a dream together now

One in a million are the odds we face
One in a million that's a chance I'll take
Cause when the moment comes I'll take my chance with you
And when it's more than you can bear
You call my name and I'll be there

So hard to find your way out of the dark
Let the light shine from your heart...
