Your sun
Doesn't make it easy for me
Way I breathed before
Now I don't breathe - no more freely
And I like
To catch the shoulder where you cry
My business 
A message in the sky
If it's a long time coming
Just carry, carry somebody else's blame
If it's a long time coming
Let us start the speech again
My clown 
Hooked the rose between his teeth
Stole into the night
To my laugh was quiet relief
And your spice, let me roll it through my tongue
When I'm caught and older
I'll still be caught beneath this sun

And everybody was here
They was telling their own sad stories
I'm sorry I'm not so clear
And time will take you aside
You better cover your eyes, or you'll cry
Cause I know sunset's
I know sunset's
I know sunset's arrived

Your light 
Let the shadows take it down
There's no sense in the beginning 
With the cover on your frown
And my light 
Makes the shade, a shade too black
And though I choose this
You still choose to have me back 

And everybody was here
They was telling their own sad stories
I'm sorry I'm not so clear
And time will take you aside
You better cover your eyes, or you'll cry
Cause I know sunset's
I know sunset's
I know sunset's arrived

While you were out yonder
Checking out the scene
Maybe you'll lose your thunder
Maybe you'll lose your dream

And my heat
Is only striking hot for you
Cause I'm not shaking easy
I'm just acting from your one
And "Hey Boss!"
You couldn't make it on your own
Sure I've stamped you easy
And I'll lead you back to home

And everybody was here
They was telling their own sad stories
I'm sorry I'm not so clear
And time will take you aside
You better cover your eyes, or you'll cry
Cause I know sunset's
I know sunset's
I know sunset's arrived
