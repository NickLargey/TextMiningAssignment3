Would you like to be down in
The hole just to see if you get out,
Now where would you go baby
Want to fly high out of control
Then you'd be a birdy hunted
Down alright, Lucy you're the
One alright, Lucy on the run
Would you like to see me
Runnin' around wearing the white
Ribbon, passin' it down alright,
Lucy you're the one alright,
Lucy on the run everything's
Alright, let it go everything's
Alright here, let it go
