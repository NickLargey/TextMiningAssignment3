Why must I always play the clown?
Why must I always play the clown?
Why must I always play the clown?

It makes it too easy for them to put you down
It's too late, too late, too late, too late, too late
To wash my face and hands
Am too late to get too high to get, too late
To wash my face and hands

Fall out the bath, fall in the car
Throw up just pull that window down
Let's have the beer, another beer
It's a fine idea my man

It's too late, too late, too late, always
To wash your face and hands
Too late to get too high to get
To wash my face and hands

Shes looking good, am in the mood
Step up and try to make her smile
Try to make her smile
I need a line this time, a chat up kind
To steal the deal in time

Why must I always play the clown?
Why must I always play the clown?
Why must I always play the clown?

It makes it too easy for them to put you down
It's too late, too late, too late, too late, too late
To wash my face and hands
Am too late to get too high to get, too late
To wash my face and hands

I fall up the stairs, fall into bed
Throw up and pull the window down
Pull the window down
Let's have a line another line
Now there's a fine idea my man

It's too late, too late, too late, always
To wash your face and hands
Too late to get too high to get
To wash my face and hands

Why must I always play the clown?
Why must I always play the clown?
Why must I always play the clown?

It makes it too easy for them to put you down
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, ooh

Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late

Why must I always play the clown?
Always play the clown
Why must I always play the clown?
Why must I always play the clown?
See I always play the clown
Why must I always play the clown?
