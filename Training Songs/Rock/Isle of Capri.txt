[Chorus:]
Twas on the Isle of Capri
That I found her
Beneath the shade
Of an old walnut tree
Oh, I can still see
The flowers blooming around her
Where we met
On the Isle of Capri

She was as sweet
As the rose of the dawning
But somehow Fate
Hadn't meant her for me
And though I sailed
With the tide in the dawning,
Still my heart's
On the Isle of Capri

Summertime was nearly over
Blue Italian skies above
I said, lady, I'm a rover
Can you spare
A sweet word of love?

She whispered softly
It's best not to linger
Then as I kissed
Her hand I could see
She wore a plain golden ring
On her finger
So goodbye
To the Isle of Capri

[Chorus]
