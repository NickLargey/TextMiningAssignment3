He fancied himself a professional dreamer
Never much good at pretending to be something else
Often times he would sit there expressionless
Staring at nothing and everything at the same time

[Chorus]
Sometimes he hear voices ...
It's that space in his head you say
Sometimes he hear voices ...
Then they just seem to fade away

Gone it an instant, without notice
One minute with us, next minute miles away
This time Vienna, next time Calais
The further the better with little or no delay

[Chorus]

One day he took it a little too far
Woke up ... standing ... right where you are !
Surrounded by strangers and stranger surroundings
Staring at nothing and everything at the same time

Sometimes he hear voices ...
It's that space in his head you say
Sometimes he hear voices ...
But they just seem to fade away
It's time to go ...
