Is this success?
Tuesday night and penniless
Sign on
Chill out
Skin up
It's your shout
Forgone, I am
In life, I'm damned

This is like Hollywood
All front, No depth, No good
This is my Hollywood
I'd run, I wish I could

Too blind, not me
I've seen the scenery
Palm trees, blue skies
Blown out, snake eyes
You're not, I am
Is this too much too understand?

This is like Hollywood
All front, No depth, No good
This is my Hollywood
I'd run, I wish I could

Who want's to live in Hollywood?
I don't think I could
You like to think you live in a world so good

This is like Hollywood
All front, No depth, No good
This is my Hollywood
I'd run, I wish I could

This is my Hollywood
This is my Hollywood
This is my Hollywood
This is my Hollywood
