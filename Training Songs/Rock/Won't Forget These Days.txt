Late at night I switch on my radio 
I sing myself a lullaby 
I close my eyes and wait 
Till the wind blows round the corner 
Bringing back the memories to me, uhh yeah 
Well we dreamed our lives, and we lived our dreams 
We've sacrificed our future for a heart of rock'n roll 

Won't forget these days 
And I never thought I would 
Won't forget these days,uhh I 
Won't forget these days 
And I never thought I would 
Won't forget these days 
WonÂ´t forget these days 

Everybody's so important and they all want to cheat you 
Learn it by heart, right from the start 
Bread is bread and you can even eat it 
Count what you've sold but gold remains cold 
Young boys take their dirty hands and swear 
Nothing should come between us 
But mostly it comes earlier, than anybody wants it
