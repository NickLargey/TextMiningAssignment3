You must be thinkin' something
But you ain't sayin' nothing
You remember me
I used to be your boyfriend

There ain't no point in reason
It only gets defensive
Why should we ruin the purity of the moment

It's a laugh, what a laugh
It's so stupid I gotta laugh
And the funny thing is everyone thought
We were forever

It's a laugh, what a laugh
It's so stupid that I gotta laugh
And the other thing is I really thought
That we were special

Maybe I should feel guilty
Is that the American way
But I just look at myself
As if I were above me

You must be thinkin' something
But you ain't saying nothing
You remember me, I have been here always

It's a laugh, what a laugh
It's so stupid I gotta laugh
And the funny thing is everyone thought
We were forever

It's a laugh, what a laugh
It's so stupid I gotta laugh
And the other thing is I really thought
We were special, we were forever

It's a laugh, what a laugh
It's so stupid I gotta laugh
And the funny thing is everyone thought
We were forever

It's a laugh, what a laugh
It's so stupid I gotta laugh
And the other thing is I really thought
That we were special

So strange but it's a laugh, what a laugh
It's so stupid I gotta laugh
And the other thing is everyone thought
We were forever
