Been passed by so many times fed up so long and I'm sick
Sense of pride, got  by my side I've got to trust in myself

[Chorus] 
I can't wait one minute more
Wait one minute more
Wait one minute more
I can't wait, one minute more)

Don't try to take me there Cause I won't go back
The world passes by as I sit
Count the days 'till your ship comes in
Your ship left, you missed it

[Chorus]

And I'm stillâ?¦I'm still waiting 
Been let down so many times I got the runaround and I'm pissed 
Can't keep me down, I'll take another swing 
It's the last chance, that I'll miss
 
Saving up for a rainy day As the sun went by and I slept 
Passes me by, I don't wonder why 
That it all make such sense to me 
I need room to breathe I work for the goals that I set
Wasted time weighs on my mind
You can bet
I can't wait one minute more
Wait one minute more
I can't wait one minute more
I can't wait one minute, wait one minute

Wait, wait, wait, wait
