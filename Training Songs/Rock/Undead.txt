Flies clinging to my body
Spiders crawling on the walls
Demons hovering around me trying to damn my immortal soul
Evil runs rampant
Everywhere I see
Witches and vampires lunging at me
Friends, I see them changing
My eyes are open wide
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

This ain't no Halloween
This ain't no horror flick
It's a real life movie
I think I'm getting sick

This ain't no Halloween
This ain't no horror flick
It's a real life movie
I think I'm getting sick

Darkness, circling around me
Death's waiting just outside
Souls, screaming Satan, no mercy!
Chills running through my body
Blood coming to a boil
Pounding faster, pounding in my head
This ain't no fantasy
Don't need no script at all
Annihilation's near, mankind is due to fall

This ain't no Halloween
This ain't no horror flick
It's a real life movie
I think I'm getting sick

This ain't no fantasy
Don't need no script at all
Annihilation's near
Mankind is due to fall

Undead, undead
Undead, undead
Undead, undead
Undead
