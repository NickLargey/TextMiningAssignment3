It's only life
I remind myself each day
If only I could remember what I'm doing in a room
The walls are padded down with foam

Because it takes away the sound
And alters the voices that tell me to do
What I do
They're worried that I'll want to kill

Without my pills
And they knew that I'd do
What I do
One more try

To step inside my brain
A constant fight
But I won't sleep till I can fool them
For hours they make me stare at blotches

I failed the grade
When I told them I was Jesus and I hear voices
That tell me to do what I do
