You've got to pick
Pick out a song
It's an easy way to right the wrong
And if the word
If the words, words, touch your mind
She'll be better, if you'll be kind

If you don't say
If you don't say what's in your heart
There's no better way for fallin' apart
Open the door and let
Let the sun shine
Yeah, she'll get better
She'll be better
Just give her some time
She'll get better
Just give her some time
She'll get better
'Cause there's tear, tear, tear
Tear drops in her eyes like the rain
Rain drops it's true
She'll know the reason why
She'll know why
