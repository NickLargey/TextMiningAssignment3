Don't know who's right 
 I don't know who's lying 
 But if you stay, we'll work it out alone 
 I know what I want 

That's what I'm saying 
 I want you here with me, so don't go home 
 Would you stay with me after dawn 
 If I say to you I was wrong? 

 I can stay with you for so long 
 Would you stay with me after dawn? 
 I don't know at night 
 Is this a trial? 

 But I know where you should be all the time 
 I know what I said, I wasn't lying 
 But if you do, you won't be in my life 
 Will you stay with me after dawn 

 If I say to you I was wrong? 
 I can stay with you for so long 
 Will you stay with me after dawn? 
 You can say we didn't have a fight 

 And we can go on all through the night 
 Why must I stay away? 
 And in the morning everything's the same 
 And we can go on for another day 

 Why must I stay away so long? 
 Why must I stay away? 
 What they had said 
 Don't listen to them 

 Because if you do, you won't be in my life 
 I don't know who's right 
 I don't know who's lying 
 Just stay with me and everything's alright 

 Would you stay with me after dawn 
 If I say to you I was wrong? 
 I can stay with you for so long 
 Will you stay with me after dawn?
