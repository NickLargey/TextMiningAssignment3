An eye can be a world
For in it are the things it sees outside
And the eye is troubled.

An eye can be a time
And watch the changing patterns hurry by
And the eye is wisdom.

An eye can be a clown
It makes a merry fool of merry fools
And the eye is laughing.

An eye can be a soul
For in it shines the hope for things to come
And the eye is wisdom.
