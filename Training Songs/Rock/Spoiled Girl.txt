When you got a pretty boy
You want a smart one
When you got a smart one
You want him pretty

When you got one who's all over you
You wish he'd hold back
Then when he's being cool
You want him to attack

Spoiled girl, living in her own world
Spoiled girl, thinks of nothing but herself

Someone's there to cut her hair
Will you wear it up or down
What, no bubbles for the bath?
Send the chauffeur into town
You'll have fun tonight
Now you're gonna call him up
"Hi" you say "I'll call you back"
He waits and waits but no such luck

Spoiled girl, living in her own world
Spoiled girl, thinks of nothing but herself

When you want her, you can't have her
When you need her you can't find her
She is busy keeping dizzy with the business of a little

Spoiled girl, living in her own world
Spoiled girl, thinks of nothing but herself
