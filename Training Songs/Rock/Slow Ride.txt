Well, it's warm inside
Let's take a midnight ride
I wanna show ya
Ya really show ya
It's an open road
Let's see how far it goes
I wanna show ya
Ya really show ya

Well, high flyin' low
Don't you wanna go
On that slow ride

Well, it's cold outside
But there's fire in your eyes
I wanna hold ya
Baby let me hold ya
I won't lose my nerve
On those dangerous curves
When we get rollin'
Oh really rollin'

I said, high flyin' low
Don't you wanna go
On that slow ride
Slow ride

Yeah, slide on in don't stop to sleep again
Let's get moving
Oh really movin'
Won't you hold on tight we can make it all night
Let's get movin'
Oh really movin'

I said, high flyin' low
Don't you wanna go
On that slow ride
Slow ride
Slow ride, oh yeah!
