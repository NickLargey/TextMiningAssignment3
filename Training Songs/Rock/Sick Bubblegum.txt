Mechanized head and a god named Zed
I keep telling you it's alright
A parallax view that you can't unscrew
When it all just get's so tight

Rock motherfucker
Rock the motherfucker
Rock motherfucker yeah

Rock motherfucker
Rock the motherfucker
Rock motherfucker yeah

Chew it up, spit it out
Sick bubblegum
Blow it up, stick it out
Sick bubblegum
Tear it up, push it down
Sick bubblegum
Shove it in, rip it out
Sick bubblegum

Fireproof stick and I ain't so quick
I just made you think I am
Black numb days and a model hater
Brand new illusion scare

Rock motherfucker
Rock the motherfucker
Rock motherfucker yeah

Rock motherfucker
Rock the motherfucker
Rock motherfucker yeah

Chew it up, spit it out
Sick bubblegum
Blow it up, spit it out
Sick bubblegum

Turn it up, push it down
Sick bubblegum
Shove it in, rip it up
Sick bubblegum

Remember the coup when you hit the loop
A new God in Hollywood
Diamond daze and your locust plays
You wouldn't make it if you could

Rock motherfucker
Rock the motherfucker
Rock motherfucker yeah

Rock motherfucker
Rock the motherfucker
Rock motherfucker yeah

Chew it up, spit it out
Sick bubblegum
Blow it up, spit it out
Sick bubblegum
Turn it up, push it down
Sick bubblegum
Shove it in, rip it up
Sick bubblegum
