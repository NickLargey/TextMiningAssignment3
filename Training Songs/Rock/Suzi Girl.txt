I, I hear a sound inside my head
I gotta know it, it's a product of my invention
Power of your suggestion

Thirty-two bars of electric guitars
And a choir of angels remounding the milky way

I, I see a carnaval of joy
I smell the cotton, then the merry-go-round illusion

And a marching band plays for the children who laugh with me
That's how I feel when I'm with you, Suzi girl

Suzi girl, you're my whole wide world
And I think aboutâ€¦
