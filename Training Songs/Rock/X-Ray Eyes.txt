Back in 1981 the scream and shouting had begun
My parents were still married and had their hatches buried
They told me everything would work out fine

Back in 1982 they were talking about what to do
Stay together or separate everyday that same debate
I heard them from the walls up in my room

All the kids want x-ray eyes
So they can see when grown-ups lies
They got their minds set on the price
The kids want x-ray eyes

Back in 1983 first day in school for me
Our teachers name was mary she said it's necessary that
All the kids do exactly what they're told

All the kids want x-ray
Eyes so they can see when grown-ups lies
They got their minds set on the price
The kids want x-ray eyes

Don't think I can take it I surrender mama
I'm just not felling so good
Things didn't turn out the way you told me that they would

All the kids want x-ray eyes
So they can see when grown-ups lies
They got their minds set on the price
The kids want x-ray eyes
