I don't think I have the answers that you're looking for 
Every door is boarded shut from the outside (from the outside) 
I don't think that you can do this without keeping score 
I don't think I can do this with you anymore 

There isn't anything left for you, left for you 
(To put this back together like before) 
There isn't anything left for you, left for you 
(To make me understand anymore) 
There isn't anything left for you, left for you 
(To make me want to stay) 
There isn't anything left for you 
Anything left for you but an enemy. 

I was trying everything I could to understand 
Just exactly what you were on the inside (on the inside) 
I just don't have it in me anymore to hold your hand 
I'm out of things to say and people to blame on you 

There isn't anything left for you, left for you 
(To put this back together like before) 
There isn't anything left for you, left for you 
(To make me understand anymore) 
There isn't anything left for you, left for you 
(To make me want to stay) 
There isn't anything left for you 
Anything left for you but an enemy. 

I'm trying to lead you away but I can't 
'cause trying to keep us 
Together is just something that I know I cant, 
Do (left for you, left for you) 
I know I can't, do (left for you, left for you) 
Without you. 

There isn't anything left for you 
To put this back together like before 
There isn't anything left for you, left for you 
To make me understand it anymore 
There isn't anything left for you 
Oh to make me want to stay 
There isn't anything left for you, anything left for you... 

There isn't anything left for you 
To put this back together like before 
There isn't anything left for you left for you 
To make me understand it anymore 
There isn't anything left for you left for you 
Oh you're never gonna change 
There isn't anything left for you 
Anything left for you but an enemy.
