Yellow bird, 
up high in banana tree. 
Yellow bird, 
You sit all alone like me. 

Did your lady friend
Leave the nest again?
That is very bad, 
Makes me feel so sad. 
You can fly away,
In the sky away,
You're more lucky than me. 

Yellow bird,
Up high in banana tree. 
Yellow bird,
You sit all alone like me. 

Better fly away,
In the sky away,
Picker coming soon, 
Pick from night to noon.
Black and yellow you,
Like banana too,
They may pick you someday. 

Wish that I was, 
A yellow bird,
I'd fly away with you. 
But I am not,
A yellow bird. 
So I sit; nothin' else to do. 

Yellow bird. 
Yellow bird. 
Yellow bird.
