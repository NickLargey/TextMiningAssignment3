Use every chance you've been given
She replied after several days
It's no good to be perfect
You know so well things are easy to tell
There is one thing I know
It goes like this
It's that when I lose my sleep it's you I miss

I have told you this before
And my transparent mind
Won't cover see-through hearts
I'll be straight with you now
Now I'm not what you want
Just like the rest
And you feel like you're subject to a test
But if there's one thing I know it's this
When I lose my sleep it's you I miss

You sleep all night
You know you lie awake
Tell me, yeah
And time is running out
And you know so well
It may never be

Use every chance you've been given
She is told, but it doesn't make her smile
She has no need to be perfect
She knows too well
Things are easy to tell
I have said what I thought you should know
But you never seem to recognize my face
