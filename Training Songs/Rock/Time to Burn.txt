Looking through the window, could've sworn I heard it call my name
There inside that old pawn shop, I knew my world would never be the same
Wood and wire, painted steel
But in my hands it came alive, you know it felt so real
Paid the man, took it home and played it 'round the clock (yes I did)
Something's coming over me, time to let it roll, let it rock, yeah
 Chorus:
It's time to burn, time to burn
It's time to burn, time to burn, time to burn
Played it 'til my fingers bled, when I picked it up, I couldn't put it down
Felt like holding dynamite, it lit my fuse and knocked me to the ground
Flesh and blood, sweat on steel
So alive, I can't describe how it makes me feel
Plug it in, strap it on, let me show 'em what I've got
Something's coming over me, time to let it roll, let it rock, yeah
chorus
(Instrumental break)
Standing up here on the stage, I never thought I'd end up in this place
Just hit one chord, the lights explode, and I can see it written on each face
Rich or poor, black or white
When I play this old guitar, it makes 'em feel just right
Turn it on, crank it up, gonna shake the whole damn block
Something's coming over me, time to let it roll, let it rock
chorus
It's time to burn, it's time to burn, it's time to burn, it's time to burn
