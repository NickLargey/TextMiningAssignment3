LET'S TAKE THE LONG WAY HOME
WRITER AUTRY INMAN

Let's take the long way home tonight
Maybe I can hold you tight
That old moon may be shinin' bright
Let's take the long way home tonight
'cause it ain't no fun to go straight home and then
Just kiss goodnight and you have to go in
Let's take the long way home from the dance
Maybe we will find romance
We'll cuddle up if we get the chance
Let's take the long way home tonight
Let's take the long way home and have fun
You can help me spend all my mon'
Tell your mom you won't be home till one
Let's take the long way home tonight
'cause it ain't no fun to go straight home and then
Just kiss goodnight and you have to go in
Let's take the long way home through the park
We'll be alone in the dark
It may be there that I'll win your heart
Let's take the long way home tonight
