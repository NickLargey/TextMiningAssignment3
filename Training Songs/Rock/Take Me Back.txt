Everyone tells me
I was dealt a losing hand
The way that I look
The way that I act
It's not hard to understand
Sure I got troubles
Maybe you got'em too
I'd like to explain what has happened to me
So it doesn't happen to you

I was born in Los Angeles
Many, many, many years ago
We lived out in North Hollywood then
In a steamy little bungalow
My mother, my father
My baby brother and me
Playin' cowboys all day out there in the valley
What a perfect family

Hey, hey
Get 'em up, get 'em up
Come a ti-yi
Hey

Went off to high school
When I was thirteen
I was kind of advanced
If you know what I mean
Ran into some trouble
Drinkin' heavy with my friends in the hills
My daddy had to come down to the station to get me, he say
"Where is my angry young man?"

Take me back
Baby, please take me back
I don't wanna live here by this dirty old airport, in this greasy little shack
Take me back
Baby, please take me back
Just give me a chance and we'll start all over again

Now that young girl
Was just a summertime thing
She went back to school
When the school bell rang
Now I do my laundry by myself
Every night I eat alone
Baby please, please, please
Won't you let me come back home?

Goin' off to college
Passed every test
They said, "Let's send this boy to Palo Alto
He could be one of the best"
Four years at Stanford
Worked very hard
A lot of good it did me, little tramp
Your're ruining my life

Take me back
Baby, please take me back
I don't wanna live here by this dirty old airport in this greasy little shack
Take me back, baby, baby
Baby, please take me back
Just give me a chance and we'll start all over again
Just give me a chance and we'll start all over
