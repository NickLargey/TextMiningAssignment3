Well, there's a feeling in your stomach, a light trembling at the knees
Not even knowing who the lucky fellow might be
Bridesmaids are cleaning the court-house bell
Horse-driven carriages wait patiently in hell

Happiness has been arranged for some time in July
Invitations have been sent I'm so bitter I could cry
Congratulations flown in from a long-lost friend
For the big occasion regretting that he can't attend

And as family tradition is busy making up your mind
Gallantly standing draped in his holy shroud
God's representative mumbles to a tearful crowd

I now pronounce you
I now pronounce you

Mother father wake up, you've overlooked one thing
The daughter you've planned for four years won't get to wear your ring
Instead she'll be running off into the dark of night
Straight into the hungry arms that long to hold her tight

And as family tradition is busy making up your mind
Gallantly standing draped in his holy shroud
God's representative mumbles to a tearful crowd

I now pronounce you
I now pronounce you

There's a feeling deep inside of you, a feeling that of ease
You're the sweetest thing that could ever happen for me
The bridesmaids are ringing the court-house bell
Horse-driven carriages try to cover streets to tell

And as family tradition is busy making up your mind
Gallantly standing draped in his holy shroud
God's representative mumbles to a tearful crowd

I now pronounce you
I now pronounce you
