This fear has me chilled down to the bone
And I have been haunted by these things I still have left to say
I'm weary of fighting this alone
So tired of holding on to strings much better left to fray

And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down
And this seems so complicated
When all I want is just the truth

I'm wilted and faded after all
Too strung out and burnt out to be half the man that I could be
I'll never belong inside your world
So black out the sun and leave me to play out the same old tragedy

And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me out
And this seems too complicated
When all I want is just the truth

Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me out
And this seems too complicated
When all I want is just the truth

You're my savior after all
Use your flame to guide me home
And then lay your hand on me

And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down
And this seems so complicated
When all I want is just the truth

Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me out
And this seems too complicated
When all I want is a part of you
