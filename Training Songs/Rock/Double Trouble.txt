Lay awake at night 
Oh so low Ive been troubled
Cant keep a job
I'm laid off and having double trouble
Hey, Hey, you can make it if you try
Baby, that's no lie
Living in generations of millionaires 
Hard for me to keep decent clothes to wear.

Laugh at me walking
I have no where to go
Bad luck and trouble has taken me
Got no money show.
Hey, Hey, They say you can make it if you try.

Generations of millionaires 
Hard for me to keep decent clothes to wear.
