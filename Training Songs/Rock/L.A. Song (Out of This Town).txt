She hangs around the boulevard 
She's a local girl with local scars 
She got home late 
She drank so hard the bottle ached 
And she tried 
But nothin's clear in a bar full a flies 
So she takes 
She understands when she gives it away 
She says 

Man I gotta get outta this town 
Man I gotta get outta this pain 
Man I gotta get outta this town 
Outta this town & out of L.A. 

She's gotta gun 
She got a gun she calls the lucky one 
She left a note right by the phone 
Don't leave a message 'cause this ain't no home 
And she cried 
She cried so long her tears ran dry 
Then she laughed 
'Cause she knew she was never comin' back 
She said 

Man I'm gonna get outta this town 
Man I'm gonna get outta this pain 
Man I'm gonna get outta this town 
Outta this town & out of L.A. 
It's all she loves It's all she hates It's all too much for her 
To take she can't be sure just where it ends or where 
The good life begins 
So she took a train 
To a little old town without a name 

She met a man he took her in 
But fed her all the same bullshit again 
'Cause he lied 
He lied like a salesman sellin' flies 
So she screamed 
It's a different place 
But the same old thang 
It's all I love It's all I hate It's all too much for me to take 
I can't be sure where it begins or if the good life lies within 
So she said 

Man I gotta get out of this town 
Yeah now I gotta get back on that train 
Man I gotta get out of this town 
I'm outta my pain 
So I'm goin' back to L.A.
