Looked at my window for Robinson Crusoe
All I can see is Daniel Defoe
Everyone movin' in different directions
I don't know which way I can go, tell me

Now I like the blues and I like cathedrals
I like the ladies' hands on my knee
I don't care what you think of my music
I sure care a lot what you think about me

Meanwhile, the man inside me rages
He's tryin' to be free, you know he tryin' to be released
Meanwhile, clean out your cages
The nearer you're gonna get, the closer you're gonna be

The nearer you'll get, the closer you'll be
The nearer you'll get, the closer you'll be
The nearer you get, the closer you'll be

I like the blues and I like the Beatles
I like the ladies' hands on my knee
I don't care what you think of my music
I sure care a lot what you think about me

Meanwhile, the man inside me rages
He's trying to be free, you know he's tryin' to be released
Meanwhile, clean out your cages
The nearer you're gonna get, the closer you're gonna be

The nearer you'll get, the closer you'll be
The nearer you'll get, the closer you'll be
The nearer you get, the closer you'll be
