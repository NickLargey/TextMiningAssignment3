Look into the eyes of the human race
Seemingly suspended upon space
Twilight colored flakes of light
Reminding me which way is right
Now it's time to leave
Need air to breathe
There's nothing left to say
 
Far away a voice begins to sing
Down below the ocean
Listening but never hear anything
It's not fine to dance and sing
When bells of death do ring
And they will ring
 
Now it's time to leave
Need air to breathe
There's nothing left to say
 
Take me down, take me down
Down below the ocean
Where I want to be
She may be
Down below the ocean
Where I want to be
She may be
 
Hand in hand together find the way
To the sunrise of my mind
Goin' down 
Below the ocean.
