Do you remember Marianne and Mick?
A thousand flights they had together
Everything was different then
And nothing lasts forever

Sixty six to sixty nine
It ends in tears as years go by
All of our love to you
My dear, Marianne

Marianne, you're somewhere out there
West of Dublin in a cottage of shells
Wrote a book, still making records
How it is and was is what you tell?

You have been through the mill
But you're still beautiful
All of our love to you
My dear, Marianne

Marianne, on the wall, on the losing end
Tell them all you've gone away
Still through it all you came back again
Back again, Marianne

You have been through the mill
But you're still beautiful
All of our love to you
My dear, Marianne

All of my love to you
My dear
