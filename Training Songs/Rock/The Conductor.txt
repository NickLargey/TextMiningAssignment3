Confident with your back to the audience
Tremolo strings begin with your gesturing wrist
Start the orchestra slow with an elegant air
Then a circular sweep crescendoing swell
Leo Slatkin, Dohnanyi, Previne, Depaur

[Chorus]
Your arms are calling out
They wave like a swarm of sound
You pull the sound from scores of notes
You step the stage and take control

You're conducting Ver√©se in a moment of silence
Your body directs a pulse of wind
Von Karjan, Hampton, Menuhin, Levine

[Chorus: x2]

"Control"
