The system made you and you don't care
You think your system isn't fair
You preach your ways and rights and stuff
But you're the one that is fucked up

Fight tonight, and we will see
Fight tonight, and we'll be free

Is this the way that we were taught?
The land our home and freedom brought
The place that we were born to be
The life ahead, and the truth we bleed

Fight tonight, and we will see
Fight tonight, and we'll be free
