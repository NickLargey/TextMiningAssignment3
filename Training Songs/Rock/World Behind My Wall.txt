It's raining today
The blinds are shut, it's always the same
I tried all the games that they play
But they made me insane
Life on TV
It's random, it means nothing to me
I'm writing down what I cannot see
Wanna wake up in a dream
Whoa, whoa
They're telling me it's beautiful
I believe them but will I ever know
The world behind my wall?
Whoa, whoa

The sun will shine like never before
One day I will be ready to go
See the world behind my wall
Trains in the sky
Are traveling through fragments of time
They're taking me to parts of my mind
That no one can find
I'm ready to fall
I'm ready to crawl on my knees to know it all
I'm ready to heal, I'm ready to feel
Whoa, whoa
They're telling me it's beautiful
I believe them but will I ever know
The world behind my wall?
Whoa, whoa

The sun will shine like never before
One day I will be ready to go
See the world behind my wall
See the world behind my wall
See the world behind my wall
See the world behind my wall
I'm ready to fall
I'm ready to crawl on my knees to know it all
I'm ready to heal, I'm ready to feel
Take me there
(Whoa, whoa)
Take me there
Take me there
Whoa, whoa
They're telling me it's beautiful
I believe them but will I ever know
The world behind my wall?
