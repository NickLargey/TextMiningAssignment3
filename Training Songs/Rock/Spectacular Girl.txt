She's got a life livin' in her heart
She's got these eyes well, where do I start?
Like lookin' at the deep night sky
So many worlds inside her eyes
She's a

Spectacular girl

Part of the job of bein' her man
Is knowin' when to let go of her hand
Her kind of power, it can't be reigned in
To hold her back would be a sin
She's a

Spectacular girl

She sees the beauty in things we all miss
All good things are defined by her kiss
If you're feelin' like you can't believe
Well, then, how do you explain the miracle I see?
She's a

Spectacular girl
Spectacular girl

Not a desire and not a need
Some things just happen 'cause they have to be
I'm gonna get there, I'm tellin' you, sir
I'm a man on a mission and I'm all about her
She's a

Spectacular girl
Spectacular girl

Aw yeah
My love
