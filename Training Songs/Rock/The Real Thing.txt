Every word I say, I mean it
Every single day I feel it
But sometimes when you talk
It's obvious you want to show it
So don't blow it

[Chorus]
Tell me what we got
Tell me it's a lot
Tell me it's the real thing
Tell me not to change
And always be the same
Tell me that's a good thing
It's a good thing
Tell me not to lie
Tell me not to wait
Tell me that you want 
The same things as me
Tell me that it's fate
Driving me insane
Tell me it's the real thing
That keeps me hanging on

I can read the signs between us
And I feel it's inside when you come nearer
There's a stillness in the air
Like no one else is there
And every moment stays in the moment

[Chorus]

Sometimes it hurts to watch you leave 
It feels like you're taking a part of me with you 
I never know how it'll be I guess it's just a mystery 
But is it the real thing (that keeps me hangin' on) 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
