she's got lovely dark eyes 
you know that i can't get enough to be hung, to be caught deep inside ! 
she's got a picture on her skin as she would tell me a story 
she's going mad on " paint it black " 
you know she's rockin' everyday cause rock 'n roll will never die 
you know that it's written on my back 
give her a pint of cherry beer 
give her  weed when she's in  hurry 
she's fucking cute ! but she's naughty reality   

when she's  hurried 
she's fucking cute, sometimes naughty, reality can be ugly  

she has put her life in the hand of my band 
i don't give a damn, i'm a hooligan 
you wanna be my friend?  

yes i'm a hooligan i don't belive in jesus christ 
i'm the king of the world on my skateboard 
devil is deep inside my mind, i really feel fine when i'm bad 
she's got lovely dark eyes 
you know that i can't get enough to be hung, to be caught deep inside ! 
you know she's rocking everyday cause rock 'n roll will never die 
you know that it's written on my back
  
she has put her life in the hand of my band 
i don't give a damn, i'm a hooligan 
you wanna be my friend?   

i wanna see your body moving with me ! 
what a surprise !!  

she has put her life in the hand of my band 
i don't give a damn, i'm a hooligan 
you wanna be my friend?
