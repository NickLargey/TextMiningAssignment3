Tell me what you think are we in trouble?
Feelin' sorry's never really been my struggle
Pickin' up the pieces siftin' through the rubble
Ringin' in the new year listenin' to the double

Are we outside the safe spaces of love?
Are we in space pinned down to spinning rocks?

How you freeze me
We're so cold now

Tell me where you are, am I getting warmer?
You freeze me with that look when I go undercover
Readin' me my rights when you were getting closer
I resist arrest until you say it's over

Are we outside the safe spaces of sex?
Are we in space or just feeling weightless?

How you freeze me
When it's all cold now

How you freeze me
We're so cold now

Are we outside in space? (so cold, so cold)
Are we outside in space? (so cold, so cold)
