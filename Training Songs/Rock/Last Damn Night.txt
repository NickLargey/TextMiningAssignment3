I got one hand on the bottle, and one foot in the grave
It's been too long since I stepped, but I, I, I ain't got time to waste
Three long days, boy you'd better break
When that light shines on you
Gonna want to stay forever and a day, but it's the night I belong to
Well the clock keeps ticking, and your time is running out
Well the clock keeps ticking, and your time is running, running, running, running

So, I'm gonna live my life like it's my last damn night
'Cause when the clock strikes twelve, we're all gonna go to hell
Said I'm gonna live my life like it's my last damn night
I'm gonna live my life like it's my last damn night

Well I'm five seconds closer to living six feet deep
There's seven steps to heaven, but that stairway is just to steep
Oh, my my everybody dies, but you know that I don't want to
You get eight long lives, boy you gonna cry when the ninth one creeps up on you
Well the clock keeps ticking, and your time is running out
Well the clock keeps ticking, and your time is running, running, running, running

So, I'm gonna live my life like it's my last damn night
When the clock strikes twelve, we're all gonna go to hell
Said I'm gonna live my life like it's my last damn night
I'm gonna live my life like it's my last damn night

But the clock keeps ticking
Don't pretend that you're ready to go
Well it's ticking down, and slow
I know I'll ever die, is gon' hold me
'Cause I'm running, running, running, running

So, I'm gonna live my life like it's my last damn night
When the clock strikes twelve, we're all gonna go to hell
So I'm gonna live my life like it's my last damn night
'Cause when the clock strikes twelve, we're all gonna go to hell
Said I'm gonna live my life like it's my last damn night
I'm gonna live my life like it's my last damn night
