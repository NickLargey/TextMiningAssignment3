When I was a young boy
I was workin' for the state
I wasn't makin' much money
I was stayin' out late
Go down at nighttime and
Play music in the bars
Take my breaks out underneath the stars

I was makin' some noise
I was a workin' boy up at the top of my voice
Sayin', "Look at me mama I'm makin' some noise"

I had to rock  the boat, I had to shake the tree
To see what'd fall down on me
I thought, "Maybe I can make it if I never give in
I been down before, I ain't goin' down again."

I was makin' some noise
I was a workin' boy up at the top of my voice
Sayin', "Look at me mama I'm makin' some noise"

From across the canyon a guitar plays
Through an amplifier on long delay
It was an old melody, I recognized the song
I had an amplifier too, so I played along

I'm makin' some noise, I'm still a working boy
Up at the top of my voice
Sayin', "Look at me Mama I'm makin' some noise."
I'm makin' some noise, I been a long gone boy
