If  you don't want my love
If you don't need my love
Baby, give it back
Baby, give it back
If  you don't want my love
If you don't need my love
Baby, give it back
Baby, give it back

When I found you stranded on a highway
I took you home in town 
I also taught you how to live good
And now you want to move me down

If  you don't want my love
If you don't need my love
Baby,  give it back
Baby, give it back

I know your tried to make a decision
Between him or  me
But knowing in you all the time you got something
That you feel you need, yeah baby
If  you don't want my love
If you don't need my love
If you don't want it
If you don't want it
If you don't need it
find somebody else

If  you don't want my love
If you don't want it,
If you don't need it,
Give it back
If you don't want my love

Give it back
