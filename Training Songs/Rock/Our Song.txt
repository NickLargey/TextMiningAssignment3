Our song, we used to call it 'Our Song'
It helped us say hello once
It made us fall in love once
Without knowing
And how we tried so not to show it
Even though we didn't know it

Our song became just a little bit sadder
But it didn't seem to matter
Even when I kissed you
I couldn't please you, oh
And then all at once our love was gone
All you left me was our song

Every time I hear that song I could cry
Now you don't belong, no no no we've said our goodbye
I'm still wondering why
Oh yeah, those tears in my eyes, oh, oh

Our love started like a song, oh
But the melody went wrong
There's nothing left to do now
So I look around for someone new
Someone who is very, very, very lonely too
Then I won't sing our song, oh no no
