Always cost a pair of hose
Spaces pressed together, Rose
Arms around each other's back
You know that I liked you Jack
And all the other boys who pose
A silent dance in the woods
In the suburb light is shown
Another can of Coca -Cola
Don't you ever call me Mom
Freckled dancing in the plan 
And air so thin it weighs a ton
As far as you can see is fun
You're nothing but a history
A second here and then you're gone
Quicksand, quicksand all around
Turn the corner just beyond
The shadows move and change the groove
And something tells me not to brood
Turning room and that's a show
You're walking through my heart once more
Don't forget to close the door
I'm not certain of what you found
All the men want a charming whore
Like a crown with all jewels
Sunny skies and angels bleed
Falling down upon my knees
That wasn't how it's supposed to be
Clear blue eyes, justice tries
The wind is busy blowing dizzy
Your dreams were shot like a star
Exploding in a mind somewhere
Doing something on a dare
Pulling a trigger like breathing air
A sunkissed boy that gave no thought
To what he'd made while others saved

Ocean spreads a careless sand
It's dripping in my hand, you're dead
Little brother reminding me
The moments tick forever true
You can see as far as sin
Don't you know the shape I'm in?
You're walking through my heart once more
Don't forget to close the door
