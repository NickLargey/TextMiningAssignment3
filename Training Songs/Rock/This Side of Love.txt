We're on the negative side of love
I'm subject to all bizarre whims she fancies
I'm running escape to find the handle
Of the door she locks me up in
She's on the laughing side of sin
What have I done in all my past lives
(To end up on) This side of Love?
We're on a permanent twist of fate
She has dominion over time and torture
I'm pinching myself to convince me that
I'm in a living nightmare
The killer attraction of a dare
What have I done, emasculation
(To end up on) This side of Love?
If I should stay
(Will the beat go on?)
I must be strong
(We tell you every day)
Will I return
(To normal lovers again?)
Please peel my skin
('Cause my soul is burning)
We're on a roundabout whirl of scorn
The demons are smiling and the angels snoring
I feel like a stepchild Caeser that's been
Beaten and bruised to please her
Wearing a rusted ring of thorns
What have I done to piss the Gods off
(To end up on) This side of Love?
If I should stay
(Will the beat go on?)
I must be strong
(We tell you every day)
Will I return
(To normal lovers again?)
Please peel my skin
('Cause my soul is burning)
We're on the negative side of love
I see my condition as a sign of service
I'll snuggle up close to her knowing
That I'm practising my religion
Warming the barrel of a gun
This will be the deed that finds me next time
(On this side of)
(On this side of)
(On this side of) This side of Love
