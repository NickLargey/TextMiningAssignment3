The kids 'round here look just like sticks
They trade old licks with a beat up six
I just smile and catch the groove

Gothic girls all dress in black
Serious as heart attacks
It takes a little bit of getting used to

The old man with the whiskey stains
Lost the night forgot his name
His poor wife will sleep alone again
And it ain't hard to understand
Why she's holding on to her own hand

Chorus:
It's midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea
No one's asking me for favors
No one's looking for a savoir
They're too busy saving me

(repeat chorus)
I've seen a lone,sloane ranger drive
Seems her chauffeur took a dive
And sold her secrets to the sun
And later in a magazine
I finally figured what it means
To be a saint, not a queen

Two lustful lovers catch a spark
And chase their shadows in the dark
Someone's getting off tonight
Of a big red bus that's packed so tight
It disappears in a trail of light
Somewhere someone's dreaming baby it's all right...

Chorus:
It's midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea
No one's asking me for favors
No one's looking for a savoir
They're too busy saving me
Midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea
No one's pinned dreams on me
No one's asking me to bleed
I'm the man i want to be
When chelsea girls sing...

It's morning when i go to sleep
In the distant dawn a church bell rings
Another day is coming on
A baby's born, an old man dies
Somewhere young lovers kiss good-bye
I leave my soul and just move on
And wish that i was there to sing this song

Chorus:
It's midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea
No one's asking me for favors
No one's looking for a savoir
They're too busy saving me

It's midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea
No one's pinned dreams on me
No one's asking me to bleed
I'm the man i want to be
The man i want to be,the man i want to be
Midnight in chelsea
