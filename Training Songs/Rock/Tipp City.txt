Cottonhead, cottonhead
I say I will not
Go to Sobercity I won't
Curtailed times, 
Once all the best was mine
Tipp City, I'm still here

Tammy all day
I hate old people I do
Everything dispensed that we missed
The busting studs said it was good

Whoa---yea! 
You got me going, You got me going

Peacock caught looking in a mirror
Stop drinking my beer
With dawn patrol on
I want to be a city official
'Cause no one gets ya

Whoa---yea! 
You got me going, You got me going

Cottonhead, cottonhead 
I have relations
With anonymous internet nation
Curtailed times 
Once all the best was mine
Tipp City yea, I'm still here.

Whoa---yea! 
You got me going, You got me going
