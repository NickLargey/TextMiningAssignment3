Uh-huh, honey
All right
My baby whispers in my ear
Mmm, sweet nothings
He knows the things I like to hear
Mmm, sweet nothings
Things he wouldn't tell nobody else

Secret, baby
I keep it to myself
Sweet nothings
We walk along hand in hand
Mmm, sweet nothings
Yeah, we both understand
Mmm, sweet nothings

He certainly takes
The time to read my book
My baby, give me that special look
Sweet nothings
Mmm, sweet nothings

Uh-huh, honey
I'm sitting on my front porch
Mmm, sweet nothings
Well, do I love you?
Of course
Mmm, sweet nothings

Mama turned on
The front porch light
And said
"Come in, darling
That's enough for tonight."
Sweet nothings
Mmm, sweet nothings
Sweet nothings
Mmm, sweet nothings
Sweet nothings
