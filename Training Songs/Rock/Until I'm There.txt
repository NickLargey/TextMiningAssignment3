I am dead from the waist up 
All of this sickens me 
I feel this heavy pressure 
Pounding through my chest 
Work with what you have here 
Loosen gradually we will overcome this 
It is imperative this time 
I won't quit 
I won't stop until I'm there this time 
I won't stop at all it's never easy 
She never loved me 
I won't stop until 
I won't stop until I'm there
