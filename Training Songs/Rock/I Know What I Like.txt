I like things that go fast 
'Cause I know that good things don't ever last 
I like believing in what I want to 
Don't like no one to tell me what to do 
And I like the times that we've had 
But I couldn't tell you what's good or bad 
I'm only hoping that you understand 
This feeling that I'm feeling when I'm holding your hand

(I know what I like)
I know what I like 
(I know what I like) 
I know what I like to do
(I know what I like) 
I know what I like
(I know what I like to do) 

I like the sound of breaking glass 
And if you don't believe me, why do you ask? 
I like leaving town, and coming back home 
I'm going to show you, when we're all alone 
I like staying up all night 
Watching old movies 'til the morning light 
I don't pretend to know what's right or wrong 
But I won't like leaving, if I stay here too long

(I know what I like)
I know what I like 
(I know what I like) 
I know what I like to do
(I know what I like) 
I know what I like
(I know what I like to do) 
Well what about you?

I like things that don't change 
'Cause the more something changes, the more it stays the same 
I might be simple, take it easy sometimes 
But I can be stubborn when I've made up my mind

I know what I like 
(I know what I like)
I know what I like 
(I know what I like) 
I know what I like to do
(I know what I like) 
I know what I like
(I know what I like to do) 
I know what I like to do
(I know what I like)
I know 
(I know what I like) 
(I know what I like) 
(I know what I like to do)
