We've passed the point of no return
How can we make amends
All alone I watch the candle burn
Burning at both ends
Nothin's ever gonna change
Can tears wash away this pain

Tears in the rain
Here it comes again
I'll never know the reason why
I cry these tears in the rain (rain)

The time has come to make a stand
We've waited much too long
Nobody's gonna lead us by the hand
How could we be so wrong
We lost the chance to the play this game
Can tears wash away this pain

Tears in the rain
Here it comes again
I'll never know the reason why
I cry these tears in the rain

So many times, I've wondered why
We still play this game

Tears in the rain
Here it comes again
I'll never know the reason why
I cry these tears in the rain

Tears in the rain
Here it comes again
Oh, I'll never know the reason why
I cry these tears in the rain

Rain, tears in the rain
(Tears in the rain) 
I've been cryin' now
Cryin' now
Cryin' tears in the rain
(Tears in the rain)
I've been cryin' baby
I wonder why I cry
Ohhh, I'll never know the reason why
(Tears in the rain)
I wonder why I cry these tears
(Tears in the rain)
Cryin...
