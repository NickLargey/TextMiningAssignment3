I went outside, what did I see
I saw the sky, I saw some trees
I saw a girl, a beauty queen
I knew that I was a machine
There is a button that makes me go
She turned it on, she let me know
That she could be my gasoline
She knew that I was a machine
The wildest thing she's ever seen
I am a machine

There is a motor behind my eyes
She kicks it hard, I start to fly
I fly around, electrified
I only stop when something's fried
I'm telling you this ain't no dream
I am a machine

Now look at her, she's quite a thing
She makes me feel just like a king
The finest lines you ever seen
You know my baby is a machine
I'll satisfy your crazy dreams
I am a machine

Built down low and mean
Oh, baby, I'm tellin' y'all
I'm a machine
