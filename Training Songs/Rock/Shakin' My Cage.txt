She's some kind of angel, or so they say
She'll take a rich man and make him a slave
Born on the bayou, raised by the sand
She's my Medusa, I'm stone where I stand, I'm stone where I stand.

Shakin' my cage, black dog lovin'
She likes it rolling in the moonlight, got the wolf growlin'
She charms the snakes, she's hypnotizing 
She's got me running from the daylight, bad moon rising
Shakin' my cage

Maybe she's evil but I'm not afraid
I talked to the devil, it's my chance to take
She's my kind of magic, a warm smoking gun
I found my Medusa, she burn out the sun
She burn out the sun!

Shakin' my cage, black dog lovin'
She likes it rolling in the moonlight, got the wolf growlin'
She charms the snakes, she's hypnotizing 
She's got me running from the daylight, bad moon rising

I found my Medusa, she burn out the sun

Shakin' my cage, black dog lovin'
She likes it rolling in the moonlight, got the wolf growlin'
She charms the snakes, she's hypnotizing 
She's got me running from the daylight, bad moon rising
Shakin' my cage!
