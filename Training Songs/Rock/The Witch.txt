Save me from myself, save my mind from my body
Teach me how to love, can you teach me how to feel
Save me from the violence that lives inside of us
Tell me I'm animal, without you I'd be lost
Without you I'd be lost
You teach me dependency I'm coming back for more
Sucking on the cigarette even though I'm bored 
Gonna build a fire and warm my monkey hands
'Cause you're a liar 

I think I understand 
That it's not human nature, it's what they made you
It's not human nature, it's what they made you
Gonna build a fire and warm my monkey hands
'Cause you are a liar 
I think I understand 

Closing up the curtains now I'm blocking out the noise
Cover me in ashes, yeah you make me open wide
Paint that pretty face upon the one that's stained with tears 
Only shame can save you now you whisper in my ear
But that's not good for me 
I don't break easily 

Gonna build a fire and warm my monkey hands 
'Cause you're a liar 
I think I understand 

Gonna build a fire and warm my monkey hands
'Cause you're a liar, yeah you are
I think I understand 

It's not human nature, it's what they made you
It's not human nature, it's what they made you
It's not human nature, it's what they made you
It's not human nature, it's what they made you
