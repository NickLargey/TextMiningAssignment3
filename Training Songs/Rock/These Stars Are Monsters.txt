I just can't say that I blame you
For buying into it all
I was truly famous
The day I lost it all

Don't don't trust the Atlantic
Look what's its done to me
Don't don't trust the Atlantic
She's not what she used to be
(I'm on your side)
So don't forget to hold on (hold on)
(Cause good times are on the rise)
(Good times are on the rise)

I just rediscovered
What I've been doing here all alone
I thought that I could take it
But I found I was all alone

So don't don't make that promise
The one you know you can't keep
Don't don't trust the Atlantic
She's not what she used to be
(I'm on your side)
So don't forget to hold on (hold on)
(Cause good times are on the rise)
(Good times are on the rise)
(Hold on)
