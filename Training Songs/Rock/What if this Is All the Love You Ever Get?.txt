Woah, what if this is all the love you ever get?
Woah, you'd do a couple things so differently, I bet
Woah, what if this is all the love I ever know
Woah, I'd say the words that were so hard to say, don't go

So you've fallen in love
So you've fallen apart

What if it hurts like hell
Then it'll hurt like hell
Come on over, come on over here
I'm in the ruins too
I know the wreckage so well
Come on over, come on over here

Woah, what if this is all the love you ever get?
Woah, you'd not worry so much about counting your regrets
Woah, what if this is all the love I'm ever shown
Woah, I'd not be so scared to run into the unknown

So you've fallen in love
So you've fallen apart

What if it hurts like hell
Then it'll hurt like hell
Come on over, come on over here
I'm in the ruins too
I know the wreckage so well
Come on over, come on over here
What if this is all the love you ever get?
What if this is all the love you ever get?
What if this is all the love you ever get?
