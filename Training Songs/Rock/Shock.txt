I hear brand new talk
Everywhere I go
They got a new word
For what we do
When the lights get low
And I hear my heart
Beat black and blue
Don't call it love
It don't keep time
For me and you
And I don't call it love
Waiting for the world to stop
And I don't call it love
Waiting for the world
I feel shock
When the lights get low
I got a heart like crime
Yeah down in my soul
I feel shock
When the lights get low
I got a heart like crime
Yeah down in my soul
When the lights get low
And the music's loud
And the latest song is hot and cold
'Til the stars go down
And my blood runs cold
And my hands just shake
Got a heart like crime and a pretty face
Ain't all it takes
And I don't call it love
Waiting for the world to stop
And I don't call it love
Waiting for the world
I feel shock
When the lights get low
I got a heart like crime
Yeah down in my soul
I feel shock
When the lights get low
I got a heart like crime
Yeah down in my soul
I feel shock
I don't call it love
Waiting for the world to stop
And I don't call it love
Waiting for the world
I feel shock
When the lights get low
I got a heart like crime
Yeah down in my soul
I feel shock
When the lights get low
I got a heart like crime
When the world gets cold
I feel shock
When the lights get low
I got a heart like crime
Down in my soul
I feel shock
When the lights get low
I got a heart like crime
When the world gets cold
I feel shock
When the lights get low
I got a heart like crime
Yeah down in my soul
I feel shock
When the lights get low
I got a heart like crime
Down in my soul 
I feel shock
