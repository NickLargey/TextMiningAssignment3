Look at the love look at the tears
Look at the heart look at the fears
Look at the eye look at the soul
Look at the top look out below

What you thinking
What you see may no be what it seems to be
So get up get up and down
So look at her then the eyes
Don't be blinded by the light
So get up get up and down

Look at the love look at the tears
Look at the heart look at the fears
Look at the eye look at the soul
Look at the top look out below

You got a witness
Can you swear what you see in front of you is really there
So get up get up and down
So look at her then the eyes
Don't be blinded by the light
So get up get up and down

Look at the love look at the tears
Look at the heart look at the fears
Look at the eye look at the soul
Look at the top look out below

Stop look and listen stop look and listen
Stop stop stop look and listen
Look at the heart look at the soul

Stop look and listen stop look and listen
Stop stop stop look and listen
Look at the heart look at the soul

Stop look and listen stop look and listen
Stop stop stop look and listen
Look at the heart look at the soul
