I've got a Trans-Am in primer paint
Nobody taught me, I was born this way
No silver spoon to feed a 401K
On Bourbon Street, the girls all scream
They callin' out my name

I wanna be a white trash millionaire
Ain't got much and I don't care
Count your cash and kiss my ass
This whole damn world gonna know I been here
I got two zig-zags and you know I'll share
I'm everyone from nowhere
White trash
White trash
White trash millionaire

Some got a castle of Mercedes Benz
Big time appointments
And all their fake friends
So tell me s'that as good as it gets
On the couch on the front porch
We're all smoking left-handed cigarettes

I wanna be a white trash millionaire
Ain't got much and I don't care
Count your cash and kiss my ass
This whole damn world gonna know I been here
I got two zig-zags and you know I'll share
I'm everyone from nowhere
White trash
White trash
White trash millionaire

Well
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up high
Now we gonna go from side to side
Front to back, back to front, front to back
Here we go, here we go

I wanna be a white trash millionaire
Ain't got much and I don't care
Count your cash and kiss my ass
This whole damn world gonna know I been here
I got two zig-zags and you know I'll share
I'm everyone from nowhere
White trash
White trash
White trash millionaire

I wanna be a white trash millionaire
Ain't got much and I don't care
Count your cash and kiss my ass
This whole damn world gonna know I been here
I got two zig-zags and you know I'll share
I'm everyone from nowhere
White trash
White trash
White trash millionaire
