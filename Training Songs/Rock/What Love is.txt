Love is not the thrill of the first connection
Love is not the chivalry in the first common race
Love is never lost in the first rejection
If you're thinking that love comes easy
It's going to disappear without a trace

Because what love is
Is that spark of desire
What love is
Is what keeps us alive
All this fire while rain is pulling it form every side
What love is
Is that thing that gets in your blood
What love is
As we're trying to define
What love is

Now I know you've been captured by a varying suspension
But baby you know
That you've heard it from a jealous lie
Can we start improving on our heart's condition
Can we stop wasting all this precious fire
Yeah because what love is
What love is
Is that spark that survives

What love is What love is
What love is

What love is
Is what keeps us alive
All this fire while rain is
Pulling it from every side
What love is
Is what you have in your blood
What love is
What you're trying to define
Just what love is

Is it the feeling you're all alone year after year
I just don't know
I know I want you here beside me
Is it the feel in some other place
Where does it lead
I got to know
And nobody ever have we ever heard or feel
What love is
Is what flows in our veins
What love is
It survives
Represses the pain
While rain is pulling in from every side
What love is
Now you all know who's right
What love is
What you're trying to define just what love is
You have to help me find out what love is
