Can you hear me, wake up
where's the voice of America

Somebody help me, we gotta stop a crime
I been betrayed by my own kind
I been quiet, too quiet
while across the borderline
We die

Can you hear me, wake up
where's the voice of America

I know that we knew right from wrong once upon a time
Everything we stood for has been compromised
I been quiet, too quiet
while across our borderline
my people lie

Can you hear me, wake up
where's the voice of America

You're quiet, too quiet, are you still alive
Inside

Can you hear me, wake up
we're the voice of America
we're the voice of America
we're the voice of America
we're the voice of America
