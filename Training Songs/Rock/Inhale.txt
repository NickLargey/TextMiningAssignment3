Yeah you're shaking now falling out and you can't take it
Just breathe in breathe out let it flow
Just ease your mind and take your time
Yeah can't you feel it?
This one life this time this time let it show

Just breathe and bring yourself back to me
How can you let go?
Of everything you meant to me
Time to it slow
No don't go

All you want's a taste you can't erase
It's taken over
Just one chance last stand
Take it slow
Tired of waking up feeling down
And you can't take it
Well strike back take that
Let it show

Just breathe and bring yourself back to me
How can you let go?
Of everything you meant to me
It's time to take it slow
It's your last chance to take your stand
God only knows
The time has come what's left undone?
How can you let how can you?

Just breathe you gotta fight to make it through this
You can't leave me
How can you let how can you let go?
