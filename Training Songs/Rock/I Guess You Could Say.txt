I came into this world as nothing
I ain't gonna leave that way
I came into this world as nothing
I ain't gonna leave that way

So in my hands remain time
There's only me to blame

I guess you could say
I'm looking for something
To be
To hold
To own
To call mine
To call mine

But I ain't found it yet
But when I do
It's all mine!

Give me back the rights you read me
I can't seem to make it make sense
Oh, give me back the rights you read me
I can't seem to make it make sense

Because no one ever said
That at the end 
I wouldn't get a second chance

From down here there's no place to go but up!

I guess you could say
I'm looking for something
To be
To hold
To own
To call mine
To call mine

But I ain't found it yet
But when I do
It's all mine!

Maybe I'm on a road that ain't been paved yet
And maybe I see a sign that ain't been made yet
Maybe I'm on a road that ain't been paved yet
And maybe I see a sign that ain't been made yet

Or maybe I'm just stuck in here 
Feeling like I gave
So much more to you
Oh ooh whoa, than you gave to me

I guess you could say (You could say!)
I'm looking for something
To be (To be!)
To hold (To hold!)
To own (To own!)
To call mine (Again!)
To call mine (Again!)

But I ain't found it yet (It yet!)
But when I do
It's all mine! (It's all mine! It's all mine!)

I guess you could say
I'm looking for something
To be
To hold
To own
To call mine
To call mine

But I ain't found it yet
But when I do
It's all mine
