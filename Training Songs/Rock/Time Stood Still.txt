The first time that I saw you
You were dancin' on the beach
Poetry in motion
But you seemed so out of reach
And the waves
Were breakin' 'round you
In the California sunset
I made a wish to know you
And touch your golden hair
You turned around and looked at me
And paradise was there
Baby I remember the way you took my hand
Yesterday
Time stood still
As we walked into the night together
The memory is locked in our hearts forever
It seems just like yesterday
Time stood still
We found a little seaside bar
High above the rocks
You were drinking white wine
And I was doing shots
I wondered if you'd stay the night
You just took my hand and led the way
Time stood still
As we made love through the night together
The memory is locked in our hearts forever
Time stood still
Time stood still
The memory is locked in our hearts forever
Oh yeah
I thought that I'd seen love before
But what you showed me
Well that's something more
Love found two strangers walking on the shore
We threw our watches in the sea
I looked at you you looked at me
And time stood still
We made a fire on the beach that night
And watched the seagulls circle in the morning light
Maybe there are some things
We're not meant to understand Anyway
Time stood still
But love goes on forever
The memory is burned in our hearts forever
Oh yes
Time stood still
The moment's gone forever
But I will love you till
Time stands still in our hearts forever
Oh yeah
Time stood still
Time stood still
Time stands still in our hearts forever
Seems just like yesterday
Time stood still
Time stands still
Time stood still
Oh yeah
Time stood still
Forever
