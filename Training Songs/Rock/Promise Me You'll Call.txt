When you came along you were everything 
Nothing else compared to the love you gave 
Say it's going to last, say you'll never leave 

Now that love's around you are everywhere 
Nothing else I found like the love we shared 
Say it's going to last, say you'll never leave 

If I gave you all that you want 
If I gave you all that you need 
If I gave you all that you want 
Will you promise me, promise me you'll call 
Won't you promise me you'll call
