These secrets I'll bring to you
Are of thorns and ice

Hushâ?¦.
Don't tell them nothing, not a word
Hushâ?¦
Don't tell them nothing, not a single thing that I've said to you

Hear all my secrets
Tell all the lies
Hear all my secrets
Tell all the fucking lies!

Can you hear it scream?
Deep deep inside

Hushâ?¦
Now listen carefully, here it comes
Hushâ?¦
It's what I keep inside, this is the crime that I've tried to hide

Hear all my secrets
Tell all the lies
Hear all my secrets
Tell all the fucking lies!

Can you hear it scream?
Deep deep inside

Envy...Sloth...Gluttony...Wrath...Pride...Lust...Greed

These secrets I'll bring to you
Are of thorns and ice
These secrets I'll give to you
Will turn virtue to vice

These secrets I'll bring to you
(These secrets I'll bring to you)
Are of thorns and ice
(Are of thorns and ice)
These secrets I'll give to you
(These secrets I'll give to you)
Will turn virtue to vice
(Will turn virtue to vice!)

Can you hear it scream?
Deep deep inside

I'll tell you only onceâ?¦
