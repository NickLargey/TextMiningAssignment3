Should you go first and I remain
One thing I'd have to do
Walk slowly towards your door
Soon I will follow you
 
[Chorus]
Will I dream of good times
Only love in our minds
Will I dream of making love
Always knew that it was enough
 
She's gone to live in
Memory's garden
 
I'll want to know each step you take
So I can walk the same
Someday down that lonely road
You'll hear me call your name
 
[Chorus]
 
She's gone to live in
Memory's garden
 
Traveled along so many roads
Must have tried everyone
Today we shown new directions
Ones we've never seen before
 
[Chorus]
 
She's gone to live in
Memory's garden
