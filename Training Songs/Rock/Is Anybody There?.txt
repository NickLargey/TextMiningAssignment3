Well I'm out here on my own
Following a star
Asking on my knees, for some direction, please
And, God, you know that's hard 

Because I'm such a stubborn man
Lord, I'm stubborn as a mule
Even though I struggle some, I believe a change will come
And I hear you love a fool
I see a road and a flash of lightning
Let me tell you it's frightening 

[Chorus]
Is anybody there?
Oh, I need somebody tonight
To care
I'm feeling alone and it just don't seem right
Is anybody there?
Oh, I need somebody to be
To know that I'm good enough for love
To walk beside me 

And as a woman in this world
Well you must have felt like this
That a man might come along
With another hard luck song
And betray you with a kiss 

But would you reconsider me
Though I know I've caused you pain
I've taken vows with you
I believe them to be true
Now can we take a little rain? 

We could hit that road in a flash of lightning
Maybe it won't be so frightening 

[Chorus x2] 

I'm gonna keep on walking, baby
