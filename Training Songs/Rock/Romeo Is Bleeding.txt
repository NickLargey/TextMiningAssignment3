You made me love you
Too blind to see, yeah
Tomorrow comes
Casanova might bleed
Having so much,
how could I be so far wrong
l've always known pain is part of pleasure
For someone else
Hoping it would never cloud my soul
Taking me so long to fall, oh no
Chorus:
Romeo is Bleeding
Can't hold out forever
Romeo is Bleeding
Hurting for himself
Romeo is Bleeding
No pulling it together
Romeo is Bleeding
Why you die for love?
You can't imagine what you don't know
So here I am,
How'd I get so much in love
Led by my heart
and addicted to the thrill - oh
You come around say
you lost your love light
l'm breaking down,
paying for my past life
Found out by all the pain that I feel
Chorus:
Romeo is Bleeding
Can't hold out forever
Romeo is Bleeding
Hurting for himself
Romeo is Bleeding
No pulling it together
Romeo is Bleeding
Why you die for love?
I won't die
but I better find a way to be healed
Chorus: (repeat)
