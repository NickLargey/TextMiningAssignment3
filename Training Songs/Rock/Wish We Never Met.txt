Disapointment stops by from time to time
To see how im doing
And he came by last night
Right after you left
My life in ruin

When I dont get what I want
The spoiled child inside breaks down
Kickin, screamin, prayin and dreamin 
For a love lost and found

Well I wish we never
Wish we never
Wish we never met
Cuz now I've got my heart set on you

Humiliation asked me out last night
I had nothing else to loose
So it took good kept two loopy drunk had conversations
I couldnt get through
Another strangers eyes
Were trying desperatly to meet mine
But I look away tabs to pay lines to say
Like "how are you" "im doing fine"

Ohh but I wish we never 
Wish we never 
Wish we never met
Cuz now ive got my heart set 
I wish we never 
Wish we never 
Wish we never met
Cuz now ive got my heart set on you

And I dont get what I want
From another strangers eyes 
No and I dont get what I want
From another strangers eyes

I wish we never
I wish we never
Wish we never met
Cuz now ive got my heart set on you

I'm set on you
