Well, well, hello
And how are you?
Fancy seeing you here
Don't let it show
No, no, no one must know
Why
They're playing "Tracks of my Tears"

Just pretend it's all over
Like you have for so long
I thought time was a healer
But I guess I was wrong
I am to blame
But we were so young
Oh, how was I to know?

But you said you still want me
Oh, you opened up an old wound
Then you left me here bleeding
And my mind's black and blue
Now, you got yours
And I've got mine
And there's no debts or dues
Oh, what can we do?
