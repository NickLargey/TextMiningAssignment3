Please put Chastity's books and magazines away
'Cause they don't move me no more
They don't move me no more
Put them all away

Forget photos and letters
All the people that matter
They don't move me no more
You don't move me no more
And you're no longer mine

It's surprising how rapidly
We were changing from you and me
No matter how you count, oh no
It will go to show

When history is done
And everything is over
Just to keep us warm
It's slowly getting colder
There's nothing to explain
It's hard to stay the same
History is done
And everything is gone

Early morning, and late night
Going over the same fight
Don't move me no more
You don't move me no more
And I don't even mind

All these things I keep
Without caring too deep
Gonna put it to sleep
I can run much faster
When nothing wears me down

He can change what it's been before
It's erased and you can't restore
Let the screen stay black, go go
I don't want it back

When history is done
And everything is over
Just to keep us warm
It's slowly getting colder
There's nothing to explain
It's hard to stay the same
History is done
And everything is gone

Everything is gone
Everything is gone
Everything is gone
Everything is gone
