Honey, you're the reason i don't sleep at night.
A-justa walkin' the floor, thinkin' of you, smoke cigarettes, and drink all day too,
Honey, you're the reason i can't sleep at night.

I'm bettin' you're not losin' sleep over me, but if i'm wrong don't fail to call,
Come over and keep me-hee company.
Sometimes i go for a walk, look at the moon, strum my guitar to some old lonesome
tune,
Honey, you're the reason i can't sleep at night.

I'm bettin' you're not losin' sleep over me, yeah but if i'm wrong don't fail to
call,
Come over and keep me-hee company.
Sometimes i go for a walk, look at the moon, strum my guitar and sing out of tune,
Honey, you're the reason i can't sleep at night.
Honey, you're the reason i can't sleep at night.
Honey, you're the reason i can't sleep at night.
