I want to be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I want to be the minority

I pledge allegiance to the underworld
One nation under dog
There of which I stand alone
A face in the crowd
Unsung, against the mold
Without a doubt
Singled out
The only way I know

'Cause I want to be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I want to be the minority

Stepped out of the line
Like a sheep runs from the herd
Marching out of time
To my own beat now
The only way I know
One light, one mind
Flashing in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
"For crying out loud" she screamed unto me
A free for all
F*ck 'em all
You're on your own side

'Cause I want to be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I want to be the minority

One light, one mind
Flashing in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
For crying out loud she screamed unto me
A free for all
F*ck 'em all
You're on your own side

'Cause I want to be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I want to be the minority
The minority
I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority
