Baby take your time
You may change your mind
When tomorrow is in your hands

Baby take your time
You may change your mind
When things don't go quite as planned

I don't want to alienate you
Or put phony words into your mouth
Can't you let it out

When your When Dreams Turn To Dust
I will revive you
When your nail starts to rust
I am behind you
When you're shamed and disgraced
I will not hide
I'll open my arms if you ask me

But you don't know if you want me

I don't want to alienate you
Or put phony words into your mouth
I just want to understand you
I just want to know what you are on about
Can't you let it out

When your When Dreams Turn To Dust
I will revive you
When your nail starts to rust
I am behind you
When you're shamed and disgraced
I will not hide
I'll open my arms if you ask me

I don't want to push you
I don't want to rush you
I know I can help you
I'm here if you ask me

[Repeat: x2]
I don't want to push you
(When your When Dreams Turn To Dust)
I don't want to rush you
I know I can help you
I'm here if you ask me

I don't want to push you
(I am beside you)
I don't want to rush you
I know I can help you
I'm here if you ask me

I don't want to push you
I don't want to push you-acapo
