You know I'll be the one who gets fallin' down drunk
At my neighbor kid's soccer game
I got an '82 Fierro with a car seat in the middle
Broken down on the Interstate

I've got a beer-stained t-shirt looking like Joe Dirt
Something 'bout me just ain't right
I'm a cash-stealing, drug-dealing loser without any feeling
Gettin' trailer trash tonight

'Cause I'm a low life, and I'm lovin' it
I got the whole damn world in the palm of my hand
I'm a low life, so fucking deal with it
No you can't change something that you don't understand

I'm thrilled to be a hillbilly, hate to have to deal with me
Probably just end in a fight
No sleeves, can't breathe, doesn't even phase me
Naked, sleeping like a baby tonight

'Cause I'm a low life, and I'm lovin' it
I got the whole damn world in the palm of my hand
I'm a low life, so fucking deal with it
No you can't change something that you don't understand

Livin' it up, livin' it up
Being a low life
Livin' it up, livin' it up
Being a low life
Livin' it up, livin' it up
Being a low life
I'm livin' it up, livin' it up

A gun-packin', bitch-smackin', mess with me it's gonna happen
Lovin' life livin' in sin
Passed out on the floor, sorry just don't work no more
Givin' up or givin' in

Ah f*ck it
'Cause I'm a low life, and I'm lovin' it
I'm never gonna change as long as I live
I'm a low life, so fuckin' deal with it
'Cause deep down I really know everyone is

'Cause we're low lives, and we're lovin' it
We got the whole damn world in the palm of our hand
'Cause we're low lives, so fuckin' deal with it
No you can't change something that you don't understand

I'm livin' it up, livin' it up
Being a low life
