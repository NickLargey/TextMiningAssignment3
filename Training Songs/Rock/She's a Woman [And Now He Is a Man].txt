Well, I can see her loading boxes in my mind
Into a belvedere with a trailer pulled behind
Well, things didn't go exactly as they planned, no, no, no
She's a woman and now he is a man

Well, there's a vacancy between them ever yday
And a sense of guilt that's not going away
And when they get older perhaps they'll understand, oh, oh, oh
She's a woman and now he is a man

And now he's into something that her heart cannot forgive
She's saying to herself, "this is not the way to live"
Well, he'll never listen to her 'cause his mind is like a sieve
Oh brother, oh brother, I'm telling your sister
No way can I resist her

With a guilty feeling hanging in their brain
And when the two of them are potentially insane
Well, they've had enough, which is more than they can stand, oh, oh, oh
'Cause she's a woman and now he is a man

I can see her loading boxes in my mind
Into a belvedere with a trailer pulled behind
Well, things didn't go exactly as they planned, no, no, no
She's a woman and now he is a man

She's a woman and now he is a man
She's a woman and now he is a man
She's a woman and now he is a man
She's a woman and now he is a man
