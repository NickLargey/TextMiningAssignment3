Hell had you by the throat
You never got to heaven
But you got real close
Your past has you in a choke hold
But you deserve it from what I've been told
Call my bluff say what you want
I'm looking down at you from the top
I beg for attention in small doses
Leave the scene smelling of dead roses

Loverboy, you played those hearts like toys
Don't you feel bad, don't you feel bad?
Filled with repent
This is your night with arms wide open
I'm the option you shouldn't have chosen
Scared of the dark the door's wide open
This is a night you'll regret in the morning

Loverboy, you played us up like toys
Don't you feel bad, don't you feel bad?
Filled with repent
If given the choice would you do it again?
Of course I would, of course I should
Well I'm your friend, friends with benefits
