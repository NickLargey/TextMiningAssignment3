Let me tell you 'bout my baby
You know he's not too shy
He's got a way that makes me tremble
He got them sexy eyes

I said come I'm
Talkin' bout my baby
Wait he makes me
I said ooh, I'm talkin'
'Bout my baby wow

Let me tell you 'bout my baby
How he touches me
He kisses sweeter than sugar
He makes my heart beat faster, faster

I said come I'm
Talkin' bout my baby
Wait he makes me
Sh-sh-sh-sh
I said ooh, I'm talkin'
'Bout my baby wow

And when I'm cold at night
He warms me up just right
I close my eyes and he goes crazy
All over me wow whoo

I said come I'm
Talkin' bout my baby
Wait he makes me
I said ooh, I'm talkin'
'Bout my baby wow

Come on I'm talkin' bout my baby
Wait he makes me sh
I said ooh I'm talkin' bout my baby
