Suddenly a woman leaves me - I've got no job - a machine relieved me
Suddenly I've lost my piece of pie
I'm now in mourning and I wear all blue
That's the color you wear when the dead one's you

Suddenly I am living in a lie
My woman's off with some other guy
I can remember the first time I saw her. 
She was hanging out in one of those singles bars. 
Wearing a really fancy dress 

Drinking a really expensive mixed drink smoking one of those 
Marlboro 100's with the big fancy plastic filters on the end 
Made her look like she had class, least I thought so. 
But then suddenly the bitch left me 

All of a sudden like something suddenly
Suddenly I'm on my own
I don't hear no rings on the telephone
And all the rings I've given her have been returned
I cling to clothes she used to wear

Then I try them on and style my hair
Suddenly I could never be as fine as she
I've got her eyes 
But I sure don't have her teeth

I can remember when we would take walks around the public pool  
and the way she would look at me - and the way she would do this 
whistle and how I would feel - I'm gonna try and show you what it was 
like 

Suddenly I found myself drinking from the lowest shelf
And all of a sudden I just could not believe my eyes
There goes some guy walking down the street wearing my tie
Suddenly I'm not gonna let another man take my woman. 

Not even death can do us part. Because when I'm an angel 
I'm gonna come down from heaven and I'm gonna buy her a brand new Cadillac 
I'm gonna buy her a brand new Cadillac

Let me tell you why, let me tell everybody why
Because in the 50's it was pompadours 
And in the 60's it was peace
In the 70's bellbottoms, I don't know why 
In the 80's Ronald Reagan, BMW's 

Sushi, back home we used that for fertilizer, but in the 90's LOVE  
Love is the new fad, I love you, good God almighty I love you Ya
Suddenly I have found myself alive
