I checked the window
There's nothing shining in the sky (sky)
Are we ever gonna get them rays?
Am I gonna see it flash before I die? (Die)

I've been reaching like a flower
Gotta grow higher and higher
Every single, every single hour
Gotta grow higher and higher

Lying on the fault line
Begging that, begging that sun to shine
Time to let the light in
Rolling in the riptide
Pull me up, pull up, Lord, I'm dying
Time to let the light in

I paused the picture
I couldn't spare the room inside (inside)
I didn't notice when the neighbors left
But I guess you've gotta earn that goodbye (bye)

I've been reaching like a flower
Gotta grow higher and higher
Nothing left, left to be devoured
Gotta grow higher and higher

Lying on the fault line
Begging that, begging that sun to shine
Time to let the light in
Rolling in the riptide
Pull me up, pull up, Lord, I'm dying
Time to let the light in

Oh, is this what you meant?
Gotta grow higher and higher
Don't know where it went
Gotta grow higher and higher and higher and higher

Lying on the fault line
Begging that, begging that sun to shine
Time to let the light in
Rolling in the riptide
Pull me up, pull up, Lord, I'm dying
Time to let the light in

Time to let the light in
Time to let the light in
