Rejected since day one
My name is bastard son
I've been damned so many times I've lost count
Blue collar, working man
Devises master-plan
Bipolar with a mental side arm

I'm sick and I'm twisted
I'm broken; you can't fix it
Don't make me 'cause I'll do it
Red button and we'll all go

Into the river below, running from the inferno
You'll think I'm insane, but you'll all know my name
Into the river below, running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame, the front page, and the fame

Contraption made of bones
Nuts and bolts creates the
New monster to burn your family tree down
Tick-tocking--time's up now
Split second--the world frowns
Lonely heart--never had nobody

I'm sick and I'm twisted
I'm broken; you can't fix it
Don't make me 'cause I'll do it
Red button and we'll all go

Into the river below, I'm running from the inferno
You'll think I'm insane, but you'll all know my name
Into the river below, running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame, the front page, and the fame
I'll take all the blame, the front page, and the fame

Into the river below

Into the river below

Into the river below

Into the river below

Into the river below, I'm running from the inferno
You'll think I'm insane, but you'll all know my name
Into the river below, running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame, the front page, and the fame
Yeah, I'll take all the blame, the front page, and the fame
