I like cold mornings
They keep me sharp
Forget the rain
Forget the car
And leave behind all communication

All the pieces
In front of me
I have this place
All to myself
I'm not asking much
Just a little space for my head

I start today, I drive the other way
I start today, I drive the other way
I start today, I drive the other way
I start today, I drive the other way

A simple lake
Dirt tracks for days
I'm breathing clean
My eyes feel bathed
I've hit the wall too many times now

I start today, I drive the other way
I start today, I drive the other way
I start today, I drive the other way
I start today, I drive the other way

I start today
I start today
I start today
I start today

I start today, I drive the other way
(And if it makes you happy, it doesn't make me sorry)
I start today, I drive the other way
(And if it makes you happy, it doesn't make me sorry)
I start today, I drive the other way
(And if it makes you happy, it doesn't make me sorry)
I start today, I drive the other way
(And if it makes you happy)
