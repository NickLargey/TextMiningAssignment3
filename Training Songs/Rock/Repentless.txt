Arrogance, violence, world in disarray
Dealing with insanity every fuckin’ day
I hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin’ scene
Pissing match of egos, f*ck their vanity
Ain’t got the time, I don’t want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin’ do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see

Live fast
On high
Repentless
Let it ride

My songs relive the atrocities of war
Can’t take society any fuckin’ more
Intensity, anarchy, hatred amplified
Playing this shit is all that keeps me alive
Leave it all on the road living on the stage
This is my life where I kill it everyday
So take your shot, bottom’s up, this is no lie
I’ll be beating this guitar 'til the day I die

Live fast
On high
Repentless
Let it ride

I hate the life, hate the fame, hate fuckin’ scene
Pissing match of egos, f*ck their vanity
Ain’t got the time, I don’t want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin’ do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see
We’re all killing ourselves a little more everyday

Live fast
On high
Repentless
Let it ride
