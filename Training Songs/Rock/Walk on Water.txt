I never seen a smile that looked so sad
You make me feel so good 'cause you're so bad

Hey little darlin'
Your love is legendary
Love's four letters
Ain't in my dictionary
'Scuse my position
But it ain't missionary
Yeah but I want to
Walk on the water with you

When it comes to makin' love I ain't no hype
'Cause I practise on a peach most every night

Hey little darlin'
Your love is legendary
Love's four letters
Ain't in my dictionary
'Scuse my position
But it ain't missionary
Yeah but I want to
Walk on the water with you

Well, the cook's in the kitchen
And hidin' the spoons
I'm winkin' at witches
And howlin' at moons
I'm afraid of the candle
But Live for the flame
You know who I am
But you don't know my name

(Aha, ha, ha, ha)

Hey little darlin'
Your love is legendary
Love's four letters
Ain't in my dictionary
'Scuse my position
But it ain't missionary
Yeah but I want to
Walk on the water with you

Hey little darlin'
Your love is legendary
You got the boo yah
It's almost ficitonary
'Scuse my position
But it ain't missionary
Yeah, but I want to
Walk on the water with you
