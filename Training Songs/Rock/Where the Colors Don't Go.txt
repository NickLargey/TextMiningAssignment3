In a white room, in a white head
In a cobweb of enterprise
Where the dreams sleep and fears keep

That's where the colors don't go
That's where the colors don't show
That's where the colors don't go

In one take, no give
Half live, half ignore
An endless chase in a small place

One world, one white flag
One shopping bag and restaurant
No surprise there
Only lies there

That's where the colors don't go
That's where the colors don't show
That's where the colors don't go

I want your eyes to color my world
And hear my endless longing

That's where the colors don't go
That's where the colors don't show
That's where the colors don't go(3x)
