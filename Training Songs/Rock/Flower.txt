Here we stand again
In the year 1999
But you're so far
But yet so close

And in the ancestral rays of the sun
We're passing time in the video store
Remembering all the things
That we were

But I've been pushed back
To the cradle
Though I believe I'm bigger now
Although I'm lonely as a flower

In the alabaster lazy sun
Never long time for the weeping
Alabaster lazy sun

Alabaster lazy sun
Never long time for the weeping
Alabaster lazy sun
In my day

And I swung the door wide open
Yes I've done my deeds adorned
When I crashed into your building

And I hope you don't cry to long
Huddled in debris land
But tomorrow's perfect
Tomorrow's Tuesday

In the alabaster lazy sun
Never long time for the weepin'
Alabaster lazy sun
In my day

Alabaster lazy sun
Never long time for the weepin'
Alabaster lazy sun
In my day

But darlin' don't you weep
Silver and gold
Aren't we lonely as a flower
Climbing above these walls

Aren't we lonely as a flower
Climbing above the walls
Well let's forget these stupid buildings
Come on my lover take the fall

In the alabaster lazy sun
Never long time for the weeping
Alabaster lazy sun
In my day

Alabaster lazy sun
Never long time for the weeping
Alabaster lazy sun
In my day
In my day
My day
My day

I can remember when
Rock 'n' roll was somewhat of a God
Leaving us naked and so alive
But now it's just a two day masquerade
I guess I'll go to the corn fields and pray
