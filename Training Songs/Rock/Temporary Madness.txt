Take my soul, take it away from me
Take my pride, take my dignity
Weepin' like a fool in broad daylight
And I know it just ain't right

I just won't listen to the sound of advice
Pray for me darling all through the night
Temporary madness, emotional overload
It only takes a dime to fall, that's all

Temporary madness, emotional overload
Even when I lose control, I can hear you call
"Come home"
Walkin' on home, my blood's on fire

Feels like my veins are runnin' dry
Jump through the mirror is what you want me to do
Stop sellin' lies baby, buy me some truth
You caught me red-handed by the balls
I can hear you call

"Go home"
