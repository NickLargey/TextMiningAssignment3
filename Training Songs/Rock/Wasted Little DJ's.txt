They told me if I write this song for them
That they would cut my hair for free
But that's not me, no liberties

And they're into all the coolest bands
And knowing that they're going to the gigs as fans
Entitles me to some decency

Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day
They're the cleverest blonde weekend
Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day
I wish everybody danced like me

Split visions of a talkative therapy
It makes me bend away, it gives me E
Seems hard to say, it?s insanity

The same record for the 16th time
Exact same set you did the last time ?round
Doesn't bother me, we're in harmony

Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day
They're the cleverest blonde weekend
Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day
I wish everybody danced like them
Everybody danced like them

No low emotions rolling tonight
Young heavy hopefuls staying the night
So stick around and wait for the day

Craziness kills laziness and happiness takes bad bets
No one gives a f*ck, you see we're all out of our little heads
Craziness kills laziness and happiness takes bad bets
No one gives a f*ck, you see we're all out of our
All out of our, all out of our little fucking heads

Doo doo doo

Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day
They're the cleverest blonde weekend
Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day
I wish everybody danced like them

Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day
They're the cleverest blonde weekend
Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day
I wish everybody danced like them

Can anybody dance like them, can you tell me?
(Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day)
Does anybody dance like them, can you tell me?
(Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day)
Does anybody dance like them, can you tell me?
(Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day)
Does anybody dance like them?
(Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day)

Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day
Asted-way ittle-lay eejays-day
