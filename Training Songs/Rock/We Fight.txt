We were the kids that left home probably too young (too young)
But we took our share and maybe then some (then some) 
Tired of beatings and battles and being sewn up (sewn up)
But that made us grow up, and that made 'em scared

'Cause we never learned to keep our voices down, no
We only learned to shout
So we fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out
We earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out

We fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out (and we fight our way out)
We fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out (and we fight our way out)

And there's still a kid somewhere that needs to hear this (hear this)
Somebody cares, that somebody knows
Who's tired of bleeding and battered and being torn up (torn up)
Just pick yourself up, it's time to go (pick yourself up)

'Cause we never learned to keep our voices down, no
We only learned to shout
So we fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out
We earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out

We fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out (and we fight our way out)
We fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out (and we fight our way out)

Maybe we found a way to make some tracks
We didn't snicker and turn our backs
We just keep digging in, and digging in, and giving back

'Cause we never learned to keep our voices down, no
We only learned to shout
So we fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out
We earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out

'Cause we never learned to keep our voices down, no!
We only learned to shout!
So we fight our way in! (we fight our way in!)
And we fight our way out!

We fight our way in! (we fight our way in!)
And we fight our way out! (and we fight our way out!)
We fight our way in! (we fight our way in!)
And we fight our way out! (and we fight our way out!)
