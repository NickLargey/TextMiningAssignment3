Captured under hypnosis
Faster and faster, images
Can a meaning be obtained
Or this mystery explained

I'm in orbit, held by magnet
And the force feels so much closer than love

Logic offers no defense
Underneath this influence
While this puzzle of intent
Holds emotion in suspense

I'm in orbit, held by magnet
And the force feels so much closer than love

Caught between the day and night
And a knot that pulls too tight

I'm in orbit, held by magnet
And the force feels so much closer than love
