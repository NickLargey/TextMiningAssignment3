Yes yes even if the good old clouds along my way 
Became frustrated philosophers for one day 

No time no time 
I'll keep it going 
No time no time 
I'll keep it going 
No time no time 
There is no reason for this 
No time no time 
And there is nothing to explain 
I've got no reason to complain 
And I'll keep it going 

Yes yes even if my lucky lips were sealed once more 
And if i tomorrow was much younger than before 

No time no time 
I'll keep it going 
No time no time 
Don't mind 
And the choir goes 
No time no time 
There is no reason for this 
No time no time 
And there is nothing to explain 
I've got no reason to complain 
And I'll keep it going 

No time no time 
There is no reason for this 
No time no time 
And there is nothing to explain 
No time no time 
I've got no reason to complain 
No time no time 
What if you saying wasn't rate 
And I'll keep it going
