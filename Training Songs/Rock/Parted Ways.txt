And the wind it blows through the atmosphere 
And the air filled with dust 
Such a far collection within every direction 
Some places I've already been 
And no, drive slow, 
Loneliness too many things have changed 

And no, I just don't look at things the same way now 
Since we parted ways 
Out in the space, I'm alone with 
The only hum of the wheels, they are carrying me 

On to a wild space to breathe in, 
Oh I need it, a wild space to breathe in, whole 
And the sun went down in this little ghost town 
Near the valley of the rio grande 
I need a little bit of whiskey and a little bit of time 
To ease my troubled mind 
Lost love and loneliness, so many things have changed 
And no, I just don't look at things the same way now 
Since we parted ways out in the space, 
I'm alone with the only hum of the wheels, 
They are carrying me on to a wild space to breathe in, 
Oh on to a wild place to breathe in, 
Whole out in the space, 
I'm alone with the with the only hum of the wheels, 
They are carrying me on to a wild space to breathe in, 
Oh on to a wild place to breathe in, 
Whole out in the space.
