You take a simple part of history
And then you feed it back to me
I'm smart enough to know

We try, we're living under plastic skies
Reality personified
And everyone's the same

Is it a lie living a lifetime is reverse
Is it alright living a lifetime in reverse
Like nothing's wrong and everything's okay

You watch images on movie screens
They contradict your memories
And everything you know

Deny the stories that are never told
Now culture can be bought and sold
To anyone today

Is it a lie living a lifetime is reverse
Is it alright living a lifetime in reverse

Is it a lie living a lifetime is reverse
Is it alright living a lifetime in reverse
Like nothing's wrong and everything's okay
Okay, everything's okay

Is it a lie living a lifetime is reverse
Is it alright living a lifetime in reverse

Is it a lie living a lifetime is reverse
Is it alright living a lifetime in reverse
Like nothing's wrong and everything's okay
Okay, everything's okay
