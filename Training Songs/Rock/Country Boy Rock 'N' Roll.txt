You can tell I'm from the country
see I'm from out of town
But I'm beginning to catch on
I'm letting my hair down

I've been a' rocking
I've been a' rollin'
I guess to some folks I look foolish
just let it make a fool out of me

I have worked in fields of cotton
I have worked in fields of corn
But I've seen nothing like it
since the day that I was born

I walked in a crowded dance hall
and I didn't know a soul
Some hillbillies started picking
everybody rocked and rolled

I have spent all the egg money
corn and cotton I have sold
I'll mortgage my old homestead
stay in town to rock and roll
