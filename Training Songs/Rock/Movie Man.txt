Why did you do it, you should not make your mother cry
I'd say you blew it, yes it gave you one more try
Yet you laugh and you smile try to run away
Don't you know what you do you might regret someday
Cause there's one who has eyes on your evil ways

The movie man
Why do you do it, you're in for a big surprise
Oh, I never knew it, but honey there's no telling lies
You're in living color, it's your picture show
Even what you're thinking everyone will know
That someday you'll have to take a stand
