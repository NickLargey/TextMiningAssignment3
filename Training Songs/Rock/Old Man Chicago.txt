Oh, Old Man Chicago, having his own fun
Living life if only you give him his own time
So when your feelings comes howling, when you given it some time
Feelings come sliding, leave me on ocean, nothing but lies
Oh, yes, you do now, oh, yes, you do now, oh, yes, you do now

Oh, they were millions, and we were just one
It's just a heart for mine, having his own fun
Leave us a friend, he's living life, he's lonely
Leave us a friend, he's just living life before me, now, yeah

Oh, old man of fortune, having his own cry
Living life if only you taken his own drug
'Cause when your feelings comes fighting, when you given it some lies
Feelings comes howling, leave me your ocean, nothing but ghosts
Oh, yes, you do now, oh, yes, you do now, oh, yes, you do now

Oh, they were millions, and we were just one
It's just a heart for mine, having his own fun
Leave us a friend, it's living life, it's lonely
Leave us a friend, it's just living life before me, now, yeah

Sing now, oh

Oh, leave us a friend, he's living life, he's lonely
Leave us a friend, it's just living life before me, now, yeah
Leave us a friend, it's living life, it's lonely
Leave us a friend, it's just living life before me, now, yeah
