She was a lackluster lover
Who thought of another
When I offered her my hand
To help her in out of the rain
Then she became quite possessive
When I gave her the message 
That I had to leave 
On the outbound ten o'clock train 
She said I thought you were stable
And that I might be able
To talk you into sticking around
For a couple of years
I said I roll with the flow
Wherever it goes and it's rolling out of here

There was this didactic minister
Who told me of sinister things 
Which would happen
If I were to do something wrong
He spoke at length about brimstone
And lives that were based on
Belief that the bad and the good
Were equally strong
That's why I think I undid him
When I started to kid him
Cause he said if you'll give me some time
I'll make it quite clear
I said I roll with the flow
Wherever it goes and it's rolling out of here

Now those are two fine examples
Of the way that I handled 
The pressure that tried to draw me away from the light
And in the final analysis
It's foolish if you resist
The changes that come into your everyday life
There might be some trepidation
But don't let hesitation
Deprive you of hope and try to replace it with fear
Just roll with the flow
Wherever it goes
Even if it rolls outta here

You just roll with the flow
Wherever it goes
Even if it rolls outta here
Just roll with the flow
Wherever it goes
Even if it rolls outta here
