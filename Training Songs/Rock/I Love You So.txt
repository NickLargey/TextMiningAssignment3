Those oldies but goodies reminds me of you
The songs of the past bring back memories of you
I always remember the first night we met
The songs they were playing I never will forget

I always will treasure them so close to my heart
They always will haunt me although we're apart
Each time that I hear them a tear's bound to fall
For I love those memories that I, I recall

Those oldies but goodies reminds me of you
The songs of the past bring back memories of you
Forever they will haunt me but what can I do
Those oldies but goodies reminds me of you

Yes, dear, they are playin' our songs
And they will always remain our songs
And each time you hear them, I hope you too will cherish
The wonderful memories that our love once knew
For these songs are just a symbol of the love that I had for you

Those oldies but goodies reminds me of you
The songs of the past bring back memories of you
Forever they will haunt me but what can I do
Those oldies but goodies reminds me of you

Oldies but goodies reminds me of you
Oldies but goodies reminds me of you
Oldies but goodies reminds me of you
