Now that you’re wasted I think that you should know
I hang out on the baseline, I take it that you know me
Now that I'm a part of the system so I can’t afford to get stoned right
They said maybe if I’m good I’ll get my head smashed to the fridge
Well I wouldn’t mind Pepsi Cola, put it to my lips
But surreal, the kids are victims
You know how the peoples talk
I said I'll see you later but I’m a business man
Besides, I'm walking down Ten Feet Boulevard
Walking down 30th Boulevard
Jesus walking down Hollywood boulevard
Under the crown

Take the kids off Broadway
Take the kids off Broadway
Take the kids off Broadway
Take the kids off Broadway now

Flipping through the Bible, the richer lay on
Oh I see

Take the kids off Broadway
Take the kids off Broadway
Take the kids off Broadway
Ooo, and they’ll be standing in the corner
Take the kids off Broadway now
Ooo, and now they’re roaring in the bedroom

Yea yea oh

You used to be walking on the water
Now you're falling in the river
You used to save my soul
Now you got no place else to go
And I do it all the time
Cause you’re just hanging with those other guys
You used to sht to cover me
And I know it was you
