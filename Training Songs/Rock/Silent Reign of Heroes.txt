Making my way across Dixie, eighteen sixty-five;
I walked all the and halfway to heaven, now believe I'm on the other side;
Day turns into nightime, nightime's by my side;
I look to he sky, I see shining light, the stars will be my guide;

The smell of gun smoke in the air;
Lighting fills the sky;
I heard a rebel yell just as loud as hell;
You can hear it 'round the world tonight;
The silent reign of heroes;
Is what brings me here today;
What I came to fight for, seems so far away
So far away;
Far away;

Tell me what's the cost of freedom;
Fighting for my life and family name;

The devil's laughing long and hard deep in hell tonight;
My feet are bleeding right through my shoes;
Ground's as cold as ice;
Sing no killer angels;
Can you hear my cry?
It seems like a sin when nobody wins and so many had to die;

Who is right, and tell me who is wrong;
Old boys come down from here to Virginia;
To sing the battle song;
The silent reign of heroes is what gives me strength today;
Tell me what's the cost of freedom;
It's so far away, far away;

Fighting for our heritage yeah;
It's so far away, far away;
When I see my home and family;
Then I know I finally paid a debt.
