And I had a dream about my old school
And she was there all pink and gold
And glittering I threw my arms around her legs
Came to weeping (came to weeping)
Came to weeping (came to weeping)

And I heard your voice as clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange and so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical

Only if for a night

And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was loose and I was set alight
But she came over me like some holy rite
And although I was burning, you're the only light

Only if for a night

In the grass was so green against my new clothes
And I did cartwheels in your honor
Dancing on tiptoes, my own secret ceremonials
Before the service began
In the graveyard, doing handstands

And I heard your voice as clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange and so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical

Only if for a night
And the only solution was to stand and fight

And my body was loose and I was set alight
But she came over me like some holy rite
And although I was burning, you're the only light
Only if for a night

Madam, my dear, my darling
Tell me what all this sighings about
Tell me what all this sighings about

And I heard your voice as clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange and so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical

Only if for a night
(Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ah-ha-ah-ooh)
Only if for a night
(Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ah-ha-ah-ooh)
Only if for a night
(Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ah-ha-ah-ooh)
Only if for a night
(Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ah-ha-ah-ooh)
Only if for a night

(Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ah-ha-ah-ooh)
Only if for a night
(Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ah-ha-ah-ooh)
Only if for a night
(Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ah-ha-ah-ooh)
Only if for a night
(Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ah-ha-ah-ooh)
