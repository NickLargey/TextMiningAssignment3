I know, they know 
Don't drink, drive slow 
Insane, no brain 
Dress down, look plain 
Big fun, no gun 
No girl, gotta run 
Flipside, can't hide 
Can't think suicide 
Is there anybody out there? 
Does anybody know? 
Is there anybody out there? 
Does anybody know?  Listen, buy 
  
Been there, no where 
Done that, get square 
I'm hip, no lip 
Dig this, my tip 
Punk's dead, see red 
Life sucks, deadhead 
No race, no face 
Still there, same place! 
Is there anybody out there? 
Does anybody know? 
Is there anybody out there? 
Does anybody know? 

I don't know where I went wrong 
And I don't know if I can wait that long 
But every time I hear that another kid died 
Through a senseless act of violence 
It makes me want to cryÂ¡Â­ 
Is there anybody out there? 
Does anybody know? 
Is there anybody out there? 
Does anybody know?
