Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of goal
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

Some kind of metal made up from glue
Some kind of plastic I could wrap around you

The needy eat man-mades
They wear phony clothes
They sit with our picture up until they grow old

Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of goal
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

Well, me, I like plastics and digital foils
Could wrap up the sound and protect the girls
From the spiritual poison we expel at night
Like phony clothes but I really like might

Some kind of nature
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Come from within us
Oh Lord, forgive me
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
It's got to come and find us
All we are is dust

Some kind of metal made up from glue
Some kind of plastic I could wrap around you
The needy eat man-mades
They wear phony clothes
They sit with our picture up until they grow old

Some kind of nature
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Come from within us
Oh Lord, forgive me
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
It's got to come and find us
All we are is dust
