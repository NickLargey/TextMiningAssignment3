You’re only alone 'cause everybody’s alone
Skipping movies to the sad parts, it’s too hard 
Forget about it, forget about it
And then you start getting old
And everybody you know buries their past 
In the backyard like track marks
Don’t ask about it, don’t even think about it

But time moves slowly, always chasing 
Something that you knew you left behind

Kids in love will do almost everything
Kissing in the dark, scared to talk about anything
Kids in love with the girl on the tire swing
Growing up now, growing up now quickly

There’s days that your home is just some place that you go
Trying to hide from dark spots on sidewalks
It’s always on us, yeah it’s all around us
You’re not alone, as far as honesty goes
I’m sick of looking sideways these days
I’m staring at it, yeah, I’m gonna fight it

Time moves slowly, we’ve been racing
Some things you leave behind, and never find

Kids in love will do almost everything
Kissing in the dark, scared to talk about anything
Kids in love with the girl on the tire swing
Growing up now, growing up now

Time moves slowly, we’ve been racing
Kids will fall in love over pretty much anything
Growing up now, growing up quickly

Kids in love will do almost everything
Kissing in the dark, kissing in the dark
Kids in love will do almost everything
Kissing in the dark, when no one's looking

Kids in love will do almost anything
Kissing in the dark, scared to talk about anything
Kids in love with the girl on the tire swing
Growing up now, we growing up now

Time moves slowly, we’ve been racing
Those kids will fall in love over pretty much anything
Growing up now, growing up now, whoo!

It’s funny how those kids in love will do almost everything
Growing up now, growing up now quickly
