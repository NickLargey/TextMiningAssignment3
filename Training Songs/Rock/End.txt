Nothing to hold on to when you're alone, then you find each other.
She heard you're leaving in august.
You promise to write, she's waiting at home.
An unanswered call.
I want you to know I'm alright and missing you.
Too bad I'm stuck here with words from a note you sent long ago: "I'd love you forever"
But I'll be back in november.
I know that by then it will be the end.
