She's got dreams dreams that he's got things
That'll open up her sky so she can use her wings
To fly away

she looks out her window
Watching people as they pass on by
Some of them want to come inside
Man oh man one on one I wonder which one will she trust
'Cause some men only lust
And she wants a man who can understand
What a woman wants and if he can appreciate her and not deface her
And she wants a king with a diamond ring
Not some prince charming who's gonna steal everything that he gave her
Yeah

She's got to fly away (uh 1-2, uh 1-2, uh 1-2)
I watch her walk next to you but soon
She's got to get away (oh that's true, oh that's true, oh that's true)
I hope her dreams do come true
'Cause she is a butterfly
Spreadin spreadin spreadin spreadin
Spreading her wings
(She's beautiful, she's beautiful, she's beautiful)

But her heart is a kingdom without a king
And without him she can't sing
So she waits on a watchtower
Hoping praying waiting for his arrival (and all the people in the world say) 
And then they'll

And she wants a family (family) she wants a lover (lover)
She wants a best friend closer than any other
A man that's true she wants a man who
Can hear god's voice and know what he is called to do
She wants a hard worker not some lazy bum
But a man who knows how to get the job done
She wants a family to be a mother and raise a child that came from her
Yeah

She's got dreams dreams that he's got things things
That'll open up her sky so she can use her wings
To (to to) fly away
She's got dreams dreams that he's got things things

She's got to fly away (fly away)
She's got to find her way
She's got to fly away

She's on the ground learning to fly but she's flying now
She's on the ground it's time to fly she's gonna fly now
She's on the ground looking down it's time to fly ya'll
She's on the ground but watch her rise and fly away
She was looking down but now she's looking to the sky ya'll
Spreading her wings to give it a try give it a try give it a try
To fly away when the rest of the girls are on the fall ya'll
She's spreading her wings to fly away

'Cause she's got dreams dreams that he's got things things
That'll open up her sky so she can use her wings
To (to to) fly away
