Hear your mother on the telephone
Partying people happy people home
Everywhere there's sceptic magazines
Shooting different colour jelly beans

Anyday of the week - when Saturday comes
Anyday of the week - she's almost gone

Hiding pictures of her takeaway
Only laughing on a Saturday
Tomorrow's Sunday - special radio
Warning her the dangers long ago

Anyday of the week ...

Such an independent girl
Think you've got what it takes
If you won't sit down next to me
Girl that's my mistake

Teenage bop form a nervous holiday
Attracting lips form a hidden stowaway
Telegram go gos got to yesterday
Shocking tears will never go away

Anyday of the week
