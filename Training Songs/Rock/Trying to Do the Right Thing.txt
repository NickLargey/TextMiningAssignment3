Your eyes look out at me and I know what they see 
The man who's devoted to you, tryin' to do the right thing 
Your gaze reflects my heart and that's the place we start 
To be devoted to, tryin' to do the right thing 
The simple things, they are the magic 
In a world of constant change this we know and it's the road of devotion 
That's the one less chosen, in an impulsive world 
We could shine a light with our love 
It's in your heart and mind and I'll return in kind 
To be devoted to, tryin' to do the right thing 
The simple things, they are the magic 
In a world of constant change this we know and it's the road of devotion 
That's the one less chosen, in an impulsive world 
We could shine a light with our love 
Your eyes look out at me and I know what they see 
The man who's devoted to you, tryin' to do the right thing 
Tryin' to do the right thing
