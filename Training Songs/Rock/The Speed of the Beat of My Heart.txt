You know me better that I do,
How my heart feels,
What my head knows to be true,
We submit and we surrender
to what we guard against,
Without even knowing that we do.
Dictate the speed of the beat of my heart
Dictate the speed of the beat of my heart
Dictate the speed of the beat of my heart
Dictate the speed of the beat of my heart
Dictate the speed of the beat of my heart
Is this the way to hurt me hurt me,
Is this the way to your revenge
Is this the way to hurt me hurt me
Is this the way to your revenge
You know me better that I do,
How my heart beats,
Love like lightning going through,
Innocently playing in your glorious design,
Without even knowing that I do.
Dictate the speed of the beat of my heart
Dictate the speed of the beat of my heart
Dictate the speed of the beat of my heart
Dictate the speed of the beat of my heart
Dictate the speed of the beat of my heart
Is this the way to hurt me hurt me,
Is this the way to your revenge
Is this the way to hurt me hurt me
Is this the way to your revenge
