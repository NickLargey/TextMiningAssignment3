Hey pretty girl remember me, I saw you at the mall
I was working at the Pizza-O-Rama, you were with your mom
do you wanna go out with me, cause we would dance all night
you could have a real good time with Mr. Me on your side
Shirley, I want to believe
won't you believe in me
remember Mr. Rogers' class, you were standing at the door
you winked your eye, I was surprised, my books fell on the floor
at the cafeteria once again, you passed with your friends
and for the first time ever I could smell your perfume in the air
and the day I called for the notes you had, well, that was just a lie
I just wanted to talk to you, and dream that you were mine
