Lately I'm learnin'
That so many yearnings
Are never to be
Childhood illusions
Merely delusions
Of a girl that I see

In my mind's eye
I see clearly a vision of how it could be

Me and my fantasy girl
Hold on to me
Be my fantasy girl
Don't set me free

Now I've had my share
And sometimes I swear
That I've had me enough
You end up in sorrow
Broken tomorrows
Love can be tough

But my mind's eye
Sees a vision of true love and how it should be

Me and my fantasy girl
Hold on to me
Be my fantasy girl
Don't set me free
Be my fantasy
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I see clearly a vision of how it could be
Be my fantasy 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Be my fantasy girl 
Hold on to me 
Your my fantasy girl 
Don't set me free 

Be my fantasy girl 
Hold on to me 
Your my fantasy girl 
Don't set me free 

Yeah, from this fantasy
