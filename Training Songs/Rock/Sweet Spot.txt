Nothin' fancy 
Nothin' fit 
Nothin' wasted and no deal to make 
What you need is what you want to take 
And what you take you use 

I'm just looking for that sweet spot 
Where I can live the way that I want 
Ill be waiting for you out front 
If you want me too 
Are you comin' too 

The fire is steady and the beat is strong 
Give is good and wide and long 
It don't even have to hold on 
'Cause it's got a hold of you 

I'm just looking for that sweet spot 
Where I can love the way that I want 
Ill be waiting for you out front 
If you want me too 
Are you comin' too 

And when I find that sweet spot 
Gonna give it everything I've got 
Turn up the radio a whole lot 
For the afternoon 

Soft as a woman 
Strong as a man 
Throws yours head back in a full-mouth laugh 
It's like knowing you can sleep at night 
But you don't want to 

I'm just looking for that sweet spot 
Where I can love the way that I want 
Ill be waiting for you out front 
If you want me too 
Are you comin' too 
Are you comin' too
