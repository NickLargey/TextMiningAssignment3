You took me home 
I drank to much
Cause of you my liver turns to dust
Cold rust takes cold creeping cool pain
Do you understand what I need?
When you feel your soul drop to the floor
Like a whole like an open bleeding sore
Then you'll have bleed like I've bleed
Then you'll have bleed this all left

Suck me down, its time rock and roll
Lets hit the bar, lets loose control
One false move you took me home
One false move your all alone

But it looks so good and it feels so nice
I've paid my price
I'll cut you out just to hear you scream,
Get away from me
And I can feel my heart beat racin'
As I realize what I must do
Get away from you

should've turned around like you
Last time I got a taste of you
I should've turned around like you
And I say we're through

You have haunt me like a plague
Weakness, we've worked at
But I digress
After all this
You're just like all the rest

Suck me down, its time rock and roll
Lets hit the bar, lets loose control
One false move you took me home
One false move your all alone
