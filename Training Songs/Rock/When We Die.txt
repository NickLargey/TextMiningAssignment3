I know that it's early
And it's too hard to think
And the broken empty bottles, a reminder in the sink
But I thought that I should tell you
If it's not too late to say
I can put back all the pieces
They just might not fit the same

There's nothing worth losing
Especially the chance to make it right
And I know that we're gonna be fine
And the tattooed mistakes are gonna fade over time
As long as we live and time passes by
And we won't get it back when we die

I know it's been years now
And I don't look the same
And the hopes and dreams you had for me you thought went down the drain
And the room looks so empty where my pictures used to be
And I can't say that I blame you
But you can't blame me

There's nothing worth losing
Especially the chance to make it right
And I know that we're gonna be fine
And the tattooed mistakes are gonna fade over time
As long as we live and time passes by
And we won't get it back when we die

Come over come over 'cause I gotta know
If I am doing this all on my own
Come over come over how can I tell you if you're not here?
And I know that we're gonna be fine
And the tattooed mistakes are gonna fade over time
As long as we live and time passes by
And we won't get it back when we die

And I know that we're gonna be fine
And the tattooed mistakes are gonna fade over time
As long as we live and time passes by
We won't get it back when we die

Come over come over whoa-oh-oh
Come over come over whoa-oh-oh
Come over come over

I gotta know
Won't get it back when we die
I know that it's early
