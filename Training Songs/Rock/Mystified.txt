I get kinda crazy like I'm going insane
I can't shake the feeling, something has to change
What in the world is this
Something inside me denied
Well, you say you have to leave me
Baby, I'm mystified

I feel like a train on a broken track
I can't move forward and I can't roll back
What in the world can I do
Now that your sweet love has died
You say you have to leave me
Baby, I'm mystified

What in the world is my future
How can I break from the past
Resigning in love and confusion
Well, I try to remember from the first time to the last

The storm clouds gather and the cold wind blow
Looks like winter, Lord it feels like snow
What in the world is this
Baby, you were my pride
Now you say you have to leave me
Baby, I'm mystified
