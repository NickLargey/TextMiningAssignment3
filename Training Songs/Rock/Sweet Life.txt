Mama can you hear me 
Mama can you hear me 
I'm going to be a farmer 
Blowing the fields in the morning sun 
I'll have a million horses 
Take me a ride when the work is done 
I'm going to have a sweet life 
Sweetest life you ever seen 
And when the day is over 
Going to go to sleep in the field of green 

Mama can you hear me 
Mama can you hear me 
Daddy do you know what I mean 
Mama can you hear me 
Mama can you hear me 
Daddy do you know what I mean 

Going to be a actor 
Playing a part in a light of gold 
Oh yes I will 
I'm going to make a lot of money 
Going to spend it all before I get to old 

And I'm going to have a sweet life 
Sweetest life you ever seen 
And you know when the day is over now 
I'm going to go to sleep in a field of green 

Mama can you hear me 
Mama can you hear me 
Daddy do you know what I mean 

Mama can you hear me 
Mama can you hear me 
Daddy do you know what I mean 

Got, got to have a sweet life 
Got to have a sweet life 
Daddy do you know what I mean 
Mama can you hear me 
Mama can you hear me 
Mama can you hear me 
Daddy do you know what I mean
