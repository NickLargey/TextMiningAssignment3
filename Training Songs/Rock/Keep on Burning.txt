Oh
Well there ain't no sense
In burning bridges.
No, there ain't no sense
In burning bridges.
If we`re sorry
Then it`s our failure
So says the jailor,
Fade away.
Now there ain't no debts,
Just destinations.
Like birds made out of steel,
They fly by.
Lost lovers in a moonlit night,
Broken lovers in a starless night.
I lay my clothes down at your feet
'Cause all I want is for you

To keep on burning.
Keep on burning, babe,
Keep on burning.
Yeah, keep on burning (burning).

And when that flame dies
Becomes an ember,
Remember, keep on burning (keep on burning).

Can you feel my warmth
Inside of you, babe.
Oh can you feel my blood
Running through your vains.
Don't lay the blame on me, girl,
Just like lovers often will
I lay my heart down at your feet
Oh all I want is for you

To keep on burning,
Keep on burning (burning)
Keep on burning, babe (yeah),
Keep on burning (burning).

'Cause when that flame dies
Becomes an ember,
Remember, keep on (burning, keep on burning) burning.
Yeah, (you gotta) keep on burning (burning),
Ooh, keep on burning.
Keep on, keep on, keep burning, babe,
Ah (you gotta keep on burning, burning) keep on burning (burning),
Baby (yeah) you gotta keep on burning, burning.

Keep on burning,
Keep ...
