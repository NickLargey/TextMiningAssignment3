in all the water she said to me
She said to me I'm sorry
In all the water she said to me
She said to me its alright
All that I could say
And all that I could do
Wasn't enough to convince her
Of what I thought I knew
Then all her words started to sound the same
Started to sound the same as water
Yeah all her words started to sound the same
Started to sound the same as BLAH BLAH BLAH
She talked about some future plans
And why our friendship had to end
But it wasn't enough to change my mind
About what I thought I knew
I'm so confused
And now I'm dealing with
All the water in my head [4x]
