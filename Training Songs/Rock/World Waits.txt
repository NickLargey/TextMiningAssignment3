World wait forever never
Take the time 
Don't break my heart
Again

World wait forever never
Take the time
Don't break my heart
Again

Though I wanna take the time
By nature of design it's so hard
To arrange
So hard to explain
Mmmm Mmmm
Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm

The way beyond your heartache
No time for our love
Your moment away beyond
Your heartache
No time for our love

World wait forever never
Take the time
Don't break my heart
Again

World wait forever never
Take the time
Don't break my heart
Again

Though I wanna take the time
By nature or design
It's so hard to arrange
So hard to explain
Then running delayed beyond

A way beyond
Your heartache
No time for our love
Your moment a way beyond
Your heartache
No time for our love
No time for our love
No time for our love
