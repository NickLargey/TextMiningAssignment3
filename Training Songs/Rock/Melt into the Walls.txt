The night is cold, you lie with ghosts you have let down, 
An empty bed betrays you, you lie awake and wonder what went wrong 
The lights have died, the love they gave on borrowed time, 
And you'll melt into the walls, melt into the walls 

Your time has run out, your time has run out, 
They lied, they lied baby, and I tried I tried lately

I'll drink you slow, I'll drink you slow but for a price, 
Water turns to poison and loving touch gives way to lonely nights 
It's a fine white line, it's a fine white line you're stumbling across, 
You'll melt into the walls, melt into the walls 

Your time has run out, your time has run out, 
They lied, they lied baby, and I tried I tried lately

Please don't you ask, 
Please don't you ask me how it feels, 
For she was the last, 
To light up my night and make me sing

Your time has run out, your time has run out, 
They lied, they lied baby, and I tried I tried lately
