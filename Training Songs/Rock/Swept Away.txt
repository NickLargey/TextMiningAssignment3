Soft wind blowing 
Her hair into my face 
Eyes still showing 
Look at shadows 
Dancing on the beach 
Still horizons 
All within our reach 
Sun still glowing 
Underneath the sea 
Love just growing 
One night, and I'm hooked on you 
One kiss, and there's nothing I can do 
First love, she had to be so far away 
First time, I've been swept away 
Spanish islands 
Dot the better dreams 
Turquoise waters 
Throw me back again 
When I'm dreaming 
Something takes me there. 
She's there waiting. 
One night, yea, and I'm hooked on you 
Just one kiss, and there's nothing I can do 
First love, and she just had to be so far away 
Oh first time, I've been swept away 
I've been swept away. 
I've been swept away. 
I've been swept away. 
Love worth keeping 
Takes you by surprise 
Untold promises 
Cost the same 
I know better 
Still, I pay the price 
She's there waiting. 
One night, oh yea, and I'm hooked on you 
Just one kiss, and there's nothing I can do 
First love, she had to be so far away 
Just one time, I've been swept away, yea. 
Oh, yea! 
I've been swept away, yea. 
I've been swept away, yea.
