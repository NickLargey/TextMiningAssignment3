The nights are getting shorter
I don’t know where to go
I am getting older
And it's starting to show
And ever since I left my mother
It’s much harder to know
How to make my own life here
How to make my own home

I don’t want to wake up lonely
I don’t want to just be fine
I don't want to keep on hoping
Forget what I had in mind
I don’t want to wake up lonely
I don’t want to just be fine
I don't want to keep on hoping
Forget what I had in mind
Forget what I had in mind

I remember a time when a kiss on the hand was enough
'Cause we know we were free
And we knew what it meant to be love
But ever since I left my father
It’s much harder to know
How to make my own life here
When all I need is home

I don’t want to wake up lonely
I don’t want to just be fine
I don't want to keep on hoping
Forget what I had in mind
I don’t want to wake up lonely
I don’t want to just be fine
I don't want to keep on hoping
Forget what I had in mind
Forget what I had in mind

This face's is starting to fade
They’re slipping through my hands
It's where my heart was made
And my feet will always land

I don’t want to wake up lonely
I don’t want to just be fine
I don't want to keep on hoping
Forget what I had in mind
I don’t want to wake up lonely
I don’t want to just be fine
I don't want to keep on hoping
Forget what I had in mind
Forget what I had in mind

I don’t want to wake up lonely
