When he comes bursting through that door, mama leaps and hits the floor
Calling himself Louis Quatorze, he's so young and dangerous
Oh I love it when he says so seriously
With his gun in my back, "Honey, close your eyes and think of England"

Just one second
It's his genuine act, as a matter of fact, Louis was horrible to me
He tears down my defenses, he pretends that I'm against him

[Chorus]
Louis, Louis, Louis did love me, Louis Quatorze made love to me
Come back again, don't tell me when, Louis Quatorze, always surprise me
Fourteen's how I'll ever be, I don't know how long it lasts
But one thing's for sure, Louis Quatorze must hurry to love me

And more and more and more and more, Louis Quatorze loves me some more
He loves me just ''cause he's so ware, Louis's gonna shoot me
Louis, Louis's locking my door, Louis's serious, I'm delirious
No plays, he just doesn't care, Louis Quatorze starts to undress me

With his gun in my back, I start to undress
You just don't mess with Louis Quatorze
He's my partner in this crime of happiness, ''cause I'm just fourteen

Oh I love it when he says so seriously
With his gun in my back, "Honey, make love to me"

[Chorus: x 2]

Louis Quatorze, I love you
