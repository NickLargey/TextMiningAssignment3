Fish from the paper, fresh from the sea
The cracks in the pavement, the city in siege
I don't know where to replace it or who to believe
Can't find on the pavement or lay on his knees
Scratching around in a second I got where you should be

We're going to wake up the nation, don't be no drag
Shake up the station, a night up ahead
We're going to wake up the nation, don't be no drag
Shake up the station, a night on our hands

Nowhere to be
Nowhere to be

Get your face off the Facebook and turn off your phone
The death of the post box, no one is home

Scratching around in a second I got where you should be

Nowhere to be
Nowhere to be

We're going to wake up the nation, don't be no drag
Shake up the station, a night up ahead
We're going to wake up the nation, don't be no drag
Shake up the station, a night on our hands

We're going to wake up the nation, don't be no drag
Shake up the station, a night up ahead
We're going to wake up the nation, don't be no drag
Shake up the station, a night on our hands
