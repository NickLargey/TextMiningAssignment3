Please can we go away
Get out of here
Somehow today.
For a place that I've heard on the radio
Never sleeps.

I'll get a job in a bar,
You could be a waitress and serve cheap cigars
To fat mustachio men in suits, you'll look cute.

F*ck what they say
F*ck it if they talk
It really don't matter.
We're going to New York.

Oh, hold on to me.
I'm gonna get you out
I'm gonna set you free.
To a place that I've heard on the radio.
Never sleeps.

I'll get a job in a bar,
You could be a waitress and serve cheap cigars
To fat mustachio men in suits, you'll look cute.

F*ck what they say
F*ck it if they talk
It really don't matter.
We're going to New York.v
