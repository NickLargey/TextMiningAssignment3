Well now I've seen it all before 
Nothing comes new to me anymore 
Is this for real? I can't decide 
Something is messing with my mind 

Well I guess that now my time is near 
Displacement conjures up no fear 
The end will only linger on 
Responsibility has gone 

The end of existence is heading my way 
I don't think I can last one more day 
Stuck in a place that doesn't wound or mend 
Is this what's called the living end? 

I'm stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea 
The end is here for eternity 
The end will only linger on 
Responsibility has gone 

The end of existence is heading my way 
I don't think I can last one more day 
Stuck in a place that doesn't wound or mend 
Is this what's called the living end? 

Stuck in a place that doesn't wound or mend 
Is this what's called the living end? 

Stuck in a place that doesn't wound or mend 
Is this what's called the living end? 

Stuck in a place that doesn't wound or mend 
Is this what's called the living end?
