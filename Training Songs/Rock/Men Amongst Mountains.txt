We are men amongst mountains
Pressing into the night
But we know not what we do
We know not what we do
We are the ones
We are the ones
That turned the fire into light
But we know not what we do
With the changes we go through

Love makes it easy
It makes it all right

In the mouth of the wolf we lay
And chase the sun to sleep
If we never come down
We won’t ever come down
It don’t make no difference to me
We are the ones
We are the ones
That turned the fire into light
But we know not what we do
With the changes we go through

Love makes it easy
It makes it all right
Love makes it easy
It makes it all right
To do what we do
Do what we do

Oh I say my prayers in the morning
I get up in the afternoon
And I’m sailing out to no one but you
I scream to the gods above me
Here we go, let me know

Father of mine let me sing you a song
You’ve been singing in the rain
You’ve been singing so long
And I wanna know could I ever be saved?
If I lived a life of lies and a life of love today

Love makes it easy
It makes it all right
Love makes it easy
It makes it all right
