I get a yearning when the sun goes down
To hold your body close to mine
I get a feeling to come 'round your house
And light the fire and drink some wine

I'll keep you safe and warm
And free from harm
It's understood

Oh, darling, take your worries
And lay them on me

And if you need me on a Friday night
I'll stay the whole weekend and try
We'll solve your problem if it takes all night
I'll even sing a lullaby

I'll keep you safe and warm
And free from harm
It's understood

Oh, darling, I'm whatever
You want me to be

Oh, darling, take your worries
And lay them on me

I get a yearning when the sun goes down
To hold your body close to mine
I get a feeling to come 'round your house
And light the fire and drink some wine

I'll keep you safe and warm
And free from harm
It's understood

Oh, darling, take your worries
And lay them on me
Oh, baby
I'm whatever you want me to be
Oh, darling
Get your loving and lay it on me
