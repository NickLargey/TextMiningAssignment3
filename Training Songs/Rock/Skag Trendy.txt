Skag trendy thinks he knows just what to do
He was only seventeen and he was out screwing the brew
Thought that parents were too old, teachers told him what to do
Master skag trendy, he'd like to talk to you

He told his mother what he was all about
She didn't acknowledge the cry for help, she just chucked him out
And now he's broke sitting outside, sitting on the floor
He's got nothing else to think about except another score

But before he gets this he has to go and steal something
That's not something that he really wants to do
But you see that his mother chucked him out
She signed him off the brew

I wish somebody would love him, he doesn't have a hope
I wish somebody would love him, he doesn't have a home
He'd like to speak to his old school friends
But he needs ten pence for the phone

Had a girlfriend, she was very, very nice
Walks by him now, won't look at him twice
Liked his dress sense and his cheeky, cheeky grin
But you see since he's been chucked out
He's lost all of them, he's got none

So he writes another sad song, he's got none
Checking out another sad song, he's got none
Oh, he writes another sad song, he's got none
Checking out another sad song

Skag trendy, think I knew just what to do
I was only seventeen and I was out screwing the brew
I thought that parents were too old and teachers told me what to do
I'm master skag trendy, I'd like to talk to you

I wish somebody would love me but I don't have a home
I wish somebody would love me but I don't have a home
I'd like to speak to my very old friends
But I need ten pence for the phone

Thing would happen to someone in this situation
That is complete and utter social deterioration
Should have clicked on out pawning his PlayStation
Just a young man looking for some variation

He made a mistake, he was looking for some variation
He made a mistake, he was looking for some variation
Oh, he made a mistake, he was looking for some variation
He made a mistake, he was looking for some variation

Skag trendy, what's so trendy?
Oh, it's not trendy, what's so trendy?
