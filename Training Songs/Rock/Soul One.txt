How come, girl was there 
When I needed one?
How come, girl was there 
When the song is done?
Some say, open your eyes 
To a brighter light.
Okay, opened my heart,
They were right.

She was my soul one.
Oh, she felt she was 
The only one.
She was the sun, 
Her sky blue eyes,
She was my soul one.

Inside, the pain in my heart 
Often made her cry.
Outside, cursed the birds 
And the sugar skies.
How long, take to realize 
She's the one?
How long 'til I find 
My lost and lonely soul one?

She was my soul one,
Lord, you know she felt like 
The only one.
She was the sun, 
Her sky blue eyes,
She was my soul one.

Should've never taken the time,
'Cause I found myself 
Livin' a lonely lie,
You said you left 
To find yourself,
But I never,
No, I never got a chance 
To say goodbye.

She was my soul one.
You know, I doubt she was the only one,
And I thought she was.
