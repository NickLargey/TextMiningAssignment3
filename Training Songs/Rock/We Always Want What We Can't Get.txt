The door behind me closes
I know for sure this chapter's over
I'll never more see my reflection in her loving eyes

A million times before I've seen
When opposites attract to me
The flame burns uncontrollably but soon the fire dies
But I'm not sure what I'm asking for,
Why if I want love, do I beg for more?

[Chorus:]
Guess we always want what we can't get
Love just strikes us blind
But in the end, we always get what we can't want
You'd have thought we'd have learned
But we fall for it every time

It turns me on if she's unreachable or dangerous
When what I need and what I lust
Are completely different things
How many times have I let love slip through my fingers
Chasing after promises I know will never keep?

But I don't know why I can't let go
When my heart says yes
But my mind screams no

[Chorus]

I've been looking all my life for answers
Questions of the heart I've got to ask her
Does she exist or does she not? I wonder...
And so my search for her goes on and on and on

But I don't know why I can't let go
When my heart says yes
But my mind screams no

[Chorus]

Guess we always want what we can't get
Will I be running around chasing love
'Til I lose my mind?
We always get what we can't want
Does anybody, anyone at all feel the same?
