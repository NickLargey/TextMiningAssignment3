I sing you this song
To let you see
Whatever became of me
This summer I'll wait under your cherry tree
Just to hear wonderful from you

I sing you these words
So you can hear
I know what I am behind the ears
And if you could once just for once reappear
And let me hear wonderful from you

I fall, I crawl, to pull you up
I sleep for years to wake you up
All the world that can tell me to get...you
Woah woah woah, it's Superman

I stand from afar
Blow clouds away
No L.A. traffic
Just milky way
And yes, I will wait for the day that you say
This is all wonderful, me take wonderful from you

I fall, I crawl, to pull you up
I sleep for years to wake you up
All the world that can tell me to get...you
Woah woah woah, it's Superman
Start

Yes, I can fight, I can fight yes yes... 

I fall, I crawl, to pull you up
I sleep for years to wake you up
All the world that can tell me to get...you
I fall, I crawl, to pull you up
I sleep for years to wake you up
All the world that can tell me to get...you
Woah woah woah
