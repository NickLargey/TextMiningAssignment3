It was sometime late September 
The leaves were gold and green 
My baby's eyes were the saddest sight I'd ever seen 
Two summers back I loved him 
Two years I cried and tried 
But I tell you, too many teardrops falling down cannot be dried 

It's been a long hard fall 
Long hard fall 
Long hard fall 

So something came between us 
A feeling cold as ice 
By October there was frost and I knew our love was lost 
November made me bitter 
As the wind blew through my heart 
Oh, so empty in the deepest darkest tiny part 

It's been a long hard fall 
Long hard fall 
Long hard fall 

There'd be snow come mid-December 
And I'll be frozen to the bone 
Oh, but by then it will all be over 

It's been a long hard fall 
It's been a long hard fall 
Long hard fall 
Long hard fall 
It's been a long hard fall 
Long hard fall
