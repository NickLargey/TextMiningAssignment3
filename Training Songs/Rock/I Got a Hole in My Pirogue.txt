Well I went out a fishin' to make a little mon.
To take to Cajulina so we could have some fun.
On the way back, I knocked a hole in my bow.
I got a hole in my pirogue, I can't go see my gal.

The purtiest sight that you ever have seen
Is a moonlight night down in New Orleans.
I'm up the river, just around the bend.
I got a hole in my pirogue, I just cain't hold it in.

Well Catelina's waitin' with tears in her eyes.
Munchin' and a crunchin' on a crawfish pie.
I smell a feeling floatin' through the air
I got a hole in my pirogue, I can't go see my Cher.

Yeah I'm here on the bayou, sittin' all alone
With a busted bottom and I cain't pole it home.
Cajulina's waitin' lonesome as can be.
I got a hole in my pirogue, I cain't go see my she.
