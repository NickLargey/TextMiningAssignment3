You might be right
You might be wrong
You might just think your life has gone one far too long
Your knees go weak
And your heart grows cold
And you're tired of doing everything you're told

Nothing can take away from you
Wat you take and what you've been through
Stand up and be strong
Stand up and be strong
It won't take long
You can't go wrong
Stand up and be strong

You might have to fight
You might have to cry
You might have to cry
You might have to Fight
Stand up and be strong

If you live in the hills
You take to many pills
If you've lost the thrill
Against you own will
Stand up and be strong

Nothing can take away from you
What you take
You know what you've got to do

Stand up and be strong
Stand up and be strong
It won't take long
You can't go wrong
Stand up and be strong

If you get all depressed
When you get undressed
If you're life's a mess
Remember you're blessed

Stand up and be strong
