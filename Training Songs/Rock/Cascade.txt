We have no image
We're just called the good friends 
We call the madmen back
As they fly to the ant hills 
We never know, we never know 
We sleep in satin nights
Throwing energy like bluebirds
In twilight

We call to stillness 
As we kiss the water king's hand
We hear the one same name 
As the darker the land gets 
We never know, we never know
We're fueling for the light
Cascading like the rain
In twilight

Waiting for you, you look so close, we walk 
A thousand stairs
Aching for your hand, our love a distant
Voice, we have no image we are light

We are not asking 
No favors from the dead 
We wash with moonlit hands
On the shores of our island 
We never know, we never know 
We sleep in satin nights 
Throwing energy in silver curves
In twilight
