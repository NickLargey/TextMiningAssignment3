Push me out. Me out. Beat me into the ground.
I am so stupid. So pathetic. Beat me into the ground.
I think I lost myself. I think I lost myself. Can't remember when it was I last lost this much.
Push me out. Beat me into the ground.
I am so stupid. So pathetic. I think I lost myself I think I lost myself.
Back in that accident. Back in that accident.
I can't believe all this dumping on me.
All I've been is the nice one to everyone.
I've seen it before and I'll say it again. I often don't know where I am.
I'll pull up the carpets in my head.
I'm so abused by you in here. Cut me a coffin out of nothing. Push. I often don't Know myself.
