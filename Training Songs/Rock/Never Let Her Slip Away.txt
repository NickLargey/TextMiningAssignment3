I talked to my baby on the telephone, long distance
I never would have guessed I could miss someone so bad
Yeah, I really only met her 'bout a week ago, but
It doesn't really matter to my heart, I know that

I love her, I'm hoping that I never recover,
'Cause she's good for me, and it would really make me happy,
To never let her slip away

I feel like a kid with a teenage crush on a school day (on a school day afternoon),
I feel like the lead in Romeo and Juliet
I'm a little bit dizzy, I'm a little bit scared,
I never felt this much aware, that
