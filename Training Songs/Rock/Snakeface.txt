Not another drive-in movie 
You know you can't sit still 
Move me 
Snake Snake 

Face out an open window 
Water in my eyes 
Beat me to it 
Meet me here next time 

One more button undone 
You talk too loud I'm talking to you 
Talk it into the ground 
Move me 

Snake Snake 
Face out an open window 
Fire in my eyes 
Beat me to it 

Meet me here next time 
One more button undone 
Next week I'll be a lousy liar 
Next time I'll say when 

You move me
