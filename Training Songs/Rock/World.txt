Fire's burning, smoke is hurling all across the sky
Cross the water, past the border, ain't nowhere to hide
Summer's coming, rainy season, guess it passed us by

World keep turning
World, round and round it goes

Mud sliding, oceans risin', hurricanes and tides
Earth quaking, mountains shakin, ain't nowhere to hide
Hard breathing, lots of sneezing, waters in my eyes

White racists, black hatred, never gonna die
Religion, facisim, Armageddon time
Doomsdayin', God savin', everybody dies

World keep turning
World, round and round it goes
