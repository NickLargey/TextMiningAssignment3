Number one is an omnipotent God
Number two is that he loves you
Number three is you turned your back on him
And now it's time to change that all, now it's time to change

Number one is he sent his only son
Number two is he died instead of you( died for you)
Number three is his blood paid for all your sins (his blood cleanses your sin)
And now it's time to change, come on
Now it's time to change

Don't you know him?
Know his name.
Don't you know him?
Don't you know his name?

Jesus Christ is the Lord of Lords.
Jesus Christ is the king of kings.
Jesus Christ died for all your sins.
And now Its time to change, come on.
Now it's time to change
(Hallelujah x 3)

Number one is to believe on him
Number two is confess your sin
Number three is to turn from sin and flee
You must commit to follow him, you must commit to change

Now you know him, know his name.
Now you know him, now you know his name.

Jesus Christ is the Lord of Lords.
Jesus Christ is the king of kings.
Jesus Christ died for all your sins.
And now Its time to change, come on.
Now it's time to change

Number one is he's coming back again
Number two to judge me and you
Number three is damnation comes from sin
Come on now and turn to him, he'll wash away the sin.

Now you know him, know his name.
Now you know him, now you know his name

Hallelujah x 3
