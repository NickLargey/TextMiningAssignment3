Get the idea cross around the track
Underneath the flank of a thoroughbred racing chaser
Getting the feel as a river flows
Would you like to go n' shoot the mountain masses
And here you stand no taller than the grass sees
And should you really chase so hard
The truth of sport plays rings around you

Going for the one
Going for the one

Get in the way as the tons of water
Racing with you crashing thru the rudder
Once at the start you gamble
That you really surely really mean to finish
After seeing all your sense of fear diminish
As you treat danger a pure collection
As you throw away misconceptions
Going for the one
Going for the one
Going for a listen in time
taken so high
to touch to move
listen to life
touching touch time
travel twilight
taken so high
Roundabout, sounding out, love you so
love you so
love you so

Now the verses I've sang
Don't add much weight to the story in my head
So I'm thinking I should go and write a punch line
But they're so hard to find
In my cosmic mind
So I think I'll take a look out of the window
When I think about you
I don't feel low
N'should I really chase so hard
The truth of sport plays rings around you
Going for the one
Going for the one
Going for to listen in time
taken so high
to touch to move
listen to life
Touching touch time
travel twilight
taken so high
taking your time
turn on to love
turnstile to one
tender timing
rocking rolling
listen in time
taken so high
to touch to move
listen to life
touching touchtime
travel twilight
taken so high
taking your time
turn on to love
turnstile to one
tender timing
rocking rolling
turn on to love
turnstile to one
tender timing
rocking rolling

Moments decide
Moments delight
Moments in flight
Talk about sending love
