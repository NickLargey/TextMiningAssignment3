I guess it's not fair
For me to not care
But I don't, and that's why
You think I'm a great guy

But I want you and you want me too
And you need this, wanna give it to you
And I thought this time I'd say something new

I'll call you, I swear
So, next time be there
Can't keep up, not more
Should quit but, what for?

But I want you and you want me too
And you need this, wanna give it to you
And I thought this time I'd say something new

It's not cruel, I do like you
And I want you to feel that I do

But I want you and you want me too
And you need this, wanna give it to you
And I thought this time I'd say something new

But I want you and you want me too
And you need this, wanna give it to you
And I thought this time I'd say something new
