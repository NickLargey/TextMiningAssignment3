Land ho! My name is Joe,
I drive a truck, steam roll.
Strong man, I got a plan,
Sing it all day, from land to land.

I swear I'm in fourth gear,
My rollers down, trail of smears.
Asphalt, aggregate,
No more trees, pavement.

That's odd, I feel like God,
My wrath of stone, struck my cud.
Cars, trees, pave the seas.
Everyone on your knees.

Ahhhhh.
Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.
Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.
Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.
Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.

"Ooh Joe! What have you done?
Your steam roll has spoiled our fun.
Asphyxiation, we're turning blue,
Ooh Joe, what can you do?"

Suck my... muffler pipe.
Pave the world... out of sight.
Eat shit... soil my shorts.
Pave the world... snort, snort!

Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.
Pave, pave, pave the world, 
Pave, pave, pave the world.
Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.
Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.

Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.
Pave, pave, pave the world, 
Pave, pave, pave the world.
Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.
Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.
