Sitting on a curved back couch 
My mind it rolls 
Reminds me it was so easy 
Staring at the Christmas lights in a box 
That were once hanging on my tree 
Proving once again that seasons change 
So do we it's nothing new 
Similar to the love you find while kissing 
Your first kiss  the world was blind 

Trip along my mindless waveless 
Thoughts they carry on
Trip along my mindless waveless 
Thoughts they carry on

The magic potion within my brain 
Painted pictures of everything 
The cat that barks the dog that meows 
The bird that flies all around 
Trip along my mindless waveless 
Thoughts they carry on 

Sitting on a curved back couch 
My mind it rolls 
Reminds me it was so easy
