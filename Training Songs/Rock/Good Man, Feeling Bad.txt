I can't eat
I can't sleep
I'm so vain
I'm sometimes so weak

I didn't mean to hurt you
Sometimes I just don't think enough
I'm a sane man gripped by my duty
Something lately has really gotten to me

I tell myself that things don't change
And all the time I know that they do
I don't want to conquer no worlds
Just live in your world with pride

I hope that you can understand
That I'm a good man, feeling bad
Lights on the highway, hypnotize me
Like sometimes my pride misguides me

You cross that line when you think
That no one listens they've written you
Off the page
I don't want to conquer no worlds

Just live in your world with pride
I hope that you can understand
That I'm a good man, feeling bad
I go to turn to you now

Don't walk away from me in pride
I hope that you can understand
That I'm a good man feeling bad
I didn't mean to make you so sad

I'm a good man, feeling bad
We can make it like it was before
It can be like it was before
Don't walk away
