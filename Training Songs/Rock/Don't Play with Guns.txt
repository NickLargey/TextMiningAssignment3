Now Josephine, she was a loner
Her fortune of incredible lies
Her problems are now your problems
I hide a gun until the day she dies

She said don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns

Now Angie, she was a demon
She had six arms and Lucifer eyes
She always had its glow
And always made me flow

Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
She said don't play with guns
Don't play with guns

This promise, love and all things go
From my love
She said please be kind and
Please be brave and kill for fun

Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
She said don't play with guns
Don't play with guns

She lays down with a revolver
She's so cold, my heat evolved her

Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
She said don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
