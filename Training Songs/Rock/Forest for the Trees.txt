When you're a young man, down and out 
You really need someone to help you out 
It looks like life or death is your only choice 
It's really hard to see 
The forest for the trees 
The forest for the trees

And when you get angry and everything's black or white 
You know that it isn't that simple, no one's always right 
You know that you're life it worth living 
You gotta start taking if no one else is giving 
And if you're not afraid to open your eyes 
You may be pleasantly surprised 
Things are never as bad as they seem 
Just gotta learn to see 
The forest for the trees
Forest for the trees
You gotta learn to see 

If you need somebody, tell them please 
If you want someone, get up off your knees 
You know that your life is worth living
You gotta start taking if no one else is giving 
And if you're not afraid to open your eyes 
You may be pleasantly surprised 
Things are never as bad as they seem 
Just gotta learn to see 
The forest for the trees
Forest for the trees
You gotta learn to see 

Forest from the trees
You just gotta learn to see 
The forest for the trees
Gotta learn to see
