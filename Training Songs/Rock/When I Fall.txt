Don't you know that I cried in silence. 
I was too afraid to be saved by the hands that held me. 
I waited without hope.

Without you I lose myself. 
I find it hard in cheap hotel with bleary eyes 
And no one knows it.

When I fall, When I lose my head, 
You're the one I call. 
When I fall, When I bleed, 
The one I need, 
You're the one I want, 
The one I call.

Can't you hear the voices humming madly 
Somewhere in my head?
But instead of trying I'm just hiding.
Lost in my regret.

Without you I lose myself. 
I find it hard in cheap hotel with bleary eyes 
And no one knows it.

When I fall, When I lose my head, 
You're the one I call. 
When I fall, When I bleed, 
The one I need, 
You're the one I want, 
The one I call.

I've dragged the past into the light. 
I want to leave it here.
I've dragged the past into the light.
Come take me away from here.
