It ain't gonna save me
It ain't gonna save me, no how

It ain't gonna save me
It ain't gonna save me, no how

It ain't gonna save me
It ain't gonna save me, no how

It ain't gonna save me
It ain't gonna save me, no how

I took a walk the other day and thought about how things used to be 
And then a cloud came into sky it shed on me 
And I don't know why, ever since that day I've never been the same 
Tired and lonely with no one to blame 
And in this bedroom is where I sit cause I don't really don't give a shit

It ain't gonna save me
It ain't gonna save me, no how

It ain't gonna save me
It ain't gonna save me, no how

My negativity it takes a toll 
It uses me just like a bone 
It scares away the things I love 
It keeps its fight and push at shows, 
Ever since that night I've never been the same 
Tired and lonely with no one to blame 
And in this bedroom is where I sit 
Cause I don't really don't give a shit

It ain't gonna save me
It ain't gonna save me, no how

It ain't gonna save me
It ain't gonna save me, no how

It ain't gonna save me
It ain't gonna save me, no how

It ain't gonna save me
It ain't gonna save me, no how

All is lost there is no hope, all is lost you can go home,
All is lost there is no hope for me.

All is lost there is no hope, all is lost you can go home,
All is lost there is no hope for me.

All is lost there is no hope, all is lost you can go home,
All is lost there is no hope for me.

All is lost there is no hope, all is lost you can go home,
All is lost there is no hope for me.

For me
