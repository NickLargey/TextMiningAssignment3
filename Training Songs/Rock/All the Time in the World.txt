People are always telling me that dreams don't ever come true
But I don't need to lie now baby, and I just think of you
All the time, all the time
So lie on your back and think of England and I'll put my hands on you
I've been dreaming on your picture, baby, creaming over you
All the time, all the time

It don't really matter what you want to say, 'cause I know that I've got
All the time, all the time in the world to make you mine
All the time, all the time in the world to make you mine
All the time, all the time in the world to make you mine
To make you mine

Now its all over, I'm sorry baby, my brains are in my pants
You know I've got my eyes on you, I'm looking for a chance
All the time, all the time
So lie on your back and think of England and I'll put my hands on you
I've been dreaming on your picture, baby, creaming over you
All the time, all the time

It don't really matter what you want to say, 'cause I know that I've got
All the time, all the time in the world to make you mine
All the time, all the time in the world to make you mine
All the time, all the time in the world to make you mine
To make you mine
