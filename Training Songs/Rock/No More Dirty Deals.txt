Ten years behind these bars
Has made a man out of me, yes, it has
I been kicked around, left on the ground
While you been downtown just walkin' free
You know what I mean

I've been a fool just takin' the blame for you
You finally made front page news
You double crossed another man
Took his life with your own hand

I ain't sayin' I'm feelin' nice
Now it's your turn to pay the price
I know I'll see you in hell
No more dirty deals, ooh, yeah

Five more days and they're gonna strap me in that chair
My only wish, that you could be there
I remember the night when you shot big Lou down
Handed me the gun and said I'll see you around

I've been a fool just takin' the blame for you
You finally made front page news
You double crossed another man
Took his life with your own hand

I ain't sayin' I'm feelin' nice
Now it's your turn to pay the price
I know I'll see you in hell

I've been a fool just takin' the blame for you
You finally made front page news
You double crossed another man
Took his life with your own hand

I ain't sayin' I'm feelin' nice
But now it's your turn to pay the price
I know I'll see you in hell
No, no more dirty deals

Oh, I've paid my price, girl
Now it's your turn to pay yours
You're just a double crossing woman
