Why do lovers
Break each other's hearts?
I'll never know
Why I don't understand

He's always saying
That there's no one else
While he's doin'
What hurts the most

When you tell a lie
You're always found out
And it's wrong

Use up your patience
But she's back again
Crying and laughing
Does she love the pain?

And when you tell a lie
You're always, found out
It's wrong
