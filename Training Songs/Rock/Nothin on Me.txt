Well I don't tell jokes
And I don't take notes
You been sayin' there ain't much hope
You got nothin' on me
I got friends uptown
And they don't talk down
They been keepin' me safe and sound
We got somethin' to be
So in case you hadn't noticed
I'm alright
Not like I was before
Things used to be so hopeless
But not tonight
Tonight I'm walkin' out that door
I'm not gonna cry
I'm wavin' goodbye
And I know this time
You got nothin' on me
Well it ain't that tough
Just more of the usual stuff
One heartache is more than enough
There ain't nothin to see
I got friends uptown
And they still come 'round
They been keepin' me safe and sound
We got somethin' to be
So don't you try to save me
With your advice
Or turn me into somebody else
'Cause I'm not crazy and you're not nice
Baby keep it to yourself
I'm not gonna cry
And I'm wavin' goodbye
And I know this time
You got nothin' on me
