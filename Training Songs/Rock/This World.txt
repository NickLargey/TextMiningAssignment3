Don't think I can last too long in this world
Don't feel like I belong in this world
Stranded alone on this alien beach
Everything is beyond my reach
Don't think I can make my peace with this world

Don't think I can last too long in this world
Don't feel like I belong in this world
Stranded alone on this alien beach
Everything is beyond my reach
Don't think I can make my peace with this world

Don't think I can take a part in this world
Ain't got he guts, ain't got the heart for this world
All my promises and plans
Run like water through my hands
Don't think I can meet the demands
Of this world

Liar, lover, loser, saint
All I am, all I ain't
It's too much to take
But not so much to lose
Don't feel like I can live in this world
There's one alternative to this world
Solo shotgun serenade
Disconnect the plans I've laid
There's no way, I have no faith in this world
