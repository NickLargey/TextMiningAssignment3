So
It's alright now, it's alright now
So settle down, I will be around
God only knows why I'm so bound
But I'm the one who'll be around

When the cat's among the pigeons
And the word is getting round
I say it's alright now, it's alright now
It's alright

So
Is it alright now?
It's alright now
So settle down
I won't share that frown

When the cat's among the pigeons
And the word is getting round
When the promises are broken
And the premise is unsound
I say it's alright now

When the secrets are now spoken
And they're trying to steal your crown
I say it's alright now
It's alright now
It's alright

God only knows just where I'm bound
But I'm the one who'll stay around
When the clowns are trying to steal your crown
I'll just say it's alright now
