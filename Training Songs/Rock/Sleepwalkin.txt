Last night's blind date
Hit me like a hand grenade
Blew holes in my soul
I'm on a love crusade

Wore my loves like a pair of gloves
But this time I'm going straight'
'Cause I never felt this strange
I'm supposed to be skilled at the game

So once again it goes to show
You'll fall into the trap of love bow
Before you know
Sleepwalkin', but don't panic

We're on the Titanic
But don't you try to call my bluff
Both eyes shut travels hard enough
Sleepwalkin', don't panic

We're on the Titanic
Across the bridges 'round the poop
A fire escape won't hesitate
She's floating there, a living jewel

A gem that makes me lose my cool
It's no surprise I'm paralyzed
This vision's got me hypnotized
Remember your princely duty

Rescue that sleepin' beauty
And I never felt this strange
I'm supposed to be skilled at the game
So once again it goes to show

You'll fall into the trap of love bow
Before you know
Sleepwalkin', but don't panic
We're on the Titanic

But don't you try to call my bluff
With both eyes shut, travels hard enough
Sleepwalkin', don't panic
We're on the Titanic

Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin'
