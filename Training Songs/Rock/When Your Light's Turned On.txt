If I see the lights on in your room
If I see the lights on I call on you
It's a signal that he's gone
So I'll call you when your light's turned on

And I'll be happy to wait up until he goes
And I'll be happy to wait up until I know
That the coast's clear it's all right
So I'll call you when your lights turned on

Everything you say about me gets right home
That's why I put up with you this way, hey
Everything you say about me gets right home
I wish that he would go and I could stay, 
Hey hey, hey hey

That the coast's clear it's all right
So I'll call you when your light's turned on

Everything you say about me gets right home
That's why I put up with you this way, hey
Everything you say about me gets right home
I wish that he would go and I could stay, 
Hey hey

Just for how long can our love go on like this
If you thought more about me you'd end all this
But when your light's on it's all right
So I'll call you when your light's turned on
