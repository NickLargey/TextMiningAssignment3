I don't know where I'm goin'
Now that I am gone
I hope the wind that's blowin'
Helps me carry on

Turn on your radio, baby
Listen to my song
Turn on your night light baby, baby
I'm gone

Turn on your radio

I don't know how it happened
Now that I am gone
I hope I'll never hear it, baby, 
Just in case I'm wrong

Turn on your record player
Listen to my song
Turn on your nightlight baby, baby 
I'm gone
Really long gone

I don't know where life's goin'
But soon it will be gone
I hope the wind that's blowin'
Helps me carry on

Turn on your radio, baby
Baby listen to my song
Turn on the night light, baby, baby
I'm gone
Long gone
 
Turn on your record player

(Turn on your record player...)

And listen to my song
 
Everybody had a hard year
And everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream
And everybody saw the sunshine

Everybody had a good year
And everybody let their hair down
Everybody put their socks up
And everybody put their foot down

Listen, listen
