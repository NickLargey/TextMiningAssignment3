Scarface, you were out of place in Ohio
Too bad, you were up ahead out in the snow
You were feeling like a bomb without a target
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa

Look out Joe I think the sky is fallin'
Seems that all the clouds have turned to stone
I'm calling you from somewhere deep in Ohio
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa

Skintight, you were up all night in the shower
So tough, you were breaking up over the wire
Well I saw you heading up a muddy river
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa

Look out Joe I think the sky is fallin'
Seems that all the clouds have turned to stone
I see the flashing lights along the highway, ohoh
You sounded lost and desperate on the phone.

Look out Joe I think the sky is fallin'
Seems that all the clouds have turned to stone
I'm calling from somewhere deep in Ohio
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
