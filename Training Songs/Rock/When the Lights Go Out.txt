When the lights go out 
Everybody has fun 
When the lights go out 
Everybody runs to a safe place 
When the lights go out 
Everybody's afraid 
When the lights go out 
Everybody starts to pray 
Starts to pray 

Monsters & Madmen 
All come alive 
When the dead start walking 
There's no place to hide 
There's no place to hide 

CHORUS 
Hey--Let's turn the night into day 
Let's start a fire in an alley way 
Let's all go crazy by & by 
And let's all pray to the cat's eye 

No one can be trusted, when the lights go out 
People act real crazy, people start to shout 
People huddle together, try and hide their fear 
People party down by they ain't goin' nowhere 
They ain't goin' nowhere 

Gonna run outside 
What's there to see 
Just one big shadow there to comfort me 
There to comfort me . . . there to comfort me 

CHORUS 

Just common folks like you and me 
Turn into mobs that get so crazy 
Prowl the streets like cats 
Out for the hunt 
Breaking all the windows just because it's fun 
Just because it's fun, just because it's fun
