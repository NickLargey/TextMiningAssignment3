When I lay and try close blood eyes
When I lay and try to waste your time
You'll be sleeping
You'll be sleeping

When I lay and try to waste time
When I lay and try to have no time
You'll be sleeping
You'll be sleeping

I will never have guessed it
I would have record this
I will never have guessed it
But you have record this, so soon
You have record this, so soon

You'll be sleeping
You'll be sleeping
I would never have guessed it
I would have record this
I would never have guessed it
I would have record this, so soon
Would have record this, so soon
Would have record this, so soon
Would have record this, so soon
