Oh, here it comes again, I feel the heat again
Blaze to the very end, rise like the sun again

I'm on my feet but I can't seem to stand
Got control but ain't got command
The things I need slip through my hand
So I tell it like it is, always hit or miss
Tell me to my face, like it really is
Make it plain to see, straight from you to me

Oh, here it comes again, I feel the need again
To burn like a flame again, blow like a hurricane
And when I look I just don't recognise
It's all off course and bound to collide
The truth I hear is a truth full of lies

So I tell it like it is, always hit or miss
Tell me to my face, like it really is
Make it plain to see, straight from you to me

I'm on my feet but I can't seem to stand
Got control but ain't got command
The things I need slip through my hand

So I tell it like it is, always hit or miss
Tell me to my face, like it really is
