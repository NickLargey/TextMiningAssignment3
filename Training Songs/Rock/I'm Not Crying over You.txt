I don't mind this empty room, and I like it when I'm alone,
I'm trying not to think about you, I'm not waiting by the telephone,
I'm watching a late-night movie, where the lovers say goodbye,
And it's really getting to me, and tears are in my eyes,
But I'm not crying, I'm not crying,
I'm not crying over you, I'm over you;

I go out with all of my friends, and I'm hardly ever at home,
You know things just couldn't be better,
I have read it in my horoscope,
I might take a walk past your house, for a trip down memory lane,
You may see me at your window, standing in the pouring rain,
But I'm not crying, I'm not crying,
I'm not crying over you, no I'm not crying,
I'm not crying, I'm not crying, I'm not crying over you,
I'm over you;

No I'm not crying, I'm not crying,
I'm not crying over you, I'm over you,
I'm over you.
