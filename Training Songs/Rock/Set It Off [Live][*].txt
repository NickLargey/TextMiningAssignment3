He was standing at the rock
Gathering the fog
Getting there with no directions
And underneath the arch
Turned into a march
And there he found a spot to set this fucker on

Set if off
Set it on my children
Set it right
Set it off
Set it off my children
All right
Set it off
Set it on my children
Set it fire
Set it off
Set it on my children

Suddenly a shot
Ripped into his heart
He needed some attention
And there he played his card
Going into shock
The last thing that he said was set this fucker on

Set if off
Set it on my children
Set it right
Set it off
Set it off my children
All right
Set it off
Set it on my children
Set it fire
Set it off
Set it on my children

Alright [6x]

Jesus at the back door
Everything is alright
All we need is some direction
Every time the wind blows
Everything you don't know
Turns into a revelation
It all ends up inside your head
Time is wasted

Set if off
Set it on my children
Set it right
Set it off
Set it off my children
All right
Set it off
Set it on my children
Set it fire
Set it off
Set it on my children
