Waitress, more wine
We celebrate, the life and times of Johnny Make Believe
He was the greatest liar, of all mankind
The biggest drunk, you ever saw alive
He was a devil, undisguised
He will be sorely missed tonight

And the next day, will never be the same
Without the beautyful Johnny Make Believe

So let's get high, laugh till we cry
Always remember, his last words:
â??farewell cruel world, all you pretty girls,
Don't send me flowers, hold me in your dreamsâ??
And then the spirit in the bottle
Took our Johnny for a ride
Come on waitress, pour us more wine
To drown our grief, for Johnny Make Believe

He tattooed my heart, branded my soul
He said: â??Go for true love, not for fool's gold

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, etc., etc.
