It doesn't really matter where you are
You could be living on a distant star
Just as long as you're feeling right
You could be happy on this fine night
If you just use a little imagination
And put your mind in a new situation
You could be tripping through the galaxy
Lost in a dream just you and me

(chorus)
You reach your arms up to the sky
And cast your love across the universe
You're feeling happy but you don't know why
And we'll go dancing on the distant dog star with you

As we go traveling through time and space
And leave the earth to the human race
On our approach to the dog star
We can see the Milky War bar
On a planet in a new constellation
We begin a great celebration
We will sing and dance until the day
For tomorrow is a week away

(chorus)

Step out on the floor feel light on your feet
Anti-gravity's on can't sit in your seat
You're so far from home and all at once you know
That you're not ready to go you want to stay here for the rest of your life

Just as long as you're feeling right
You could be happy on this fine night
You could be tripping through the galaxy
Lost in a dream just you and me

(chorus)
