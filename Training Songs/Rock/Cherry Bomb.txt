Can't stay at home
Can't stay at school
Old folks say
"You poor little fool"

Down the street
I'm the girl next door
I'm the fox you've been waiting for

Hello daddy
Hello mom
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb
Hello world
I'm your wild girl
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb

Stone age love and strange sounds too
Come on baby let me get to you
Bad nights causin' teenage blues
Get down ladies you've got nothing to lose!

Hello daddy
Hello mom
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb
Hello world
I'm your wild girl
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb

Hello daddy
Hello mom
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb
Hello world
I'm your wild girl
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb

Hey street boy what's your style?
Your dead end dreams don't make you smile
I'll give ya something to live for
Have ya, grab ya
'Til you're sore

Hello daddy
Hello mom
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb
Hello world
I'm your wild girl
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb

Hello daddy
Hello mom
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb
Hello world
