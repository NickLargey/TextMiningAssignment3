My heavy heart pounds hard tonight
Down this highway in the wind
The windshield wipers clean away
The tears I cry within
The love I've thrown away, I know
I'll never feel again
And I, I'm just twistin' in the wind

Someone cut me down from here
I can't prove what don't exist
Did you feel the same as I?
Or was there something I might have missed?

I turned my back on everyone
Who wanted me to win
I needed you so bad, I guess
That's the way I was back then
Now I, I'm just twistin' in the wind

I believe I'll go down to the bridge
And watch the trains roll by
See the sparks fly from their wheels
Where the rocks and the cinders lie
The weight I feel inside tonight
Could put a freight train in a spin
And I, I'm just twistin' in the wind

Someone cut me down from here
I can't prove what don't exist
Did you feel the same as I?
Or was there something I might have missed?

I turned my back on everyone
Who wanted me to win
I needed you so bad, I guess
That's the way I was back then
Now I, I'm just twistin' in the wind

Love made a fool of me
At the gates of the guillotine
I can't believe I heard the truth
Comin' from your answering machine
How did I become this broken man?
Was I too blind to bend?
Now I, I'm just twistin' in the wind
I, I, I, I, I'm just twistin' in the wind

Someone cut me down from here
I been hangin' here too long
Release me from the binds of love
I can't tell right from wrong
