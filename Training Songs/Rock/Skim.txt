Consider the source of your energy
Do you just hate him more than you love me?
Never been this sore for alkalinity

There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in
There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in
I'm only the skim of what has already been
I know every tense in which I cannot exist yet

My head swivels it one ways
My head swivels it one ways

Can you probe the ends of the almighty?
Did he hold your hips with authority?
No pride or projection swells like insecurity

If only I could use that to hold you
I'd tell ya, I would use that to hold you

There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in
There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in

I'm only the skim of what has already been
I know every tense in which I cannot exist
There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in
There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in
