Never been so far away 
I don't think I want to stay in this room
Anymore

If I crawl across the floor 
Then I'd be closer to that door 
It's too far

Never been so far away 
Just lost the last thought in my head
What happens now? 

Some fantasy you've been
Pick up the pieces in my mind 
I'm going home
