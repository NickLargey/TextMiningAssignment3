Stop everything
I think I hear the President
The Pied Piper of the TV screen
Is gonna make it simple
And he's got it all mapped out
And illustrated with cartoons
Too hard for clever folks to understand
They're more used to words like:
Ideology 
They're not talkin' 'bout right and left
They're talkin' 'bout
Right and wrong, do you know the difference
Right and wrong, do you know the difference 
'Tween the right and the left and the east and the west
What you know and the things that you'll never see
So what ya think
You like the Yankees or the Mets this year
And what about this latest war of words
And what about the Commies
I saw the news last night
All illustrated with cartoons
So when they come with that opinion poll
They better not use words like
Ideology 
Or try to tell me 'bout the issues
Ideology 
Whose side are you on
We're talkin' 'bout
Right and wrong, do you know the difference
Right and wrong, do you know the difference 
'Tween the right and the left and the east and the west
What you know and the things that you'll never see
Where are we?
Right and wrong, do you know the difference
Right and wrong, do you know the difference 
'Tween the right and the left and the east and the west
What you know and the things that you'll never see
