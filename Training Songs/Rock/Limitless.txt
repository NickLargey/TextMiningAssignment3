This song goes to everyone who soul is broken,
Was search for a answer and left in the dark
This is for you, thi-thi-this is for you
Stand up, oh!

I will never be afraid
You shot me once, I'm still standing
I will never dig my grave
You shot me once, I'm still standing
And every part of my keeps screaming
Gat on with your life and stars beleaving
I'm trying to heal wounds but I'm still bleeding
I'm trying to heal wounds but I'm still bleeding

I've run out of all that I was
I've search for the meaning
And ended up lost, but I
See the light in the end of the road
And it's guiding me, guiding me home

I know I no longer must walk through this world alone
I know I no longer must walk through this world alone
We must resist to be a part of their insolence
We must start the resist
Follow no one, oh

I've run out of all that I was
I've search for the meaning
And ended up lost (ended up lost)
But I see the light in the end of the road
It's guiding me home where I'll
Heal all that has left me bleeding
While thier words still burn
These scares are another lesson learned

You live your life so disconnected
As you sit there mighty
In your fucking little throne
I'll see to it that all you walls crumble
I'll tear it down stone by stone

Bow down, I will not kneel before you
Bow down, you're never gonna wear my crown
You shot me once, but I'm still here
You shot me once, but I'm still here

This is for those who seen the light
We must rise, we're limitless tonight
And though the sun may never rise
We must know, we're limitless tonight

This is for those who seen the light
We must rise, we're limitless tonight
And though the sun may never rise (and though the sun may never rise)
We must know, we're limitless tonight (we're limitless tonight)

We're limitless tonight (tonight)
We're limitless tonight (tonight)

It's time for destriction
