A man I met in my youth
Came to me in the light of truth
A beautiful dream that was
Till he died one rainy fall
There I was a child bride
Widowed at nineteen, defied
Never would I let him go
Go to the place that heaven knows

On the evening of his death
My shoulders felt a brushing breath
Cold were his hands on my breast
The man that I loved and put to rest
He came to me and held me close
We danced till dawn in the early snow
There I felt him cry and cry
