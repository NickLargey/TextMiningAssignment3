When the feelin' is ended
There ain't no use pretendin'
Don't ya worry, it's only love

When your world has been shattered
Ain't nothin' else matters
It ain't over, It's only love
And that's all, yeah

When your heart has been broken
Hard words have been spoken
It ain't easy, but it's only love

And your life ain't worth livin'
And you're ready to give in
Just remember, that it's only love

You can live without the aggravation
Ya gotta want to win, ya gotta want to win

You keep lookin' back in desperation
Over and over and over again

When your world has been shattered
Ain't nothin' else matters
It ain't over, It's only love

And if your life ain't worth livin'
And you're ready to give in
Just remember, that it's only love
Yea, that's all

Ya it ain't easy baby
But it's only love, and that's all
