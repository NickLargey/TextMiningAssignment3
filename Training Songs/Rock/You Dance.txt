I won't face another day
I won't wait until tomorrow
I won't spend another night without you
Let me carry you away
Let me wake you every morning
Let me wander every day beside you

'Cause you dance in my head, in my heart, in my everything
You belong

You won't worry 'bout a thing
You can sleep a little longer
You can dream another dream beside me
I could walk another road
I could sing another sad song
But I could never make it home without you

'Cause you dance in my head, in my heart, in my everything
You belong

'Cause you dance in my head, in my heart, in my hands
