Oh, sweet morning
Is your head not right
Did you hear my warning
This is the time of times

And your head feels like your body
You mind is close behind
There's a teardrop on your shoulder
Says this is the time of times
It's the time of times again

This is the time of times
It's the time of times again

Oh, sweet morning
And your head's not right
Did you hear my warning
This is the time of times

And your head feels like your body
Your mind is close behind
There's a teardrop on your shoulder
Says this is the time of times
It's the time of times again

The time of times
Yeah this is the time of times
