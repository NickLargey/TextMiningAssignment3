Another heartache for me
Another thorn in my side
Another warning, another warning
Remember Russia (children)
Remember Russia (dying)
Remember Russia (children)
Remember Russia (dying)
Another stain on humanity
Another scar we can't heal
Another warning, another warning
Remember Russia (children)
Remember Russia (dying)
Remember Russia (children)
Remember Russia (dying)
And damn those satellites to hell
Another waste of brain
And now they've poisoned
They've poisoned our rain
Another warning, another warning
Remember Russia (children)
Remember Russia (dying)
Remember Russia (children)
Remember Russia (dying)
And damn those satellites to hell
Remember Russia, remember Russia
Remember Russia, remember Russia
Remember Russia, remember Russia
Remember Russia
