Breakin' out of nowhere
There's a fading echo that says
I'm waiting for you again

Where I'm gonna find you
When I'm gonna see you again
I've been on my own so long

Goin' out to no land
Wastin' all my nights away
I've been in the rain to long

Loosin' all my seasons
Show them all the reasons
To say that you are the one

Always down waiting for a miracle
To move into you with my soul

I'm lookin' all around
I'm sure that I'll find out something good
Yeah something good yeah
I move from north to south
I'm sure that I'll find out something good
Yeah something good yeah

Always down waiting for a miracle
To move into you with my soul
