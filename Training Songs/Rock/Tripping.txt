First they ignore you,
Then laugh at you and hate you.
Then they flight you,
Then you win.

When the truth dies,
Very bad things happen.
They're being heartless,
Again.

I know, its gonna, there's gonna be violence
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take
Why do you think we should suffer in silence
When a hearth is broken there's nothing to break

You've been mixing,
With some very heavy faces.
They boys have done,
A bit of bird.

They don't kill their own,
and they all love their mothers.
But you're out of your depth son,
Have a word.

I know, its gonna, there's gonna be violence
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take
Why do you think we should suffer in silence
The heart broken there's nothing to break

All is wonderful in this life,
Dreaming of the sun she warms.
You should see me in the afterlife,
Picking up the songs of lures.

When you think we're lost, we're exploring.
What you think is work because I'm adoring.
You don't want the truth, truth is boring.
I've got this fever need to,
Leave the house,
Leave the car,
Leave the bad men where they are,
I'll leave a few shells in my gun,
And stop me starring at the sun.

I know, its gonna, there's be gonna violence
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take
Why do you think we should suffer in silence
My heart is broken there's nothing to break.
