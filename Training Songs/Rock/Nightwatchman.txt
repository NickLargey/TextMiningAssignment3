I'm the nightwatchman 
I make the rounds 
I'm the nightwatchman 
I gotta keep my nose to the ground 

Honey this ain't no job for a man like me 
I got potential, I can be just what you need 
You got to think about the pros and cons 
You could be right could be wrong 

I'm the nightwatchman 
I am security 
I'm the nightwatchman 
How safe do you want to be? 

I sit around at night, listen to the radio 
If I get bored I may have a little smoke 
Yeah I got a permit to wear this .38 
But listen, my life's worth more than the minimum wage 

I'm the nightwatchman 
I am security 
I'm the nightwatchman 
How safe do you want to be?
