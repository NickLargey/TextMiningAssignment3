Welcome
Welcome
How do you do - what do you say
Welcome to a new dark age
Let's go straight to bed
Love's got outta hand
You must be outta your head

When you feel in the night
This can't happen to you
It's a war that we fight
Yes we do
Yes we do

Welcome to the new dark ages
Welcome to the new dark ages
Ooh yeah
Only love can save us now

Love has become a four letter word
It's past its best and seldom heard
Love's left on the shelf like cigarettes
It's bad for your health

And you feel in the night
It's a scary thing
You believe in what's right
Take care - stop to think

Welcome to the new dark ages
Welcome to the new dark ages

Stop - Take - Care - Think
Is - this - real - love

And you feel in the night
Can this bad dream be true
It's a war that we fight
Don't let it happen to you

Welcome to the new dark ages
Welcome to the new dark ages
Welcome to the new dark ages
Welcome to the new dark ages
Welcome
New dark ages
Welcome to the new dark ages
Welcome to
New dark ages
New dark ages
