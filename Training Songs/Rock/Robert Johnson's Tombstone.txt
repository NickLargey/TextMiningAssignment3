Tell me where did they lay you down?
Where did they lay you down?
Two graves in Mississippi and nobody knows
Where did they lay you down?
Tell me where did they lay you down?

Did the Devil really buy your soul?
Did the Devil really buy your soul?
Did he teach you how to play and take your soul away?
Did the Devil really buy your soul?
Did the Devil really buy your soul?

The heat was rising to the Delta haze
And your fate was sealed when you saw her face
Making love all afternoon
Another woman put a spell on you
Oh yeah

Saturday night at the Three Points Inn
You drank the whiskey with the poison in
Cause a jealous guy had a girl to lose
The last time you played the blues
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Oh, going down to the crossroads tonight
Around midnight
I'll be looking for you
Oh, going down to the crossroads tonight
I know it'll be alright
If I listen to you

Tell me where did they lay you down?
Where did they lay you down?
Two graves in Mississippi and nobody knows
Where did they lay you down?
Where did they lay you down?
Tell me where did they lay you down?
