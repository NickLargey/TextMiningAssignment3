Mother mother found me on her step
Gracious mother held me to her breast Until the day I started pushin'
Too late to cry she turned away I started pushin'
I saw no future in this lack
I started pushin' 
Pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back

Baby brother clinging to her hair
Gracious mother pleading, "not another soul to bare"
He started pushin'
All my kings have fallen down
I started pushin'
Fallen heroes feed the ground
I started pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back

Fallin' down, now I know her
I know I'll never drown, drown, drown
Fallin' down, now I know her
I know I'll never drown, drown, drown

Ah, I was pushin'
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back 
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back

I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
