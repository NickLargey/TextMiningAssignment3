Just give me the news
It can all be lies
Exciting over fair or the right thing at the right time
Everything is clear
Just how you described
The way it appears, a world possessed by the human mind

Then I think I smiled
Then I think you said, "it's fine"
And quietly I dressed, in a world completely possessed by the human mind

We're in awe of no one
We've none of their fear
Fighting's goin' nowhere and we stay right here
Where's everything is quiet
A little super dangerous
In the shadow of the law and with colours of justice

Then I hope I smiled
Then I'm sure you said, "it's fine"
They got no interest in a world completely possessed by the human mind

Everything is quiet
A little super dangerous
Quiet enough to hear god rustlin' around in the bushes
Oh, but it was you
Girl, I was so afraid
You said, "you shoulda seen the look on yer face"

Then I hope I laughed
Then I hope I said, "it's fine"
And quietly undressed in a world completely possessed by the human mind

Oh it was you
Girl, I was so afraid
You said, "you shoulda seen the look on yer face"
