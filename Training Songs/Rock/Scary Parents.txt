Nothin's gonna change with everything the same,
You know it baby,
Tell me what you done,
Your not the only one to blow it baby.

Why don't you say it like it is?
Why don't you take it to the kids?
'Cause no one gives a f*ck
Your parents messed you up- You know it baby!

You may never learn,
'Til you crash 'til you burn,
Don't hide your face in the crowd,
In the crowd. 

When I was at school they said I was a fool,
They told me daily,
Now that I'm a man, nobody understands,
Except you, my darlin', baby. 

Why don;'t you say it like it is?
Why don't you take it to the kids?
'Cause no one gives a f*ck
Your parents messed you up-You know it baby! 

We may never learn 'til we crash 'til we burn,
You'll lose your head in the crowd.
Oh here it comes! 

Say thank you,
SAY IT LIKE IT IS!
Say thank you,
EVERYTHING IS CLEAR!
'Cause no one gives a f*ck
Your parents messed you up-You know it baby! 

Why don't you,
Why don't you,
Why don't you,
Say thank you,
Say thank you,
Say thank you? 

We may never learn 'til we crash 'til we burn... 'til we burn!
