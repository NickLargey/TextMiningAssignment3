I never thought love knew distance
I heard once smitten 
It was wave goodbye
To the clubs and the dance on  the tables shaking
Bad boy turned to a life of good

Passing round  your number  to a bunch of strangers
Girls in heels and their lips so red

They're not looking for love love love
They're looking for sweets
They're looking for a daddy
They're looking for sugar
Hey 
Hey 
Hey 

Everybody told me it would never work out yeah
Living so far apart
And like a fool I  though the oceans    
Divided the continents 
But not a faithful heart

Everybody told me that the sunshine that 
I saw in  your eyes was fake
That the blue was a too 
I heard every single word they said 
But it sounded like French
And  Je ne parle pas francais

Cause I  was looking for 
Love love love

OK I  decided in my fairy tale world 
We were hands stretched across the sea
And every time somebody told tell me 
You were playing around I said 
Oh no
He wouldn't hurt me
But more and more I find there's no answer to all my mail 
And I can't reach you on your phone 
Last thing we planned so meticulously  
You missed the plane 
And I spent the night alone
I gotta tell you now 

Always thought of you as stronger baby
You were bigger than the sky 
Don't want revenge she ain't a lady baby
And  you know that is what I am
Aah aah aah

All I get from you is an abridged  illusive story
Try to put a spin on cheating babe now you bore me

Once I was naive and I listened to the lies 
And what you told me I would just believe
But while your other female friends are looking for a paycheck
It doesn't take money to please me

Do you read me
When you need me
I'm telling you babe 
It cuts both ways
Believe me

Everybody told me it would never work out yeah
Living so far apart
Like a fool I  though the oceans    
Divided the continent 
But not a faithful heart

Cause I was so in love
Yeah I was so in love
Yeah I was so in love
Yeah I was so in love
I was so in love

Love love love
Love love love
Love love love
