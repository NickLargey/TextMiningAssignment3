Lost in another world, oh Saturn, Saturn Girl.

Far away, ot an infinite world I escape 
I'm clear and calm, I'm unafraid. 
Sunless days, in my sheltered Milky Way 
In Saturn's rings I feel no pain. 

In my heart, in my head 
Oh, Saturn Girl has always bled 
No you're not, from this world 
Saturn Girl. 

I can't explain, why I don't belong to the same world 
I don't fit in, and I will not stay. 
I want to fly, oh I long for my violet skies 
My astral nights, my peace of mind.

Chorus 

Lost in another world, oh Saturn, Saturn Girl.
Saturn Girl, I'd rather be lost in my empyrean world 
Than be down on earth. 

Chorus 

Everybody tries to break my dreams to break through, 
They don't believe in my words, they don't believe in my world. 
"Oh you're lost in another world, 
Oh you're lost you Saturn Girl, oh you crazy girl,
Oh you Saturn Girl..."

Chorus
