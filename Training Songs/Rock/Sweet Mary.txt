Sweet Mary sent a letter to me
She say to hurry home 
I need you right away
I've got a   made full of love
And I'm all alone
Hurry today

Sweet Mary I'm coming home
Coming home to you
Sweet Mary I'm coming home
That's the least I can do

Sweet Mary in that letter to me
It's up to you
I need you right away
And now I got to hop a freight
Get me home by dawn
I got to sleep

Sweet Mary I'm coming home
Coming home to you
Sweet Mary I'm coming home
That's the least I can do

Sweet mary has a smile on her face
You know she's hapy to see me
Rather anyway
I only hope that the passing of time
She'll always feel that way
I won't pack up my dreams

Sweet Mary I'm coming home
Coming home to you
Sweet Mary I'm coming home
That's the least I can do

Sweet Mary I'm coming home
Coming home to you
Sweet Mary I'm coming home
That's the least I can do
