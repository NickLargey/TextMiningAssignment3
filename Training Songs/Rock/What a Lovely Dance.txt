What a lovely dance 
Wasn't looking for romance 
But I found it 
What a pretty day 
Rain and wind that came soon went away 
Just like my love 
Oh but she'll come back some day 
Feels like I lost both of my gloves 
And my hat has blown away 
I can only live in hope 
Only live in hope 
And pray 

What a special night 
Wasn't think about what was wrong 
But what was right 
Such a pretty day 
Rain and wind that came soon went away 
Just like my love 
Oh but she'll come back some day 
Feels like I lost both of my gloves 
And my hat has blown away 
I can only live in hope 
Only live in hope 
And pray 

Just like my love 
Oh but she'll come back some day 
Feels like I lost both of my gloves 
And my hat has blown away 
I can only live in hope 
Only live in hope 
And pray 

We can't and we won't 
We can't 
Live without 
We can't, we can't 
Live without hope 
We can't, we won't 
Live without hope 
We can't and we won't 
Live without hope
