Yes, my bucket's got a hole in it 
Yes, my bucket's got a hole in it 
Yes, my bucket's got a hole in it 
I can't buy no beer 

Well, I went upon a mountain 
I looked down in the sea 
I seen the crowds and the fishes 
Doing the be bop beep 
Cause my bucket's got a hole in it 
Yes, my bucket's got a hole in it 
Yes, my bucket's got a hole in it 
I can't buy no beer 

Well, I'm standing on the corner 
With a bucket in my hand 
I'm a waitin' for a woman 
That ain't got no man 
Cause my bucket's got a hole in it 
Yes, my bucket's got a hole in it 
Yes, my bucket's got a hole in it 
I can't buy no beer 

Well, me and my baby 
We bought a Ford 
And now we sit together 
On the running board 
Cause my bucket's got a hole in it 
Yes, my bucket's got a hole in it 
Yes, my bucket's got a hole in it 
I can't buy no beer
