She may not be the one you're thinking of
But she is still the only one you really love
Yes I see you every day
Trying to score an easy lay
Sure the one you need, she's sure the one you need
Tries to know what it is you want

Well maybe you're the leader of the band
But even you must sometimes need a helping hand
Yeah I have seen you too many time s
Robbing blind men from their dimes
Sure the one you need, she's sure the one you need
She tries to know what it is you want
She'll lay it all on you

You may think that you know where it's at
But I have seen you wearing her top hat
If you come home through that door
You won't see her anymore
She's sure the one you need, she's sure the one you need
She tries to know what it is you want

Sure the one you need
She's sure the one you need
