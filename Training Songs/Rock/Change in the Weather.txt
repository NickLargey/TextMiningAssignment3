Watch out sweet thing
A change in the weather
Is all that you bring
Look up the weather's strange
The only thing we know 
That's gonna come for sure is change
Look at my life go round and round
Hands on the clock still turning
Now I want it but I just can't see
I want that and that's just like me
Goodbye, bye kids
Where you gonna run
From the things you keep hid
Look out the weather's strange
The only thing we know 
That's gonna stay the same is change
Look at my life go round and round
Hands on the clock still turning
Now I want it but I just can't see
I want that and that's just like me
You know it's me
That picks you up
You know it's me 
That puts you down
