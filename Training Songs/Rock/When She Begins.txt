I was feelin' kinda beat, I decided
To hit the streets. I was lookin'
For a place for this heart of
Mine. Well I said to myself, oh
God this must be hell 
I think I was slowly losin' my mind

Well round and round she goes
Where she'll stop nobody knows.

why'know that woman put a spell 
On me, but if you start me, start
Me, start me you can't stop me,
Stop me, stop me. When she begins
To rock, honey, I begin to roll
I was hangin' by the phone, tired
Of sleepin' alone

Baby tell me where did I go wrong? When
Minutes seem like hours and
Days seem like weeks, how could
A year last so fucking long?

Well round and round she goes
Where she'll stop nobody knows.
why'know that woman put a spell 
On me, but if you start me, start
Me, start me you can't stop me,
Stop me, stop me. When she begins
To rock, honey, I begin to roll 
I was hangin' with a couple

Of chicks, man I was just looking
For a place for this raggedy ol'
Heart of mine.

Well round and round she goes
Where she'll stop nobody knows.
ya know that woman put a spell 
On me, but if you start me, start
Me, start me you can't stop me,
Stop me, stop me. When she begins
To rock, honey, I begin to roll.
