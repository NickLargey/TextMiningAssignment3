She´s the heart of an enemy
You´ll find
Stationary by your side
Yeah she´ll search for a remedy
Last of her kind
As she breathes love to your life
What´s the price of a memory?
Broken lives
Scattered here by the graveside
Are we late for the ceremony?
Who decides?
Pray for time

Cause we all need a safe place to hide
Yeah we all need some love our lives
And you know if they come for you
I´ll be right here by your side
Cause we all need a safe place to hide

She stands for the innocent
Inside her heart beats
A crowd unknown
A scream breaks the interval
Of time
One last word been thrown

And you know if they come for you
I´ll be right here by your side
Cause we all need some love in our lives
Yeah we all need some love in our lives

Shine a light on your love
You be strong don´t give up on your life
Shine a light on your love
You be strong don´t give up on your life
Shine a light on your love
You be strong don´t give up on your life
Shine a light on your love
You be strong don´t give up on your life

Cause we all need a safe place to hide
And we all need some love in our lives
