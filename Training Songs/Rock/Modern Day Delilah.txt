She's a wizard with her sheers
She's been turning heads for years
All the darlings and the dears say she's got the touch
An exclusive clientele
Oh she knows each one so well
No one dares to kiss and tell

She's a modern day Delilah
Keeps her scissors razor sharp
Once she finds your weakness
She'll cut you to the quick
Stab you in the heart
She'll love you like a lion
Leave you like a lamb
She's a modern day Delilah
She'll cut you if she can

Oh she's sure what's right for you
Slips it into your shampoo
Only she knows if it's true
Blondes have more fun
When you wake up on the floor
All your strength swept out the door
Take a mirror from the drawer
The damage is done

She's a modern day Delilah
Keeps her scissors razor sharp
Once she finds your weakness
She'll cut you to the quick
Stab you in the heart
She'll love you like a lion
Leave you like a lamb
She's a modern day Delilah
She'll cut you if she can

She's the keeper of secrets
Mistress of lies
You'll see a cold steel blade
When you look into her eyes
She's a modern day Delilah
Keeps her scissors razor sharp
Once she finds your weakness
She'll cut you to the quick
Stab you in the heart
She'll love you like a lion
Leave you like a lamb
She's a modern day Delilah
She'll cut you if she can
She's a modern day Delilah
