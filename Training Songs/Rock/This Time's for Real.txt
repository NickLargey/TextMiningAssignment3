Why do you tell me all these lies?
I just want to live my life
I don't want to leave my dreams behind
Tell me
Why am I only getting older?
My patience getting shorter
I'm running out of time
And I hope that I get what I wanted

This time's for real
Is there anything I wanted?
Is there anything I needed?
Anything at all?

This time's for real
Is there anything I wanted?
Is there anything I needed?
Anything at all?

Why do you make me feel denied?
Always pushing me aside
You do not decide what's wrong or right
Tell me
Why am I feeling so much pressure?
Am I searching for the answer?
