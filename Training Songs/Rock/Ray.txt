Hey, what the hell do you want me to do?
Hey, does it look like I'm steady to you?
You might look twice, 'cause I'm moving

Okay, you see that I can walk which is good
But still you're trying to make me talk like you would
Your intention's nice, you're improving

For all you know, you're doing fine
But I guess it shows
That even jewelery that's fake does shine

[Chorus]
So shut your mouth now, big boy
I'm just myself, not your toy
It's in my nature to be changing
Now is it so hard to see
You can not make me to be
Someone who never will be changing?

So what the hell do you want me to say?
Another half-ass rhyme, another cliche?
You might be right for this one time

You take for granted I'm your servant subdued
It doesn't make sense to me, but to you
So here's one last bright make-shift rhyme

For all you know I'm just a fool
But I guess that shows
You can not judge a dog just by it's drool

[Chorus]

And I'm losing you,
With a big smile on my face
You're nothing new,
Not hard to replace

I'm losing you, 
But I'm not loosing ground
So peek-a-boo, 
And you won't be around 
You won't be around

No, you won't be around

[Chorus]

'Cause I change with time 
And that's not a crime
Someone like you cannot derange me
Yeah, I change with time 
And that's not a crime
Its in my nature to be changing
Changing
