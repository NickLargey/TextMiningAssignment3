When I'm getting home to you
I gotta show you what I can do
But everything connects and that ain't nowhere
Well, maybe they're just giving you all you've ever wanted
And maybe you never-ever know what that was
And maybe you're just finding it out now
With a Vietnamese baby on your mind

Technology satellite, well
What's wrong today and why was
Everyone so busy they've forgotten
Why they're playing that, he said
What's wrong today is what's wrong with you
You're so solid, busy solid, that's all you do
With a Vietnamese baby on your mind
Your pretty little mind

Match me your slingshot with
Every life of Queens and I got to
Show you more busted glass than any girl ever seen
Since I been blasted, I've been blownin', I've been backing away
You've got to back it away
You've got to take a search of values, yeah
But I've got a concert out to play
With a Vietnamese baby on your mind
Your pretty little mind
Your pretty little mind

When I'm getting home to you
I've got to show you what I can do
But everything connects and that ain't nowhere
No-no-no
Ah-baby, no-no-nowhere
It just won't give out, no, no
I'm talking about your overkill
Talking bout your overkill
Got to shout about your overkill
Now that it's over, now that it's over
Now that it's over, now that it's over, what ya gonna do?
