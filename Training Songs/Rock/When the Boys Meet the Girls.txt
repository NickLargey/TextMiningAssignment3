When the boys meet the girls,
I'll know my love when I see him,
I'll recognize the look in his eyes,
That tells me this must be him.

When the boys meet the girls,
I'lll know his face in a moment,
And in the space of a moment,
We'll fall in love.

There in the crowd, he'll be waiting,
Heaven will reach out to me,
There in his arms, I'll discover,
The wonderland that lovers only see.

'Til the day that we meet,
I'll play the part of a dreamer,
Dreamin' my favorite dream,
Again and again,
That moment when,
The boys meet the girls.
