Well Iâ??m a stranger here in this place called Earth
And I was sent down here to discover the worth
Of your little blue planet third from the sun
Come on and show me what youâ??ve done

We got the aeroplane, we got the automobile
We got sky scraper buildings made of glass and steel
Weâ??ve got synthetic food that nearly tastes real
And a little white pill that makes you feel hey
Hey, A whole lot better when you get out of bed
You take one in the morning for the lovelier head
We got everything everybody needs to survive
Surely the good life has arrived

I think your atmosphere is hurting my eyes
And your concrete mountains are blacking out the skies
Now I donâ??t say that youâ??ve been telling me lies
But why do I hear those childrenâ??s cries

Iâ??m a stranger here, Iâ??m just looking around

I see the aeroplanes carrying the bombs
Why, youâ??ve even found people to drop them on
You know you canâ??t keep what you take by force
But itâ??s only my first impression of course.

Well Iâ??m a stranger here on your planet Earth

We got the rivers and the mountains and the valleys and the trees
We got the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea
We got the â?? 
Oh you crazy fools donâ??t you know you had it made
You were living in paradise
But take it from one who knows
Who knows the gates of Heaven can close
I only pray that you take my advice
Because Paradise wonâ??t come twice.

Well Iâ??m a stranger here in this place called Earth
And I was sent down here to discover the worth
Of your little blue planet third from the sun
I think Iâ??ll go back home where I come from.
