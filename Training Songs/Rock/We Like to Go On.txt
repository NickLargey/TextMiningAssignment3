So what the hell is going on
I cannot touch myself
For I'm a winner too
How come I'm losing track

The sign, the fly
Will dry my hands
Of you

I know it all on fire
But shall not speak the truth
So do not carry on
For I'm a liar too

The sign, the fly
Will dry my hands
For you

The lights were low
There's too much smoke
I still believe I will succeed
I'm alive
To keep myself from falling
I'm awake
To keep myself from falling

I can't control myself
I need the sound of my guitar

The lights were low
There's too much smoke
I still believe I will succeed
I'm alive
To keep myself from falling
I'm awake
To keep myself from falling

Yes I'm alive
To keep myself from falling
Yes I'm awake
To keep myself from falling

Oh I'm alive
To keep myself from falling

You're so alive you're so alive
You're so a-l-a-l-a-a-a-live
So alive so alive I'm alive I'm alive
