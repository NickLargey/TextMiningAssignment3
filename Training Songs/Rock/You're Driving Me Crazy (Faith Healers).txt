It's strange to hear you talk about faith
When you were too blind to recognize
That the faith you sought
Was a passing phase
Merely in disguise

You've finally come to realize
That confusion confessed to popularize?
When your congregation was so surprised
To see that I was coming through

Oh, you're driving me crazy
You think you're so complete
Oh, you're driving me crazy
Right back into the street 

And now I feel like a stranger in my own backyard
Now praying for your freedom seldom seemed hard
But I've noticed a lot of changes in freedom too
Like I've noticed changes in you

I could hear them laughing
As usually they'd do
In the days of my childhood
I can't see them anymore
Faith healers, I don't need them

Oh, you're driving me crazy
Well you think you're so complete
Oh, you're driving me crazy
Right back in to the street
