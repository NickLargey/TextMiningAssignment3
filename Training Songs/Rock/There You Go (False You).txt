Take it, take it all away
If you feel that way
Leave me here to stay
Burn, burn it all up
Cause I don't care anymore
I've already had enough
There you go again
You make it look so real
But I know it's not
Who you want to be
There you go again
You make it look so real
But I know it's not
Who you want to be

I feel what you want me to feel
Nothing seems real to me anymore
And I will say, what you want me to say
I'll be what you want me to be
If that's the way you want it, okay

There you go again
You make it look so real
But I know it's not
Who you want to be

There you go again
You make it look so real
But I know it's not
Who you want to be

Na na-na na na, na na-na-na na
Na na-na na na, na na-na-na na
Na na-na na na, na na-na na na ah

There you go again
You make it look so real
But I know it's not
Who you want to be
There you go again
You make it look so real
But I know it's not 
Who you want to be

There you go again
You make it look so real
But I know it's not
Who you want to be
There you go again
You make it look so real
But I know it's not
Who you want to be
