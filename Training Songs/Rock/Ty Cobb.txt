I'm sittin' in a magic hat
With smoke and mirrors
And tire rubber fires Watch me disappear
What made it slow you down
Sucking on a ball and chain
Another motherfucker goes down the drain
Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed f*ck you all
Just add it up to the hot rod death toll

Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed f*ck you all
Just add it up to the hot rod death toll

Sick in the head sick in the mouth
can't hear a word you say
Not a bit, and I don't give a shit
I got the glass, I got the steel, I got everything
All I need is your head on a stake

Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed f*ck you all
Just add it up to the hot rod death toll

Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed f*ck you all
Just add it up to the hot rod death toll

Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed 
Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed 
Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed f*ck you all
Hard headed f*ck you all
Just add it up to the hot rod death toll
Hot rod death toll
Hot rod death toll
Hot rod death toll
Hot rod death toll
