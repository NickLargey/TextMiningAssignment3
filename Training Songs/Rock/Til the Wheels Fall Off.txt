There's no taking the easy way out
There's no ending it now
We got a long way to go before we quit
The will to choose is a beautiful thing
It doesn't apply somehow
We gotta stay strapped in
Until we finish the trip

Get back in the car 
You can't be walking out there alone 
When we're riding together
We're at least a little closer to home
Get back in the car
This indecision is getting old
We're gonna keep on driving
Til the wheels fall off and roll

We've been going around and around
We ain't getting anywhere 
I guess the path of least resistance 
  wasn't on the map
Nothing but gravel since we set out
We lost our way back there
I must have missed the sign
When you were taking a nap

Get back in the car...
