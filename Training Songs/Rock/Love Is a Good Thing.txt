Watch out sister  watch out brother  
Watch our children while they kill each other 
With a gun they bought at Walmart discount stores 
Welcome to the hallway  metal detector just been installed...hey 

Isn't cops and robbers gettin' to be a big bore 
Mary  Mary quite contrary  close the door now  it's much too scary 
And you might see something you wish you hadn't seen 
Out of sight  out of time  out of patience, and I'm out of my mind 

Governor, tell me what does it mean 
Dance children, dance to the beat, 
Want to be a hippy cause life was so sweet 
Good-morning hate 

Dance children, dance to the beat, 
Want to rock and roll up and down the street, 
I've got a message 
Love is a good thing 
Love is a good thing 
Love is a good thing 

Politicians on a mission, build them up, bring them down 
For the good of the "system", 
Well we don't like the way you live your life 
I got one thing I must express, we try our criminals in the press 
Justice is a fading light 

Mary, Mary quite contrary, close the door now, it's much too scary 
And you might see something you wish you hadn't seen 
Out of sight, out of time, out of patience, and I'm out of my mind 
Governor, tell me what does it mean 

Dance children, dance to the beat, 
Want to be a hippy cause life was so sweet 
Good-morning hate 
Dance children, dance to the beat, 

Want to rock and roll up and down the street, 
I've got a message 
Love is a good thing 
Love is a good thing 
Love is a good thing
