(Lost) Like leaves in the tide
(Lost) That blow far and wide
(Lost) And land on some far seaside

(Lost) Like songs when they end
(Lost) A voice on the wind
(Lost) Like wayfaring wandering friends

Lost like the beat of long-gone bands
That blew through lips and ran from hands
And tapped the feet at long-gone jams
They're never lost

(Lost) Like dreams when you wake
(Lost) Like big plans you make
(Lost) Like pebbles tossed in a lake

(Lost) Like flowers when they die
(Lost) Like birds flying high
(Lost) Like seconds that tick right on by

Lost like the beat of long-gone bands
That blew through lips and ran from hands
And tapped the feet at long-gone jams
They're never lost

Lost like the beat of long-gone bands
That blew through lips and ran from hands
And tapped the feet at long-gone jams
They're never lost

They're never lost
