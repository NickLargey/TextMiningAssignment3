Not a match, have sex, not much of a problem
Either side of the fence I'm trying to stop this
Don't go too far

Make your mind up
And I'll chase you through the streets
The chase will wind up
I got blood on the soles of my feet

Wooh
Wooh

So I was young for only a heartbeat
We'll bite our tongues and sleep on the concrete
Don't waste my time

Make your mind up
And I'll chase you through the streets
The chase will wind up
I got blood on the soles of my feet

Wooh
Wooh
