Well some kid got the lock down 
'Cause he got flip with an officer 
No you don't do that in this town 
Unless you can bail yourself out 
Some kids got the kick down 
Fightin' straights from Fenway Park 
But who was in the right now 
And who still feels the scars? 

Whoah, pick yourself up now, lets go 
Now when we come to your town 
Ain't no one gonna be a thug 
But we're gonna have a lot of words now 
So ya tough hoods listen up 
I seen ya drinkin' down the river 
I seen ya fightin' at the shows 
I seen em crawl from every niche around 
And then I've seen em go 

These are the times 
And I don't care how it happens 
Things just gotta change 

Are you in it for a lifetime 
Are you giving back what you take 
Is what I'm saying sinking in 
Or is it just another wasted day 
there's one thing that they got that we ain't got 
Its the long arm of the law 
When the mace came out I clutched the ground 
Then they kicked me up some more 

Pick it up punk
