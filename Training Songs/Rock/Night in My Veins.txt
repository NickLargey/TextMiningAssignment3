I see him standing silhouetted in the lamp-light
I cross the street and I quicken my pace
He cups his hands and he lights a cigarette
I find myself in the bones of his face

It's just the night in my veins, oh!
Making me crawl in the dust again
It's just the night
Under my skin, slipping it in

He's got his hands in my hair and his lips everywhere
Oh yeah! It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins

He's got me up against the back of a pick-up truck
Out of sight of the neon and glare
We might as well be on a beach under the moonlight
Love's language reads the same anywhere, yeah

It's just the night in my veins, oh!
Making me crawl in the dust again
It's just the night
Under my skin, slipping it in

He's got his chest on my back across a new Cadillac
Oh yeah! It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins
Even if it's just the night in my veins

I've got my head on the curb and I can't produce a word
Oh yeah! It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins

It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins
Even if it's just the night in my veins

It feels good, it's alright
Even if it's just the night in my veins
