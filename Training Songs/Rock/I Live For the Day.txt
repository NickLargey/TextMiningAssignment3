Iâ??ve got time to watch you spin around in circles 
Falling through the cracks inside your mind 
Thatâ??s fine 
And Iâ??ve been through the darkest hour 
Made it to the other side of you 
I canâ??t live without you 

I live for the day 
I live for the night 
That you will be desperate and I am inside 
I live for the tears to fall down your face 
I live for the words you finally say 
I live for the day 

You are high, 
Thinking you're invincible so busy building castles in the sky 
Youâ??re done, and you donâ??t even know it 
But your eyes have started showing that itâ??s true 
Trying to live without love 

I live for the day 
I live for the night 
That you will be desperate and I am inside 
I live for the tears to fall down your face 
I live for the words you finally say 
I live for the day 
I live for the day 

I canâ??t live without you 

I live for the day 
I live for the night 
That you will be desperate and I am inside 
I live for the tears to fall down your face 
I live for the words you finally say 
I live for the day 
I live for the day 

Oh I wanna see you crying 
Oh I wanna see you crying 
Oh I wanna see you crying 

I live for the day
