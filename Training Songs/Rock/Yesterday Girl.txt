I never think about the future
I just live for today
And if you want an easy answer
I've got nothing to say
So please don't bother talking to me
I'll just disappoint you
Because I'm quite content to sit right here
With nothing to do

[Chorus]
Well I'm not the same guy that you used to know
I used to be the guy that had no place to go
But that was yesterday girl, yesterday girl
Yesterday girl, yesterday girl
And you're my yesterday girl, yesterday girl
Yesterday girl, yesterday girl

I never want to find an answer 'cause
I don't like the truth
And if I find just what I'm looking for
I've something to lose
So please don't go and ask me questions
I just won't feel the same
And when I think about religion
Well, there's no one to blame

[Chorus]
