You are my life, you are my life
Pretty woman
Visions in my mind
And I love you, woman, love you, woman
Lady love, ooh, lady love

You are my dream, you are my dream
Pretty woman
Visions in my mind
And I love you, woman, love you, woman
Lady love, ooh, lady love

Days coming, days going
Nothing changing, life flowing
Down the river of once upon a time

My visions come and visions go
What they mean, I'll never know
Never, never enough to stay in my mind

You are my love, you are my love
Pretty woman
Visions in my mind
And I love you, woman, love you, woman
Lady love, ooh, lady love

My visions come and visions go
What they mean, I'll never know
Never, never enough to stay in my mind

You are my life, you are my life
Pretty woman
Visions in my mind
And I love you, woman, love you, woman
Lady love, ooh, lady love, ooh lady love

Pretty woman
