It's falling to pieces 
I stand and wait 
There's no one to blame this time 
Stand and brace 
You're sure I can change your mind 
Feel brave 
There's no one to claim the lie
Stand and face 
This is the warning 
As the world sleeps without knowing 
Choose your ground, lead or start running 
Take your time, breathe, truth is coming 
Take control, real change 
This is the warning 
As the world sleeps without knowing 
Choose your ground, lead or start running 
Take your time, breathe, truth is coming 
Take control, real change 
They've got it all worked out
Wish I could leave here now 
Is there another way 
Some other path to take 
We will figure itout
Same people brought you down 
They are controlling you 
These people lead us
I saw them change the truth 
They didn't want us to
There right before our eyes 
I knew we'd made it
Don't take the easy ride 
We're running out of time 
This is the warning
