Are you ready for me?
Better let me know
Are you ready for me?
Better let me know
Are you ready for me?
Better let me know
You'd better, you'd better do whatever's clever baby

[Chorus:]
How can you be down?
You gotta do whatever's clever
So that I will stick around
You gotta do whatever's clever
And you don't want to waste your time
You gotta do whatever's clever
You gotta go somewhere you gotta do whatever's clever
If you want to step to me
You gotta do whatever's clever
So I'll listen carefully...
You gotta do whatever's clever
You gotta say whatever, hear whatever, mean whatever, hear whatever
Feel whatever, think whatever do whatever's clever

So you want to roll with me
Here's advice that you should heed
Common sense is all you need
To avoid my thunder
First of all talk to my face
Not the view below my waist
How we gonna conversate
While your head's down under?
Stop where are you going
If you were in my shoes, what would you say?
Stop, this is worth knowing
So a brother can't lose if he steps my way.
Stop where are you going
If you were in my shoes, what would you say?
Stop, this is worth knowing
So a brother can't lose if he steps my way

[Chorus:]

Here's a very simple truth
"Monkey see is monkey do"
So you're never getting through
If your boys are busters
Finally please understand
All I have is by my hand
On my own I'm making ground
I am my own woman
Stop where are you going
If you were in my shoes, what would you say?
Stop, this is worth knowing
So a brother can choose if he steps my way.
Stop where are you going
If you were in my shoes, what would you say?
Stop, this is worth knowing
So a brother can't lose if he steps my way

[Chorus:]

Are you ready for me?
Better let me know
Are you ready for me?
Better let me know
Are you ready for me?
Better let me know
You'd better, you'd better do whatever's clever baby
Are you ready for me?
Better let me know
Are you ready for me?
Better let me know
Are you ready for me?
Better let me know
You'd better, you'd better do whatever's clever baby
