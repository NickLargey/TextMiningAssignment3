I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love

Sometimes I feel lost, and I don't know what you believe
My wires get crossed, and I wonder how you could leave
But one thing I know: I just can't go on living from day to day
Won't you listen to me when I say
I need your love?

I need your love
Oh, won't you believe me?
I need your love
For every time I close my eyes to sleep, you'll still be there

And I get so afraid when the night closes in on me
I thought that we had it made
From now on it's just a memory
I wake up at night calling your name
Nobody hears but me
I've just got to try to make you see
I need your love

I need your love
Oh, won't you believe me?
I need your love
'Cause every time I close my eyes to sleep, you'll still be there

I wake up at night just calling your name
Nobody hears but me
I've just got to try to make you see
I need your love
I need your love
Oh, won't you believe me?
I need your love
'Cause every time I close my eyes to sleep, you'll still be there

And I'll be waiting for you
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
'Cause every time I close my eyes to sleep, you are still there

And I'll be waiting for you
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
'Cause every time I close my eyes to sleep, you'll still be there

And I'll be waiting for you
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
Oh, you are still be there

And I'll be waiting for you
I need your love
Won't you believe me?
