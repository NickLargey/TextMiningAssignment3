Waving from the ocean liners, 
Beaded cheering Indians behind them. 

Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock roll over
Ribbon of concrete - just see what you done 
Done to the church of the American Indian!

Once upon the sandwich Isles, 
The social structure steamed upon Hawaii. 
Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock roll over. 

Bicycle rider, just see what you've done 
Done to the church of the American Indian! 

Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock roll over. Mahalo lu le, 
Mahalo lu la, Keeni waka pula (repeat) 
Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock roll over. Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock roll over.
