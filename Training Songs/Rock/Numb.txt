I'm in surgery
It?s an emergency
It just occurred to me
Ironically I caught a disease

They take a piece of me
Enjoy the scenery
Countin? back from ten
But I will never fall asleep

I refuse to go numb
I refuse to go numb
I refuse to go numb

So let the music come
Let the music come
Let the music come

I'm writin? pop songs
Done it for so long
Sometimes I dream about a chorus
That's so clever, it?s dumb

And now they're tellin? me
The music industry
You can stay if you behave
Be a good boy, go to sleep

But I refuse to go numb
I refuse to go numb
I refuse to go numb

So let the music come
Let the music come
Let the music come

?Cause I refuse to go numb
I refuse to go numb
I refuse to go numb

So let the music come
Let the music come
Let the music come
Let the music come

So if you're askin? me
What you mean to me
This is a dream to me
A theme for me, I gotta believe

In what you're tellin? me
In what you're sellin? me
In what's compellin? me to feel
The only reason I need

Here comes the drum beat
I'm movin? my feet
The only reason I need
The only reason I need

And a guitar chord
I feel so sure
The only reason I need
The only reason I need

I refuse to go numb
I refuse to go numb
I refuse to go numb

So let the music come
Let the music come
Let the music come

I refuse to go numb
I refuse to go numb
I refuse to go numb

So let the music come
Let the music come
Let the music come

Let the music come
Let the music come
Let the music come

Let the music come
Let the music come
Let the music come
