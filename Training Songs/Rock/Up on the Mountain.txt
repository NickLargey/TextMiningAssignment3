(J. Comanor/S. Silverstein)

Sal from the valley loved Al from the alley and they lived in harmony
Sally played acoustic and Al, he played electric and they both took turns on lead
They sang it for their friends, again and again of the places they had been
But their favourite song of all was called up on the mountain

Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me

Then into the valley came a girl from the galleys, with a strange and smilin' face
Al played acoustic and Sally played electric, and the gal played a hell of a bass
And when they sang their harmonies, the lady dipped right in
She soon moved in and lived with them up on the mountain

Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me

Now Al from the alley is gone from the valley, a sadder but wiser man
And Sally from the valley and the gal from the galleys they live in mortal sin
Sal plays acoustic and the gal plays electric and sometimes they hold hands
Late at night you can hear them playing, up on the mountain

Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me

Hot lickin' and finger pickin'
Say farewell for me
