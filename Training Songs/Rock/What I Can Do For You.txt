I'm so glad you're awake
That you're not like the others
'Cause they're so straight-laced
And no fun
And gosh, that's nice
That lingerie
Makes me feel like
Oh, I don't know

You're a very pretty thing
You remind me of someone
You must have heard some awful nasty things about me, but

What I can do for you
There's no one else on God's green earth can do
What I can do for you
There's no one else on God's green earth can do

Just ask anybody
They'll tell you that it's true
There's no one else on earth
Can do the things that I can do for you

For you, for you (for you)
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you (for you)
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you

You're never gonna make it
All by yourself
You're gonna need a friend
You're gonna need my help
I have so much to offer
If you just be nice
If you do what I say
And don't make me say it twice

Do you mind if I just
Rub my hand up thus
Come on, just my hand
Come on, just my hand
You gotta understand
I'm gonna be your man
I'm gonna be your man

I'm gonna be your man (you're gonna need me)
I'm gonna be your man (I'm gonna make you understand)
I'm gonna be your man (yeah, I'm gonna be your man)
I'm gonna be your man (I'm gonna be)
I'm gonna be your man (I'm gonna be your man)

What I can do for you
There's no one else on God's green earth can do
What I can do for you
There's no one else on God's green earth can do

Just ask anybody
They'll tell you that it's true
There's no one else on earth
Can do the things that I can do for you

For you, for you (for you)
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you (no one else on earth)
For you, for you (can do those things)
For you, for you (that I can do)
For you, for you
For you, for you (I can do for you)
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you (come on, just my hand)
For you, for you
For you, for you (you gotta understand)
For you, for you (I'm gonna be your man)
For you, for you (I'm gonna be your man)
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
