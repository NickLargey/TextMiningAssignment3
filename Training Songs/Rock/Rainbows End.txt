Are you sleeping with the stars tonight
or are you blue with cold
leaving imprints on your forehead the floor is cracked and old
nice and easy
see the city
the boys are clothed in threads of gold rainbow's end for ????

Rooms to let in Rainbow's End There's always some
Rooms to let in Rainbow's End There's always more than one

Wake up to another high day (it's a high day)
Open front or quick in the back
Just like seeing your hips way
It's over don't look back

Rooms to let in Rainbow's End There's always some
Rooms to let in Rainbow's End There's always more than one (x2)

Repeat 1st Verse

Repeat Chorus to fade
