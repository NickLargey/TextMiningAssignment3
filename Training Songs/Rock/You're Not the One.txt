Dreams stay with you
Always on my mind
I got a lust for love
Seasons bring truth
When I found mine
It was summertime

It’s the middle of the night and I’m so gone
And I’m thinking about
How much I need you but you really want somebody else
Should be given the right to carry on
I’m still thinking about
How much I need you but you really want somebody else

You’re not the one
Guess you’re not the one

Streets like a zoo
Through a city of lights, love at first sight
Silent rays of blue
They slowly glide
Right down my spine

It’s the middle of the night and I’m so gone
And I’m thinking about
How much I need you but you really want somebody else
Should be given the right to carry on
I’m still thinking about
How much I need you but you really want somebody else

You’re not the one
Guess you’re not the one
You’re not the one
Guess you’re not the one

I was enjoying the ride
And now we’re standing on the graveside
Left unsatisfied
Won’t even bother to fight, I know

You’re not the one
Guess you’re not the one
Guess you’re not the one
Guess you’re not the one

You’re not the one
Guess you’re not the one
You’re not the one
Guess you’re not the one

You’re not the one
Guess you’re not the one
You’re not the one
Guess you’re not the one
