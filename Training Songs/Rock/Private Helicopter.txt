I'm on a private helicopter with my favorite ex girlfriend 
Tiny little cabin in the sky 
Now we're alone and we can remember how we felt before we were angry: 
We were guilty and we were bitter 

(I must admit I said a few things  but...) 
I'm still attracted to you 
Sorry we've been so cold  so 
Eight miles high and three hours to landing  

God  your hair smells really great 
I'm on a hovercraft to Paris with my former best friend 
We have to get to the cinematheque 
We're not alone but no one speaks english, so we're free 

To look into each other's minds 
And see what we're thinking like we always used to 
I miss talking to you 
But you never draw me out so 

Cast off the ego scars and let's go hit the bars 
I reserve the right to hold my grudges 
Friends like you, you know the rest 
But all told, I hold on to my anger far too long 

Until it's a joke 
The night is cold 
The joke is old 
(And poorly told, I told you once) 

I'm on a private helicopter with my favorite ex-girlfriend, 
No one to keep up appearances for 
Now we're alone and we can remember how we felt at first; 
The desperate need to be together 

Must've been good for something, sugar 
I'm still attracted to you 
No one's making us do what we're supposed to 
So lie here in my arms 

Lie here in my arms
