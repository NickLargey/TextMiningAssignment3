(Verse 1)
You can think of times when you had the right chance
You could make a choice when nobody could see
You could think of ways of defending your deeds
Justify the way that you wanted to be

(Bridge)
Wait just a minute
Wait just a minute

(Chorus)
Hey, did you ever think twice
Something inside says stay away
Hey, did you ever think twice
When there's stil time you can go the other way
Hey, did you ever think twice
If you don't bother, gonna pay the price
Hey, did you ever think twice

(Verse 2)
You can think of things that you wanted to try
You can think of things that you wish you could see
You could go a way that would seem so right
Thinking of a place that you wish you could be

(Repeat Bridge)

(Repeat Chorus)

(Refrain)
Face to face with sin
You better think again, you better think again
Take another look for a second time
And give a second thought to where you draw the line

(Repeat Bridge)

(Repeat Chorus)
