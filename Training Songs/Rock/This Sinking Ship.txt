I see myself in my fathers eyes
I see my strengths and my weaknesses
There's children safe in their mother's arms
But photos can be misleading
Right on the branches of my family trees
That's where the young ones are dwindling - with lies

So will we learn? Talk together into the night
Can we help this home to survive?
We need the strength of our family's arms
Not a false sense of solidarity

Walk together and we could work this out
Talk together and we could understand
We need the strength of our family's arms
I wish I knew where to go from here

I see the sadness in all their eyes
I understand why this burdens them
It's written on my grandfather's arms
Indian ink tells the story there

Out on the branches of my family trees
That's where the young ones are suffering - with lies

So will we learn? Fought together into the night
Can we help this home to survive?
We need the strength of our family's arms
Not a false sense of solidarity

Walk together and we could work this out
Talk together and we could understand
We need the strength of our family's arms
I wish I knew where to go from here

We were aloud to take this on
But this can't be here when we are gone
Giving what we have now is to make this time
That we have left last forever

All that we have left is to make this time
Last forever - Then we'll have learned

Look into your son and forget what you see
Protect what you love
And show what you mean
Before you send this sinking ship into the sea
God damn, I wish we knew when we started this
