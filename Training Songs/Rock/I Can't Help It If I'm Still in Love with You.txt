(him) Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
(both) I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

(him) Sombody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
(both) I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

(him) A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling 
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
(her) Still in love with you

(her) Today I passed you on the street
(him) Today I passed you on the street
(her) And my heart fell at your feet
(him) And my heart fell at your feet
(him) I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

(her) Somebody else stood by your side
(him) Somebody else stood by your side
(her) And he looked so satisfied
(him) And you know he looked so satisfied
(him) I can' help it if I'm still in love with you

(him) It hurts to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss
How much that I miss yea
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
(her) Still in love with you
