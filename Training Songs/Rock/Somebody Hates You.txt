This is the coolest party that I've been to 
Shake your hand and kiss your ass 
Won't join the other fools 
Another night, another life 
I can't take this anymore 
Another life, another night 
Drunk and passed out on the floor 
Hey! Punk! In a years time we will see 
Hey! Punk! Another rock star wannabe 
I smell the arrogance from across the room 
Pasty skin and heroin 
Our host will be here soon 
Another night, another life 
I can't take this anymore 
Another life, another night 
Drunk and passed out on the floor 
You're no one, til someone 
No one, til somebody hates you 
Hey! Chump! How charmed can one life be? 
Hey! Chump! You're better off don't f*ck with me 
It's no coincidence, bitch, I thought you knew 
Go back to your rock punk and suffer with your fools 
Another night, another life 
I can't take this anymore 
Another life, another night 
Drunk and passed out on the floor 
You're no one, til someone 
No one, til somebody hates you
