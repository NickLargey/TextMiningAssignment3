Take a seat, and catch your breath
You're only working towards your death
For as the days go by
They go by oh so slow
But your blonde hair and gaping eyes
Send tingles down my nervous spine
And now the days go by
They go by oh so slow

But I'm yours if you want it
I can be yours to spend your life with
I can be yours; we'll hide indoors
Petrified of the world

And if you'd rather stay in at night
I can relate to that
And if it feels like your heart's dried up
I can relate to that
And if you need someone at your side
I am out there
I'm out there
Out there

In the grass at Union Square
I touched your face, pushed back your hair
And said, “The days go by…
They go by oh so slow.”
(Days go oh so slow)
And in a room, upon your bed
We tangled arms and crossed our legs
When you sleep alone
The days go oh so slow

But I'm yours if you want it
I can be yours to spend your life with
I can be yours; we'll hide indoors
Petrified of the world

And if you'd rather stay in at night
I can relate to that
And if it feels like your heart's dried up
I can relate to that
And if you need someone at your side
I am out there
I'm out there
Out there

I am yours if you want it
I can be yours to spend your life with
I can be yours; we'll hide indoors
Petrified of the world
Oh!

And if you'd rather stay in at night
I can relate to that
And if it feels like your heart's dried up
I can relate to that
And if you need someone at your side
I am out there
I'm out there
I am out there
