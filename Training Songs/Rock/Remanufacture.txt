Desensitized by the values of life
Maligned and despaired by government lies
Revenge is so strong
I taste it on my tongue
My gun will be
Your angel of mercy
Dislocated by the eyes of disdain
Abused beyond recognition
I can't cope with
The madness abounding
Blasts in my head
Of gunfire resounding
Firing relentless
Killing the senses
I've got no more goddamn regrets
I've got no more goddamn respect
I am the thorn
In your eye
I am the thorn
In your eyes
In your eyes
Repeat second verse
I've got no more goddamn regrets
I've got no more goddamn respect
I've got no more goddamn respect
