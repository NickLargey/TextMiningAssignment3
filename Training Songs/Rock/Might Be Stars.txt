We spend our money on guitars;
Write songs about our broken hearts.
We're Shit City stars,
And when we don't, we're still aware
That we're pop revolutionaires;
Aren't we cool?

Some say we pretend we live in a dreamworld;
We don't think so.
Rule Number one - pretend it's fun.

Okay now,
Chances are we might be stars, and live forever.
Chances are we might be stars, beloved forever.
Chances are we might be stars, and shine until...
We fall down.

We know the faces one should know.
We know the places where to go.
We're on the radio.
We never stop, we carry on,
Pretending life is like a song;
Aren't we cool?

Some say we pretend we live in a dream world;
We don't think so.
Rule Number ten - just try again.

Okay now,
Chances are we might be stars, and live forever.
Chances are we might be stars, beloved forever.
Chances are we might be stars, and shine until...
We fall down.
