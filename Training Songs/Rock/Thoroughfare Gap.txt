Sometimes I Consider My Pace
I'm Reminded Of A Train Gathering Speed
For The Climb To The Pass
In Whose Shadow It Already Lies

A Small Metal Dragon Approaching
The Ever-Present Ascending Rise
To The Seventh Mountain
Reeling And Snaking And Leaping

It Seems Like It Wants To Come Loose
From Its Path Cast In Iron
But She Can't Slow Down Now
As The Earth Has Presented 

A New Crest To Reach
Without Barely A Rest
From The Last One
And You Wonder Just What Lies Beyond

Though You've Been There Before
And Forget About The Effort And The Strain
Always Ascending
Each Yard Adds A Mile

To The Never-ending Pull 
Of The Steepening Grade
That's Before You
A Valley, A Forest, A Desert, A Stream

With An Oversized Bridge
For The Trickle There Beneath
You Remember The Torrent
It Turned To Last Spring

From The Snows Melting Fast
And The River It Became
In The Summer
Perhaps It Is Ruined

From A Fire That Has Scorched It
So Badly That Nothing 
Will Grow Without Rain
To Wash Away The Blackened Soil

Now Useless Till Called Upon Again
In A Future As Twisted And Far Away
As The Next Range Of Mountains
So Take It As Far As You See

And Beyond
With Eyes You Don't Use Enough
Gather Up Strength
As Thoroughfare Gap

Will Await You Forever
You're Seeking To Get There
For Even Before
It's No Matter

No Distance
It's The Ride
