So you're finally over it now.
You thought you wouldn't make it,
But I knew you would somehow.
I guess I knew you could make it in the end
And it's good to have you round again old friend.

You weather the storm,
You weather the storm.
You weather the storm,
And you come up smiling in the end.

So, you're over all the disappointments now.
You thought you wouldn't make it,
But I knew you would somehow.
Maybe it still hurts to think of bad times that you spent,
But it's over, and you're back again old friend.

Chorus

Into every life, a little rain must fall,
And for sure it poured down on you.
An umbrella's no good in a hurricane,
But just like the sun in the end you come shining through.

Chorus

So, you see, it's getting better now,
You look a little battered,
But we all do anyhow.
When the break is mended it can be stronger than before.
Don't go round butting doors or punching walls.

Repeat chorus twice.
