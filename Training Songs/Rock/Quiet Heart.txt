The heater's on
The windows are thin
I'm trying hard
To keep this warmth in
I turn to her
She's sound asleep
Someplace I don't know
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go

[Chorus]
I tried to tell you
I can only say it when were apart
About this storm inside of me
And how I miss your quiet, quiet heart.

Two hours on
My eyes are open
There's bad blood between us
What did I say
That made you cry?
Our dream won't die
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go.

[Chorus]

What is that light?
that small red light 
Scorpio rising
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go

[Chorus]
