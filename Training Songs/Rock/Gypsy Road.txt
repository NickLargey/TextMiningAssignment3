I used to be now I'm not what you see, lord I try
And now it seems all those dreams have come true, but they're passing me by
Some fast talkin' mama for a dollar put a smile on my face
I'm drivin' all night
I end up in the same old place

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushing 'cause it feels alright

And who's to care if I grow my hair to the sky
I'll take a wish and a prayer, cross my fingers 'cause I always get by
Fast talkin' jerk for a dollar wiped the smile off my face
I'm drivin all night
Just to keep the rat in the race

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushing 'cause it feels alright

Sometimes I feel so old
Got my lights burnin' bright
But I'm lookin' pretty sold
Sometimes I feel so cold (so cold)
So cold
Let's go

Gotta get on home
My gypsy road can't take me home
My gypsy road can't take me home, take me

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushing 'cause it feels alright

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushing
My gypsy road
My gypsy road
My gypsy road
My gypsy road
My gypsy road can't take me home
