Sitting here so close, together 
So far we're just friends, but I'm wondering whether 
I, am I just imagining 
You, or do you really have a thing for me 
Like I think I see when I see you smile 
And the smile's for me, I wanna tell you... 

Hey, You, I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend 
Trying to say I wanna be your number one 
Hey, You, I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend 
Gonna make you love me before I'm done 

Late at night when I, when I can't sleep 
Picture in my mind, I see you and me 
I, I'm telling you what I wanna be 
You, you're saying you're in love with me 
And oh, it feels so good in a dream 
That I know in life it's just got to be 
I wanna tell you...... 

(Chorus) 

Bridge: 

Gonna make you love me, yeah I'm 
Gonna make you love me, yeah I'm 
Gonna make you love me, before I'm done 

(Solo) 
I, am I just imagining 
You, or do you really have a thing for me 
Like I think I see when I see you smile 
And the smile's for me, I wanna tell you... 
Hey, You, I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend 
Trying to say I wanna be your number one 
Hey, You, I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend 
Gonna make you love me, yeah I'm 
Gonna make you love me, yeah I'm 
Gonna make you love me before I'm done
