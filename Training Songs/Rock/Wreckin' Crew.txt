Well, it's night time in the city
Let's all go out to play
Their ain't no-one can catch us
Couldn't stop us anyway
We do just what we want to do
Get outta the way, we're the Wrecking Crew

The city as you know it's gone
We're all that's left alive
We prowl around the streets in packs
Do what we can to survive
We're gonna do just what we want to do
Get outta the way, we're the Wrecking Crew

We're the Wrecking Crew
We do what we must do
You've blown away our lives
Killed our lovers and our wives

If you don't like our attitude
Pal, you're out of luck
We're the Mutant Wrecking Crew
And we don't give a f*ck
We'll do just what we want to do
Get outta the way, we're the Wrecking Crew

We're the Wrecking Crew
We do what we must do
You've blown away our lives
Killed our lovers and our wives

Why don't you come and join us
If you think you've got the guts
We'll all go out and have a real good time
When all the shops are shut
We're gonna do just what we want to do
Get outta the way, we're the Wrecking Crew
