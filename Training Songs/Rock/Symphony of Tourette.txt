Stutter stutter says the little boy
I want to blow a hole in my head
I swear what this world wants to hear
Trapped in what we know as truth syndrome
Stutter stutter silence no friend

Childern can be cruel she said
So I smashed her in the fucking head
Sorry dear that's the nature of Tourette

Stutter stutter nothing else but me
I twitch and turn while underneath
My contemporaries are so in control
F*ck you f*ck you I grunt and groan
Stutter stutter can't keep it no more

Children can be cruel she said
So I smashed her in the fucking head
Sorry dear that's the nature of Tourette

Stutter stutter are your eyes closed
You know a hole through which you can fall
But I can't even be bothered to hang on
When you're this numb news don't register
I just opened my eyes
