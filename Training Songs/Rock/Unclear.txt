I'm trying to learn and I'm dying to know
When to move on and when to let it go
A curious feeling no one can explain
And I just don't know if I'll risk it again

When the future's so unsure
When the future's so unclear
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh

So you swallow your heart and you swallow your pride
You gotta be tough if you wanna survive
They'll chew you up and they'll eat you alive
But never give up on the dreams in your mind

When the future's so unsure
When the future's so unclear
When the future's so unsure
When the future's so unclear

We walk, we walk on
Our time, our time will come
We walk, we walk
Our time, oh oh oh oh! 

When the future's so unsure
When the future's so unclear
When the future's so unsure
When the future's so unclear
Woah oh oh, 
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
