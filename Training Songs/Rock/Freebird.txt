If I'd leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see

And if I'd stayed here with you, girl
Well, things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change

Bye, bye, baby, its been a sweet love
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it so badly
'Cause the good Lord knows that I'm to blame

And if I'd stayed here with you, girl
Things just could not be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
No, no, I can't change, ain't no way that I can't change

Why don't you fly on freebird?
Fly on freebird

Why don't you fly on freebird?
