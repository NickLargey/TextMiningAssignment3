Every day I sit at home and sharpen up the knives

but it's alright, it's alright.
Today is the tomorrow that I dreamed about last night,
So shine a light, shine a light, but I...
Just wanna feel what I felt before, but I
I want you to know that I need it more.

Well the blind lead the blind
Are the saints still alive since the last time?
At the end of the line
Was I cruel to be kind in a past life?
Sharpen up your knives.

Every day I chip at stone while you are on your way,
Up to the stars, up to the stars.
I don't know where I'm going to,
I don't know where you are,
But it's a start, but it's a start, and I'm...
Just gonna say what I, said before but I,
I want you to know that I need it more.

Well the blind lead the blind
Are the saints still alive since the last time?
And I don't wanna stay,
Don't wanna go away in a past life.
It's not alright

I've given up on horses hooves,
And I'm feelin more,
Than just blue ribband blues.
And his advice,
Before I dropped
Was be sincere,
Whether you mean it or not,
It's alright.
