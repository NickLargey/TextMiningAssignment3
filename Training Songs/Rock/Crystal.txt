When you're feeling kinda lonely
And the world has got you down
I know a place where you can go
To bring your head around

They call it Crystal's Palace
They say it's quite insane
I understand they've got good music
And Crystal, she's always game

And Crystal
She'll get you through
And Crystal
She'll do anything you tell her to
And she'll make, she'll make you feel
Feel alright

So if you're having trouble smiling
But you've got to carry on
The music plays at Crystal's place
From sundown until dawn

I know you won't be sorry
If you check it out tonight
'Cause after you meet Crystal
You will swear everything's alright

And Crystal
She'll get you through anything you got to do
And Crystal
She'll do anything you tell her to
And she'll make, make you feel
Feel alright

She's the kind of girl
That you'd like to know
A-when you're feeling low
And she'll make, she'll make you feel
Feel alright

And Crystal
She'll get you through anything you got to do
And Crystal
She'll do anything you tell her to

And Crystal
She'll listen to you
And she'll make you feel
Feel alright

Whoa, whoa, whoa, Crystal
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Crystal
