Stuck in the middle
I burrow inside
Back to the cradle
Away from the burdens
Of all my crimes
Before it's fatal

The past has found me
The truth come out
Always remember
With no place to fall
But straight down
I must surrender

Well it seems I've finally
Thought of everything
I want to love
I want to feel
Find peace
Find the real

There's a face I put on
All my life
The face of an angel
I look in the mirror 
Only to find
The face of a stranger

And all that I've taken
I hunger for more
Cause I'm selfish
And all I'm left with
Is a crown of thorns
And I'm helpless

Well it seems I've finally
Thought of everything
I want to love
I want to feel
Find peace
Find the real

I'll trade these lies for something right
I will kill what hurts with something pure
I will be redeemed so I can breathe again

Well it seems I've finally
Thought of everything
I want to love
I want to feel
Find peace
Find the real
