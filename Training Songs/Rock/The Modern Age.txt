Up on a hill is where we begin
This little story a long time ago

Stop to pretend, stop pretendin'
It seems this game is simply never-endin'

Oh, in the sun, sun havin' fun
It's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now
Let me go, oh, let me, oh, g g g g g g g go 

Leavin' just in time
Stay there for a while
Rollin' in the ocean
Tryin' to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different
So I'll pretend I'm leavin', oh yeah

Our fears are different here
We train in AVA
I wish you hadn't stayed
My vision's clearer now, but I am not afraid

Flyin' overseas, no time to feel the breeze
I took too many varieties

Oh, in the sun, sun havin' fun
It's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now
Let me go, ooh
Darlin' let me, let g g g g g g g go 

Leavin' just in time
Stayin' for a while
Rollin' in the ocean
Tryin' to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different
So this is why I'm leavin'
