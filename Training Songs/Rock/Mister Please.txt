Mister please
Won't yo tell me I'm alright
I'm so lonely
I been thinking I could die
I got me a woman
She bled her soul
All over me
I think she's crazy
What you gonna do with me
Brother brother
Can't you hear them mission bells
Calling out
All them sinners bound for hell
Ain't no stranger
Been down that road before
So brother brother
Won't you tell me I'm alright
I'm alright
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Smoking mother nature into the dust
Yeah that's all I see
Praying to gods that are made out of rust
And thinking what you might have been
Now I suppose I could change my vows
Yeah that's all I need
Maybe some day you'll find me fishing
For the lock that fits with my key
Gonna change it baby that me
Ah, ah, hey mister
Never one to count
Take a look at my life
What a work of art I see
Got no love baby living off the tracks
With the chains and the shackles on me
Now I'm with you
Gonna head on south
Sliding down to Mexico way
Maybe someday you'll find me sitting
On a beach where the palm-ah trees sway
And heaven's just a little kiss away
Won't you help me mister please
Now I suppose I could change my vows
Yeah that's all I need
Maybe someday you'll find me fishing
For the lock that fits with my key
Gonna change it baby that's me
Won't you help me mister please
Mister please
Won't you tell me I'm alright
I'm so lonely
I been thinking I could die
I got this woman
She bled her soul all over me
Now I think I'm crazy
What you gonna do with me
Mister please
