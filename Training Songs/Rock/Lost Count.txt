Been walked
Out upon
And been the one
Walking
Out
On the ones
I love
Made my
Life a mess
I can't put the blame on anyone but myself
Lost hope and I
Lost faith
So many times I lost count
Been stumbling
Grouping
Caught
But found a way
Out of
Each
And every trap
Somehow
And so far
Made my
Life a mess
I can't put the blame on anyone but myself
Lost hope and I
Lost faith
So many times I lost count
I lost count...
Ooh...
Ooh...
Ooh...
Ooh...
Lost hope and I
Lost faith
So many time I lost count
Been walked
Out upon
And been the one
Walking
Out
