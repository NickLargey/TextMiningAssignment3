Would I need ya if I got amnesia?
Would you be the one for me if I lost my memory?
And would I look at you the way that I used to?
Would I fall in love all over again,
Or would I have to pretend?

Are we gonna stay the way we are?
Are we gonna break and fall apart?
Are we gonna make it when our love is tested?
Are we gonna stay the way we are?
I don't wanna break and fall apart,
Are we gonna make it through the shark infested water?
Hearts entrusted to each other

And I don't know what I'd do,
If I found out you were untrue.
Would I find it in my heart to forgive?
Would I be able to forget?

Will I be beautiful?
Or will I just be a fool?
Can you keep me fresh and young?
What if I make you deaf and dumb?

Are we gonna stay the way we are?
Are we gonna break and fall apart?
Are we gonna make it when our love is tested?
Are we gonna stay the way we are?
I don't wanna break and fall apart,
Are we gonna make it through the shark infested water?
Hearts entrusted to each other

Can we still have adventures,
When we're old and wear dentures?
Will you kiss me on the lips?
Do you think we'll dance with our plastic hips?
And when you look at me,
Will you see the girl you met when you were nineteen?
Will you see a lady with a limber heart,
Swimming in the water with the sharks?

Are we gonna stay the way we are are?
Are we gonna break and fall apart?
Are we gonna make it when our love is tested?
Are we gonna stay the way we are?
I don't wanna break and fall apart,
Are we gonna make it through the shark infested water?
Hearts entrusted to each other
