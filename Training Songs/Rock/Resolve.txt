Something that I felt today, something that I had
Swingin' from the chandeliers, hanging on your word
I remember watchin' you once upon a time
Dancing from across the room in another life

A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how
A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how

Lookin' back to find my way, never seemed so hard
Yesterday's belated rest, changing of the gods
I would never change a thing even if I could
All the songs we used to sing, everything was good

A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how
A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how

One more year that you're not here
It's gone and passed you by
Happened to you, happened to you
One more tear that you won't hear
That's gone and passed you by
Happened to you, happened to you

A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how
A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how

A little bit of resolve
One more year that you're not here
It's gone and passed you by (a little bit of resolve)
A little bit of resolve
One more year that you're not here
It's gone and passed you by (a little bit of resolve)
