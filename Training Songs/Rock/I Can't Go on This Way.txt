I Can't Go On This Way

I need your arms to hold me
To keep to have and to hold
I'm here I'm blue and I'm lonely
But I guess that's the way it goes
I can't go on this way
Because you won't let me stay
My darlin' I need you so badly
So won't you please come and go my way

I've tried so hard to please you
To make you happy too
But you went away and you left me
But I'll always be in love with you

Mmmhhh mmmhh mmmhh mmmhh
Mmmhhh mmmhh mmmhh mmmhh
Mmmhhh mmmhh mmmhh mmmhh
Mmmhhh mmmhh mmmhh mmmhh
