Well, you know I got a case of the shakes
So hold me like you used to do
Tell me that I've got what it takes to make it through

Sometimes it just gets so damn hard
I feel like I could lose my mind
I'm all torn up and scarred and you're so kind

You know me better than I do
You know me better than I do

Well, you know that we could build a fire
To chase our ugly cares away
So tell me, do my words inspire you to stay?

You know me better than I do
You know me better than I do

'Cause now what, you know where I'm gonna stay
And when I talk you know what I'm gonna say

The roof is coming down on me
The rain is falling on my head
Don't you know I long to be inside your bed

Help me sort out this mess
The one that clutters up my mind
Darling, I must confess, I'm out of time

You know me better than I do
You know me better than I do
You know me better than I do
You know me better than I do

You know me better than I do
You know me better than I do
You know me better than I do
You know me better than I do

You know me better than I do
You know me better than I do
