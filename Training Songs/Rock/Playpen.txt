When the cat's away, the mice will play
Beer and drugs and things to say to you, to you
Lots of girls and lots of boys
Loud music and all the toys we need,
We need

[Chorus]
We have to go
The neighbors have complained
We have to go
The walls have all been stained
They have to know
They can't stop us now
They have to know
We could burn this town

Old men and kids on the run
Missing teeth and now the damage is
Done, it's all been done
Losing battles, losing fights

The police would love to take away our
Rights, our rights

[Chorus]
