From the manner of
Cutting whisper
Rising vapors through
Clouds of gold

Giving fire and
Change the demons
With undercurrents
Far too strong to haul

The sun burnt out today
Fools are dancin' in the rain
Stopped by the acid stain
And on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain

Nightfall hunts us all
From the shadows
Cynical beauty now
Lies the host

Before the flicker
There's only blackness
The end is coming
All my friends are dead

The sun burnt out today
Fools are dancin' in the rain
Stopped by the acid stain
And on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain

Rid by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the selfish stage
Feeding on the voices in my head

(Slowly we'll learn)
(Slowly we'll learn)
(Slowly we'll learn)
(Slowly we'll learn)
(Slowly we'll learn)

The unruled hedges we
Turn to someone
All those weeping will
Go unheard

Up on that once green hill
Around the mazes
And seeing the darkness
The jaws will take it slowly

The sun burnt out today
Fools are dancin' in the rain
Stopped by the acid stain
And on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain

Rid by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the selfish stage

You're feeding all the voices in my head
You're feeding all the voices in my head
They're feeding all the voices in my head
They're feeding all the voices in my head
