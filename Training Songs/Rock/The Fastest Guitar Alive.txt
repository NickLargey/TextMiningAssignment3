Hey, here I go a lucky so and so
Happy 'cause I know, I've got my fast guitar
Singing pretty songs, knowing I belong
I am first and last and always a fast guitar

The fastest guitar alive
Rattling strings like a gattling gun
Shaped like a lovely woman

Stay right where you are
My guitar is a fast guitar
The fastest guitar alive

I'm rolling on like a rolling stone
Gathering no moss, I play a boss guitar

The fastest guitar alive
Strumming like a battling soldiers drum
Shaped like a lovely woman

Stay right where you are
My guitar is a fast guitar
The fastest guitar alive

Hey, here I go a lucky so and so
Happy 'cause I know, I've got my fast guitar

The fastest guitar
The fastest guitar
The fastest guitar alive
