Why do you insist that you are right and I am wrong?
I know I'm no Jesus Christ, but I'm no different than you.

What if I was everything you wanted,
Would you still point and laugh at me?
I cried once, but never again.
Not again.

I am not like you, so you don't like me.
You are so resistant,
Never listening to anything other than what's familiar.
I'm familiar with everyone else.

What if I was everything you wanted,
Would you still point and laugh at me?
I cried once, but never again.
Not again.

I am not like you, so you don't like me.
I am not like you.

What if I was everything you wanted?
Would you still point and laugh at me?
I cried once, but never again.

I am not like you, so you don't like me.
I am not like you, so you don't like me.
I am not like you...
I am not like you...
