I loved a girl, but I messed around
Now she's with another, so I found
They say better to have loved and lost than not have loved at all
Much more than my foolish pride has took a fall
They all tell me about mistakes that I have made
And I have no doubt my hand was overplayed

There's a shadow on my house
The windows shed no light
Since you've gone I feel so wrong
I can't tell day from night

All too late I have learnt
Burn the candle at both ends and you'll get burnt
How could there be a fool such as I
To let you walk away out of my life?
Sitting here alone, all the days seem the same
I don't know how much longer I can stand the pain

There's a shadow on my house
The windows shed no light
Since you've gone I feel so wrong
