In the presence of another world
You guess the things unguessed
In the fullness of another world
There is no emptiness

In the promise of another world
A dreadful knowledge comes
How even space can modulate
And earthly things be done

Your master he's a monster
He will come on a bridge of paper
Inscribed with a hundred names of god
But he can count one more
The curse of life eternal
Written on the door

Your master.....he's a monster
Your master.....he's a monster
Your master.....he's a monster

In the presence of another world
A dreadful knowledge comes
How even space can modulate
And earthly things be done
In the fullness of another world
There is no emptiness

Your master.....your master is a monster
Your master.....born of a yolkless egg
Your master.....he has dominion over animals
Your master.....he walks the world entrail diviner
Your master.....and when the stars are right
Your master.....he locks the door behind the door behind the door
Your master.....the milky way abyss inclines
Your master.....the seven years of labor for the instruments of time
Your master.....the seven years of labor for the instruments of time
Your master.....the seven years of labor for the instruments of time
Your master.....the seven years of labor for the instruments of time

Your master is a monster
And gentlemanly too
He'll make for us some new germ
With pieces of the perfect black
The alpha and omega
The double peaks of mars
The maze of his infinity
The buried city
In the stars
