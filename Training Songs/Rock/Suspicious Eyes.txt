Oh God I'm running late again
I don't believe this

Another Wednesday morning on the train to work
And my weekend spread into the middle of the week
I'm boozing every night, 3 hours sleep
Check all the people then stare at my feet
Guy next to me pretend to read the Metro
Sort of bloke who calls everybody bro
But only met a black guy at Uni though
And the lady with the kid watches the guard meet the train

[Chorus]
Suspicous eyes
Looking for the end
Suspicous eyes
Looking for the end

A young Asian guy with a rucksack on his back
Jumps on the tube, is he ready to attack?
God just imagine it being all over, stuck in the tube with nowhere to go
All the smoke and confusion, stuck in this dark coffin
The man with the paper, he moves from his seat
Why did that kid stand so close to me?
I'm sick of them moaning that they're being picked on, 
When its them running round with the bombs
I'll grab the kids, leave London's town

Join a white flight to Surrey and beyond

[Chorus]

These people are assuming who I am, but they're wrong
Got a beard and a bag so they think I got a bomb
I saw everyone's reaction soon as I stepped through the door
All acting like they've never seen a brown person before
The guy infront of me, he should be reading his paper
I'm checking my watch cos there's an interview that I'm gonna be late for
Every time I step on the tube, there's a dude in his suit who ain't got no manners,
Doesn't he know staring is rude?
And if you're so scared, move! I've just stopped caring
I'm off at the next stop mate just keep staring

[Chorus]

Clocks are ticking and we leave on time [Repeats]
