All the secrets of the skies in a drop of rain
Look around, just look around
Full of silver and surprise
If you look around, just look around

All the wisdom of the sea in a grain of sand
Look around, just look around
Set the child within you free
When you look around, just look around

That cloud's a bird flying through the air
That happy leaf's going to the fair
It's all there, it's all there
(It's all there, it's all there)

All the innocence of spring in a blade of grass
Look around, just look around
Let the child within you sing
When you look around, just look around

Just look around
(Stop and look around)
Just look around
(Stop and look around)

That cloud's a bird flying through the air
That happy leaf's going to the fair
It's all there, it's all there
(It's all there, it's all there)
(It's all there, it's all there)

All the innocence of spring in a blade of grass
Look around, just look around
Let the child within you sing
When you look around, just look around

Just look around
(Stop and look around)
Just look around
(Stop and look around)

Just look around
(Stop and look around)
Just look around
(Stop and look around)

Just look around
(Stop and look around)
Just look around
(Stop and look around)
