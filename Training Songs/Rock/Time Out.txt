Goin' through the motions 
Tryin' not to snore 
Didn't know the gun was loaded 
Goin' through my motion 

Caught without an oar 
Someone said they all were phony 

Time out, save the play 
Try to make the lie last 
Any old way we can 
Signed out all the way 
When you speak your mind out 
Never say what you plan 

I met her in the hallway 
Bangin' on the door 
Askin' what the funny smell was 
Wake you up and tell you 
It's OK to sleep some more 
By the way, is there any you can sell us? 

Time out, save the play 
Trying to make the lie last 
Any old way we can 
Signed out all the way 
When you speak your mind out 
Never say what you plan 

So the case is gettin' hotter 
Hear me tell you, Jack 
Stick 'em up, you've just been busted 
Your basement's full of water 
Got above the tide 
Hope to God the pump ain't rusted 

Time out, save the play 
Trying to make the lie last 
Any old way we can 
Signed out all the way 
When you speak your mind out 
Never say what you plan
