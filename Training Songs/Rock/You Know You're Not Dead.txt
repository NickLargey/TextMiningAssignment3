Please, lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, don’t ever go!
Before these songs
Before these songs
Before these songs
It’s all fading away!

Sing me a note that I might know with all my aching heart
Send me the dirt that I might hold so I know where to start
Send me a vibe for I’m the rich
Send me a vibe for I’m the rich
Before my aching heart
Before my aching heart!
Send me a note that I’m might hold with all my body
Send me a note that I might throw this letter upon mistake
Send me a note before go rich
Send me a note so that I don’t
Before my aching heart!
Before my aching heart!

Cause the way, can you not see?
You’ve been this woman
That you are my body
You are my heart
So come on
You’re in my heart
You know you’re my heart
You know you’re not opened wide

Sing me a note that I might know, that I can wear along
Sing me a note…I’ll crush your soul
Sing me a note so then I can
Sing me a note so then I can
For my aching heart!
For my aching heart!

Cause the way, can you not see?
You’ve been this woman
That you are my body
You are my heart
So come on
You’re in my heart
You know you’re my heart
You know you’re not opened wide

The way the dreams are lost
But you’re my heart
Telling me the dreams are
Sing me a note that I might know with all my aching heart
Send me the dirt that I might hold so I know where to start
Send me a vibe for I’m the rich
Send me a vibe for I’m the rich
That you’re my aching heart
That you’re my aching heart!
