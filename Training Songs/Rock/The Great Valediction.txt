Bold flashing dagger teeth
Powerful and tree-like limbs of allosaurs go by
Oh a hundred million years ago
There wasn't need of lumbering sauropods
For man would soon give birth to god and breed

But you were made into a jellyfish discovering the flow of time
And never hearing 'The who live at Leeds'

Talk of tomorrow, or spoil the gathering
End all of your sorrow for what it's supposed to mean

Bold flashing dagger teeth
Powerful and tree-like limbs of allosaurs
Escaping from the ultrasaur in time

But you were made into a jellyfish discovering the flow of time
And never hearing 'The who live at Leeds'

Talk of tomorrow, or spoil the gathering
What it's supposed to mean
