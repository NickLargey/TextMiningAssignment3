America the beautiful
Amber waves of race
Constitutes equality
Don’t dub us left or right

Tora, tora, tora
Tora, tora, tora
Tora, tora, tora
Tora, tora, tora

Freedoms just another verb
That they’ve put on a roof
Analyze everything I say
And take it wrong to boot

Smash fashion, fascism
Smash fashion, fascism

Contradiction figure it out
Criticism
Maybe you're just coming through
So give me all you want

Tora, tora, tora

Life and crimes
And crimes of life
Much to personal
We won't get through the ground
