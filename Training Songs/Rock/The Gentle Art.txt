All of the things I endured
And what others saw in you
I wonder how and why it took me so long
To realize all the wrong paths that you made me take
For your own benefit 
F*ck this shit and what you wrote about it
You might think, you might say
I know who my friends are
You might think, you might believe
You're running out of time

Understanding is the reason
And anger is the motivation
To cast a light on these actions
So many lies are told
Sold for your own benefit

F*ck this shit and what you wrote about it
You might think, you might believe
I know who my friends are
You might think, you might believe
You're running out of time
