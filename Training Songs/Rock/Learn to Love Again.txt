There's a place we know
What's cold enough won't grow
We have seen the dark
And the dark took its toll

And the journey waits for no one
If no one breaks the mould
And our hearts are stronger
Than we know

That you and I could learn to love again
After all this time
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one
That you could still believe in me again
And after all our trials
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one

To awake I know
We made it through the storm
And someone saves their sweet embrace
For you and you alone

That you and I could learn to love again
After all this time
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one
That you could still believe in me again
And after all our trials
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one

Silence says to remember
We remember
To our souls in the shadow
In the shadows

That is how I knew you were the one
And that is how I knew you were the one
