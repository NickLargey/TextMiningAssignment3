Oh Yeah
In France a skinny man
Died of a big disease with a litte name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same
At homethere are seventeen-year-old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called The Disciples
High on crack, totin' a machine gun

Time Time

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church
And killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story
Is tellin' you somebody died

Sister killed here baby 'cause she could afford to feed it
And we're sending people to the moon
In September my cousin tried Reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing Horse, it's June

Time Time

It's silly, no? When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly

Some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh why

Time Time

Baby make a speech, Star Wars fly
Neighbours just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn

Time Time

It's silly, no? When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly

Some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh why

Time Time

Sign O' The Times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's too late
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby
We'll call him Hate...if it's a boy

Time Times

Time Time
