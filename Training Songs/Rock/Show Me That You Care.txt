Please, please be mine all of the time 
& try to show me that you care 
I, I'll be true, true just to you 
As long as you show me that you care 

(x2): 
I'll make you happy in my arms 
But you must shower me with charms 
Day after day, I'll love you, come what may 
As long as you show me that you care 

As long as you show me that you care
