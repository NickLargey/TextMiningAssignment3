The docks
The clocks
A whisper woke him up
The smell of water
Would resume.
The cave
The waves
Of light the unreal night.
That flat curving
Of a room.

Prove it, just the facts, the confidential
This case, this case, this case that I
I've been workin' on so long

First you creep
Then you leap
Up about a hundred feet
Yet you're in so deep
You could write the Book.
Chirp chirp
The birds
They're giving you the words
The world is just a feeling
You undertook.
Remember?

Now the rose
It slows
You in such colorless clothes
Fantastic! You lose your sense of human.
Project
Protect
It's warm and it's calm and it's perfect
It's too "too too"
To put a finger on
This case is closed.
