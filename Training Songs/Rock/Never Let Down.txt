Never want to break your heart
Never want to make you cry
Never want to give up and die

Even if you can't stand up
Even if you lose your life
I'm a friend by your side
You're never gonna be alone

You can never let down
Never let down
You can never let down
Never let down

Never want to make mistakes
Never want to do no wrong
Never have a place to belong

And I'm never gonna leave you out
If you ever lose your way
Not alone or betrayed
I'm always gonna be around

You can never let down
Never let down

You're doing alright
You're doing ok
Just follow your heart
And don't run away

You can never let down

You're doing alright
You're doing ok
Just follow your heart
And don't run away

You can never let down

You're doing alright
You're doing ok
Just follow your heart
And don't run away

Never want to break your heart
