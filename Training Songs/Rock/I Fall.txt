I gotta full moon
A smaller room than I need
A candy store, a sexy whore
Yes, I bleed
A sifting sand and an electric hand
Yes, I'm fine
Got a souped-up truck or a goblin suck
Yes I'm blind

And I fall
Well, I fall
Well, I fall
Yeah I fall

My mind's a raging blame
A crying shame and I'm sad
A city of sin, a bottle of gin
So doggone bad
A cool reaction for the big attraction
That's fine
A pissed-off god, oh mother of god
Yeah, I'm blind

And I fall
Well, I fall
Well, I fall
Yeah I fall

I'm a falling angel
Falling down
Be a falling angel
Won't you come on around?
Don't be scared to follow
It's no crime
You're a falling angel
Before your time

And I fall
Well, I fall
Well, I fall
Yeah I fall
