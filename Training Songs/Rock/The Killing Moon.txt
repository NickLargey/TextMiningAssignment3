Under blue moon I saw you
So soon you’ll take me
Up in your arms, too late to beg you
Cancel though, I know it must be
The killing time, unwillingly mine

Fate, up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him

In starlit nights I saw you
So cruelly you kissed me
Your lips a magic world
Your sky all hung with jewels
The killing moon, will come too soon

Fate, up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him

Fate, up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him

Under blue moon I saw you
So soon you’ll take me
Up in your arms, too late to beg you
Cancel though, I know it must be
The killing time, unwillingly mine, unwillingly mine
