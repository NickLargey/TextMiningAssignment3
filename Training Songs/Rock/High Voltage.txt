I've been taking into crates ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
Mastered numerology and big bang theology
I've been digging in the crates
Ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and big bang theology
Preformed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented a mic so I could start blessing it
Chin checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist my cords like double helix's
To show u what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of these MC's who hate us
Try on, leave u with out a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones
I fire bombs ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that what this is

High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing u up and taking u down
High voltage
Coming at u from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

I've put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfied my rhymes Jones
Spraying bright day over what u mite say
My blood type is krylon technicolor type a
On highways ripe with road rage
On pages of wind, cages of tin that bounce all around
Surround sound
Devouring the scenes
Subliminal gangrene paintings over all the same things
Sings songs karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with stick and stones tactics
Fourth dimension compact convection
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put u away with
A pencil, pistol, official, sixteen lines, a rhymes missile
While you risk your all, I pick at all your flaws

Bringin' u up and takin' u down

High voltage
Bringin' u up and takin' u down
High voltage
Coming at u from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes I feel like I'm crawling
Misunderstood and under the gun
Like a new disease disease disease
Sometimes I feel like I'm crawling
Misunderstood and under the gun
Like a new disease disease disease
