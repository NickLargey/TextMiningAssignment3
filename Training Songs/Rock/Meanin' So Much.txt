Oh sweet, sweet, sweet lovin' babe, how'd I ever let you go
Miss you more as the years go rollin' by
And I might still be near you, if not for one small thing I know
You lied when I looked you straight in the eye
But oh, you're meanin' so much
Oh lover, meanin' what you're meanin' now
Oh, meanin' so much to me
Ask me how well, how well that I remember nights in September
Lying holdin' each other's lovin' charms
And I might still be near you, if not for one small thing I know
I found you in someone else's arms
But oh, you're meanin' so much
Oh lover, meanin' what you're meanin' now
Oh, meanin' so much to me
I know it's useless, I know it's impossible, I've tried
Can't seem to drink you out of my mind
No sense in lookin, no sense in comin' crawlin' on back
Knowing what it is that I'd find, what I'd find
Oh, night comes falling bringing darkness again
Bringing teardrops to another lonely man
But I might still be near you, if not for one small thing I know
When you loved me you would love me and then you ran, yes you did now
But oh, you're meanin' so much
Oh lover, meanin' what you're meanin' now
Oh, meanin' so much to me
