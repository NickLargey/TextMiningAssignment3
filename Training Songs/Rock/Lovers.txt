She shivers in the rain
It's the capital connected with her veins
Stepping under statues and on trains
Till we are under covers

She giggles like a child
With no sign of all the tension in her life
It's written on a t-shirt and it writes
That there is no other

Cause we are the lovers
We are the lovers
We're different colors
But we stand up as one

We are the lovers
We are the lovers
Two different colors
But we stand up as one

All the silly things we do
Just remind me of the flippancy of youth
Kissing under statues throwing food
And getting into trouble

She shivers in the cold
It's the capital connected with her bones
Jumping into taxis here we go
No other

Cause we are the lovers
We are the lovers
We're different colors
But we stand up as one

We are the lovers
We are the lovers
Two different colors
But we stand up as one

Cause we are the lovers
We are the lovers
We're different colors
But we stand up as one

We are the lovers
We are the lovers
Two different colors
But we stand up as one

Stop
