I was walking home lonely the other night.
I couldn't see a single star in the sky.
Oh, they must be too high
Shadows dance around me in the Dark
Oh, don't stop.

This could be the longest day
And the night has yet to come,
This must be the dawn to ?
Of nowhere else to run.
This could be the longest day
And the night has yet to come,
This must be the dawn to ?
Of nowhere else to run.

Was eleven years to change what had been lost
One single shot was fired
What a cost?!!
O-oh, what a cost.

This could be the longest day
And the night has yet to come,
This must be the dawn to ?
Of nowhere else to run.
This could be the longest day
And the night has yet to come,
This must be the dawn to ?
Of nowhere else to run.

I wanna run, i better run now, run
As far as I can.

As far as I can.
