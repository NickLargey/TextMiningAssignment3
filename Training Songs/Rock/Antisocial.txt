I don't like papers, reading books
Getting sick, think it sucks
I don't wanna listen to another word
I'm so bleeding bored

[Chorus]
I'm an-ti-social
An-ti-social
An-ti-social
I hate the world

I don't wanna go to work another day
I wanna be somebody
I don't wanna wear no three piece suit
I don't wanna family

[Chorus]

Wanderin' round the streets wondering what to do
Pick whatever you like
I ain't got no money or a set of wheels
It's a bloody drag
Looking at the posers and their flashy cars
I'm just walking round
Never gonna get a house wife or kids
I ain't gonna settle down

[Chorus]
