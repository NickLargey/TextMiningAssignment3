There's an eagle in the eastern sky, turning in the wind;
Out across the evening, resting on the wing.
If I had the wings of an eagle
There'd be no holding me
I'd be free
Sailing free.

One day soon I'm gonna run like the wind,
One day soon 
Gonna break away from everything
One day soon 
Nothing in the world's gonna pull me back
And nothing's gonna keep me in
Gonna run like the wind.

And if you should tell me you want to hold me down, 
Before the glow of morning, I'll be gone without a sound.
The more you try to keep me in
The less you will succeed
Sailing free,
Sailing free.

One day soon I'm gonna run like the wind,
One day soon 
Gonna break away from everything
One day soon 
Nothing in the world's gonna pull me back
And nothing's gonna keep me in
Gonna run like the wind.

One day soon I'm gonna run like the wind,
One day soon 
Gonna break away from everything
One day soon 
Nothing in the world's gonna pull me back
And nothing's gonna keep me in
Gonna run like the wind.
