There's two boys holdin' stars for the wishin'
Yeah, one boy's sure, one says "I don't know"
But sometimes I feel we been missin'
Ooh, love, I try and away they go

And in this ol' town, the wind starts blowin'
And the radio sings blues for free
We got the bottle down for soakin' dreams (yeah)
Tears of a clown, well hey, that's me

And hearts that fall in two pretend they don't show
Holding back the rain, baby, let it go
You don't get much without giving
You don't get much without giving
Hey, hey, yeah, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, hey, hey, yeah

Oh, she left one shoe behind in the back hallway
She left one memory, the strangest kind
I guess naive love songs are savin' grace, yeah
When losers win in this losin' race

And hearts that fall in two pretend they don't show
Holding back the rain, baby, let it go
You don't get much without giving
You don't get much without giving
Hey, hey, yeah, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, hey, hey, yeah

You don't get much, you don't get much
You don't get much, you don't get much
