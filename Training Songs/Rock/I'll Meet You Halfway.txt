Will there come a day when you and I can say
We can fin'lly see each other?
Will there come a time when we can find the time
To reach out for one another?
We've been trav'lin' in circles such a long, long time,
Try'n' to say hello,
And we can just let it ride,
But you're someone that I'd like to get to know.
I'll meet you halfway, That's better than no way.
There must be someway to get it together.
And if there's some way I know that some day
We just might work it out forever.
I'll meet you halfway, That's better than no way.
