You said that I would be sorry if you went away
You said I wouldn't be happy without hell to pay
You said the teardrops would fall
Between the bedroom walls
You said that I would regret
Well It Hasn't Happened Yet 

Your friends come over and offer to take me to eat
They all seem so sorry I'm sufferin' so much misery
They said to just give a call
Next time that I start to crawl
I always say yeah, you bet
But It Hasn't Happened Yet 

I don't have anyone
I'm havin' fun
No one is into me
No one's a mystery
I see you on the street
My heart don't skip no beat
Lovers' hostility
Don't mean a thing to me 

I find it hard to remember the good times we had
Call me insensitive now that it's over I'm glad
You said when big shadows fell
It would be too hard to tell
My light from your silhouette
Well it hasn't happened yet
