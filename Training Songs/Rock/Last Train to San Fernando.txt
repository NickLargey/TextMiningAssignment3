Last train to San Fernando, last train to San Fernando
If you miss the one, you'll never get another one
Bee-dee-dee-dee-bom-bom to San Fernando.

Last night I met my sweet Dorothy
She said, tomorrow I join in sweet matrimony
But if you act all right
Oh, you can take me out tonight
We can wine and dine and get back in time
For the last train to San Fernando.

Last train to San Fernando, last train to San Fernando
If you miss the one, you'll never get another one
Bee-dee-dee-dee-bom-bom to San Fernando.

Well, I married into high society
Be carefull of the places you're a-takin' me
'Casue if you slip, I'll slide and I may never be your bride
Bee-dee-dee-dee-bom-bom to San Fernando.

Last train to San Fernando, last train to San Fernando
If you miss the one, you'll never get another one
Bee-dee-dee-dee-bom-bom to San Fernando.

Last train (to San Fernando)
