Just hold your head up high
Forget your feelings for a while
Your friends, they don't mean what they say
Only want you when you are away

Why'd you wait, so long
Why'd you wait, so long
Why'd you wait, so long
Why'd you wait, so long

If you feel like running, stand your ground
Someone out there feels the same about
Living with no guts, with no crush
Only when you're broke, you'll be found

Why'd you wait, so long
Why'd you wait, so long
Why'd you wait, so long
Why'd you wait, so long
