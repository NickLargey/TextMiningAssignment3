Too late, I'm bound to say
I feel my luck slipping away
The light has faded on me
I find myself falling you see

You don't choose to sleep on the sidewalk
You don't choose to sleep on the sidewalk

I used to be so discreet
With the drifters out in the street
But now it looks like I'm going to be
Searching in doorways for somewhere to sleep

You don't choose to sleep on the sidewalk
You don't choose to sleep on the sidewalk

Some time good luck will surely come my way
