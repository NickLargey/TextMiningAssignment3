I recognize suspicion
I see it in your eyes
I'm not the devil with the art of telling lies
I've got no more than a strong alibi
You're lacking evidence so I must deny
(Chorus)
And then the lightning comes
Somebody stole my heart
Now I can't explain
Where it is
I'm going down to the river,
Bathe in the water
It's a way to make a living
But will I be forgiven?
Down to the river,
Bathe in the water
It's a way to make a living
But will I be forgiven?
Forgiven
Tell me (tell me)
What's on your mind
You've got that look that says I'm leaving
I never wanted to hurt you this way
So now it's time I fade away
Chorus x2
Down to the river
Bathe in the water
It's a way to make a living
But will I be forgiven?
