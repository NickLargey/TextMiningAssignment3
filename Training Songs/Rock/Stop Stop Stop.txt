See the girl with cymbals on her fingers entering through the door
Rubies glistening from her navel, shimmering around the floor
Bells on feet go ting-a-ling-a-ling, going through my head
Sweat is falling just like a tear drop running from her head
Now she's dancing, going through the movements, swaying to and fro
Body moving, bringing back a memory, thoughts of long ago
Blood is rushing, temperature is rising, sweating from my brow
Like a snake, her body fascinates me, I can't look away now

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing, give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing or I'll have to leave

Now she's moving all around the table's luring all in sight
But I know that she cannot see me hidden by the light
Closer, closer, she is getting nearer; soon she'll be in reach
As I enter into her spotlight, she stands lost for speech

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing, give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing or I'll have to leave

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing, give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing or I'll have to leave

Now I hold her, people are staring, don't know what to think
And we struggle, knocking over tables, spilling all the drinks
Can't they understand that I want her? Happens every week
Heavy hand upon my collar throws me in the street

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing, give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing or I'll have to leave
