I look into your eyes, and I see
I see a part of me
You're better than I'd ever hoped you be
And when you smile you light the room
You love me, and you make it clear
I wonder what I did to deserve
To have you near

Sorry I had to go away
No please don't misconstrue
I just hope you'll understand one day
The hardest part was leaving you

You know that last December
I wanted to be with you
I know that I should have been there too
For you
You might be the only one I love
It makes me choke up choke up

I'm scared that if it carries on this way
You'll feel the way I do
And I don't want that but I still run away
And it's breaking me in two

I've spent so many birthdays wondering
Where my dad was
It's not an excuse it's just a cause

I'm scared that if it carries on this way
You'll feel the way I do
And I don't want that but I still run away
And it's breaking me in two

It's breaking me
It's breaking me
It's breaking me
In two
