I have always had
A real problem with getting down
But it's alright you know
I really don't mind that you know 
I know you've been sleeping around
Your bed's full of idiots from town to town
But it's alright you know
I really don't mind that you know 

Out of sight
It's not right, she said
Leave town right now, say
Oh oh oh oh 

Out of sight (Oooh)
It's not right, she said
Come on, leave town right now, say
Oh oh oh oh 

And now, I'm back to the plot
I'm sorry I got side-tracked there, I'm bad out of plan
But it's alright you know
I really don't mind that you know 

The words that they said sounded like
They were underwater, but I understand
But it's alright you know
I really don't mind that you know 

Out of sight
It's not right, she said
Leave town right now, say
Oh oh oh oh 

Out of sight (Oooh)
It's not right, she said
Come on, leave town right now, say
Oh oh oh oh 

Out of sight
It's not right, she said
Leave town right now, say
Oh oh oh oh 

Out of sight (Oooh)
It's not right, she said
Come on, leave town right now, say
Oh oh oh oh
