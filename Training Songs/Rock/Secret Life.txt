I don't want to go to
The place that's
So hard to face
When I'm feeling sane

I just can't understand why
When I tell you a lie
With no tears in my eyes

Dark places that I have gone
Dark places I don't belong
I'm good deep inside
So why do I hide from you

My secret life
It is so hard living for two
I just can't seem to let go
When I'm living my life
It should be with you
It's here where loneliness lies
The big mistakes
The heartaches, oh

My secret life

When things are going my way
Is the time that I turn
And I run away
I will go far into space
Then return to your door
With a smile on my face

Dark places that I have gone
Dark places I don't belong
I'm good deep inside
So why do I hide from you

My secret life
It is so hard living for two
I just can't seem to let go
When I'm living my life
It should be with you
It's here where loneliness lies
The big mistakes
The heartaches, oh

My secret life
My secret life

It's here where loneliness lies
The big mistakes
The heartaches

My secret life
My secret life
My secret life
