Hey
Things won't be strange any day now
They change every day

Hey 
Things won't be bad all the time now
Stay bad all the time

But hey now, little lady 
This is a tragical sign
It's a sign

Morning after midnight
Things don't ever go right
Morning after midnight
Hey bye bye
Not so sad to wake up
But I took the bait up
Morning after midnight
What's going on yeah

Hey, what's that sound
Might get a glimpse of just what's going down
Oh modern lover what's that noise
Ah it's just you, Johnny, not one of your boys
We say hey

Hey
Things won't be strange any day now

Hey 
Things won't be bad all the time now
Stay bad all the time

But hey now, little lady 
This is a tragical sign
It's a sign, it's a sign, it's a sign

Morning after midnight
Things don't ever go right
Morning after midnight
Hey bye bye
Not so sad to wake up
But I took the bait up
Morning after midnight
Hey cha cha cha
