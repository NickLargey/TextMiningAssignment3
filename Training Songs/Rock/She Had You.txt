There was a corner - it was the place to go
We used to meet there - doing our whiz and blow
I had a friend there - she was a wasted space
She tried to match me - she couldn't stay the pace
She was a no one
She was a loser
She had you ooo ooo - she had you
She had you ooo ooo - she had you
I couldn't stand it - seeing you there with her
I never told you - how much it really hurt
I went to college - I got a fancy car
Drop dead apartment - now I'm a shining star
But she never made it
She's selling Avon
She had you ooo ooo - she had you
She had you ooo ooo - she had you
She had you ooo ooo - she had you
She had you ooo ooo - she had you
I have respect now - I always knew I would
'Cause I had a passport - out of the neighborhood
And when I go back - I always see her there
I ask how she's doing - not that I really care
She's still on the corner
She's still going nowhere
But she had you ooo ooo - she had you
She had you ooo ooo - she had you
She had you ooo ooo - she had you
She had you ooo ooo - she had you
