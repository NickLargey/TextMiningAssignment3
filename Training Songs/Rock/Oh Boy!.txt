All my love, all of my kissin',
You don't know what you've been a-missin',
Oh boy (oh boy)
When you're with me,
Oh boy (oh boy)
The world can see that you were meant for me.

All my life, I've been a-waitin'
Tonight there'll be no hesitatin'
Oh boy (oh boy)
When you're with me,
Oh boy (oh boy)
The world can see that you were meant for me.

Stars appear, and the shadows are fallin',
You can hear my heart a-callin',
A little bit of lovin' makes everything a-right,
And now I'm gonna see my baby tonight.
