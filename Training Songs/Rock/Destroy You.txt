I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you
I feel it coming on again
Just like it did before
It'll feed your pride with boredom

I feel it coming on again, just like it did before
They feed your pride with boredom, and they lead you off to war
The way you treat each other, makes me feel ill
And if you want to fight them, then you're dying to get killed

I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you

A pox upon the media and everything you read
They'll tell you your opinions and they're very good indeed

I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you

And when I have destroyed you, I'll come picking at your bones
You won't have a single atom left to call your own

I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you
Destroy you
Destroy you
Destroy you
Destroy you
