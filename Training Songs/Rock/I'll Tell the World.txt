If I could show you 
All of the things, that you'd love to see 
And I'd like to start you laughing 
All that you want, is my sympathy 

Time won't bring back, all the time, going back 
So just for the moment 
Let your heart, let it fly away 
And I'll tell the world about you 
In all of my dreams
