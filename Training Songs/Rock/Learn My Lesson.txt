I am a wavering candle light
I remain but I'm ever slight
Through all my years
I sit, in my room in the fading light
Righting back all my wrongs tonight
'Cause I'm still here

Boarded up all the doors
And I swallowed all the keys
I'm still haunted by
All the things I'll never be

To live
Is to learn
Oh the heart's a heavy burden
So I take (I take)
I don't wait (don't wait)
Nothing ever is for certain
And I hold my hands up high
On my knees tonight
I'll take
Won't wait
I will live and learn my lesson here tonight

I, never knew it could be so cold
But I burnt all the things I used to hold so dear
Still I fight (I fight)
With my pen in my hand held tight (held high)
Writing protest songs tonight
'Cause I'm still here

Boarded up all the doors
And I swallowed all the keys
I'm still haunted by
All the things I'll never be

To live
Is to learn
Oh the heart's a heavy burden
So I take (I take)
I don't wait (don't wait)
Nothing ever is for certain
And I hold my hands up high
On my knees tonight
I'll take
Won't wait
I will live and learn my lesson here tonight
Whoa, whoa

I'll get off my knees and fight
Kick down the doors let in the light tonight
Tonight

To live
Is to learn
Oh the heart's a heavy burden
So I take (I take)
I don't wait (don't wait)
Nothing ever is for certain
And I hold my hands up high
On my knees tonight
I'll take
Won't wait
I will live and learn my lesson here tonight
Whoa, whoa

I will live and learn my lesson
