Here comes the night, see the stars in the sky
Shining high above, light of love, darling just you and I
And a-here comes the night, how I thrill to your kiss
Music fills the air everywhere, nights of magic and bliss

Think of the moments, the hours and hours that we were apart
Moments and hours that kept bringing showers of tears to my heart
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah

Here comes the night, like the others before
But tonight's divine, you are mine, once more

Think of the moments, the hours and hours that we were apart
Moments and hours that kept bringing showers of tears to my heart
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah

And a-here comes the night, like the others before
But tonight's divine, you are mine, once more

And a-here
Here comes the night!
