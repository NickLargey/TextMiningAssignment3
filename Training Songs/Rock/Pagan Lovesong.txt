Heathen, a pagan
No sun shines for me
Savage but gentle
The animal within

And I see it now
And I see it now
I had a weird dream
Watch but don't touch
I had a weird dream
I'm taking it away

Put it in a bag, hide it in a tree
Put it in a bag, hide it in a tree

I want to steal your heart, your heart
With these eyes I cannot see
And this cold heart never bleeds, never, oh no, never

Sweet smell this poison, the colour you bring
Tongue swollen venom, to touchâ?¦to love

And I see it now
And I see, see it now
I had a weird dream
Watch but don't touch
I had a weird dream
I'm taking it away

Put it in a bag, hide it in a tree
Put it in a bag, hide it in a tree

I want to steal your heart
I want to eat, eat your heart
I reach for the sky but never, never can touch

It seems so easy, easy to me
Still I cannot, will not take this thing
Hearsay, this heresy
A victim to sin
Eternal the torment, the answer lies within

I had a weird dream watch but don't touch
I had a weird dream I'm taking it away
The love you give is the love, the love you get, you get
