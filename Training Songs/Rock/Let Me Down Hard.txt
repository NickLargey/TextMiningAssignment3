Don'tcha spare my feelings
Don't be scared of blood
Don't break it to me gently
Ah, don't you use kid gloves

Don't sweet talk me, baby
Don't sugar coat
The bitter little pill
You're shoving down my throat

Don't let me down easy
I'll make it hurt like hell
Don't you kiss my cheek
Don't you wish me well

Don't let me down easy
Leave me bruised and scarred
Don't let me down easy, please
Let me down hard

Don't you change your colors
Keep them lean and true
When you break my heart girl
I wanna recognize you

Leave a bad taste, baby
Leave me here to cry
Leave a little somethin', please
To forget you by

Don't let me down easy
I'll make it hurt like hell
Don't you kiss my cheek
Don't you wish me well

Don't let me down easy
Leave me bruised and scarred
Don't let me down easy, please
Let me down hard

Baby, yes hard feelings
Baby, yes regrets
I might forgive you someday
But baby not just yet

Won't let me down easy
I'll make it hurt like hell
I won't you kiss your cheek
I won't wish you well

Won't let you down easy
I'll Leave you bruised and scarred
Won't let me down easy, no

I'll let you down hard
I'll let you down hard
I'll let you down hard
I'll let you down hard
