Yeah, pogo
There’s something in the air
There’s something in the air
There’s something in the air

Now, where has it been?
I mean, the good old wild days
Became a bit too lame
Just take a look at my place

It’s such a mess
But I'll be out of this space as soon as you tell me
Where the night is
You have to set up

Bring it on, forward

Yeah, pogo
There’s something in the air, pogo
There’s something in the air, pogo
There’s something in the air

It’s been quite of a while since I could experience your brightness
Now, you’ve got a brighter smile and I think I'm going to like it
Talking ’bout the better things, you know how to maximize
Everything around you will become super sized

You have to set up
Away from what matters
And get it prepared
Forward

Yeah, pogo
There’s something in the air, pogo
There’s something in the air, pogo
There’s something in the air

Yeah, pogo
There’s something in the air, pogo
‘Cause I've been dreaming we could be the fire for this night
Can’t stop

You have to set up
We could get so wasted if you would have come
(Bring it on)
We could get so wasted if you would have come
(Forward)

We could get so wasted if you would have come
(Can't stop)
We could get so wasted if you would have come
(You have to set up)

We could get so wasted if you would have come
(Bring it on)
We could get so wasted if you would have come
(Forward)

We could get so wasted if you would have come
(Can't stop)
We could get so wasted if you would have come
(You have to set up)
