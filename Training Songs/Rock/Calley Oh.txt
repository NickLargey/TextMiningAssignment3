1. I thought I knew the Story. I thought I'd seen it all
Those days of love and glory. But now I hear you call
Chourus:
Calley Oh
See there's nowhere to hide
Calley Oh
I can feel you inside
Don't you know
That I can't hold back
I keep on coming after you

2. You never compromise me. You never find it hard
You never recognize me. You throw me off my guard

Ch: Calley Oh
With the roads that you pave
Calley Oh
You can have it your way
Don't you know
That I can't hold back
I keep on coming after you

Bridge:
I go chasing moonshine racing you may wonder why
If I find my true love ever
I will never
I will never say good bye

3. I'm past the point of caring. It's just your point of view
I'm Past the point of sharing. I gave it all to you

Ch: Calley Oh
You can see through my eyes
Calley Oh
You could never disguise
What you know â?¦ That I can't hold back
I keep on coming after you
Calley Oh
You're my nights and my days
Calley Oh
Finding my way
Don't You know that I can't hold back
I keep on coming after you.
