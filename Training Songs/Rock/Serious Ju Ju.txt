Don’t disturb my paradise
I’ve asked you once, I asked you nice
Mother Earth will punish you
With some serious juju

Astronomical divide
We stand and watch two worlds collide
Paranoia, paralyzed
We need some serious juju

Untied from the whippin' post
Set free from Mary’s spell
Cut loose from the ball and chain
9 steps from the wishing well

Tuggin’ on the Devil’s sleeve
He’ll cut a deal for me
Locate me anywhere, I’ll be there
It’s serious, it’s serious

The politicians speech is jive
He lies to keep the lie alive
While mass confusion makes ‘em strong
It’s serious, serious juju

Got no agenda here
I got to scream it out
Moments of clarity
I’d rather be without

It’s never loud enough
Shouts out a distant child
Ignore my bloody throat
I’ll go the extra mile

It’s serious, woo, juju
Yeah, it’s serious juju
Somebody save the world
It’s serious, it’s serious juju

Somebody save the world
It’s serious, it’s serious juju
Somebody save the world
It’s serious, so serious juju

Somebody save the world
It’s serious, it’s serious
It’s serious juju
