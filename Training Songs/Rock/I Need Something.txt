I need something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in myself
And I'm sick and tired of getting nowhere
Guess it'll all work out

And I don't mind anymore 
And I don't mind anymore

And I need someone to put my trust in
'Cause I ain't trusting myself
I'm scared of failure, so scared of success
I guess, it'll all work out

And I don't mind it anymore
And I don't mind it anymore anyway

And I need something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in myself
And I'm sick and tired of getting nowhere
I guess, it'll all work out

And I don't mind it anymore
And I don't mind it anymore
