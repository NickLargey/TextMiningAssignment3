And you're primitive
And you're cynical to me
And I chewed down on the bit
And almost swallowed it

You sit all alone with your color TV
Your hair starts to glisten
In spite of the fleas
We don't have to stay friends
Let's pretend to be enemies

Yeah, whatever makes you happy
Yeah, whatever makes it beautiful
Yeah, whatever leaves you satisfied
'Cause I'm out of time
For now

And you're paranoid
As you look me up and down
And I'm soaked in gasoline
Mud and ice cream

You sit by the phone
With your tongue hanging out
You cradle the flies in the back of your mouth
We don't have to stay friend
Let's pretend to be enemies

Damned if you do
Fucked if you don't
Damned if you do
What if you won't

You must be aware what you're
Doing to me
We sunk like a stone on a rock
In the sea

We don't have to stay friends
(Not for very long)
We don't have to stay friends
(Just because you're gone)

You get what you want 'cause you won't let it die

Yeah, whatever makes you happy
Yeah, whatever leaves you insecure
Yeah, seems to break you down

'Cause I'm out of time
But I'm feeling fine
