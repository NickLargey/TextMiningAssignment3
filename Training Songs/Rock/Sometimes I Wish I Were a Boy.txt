Sometimes, yes sometimes I wish I were a boy

I'd been standing by the jukebox
Hoping he'd ask me to dance
How I wish I could run to him and hug him
But a girl musn't make an advance

Oh, I'm a girl and it's wonderful
It fills my heart with joy
But sometimes, yes sometimes I wish I were a boy

Oh he's dancing with another
And he's holding her so tight
Wish I had the nerve to cut right in and stop it
But a girl has to be polite

Now the record hop is over
And I think he's caught my eye
Here he comes heading straight in my direction
There he goes, he's passing me by
