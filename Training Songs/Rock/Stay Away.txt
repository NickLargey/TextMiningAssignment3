Stay away leave me alone
Say away from my door
'Cause you'll hurt me again
Like you hurt me before
Don't want no excuses
I don't want no more lies
I don't like crying
So I keep it inside
Do me a favor for God's sake please
Say away
Stay away out of my dreams
Stay away from my nights
You're there in the darkness
So I leave on the nights
Well I don't want no whiskey
'Cause is heightens the pain
Make me call you at midnight
And beg you come back again
Do me a favor for God's sake please
Stay away
'Cause time is to short 
To waste it on regrets
They say it heals a broken heart
That's waiting to forget
Stay away leave me alone
Say away from my door
'Cause you'll hurt me again
Like you hurt me before
But if you should need me
Well it might be alright
I suppose you could call me up some lonely night
But do me a favor for God's sake please
Stay away
