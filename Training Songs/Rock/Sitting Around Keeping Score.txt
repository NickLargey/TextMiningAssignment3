Sitting around, keeping score
On a little note pad past bedtime, yeah
Vowed that I'd wait three days to call
I'm already two ahead, is that alright?
Is that alright?

If someone told you, barely knowed you
That you showed up in their dream
You'd check them closely for intention
Why share something so revealing?

Kicking around with too much to do
Putting it off until lunchtime, yeah
Pick up the phone and then hang it up
Checking the mail and it's so bright outside

Chorus

Gazing across the neighbor's lawn
From a bedroom desk until sundown
Picking away at a ketchup stain
Getting up now would take
Way way too much out of me

Chorus
