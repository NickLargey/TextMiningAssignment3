His love is always there
No matter where you are
His love is always greater than your fondest hopes
And bigger than what you're afraid of

There is no heart so lost it cannot be found
There are no hopeless circumstances
There is no such thing as a godforsaken town
?Cause there are always second chances

Until this life is over
There is no point of no return
?Cause everywhere you turn

His love is always there
No matter where you are
His love is always greater than your fondest hopes
And bigger than what you're afraid of

Wherever you may go
You haven't gone too far
Love is always there

Is no night so long it can stop the sun
From taking over come the morning
And there's no road so wrong, it can keep anyone
From finding home around the corner

So even in your darkest hour
Even when it?s more than you can bear
You've always got a prayer

His love is always there
No matter where you are
His love is always greater than your fondest hopes
And bigger than what you're afraid of

Like a light in the window
Love calls you in from the dark
Like a tireless suitor
Heaven pursues your heart

His love is always there
No matter where you are
His love is always greater than your fondest hopes
And bigger than what you're afraid of
