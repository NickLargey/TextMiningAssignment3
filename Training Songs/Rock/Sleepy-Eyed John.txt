Well way down yonder on Candy Creek
I whittled out a fiddle from a wagon seat.
I tune fiddle and I rub my bow.
Play a little tune wherever I go.

Sleepy-eyed John, you better get yore britches on
Sleepy-eyed John better tie your shoe.
Sleepy-eyed John, you better goet your britches on.
Try to get to heaven 'for the devil gets to you.

Now Sleepy-eyed John he had a wooden leg.
The wooden leg was nothing but a little wooden peg.
With one shoe off and one shoe on
Do the double-shuffle 'till the cows come home.

Sleepy-eyed John, you better get yore britches on
Sleepy-eyed John better tie your shoe.
Sleepy-eyed John, you better goet your britches on.
Try to get to heaven 'for the devil gets to you.

Over the hickory and down the pine
The racoon left and the old hound whined.
John said 'Sick 'em', and the racoon left.
They crossed Green River in a minute and a half.

Sleepy-eyed John, you better get yore britches on
Sleepy-eyed John better tie your shoe.
Sleepy-eyed John, you better goet your britches on.
Try to get to heaven 'for the devil gets to you.

I took 20 dollars for to build a fence.
I took my money and I ain't worked since.
I sold my buggy and I sold my plow.
I wouldn't take a dollar for my journey now.

Sleepy-eyed John, you better get yore britches on
Sleepy-eyed John better tie your shoe.
Sleepy-eyed John, you better goet your britches on.
Try to get to heaven 'for the devil gets to you.
