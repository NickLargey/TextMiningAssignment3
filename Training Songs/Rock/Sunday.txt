You could never turn me off 
Just turn me upside down 
When push comes to shove 
I knew you'll be around to help me 
Put it down 

Funny papers I'm picking up things you let fall 
I've got an answer let's listen to it all comes down 
Forgotten 
Feigning 

But you know how far away we are 

You caught me looking as you were catch as catch can 
Caught you spinning on himself in the pretty night 
Giving into this 

But you know how far away we are
