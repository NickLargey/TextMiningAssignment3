Guarding yourself from the love of another
Left you with nothing tonight
Why does it sound like the devil is laughing
Leaving me haunted tonight
You did decide

Now I want you when you're done
And now it's like you're holding something
Just in front of me
Well then I can't allow this to become another
One of those times when I'm left in the cold, dead
There's no compromise
Just another tie
I know I need to sever

Guarding yourself from the love of another
Left you with nothing tonight
Why does it sound like the devil is laughing
Leaving me haunted tonight
You did decide

Ever haunted by the trappings of this life
Sweet redemption just in front of me
Well now it seems once again that I've lost another
One of the one's that have broke through the wall, damned
Fate won't compromise
I have sold my soul
And now the devil's laughing
You did decide

You were bold and strong
And ready to begin your life
All for nothing
You were sacrificed
You begin alone
And so it will be when you die
All for nothing
Will you be remembered
You did decide

Guarding yourself from the love of another
Left you with nothing tonight
So now you know why the devil is laughing
He left you with nothing tonight
You did decide
