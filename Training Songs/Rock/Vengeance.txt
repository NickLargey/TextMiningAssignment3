Well I remember the times you put me down on the floor
Spreading it around like a cheap little whore
But now you've finished with your fancy man
A skinny little runt from Birmingham

I want vengeance and I want it now
I want vengeance, gonna get it somehow
I'm gonna hit him, I'm gonna kill him
I'm gonna really make him pay for what he's done
I'm gonna hit him, I'm gonna kill him
Nobody spoils my fun

Well I was crying
But now I've stopped
And you were lying
The penny's dropped

So shut your mouth and lay on the bed
And when I'm finished with you, I'm gonna break his head
I'm gonna hit him, I'm gonna kill him
I'm gonna really make him pay for what he's done
I'm gonna hit him, I'm gonna kill him
Nobody spoils my fun

A Well I had my very last night with you
You pushed me too far and now we're through
You're running to the car and you think you're cute
But you're the kind of bird, that they ought to shoot

I want vengeance and I want it now
I want vengeance, gonna get it somehow
I'm gonna hit him, I'm gonna kill him
I'm gonna really make him pay for what he's done
I'm gonna hit him, I'm gonna kill him
Nobody spoils my fun

Well I was crying
Yeah, But now I've stopped
And you were lying
The penny's dropped

So shut your mouth and lay on the bed
And when I'm finished with you, I'm gonna break his head
I'm gonna hit him, I'm gonna kill him
I'm gonna really make him pay for what he's done
I'm gonna hit him, I'm gonna kill him
Nobody spoils my fun
Nobody spoils my fun

I want vengeance and I want it now
I want vengeance, gonna get it somehow
I want vengeance and I want it now
I want vengeance, gonna get it somehow
I want vengeance and I want it now
I want vengeance and I want it now
I want vengeance and I want it now
I want vengeance and I want it
I want it now!
