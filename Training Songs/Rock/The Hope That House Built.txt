In the end everybody wins
As long as we remember there's a reason for 
Incredible wealth (incredible wealth)
Incredible luck (incredible wealth) woah

Don't despair life is just a dream
And nobody can judge us if we choose to face
It gradually (it gradually) 
Makes everything right ('cause nothing can beat us)

Come join come join our hopeless cause
Come join come join our lost cause
Come join come join our hopeless cause
Come join come join our lost cause

Turn around face a different sphere 
We imagined art is just a mental illness 
Looming towards (appearing towards) 
The end of our days (the end of our days) woah 

Think again how could we be wrong
If supernaturals control our fate
Could anyone tell (could anyone tell)
Would anyone care (would anyone care at all)

Come join come join our hopeless cause
Come join come join our lost cause
Come join come join our hopeless cause
Come join come join our lost cause

The feeling stabs 
The fools behind 
They're back in the ground 
We look at our hands
And wonder aloud 
Could anyone choose to die 
In the end everybody wins 
In the end everybody wins

The feeling stabs 
The fools behind 
They're back in the ground 
We look at our hands
And wonder aloud 
Could anyone choose to die 
In the end everybody wins 
In the end everybody wins

The feeling stabs 
The fools behind 
They're back in the ground 
We look at our hands
And wonder aloud 
Could anyone choose to die 
In the end everybody wins 
In the end everybody wins

The feeling stabs 
The fools behind 
They're back in the ground 
We look at our hands
And wonder aloud 
Could anyone choose to die
