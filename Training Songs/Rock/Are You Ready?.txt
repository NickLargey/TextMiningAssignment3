Ooh oh yeah
Ooh oh yeah
Ooh oh yeah

Are you ready? 
Ooh, are you ready for the day?
He's gonna come back down to earth
I hope you're gonna pray
That you're with us
Mm, as we beam him right up
He's got a little place for me
In his loving cup

Are you ready? 
Ooh, ready to see
I'm out here in Babylon
Come out here with me

Are you ready?
Ah, are you ready?
Ah, are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Ah, are you ready?
Ah, are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

Please, I'm ready
'Cause I've lived a life of sin
And I heard that us sinners 
Have got a chance with Him
Suicidal, ooh yeah
Deep inside my soul
I've been praying there's somewhere else
For me to go

Come on people
Ooh, don't you hear my pain
I'm out here in Babylon
Waiting for the day
Are you ready?
Ah, I'm ready
Ah, I'm ready
Yes I'm ready
Yes I'm ready
Ah, I'm ready
Ooh yes, I'm ready
Ooh I'm ready
Yes I'm ready
Yes I'm ready
Yes I'm ready

Ah, I'll paint the town with blood
I've been losing so damn much
Since I'm feeling love with people
Ah yeah, the whole damn human race
I wanna put you in my arms
And give you a love embrace
I'm ready
Oh, I ain't no freedom train
Cos where we are heading
Yeah, there is no thing as pain
Yes I'm ready
Ooh I've had a season in hell
I'm getting pretty tired down here
Oh, please break the spell

Ah Jesus, sweet Jesus can't you hear?
Please don't leave us all alone
Living here with fear
I'm ready
Yes I'm ready
I'm ready 
Yes I'm ready
Yes I'm ready
I'm ready
Yes I'm ready
Yes I'm ready
Yes I'm ready
Yes I'm ready
