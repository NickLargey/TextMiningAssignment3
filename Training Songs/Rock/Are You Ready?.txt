There's rumors of war
Men dying and women crying
If you breathe air, you'll die
Perhaps you wonder the reason why

But wait, don't you worry
A new day is dawning
You catch the sun
And away we'll fly

Are you ready to sit by his throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready then he'll carry you home

Are you ready?
Are you ready?

People say that he won't come
And I don't know what say you
But if he should, would you be the one
I've got a little question I'd like to ask you

Are you ready to sit by his throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready then he'll carry you home

Are you ready?
Are you ready?

Brothers and sisters
I have many stumbling along to do their thing
Love is a song, it's better than any
It's better for music, it's easy to sing

Are you ready to sit by his throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready then he'll carry you home

Are you ready to sit by his throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready then he'll carry you home

(Yes I'm ready)
Are you ready?
(Yes, I'm ready)
Are you ready?
(Yes, I'm ready)
I've got to know, yeah

(Yes, I'm ready)
You sound real good
(Are you ready?)
Are you ready?
(Aah, yes, I'm ready)

Gonna be your sunshine again
(Aah, yes, I'm ready)
And the flowers growing
(Aah, yes, I'm ready)

Children playing
(Aah, yes, I'm ready)
Gonna be alright
(Aah, yes, I'm ready)

You've got to be ready
(Oh, yes, I'm ready)
I know you're ready
(I know, baby, I'm ready)

Say it loud one more time
(Oh, yes, I'm ready)
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
(Yes, yes, I'm ready)
