You're there
I'm here
Let's dance
My dear
What's your name
How do you do
What's the game
Hallelujah

I saw a girl
The way she moved
It changed the way
I see the world
And that girl is you
And this is for real
How do you do
I sing Hallelujah

You're there
I'm here
But let's dance
My dear
What's your name
How do you do
What's the game
Oh, Hallelujah

I saw a girl
And the way she moved
It changed the way
I see the world
That girl is you
And this is for real
How do you do
Oh, Hallelujah

You're there
And I'm here
Let's dance
My dear
What's your name
How do you do
And your game
Hallelujah
