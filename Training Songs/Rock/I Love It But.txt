I love it but it doesn't knock me out
I think it's great, but it could be better
I like it a lot, it's just not my cup of tea
Yet if you were to change the melody
Take out a part that you think should be here
Put in a part that wouldn't otherwise appear
Well it's only an idea.
I hate it but that doesn't mean it's bad
In other words I quite enjoyed it
Apart from which, it's the best you've ever done
Yet if you were to change the words
It would be superb with perhaps a different melody
I love it but it's just a shade too long
Though to be fair you'd hardly notice
The only thing as I say is how it's done
Bits to me sound like it ought to have been sung
Not only in two part harmony but one
Making the whole thing really swing before it's swung
Walk instead of run
I love it, but it doesn't knock me out
Yet it you were to change the words
It would be superb with perhaps a different melody.
I love it but it doesn't knock me out
I think it's great, but it could be better
I like it a lot, it's just not my cup of tea
Yet if you were to change the melody
Take out a part that you think should be here
Replace it with a part that wouldn't otherwise appear
Are you getting the idea
I love it, but it doesn't knock me out.
