You find me here alone
I hear a voice that's so unknown
It strikes courage up my backbone
Strengthen my heart
A life set apart
I see that's what you are

You come, you come with open arms
And you say I love you for who you are
When I was haunted and alone
With this baggage on my back, dragging me down
You set me free, yeah
You set me free, yeah
You set me free

How quickly will I run away
And let it all go to my head?
I can't give in to my stubborn heart
And let things that don't matter get in my way
Oh, why can't we just listen
Break down our pride and go ahead?

You come, you come with open arms
And you say I love you for who you are
When I was haunted and alone
With this baggage on my back, dragging me down
You set me free, yeah yeah
You set me free, yeah

Oh when I'm weak
You carry me
Through the storm
You set me free
When I'm weak
Oh you carry me
Through the storm
You set me free, yeah

You come, you come with open arms
You say I love you for who you are
When I was haunted and alone
With this baggage on my back, dragging me down
You set me free, yeah
You set me free, yeah
