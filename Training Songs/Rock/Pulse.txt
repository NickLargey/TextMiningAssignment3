You comin' through get in the crowd
You come in crew it turns me on
You comin' through get in the crowd, we start
You can do anything whatever you want
So,no need to hesitate,future's right there
Make our own rules
Kick it now
Correct or wack,check yourself
Stake yourself before you upset
That's the way we do all the time
Correct or wack,check yourself
Open your mind,open mind
