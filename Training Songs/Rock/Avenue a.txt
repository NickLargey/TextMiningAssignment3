Benny got a new tattoo
Down at the St. Mark's Zoo

He walked down to the park
Drinkin 40's, till it's dark
Talkin to a grey haired man
In a tie-dyed shirt and ragged pants
He said,
That's where the hippies used to play
Down on Avenue A

Susie got a new pair of shoes
Now she don't know what to do

So she's sitting in the Park
Smokin pot till it's dark
Talking to a toothless man
With spiky hair
And leather pants
He said,
I knew Stiv in the day
And that's where the junkies used to play
Down on Avenue A

When every memory is gone
And everything you know is wrong

Takin the edge off on a beautiful day
With a Frappacino and a cr√©??e brulee
Yeah, it's all over when you see a Range Rover
And to my bodega, I say hasta luega

it's not what you do, it's what you say
And it's not who you know, it's who you pay

Down on Avenue A
