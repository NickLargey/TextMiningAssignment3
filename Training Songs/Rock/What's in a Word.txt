Oh, yes it's hard, it's getting harder
To turn the cheek or just walk away
When all I see is degradation
Day after day

I wanna fight, my hands are tied
My weapons are pitiful
And all that's left
One troubled mind, one timid voice
Such a desperate noise

What's in a word, more than you imagine
What's in a word, more than I can say
Once in a while you can hear such sweet sounds
Freedom's singing in your head, in your head

And while I slide down into darkness
You spent so proud, so proud in the light
Oh, help me please
I think I'm falling between wrong and right

Why give me strenght, then speak at lenght
Of wisdom and tenderness
So much to learn, so much to lose
I've asked it before, now tell me once more

What's in a word, more than you imagine
What's in a word, more than I can say
Once in a while you can hear such sweet sounds
Chimes of freedom in your head

Yes I have heard that a new age's dawning
And I have heard that the die is cast
I know the word can be liberation
For a people free at last, free at last

Some give a damn, some give their lives
Why can't we give peace a chance
Put down that gun, a battle won without even a shot
Oh, dreamer I'm not

What's in a word, more than you imagine
What's in a word, more than I can say
Once in a while you can hear such sweet sounds
Freedom's singing in your head

Yes I have heard that a new age's dawning
And I have heard that the die is cast
I know the word can be liberation
For the people free at last
Free at last
