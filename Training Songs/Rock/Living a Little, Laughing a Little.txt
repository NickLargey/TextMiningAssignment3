Laugh everyone at the clown
He's the best one in town, ummm ummm
Ride on his merry-go-round
Spinning faster than sound
Uuuuh huh uuuh huh 

Laugh as the funny man cries
Though his makeup is smeared
Uuuuh huuuh
Laugh at his funny pictures
As he [paints out the years?]
Uuuuh huh uuuuh huh 

Livin' just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy, uuuuuh huuuuh 

Livin' just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy 

Laugh everyone at the fool with his heart in his hand
Uuuuh huuuh
Mmmmm, he can't quite understand that he's less than a man
Uuuuh huuuh uuuuh huuuh 

[?] there's an ember of pride
Uuuuh huuuh
Watch how he tries hard to hide that he's dying inside
Uuuuh huuuh
Uuuuh huuuh 

Livin' just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy, uuuuuh huuuuh 

Livin' just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy 

Livin' just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy, uuuuuh huuuuh 

Livin' just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy
