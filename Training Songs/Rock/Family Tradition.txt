I try to be the one that everybody loves
Where has that gotten me?
I tear myself to shreds to prove that I'm someone
That I could never be
Now, these unsightly marks define me

So, help me
Please, someone, come quick
I think I am losing it
Forgive me, I inherited this
From a stranger I'll never miss
I'm sick

My father taught me first-hand how to be set free:
Give up and run away!
I wish I could drain out his half of blood in me
But, I'd still have his face
I curse reflections every day

So, help me
Please, someone, come quick
I think I am losing it
Forgive me, I inherited this
From a stranger I'll never miss
I'm sick

Here is my own family tradition:
Following footsteps into addiction
So, is there a way
That I can find peace, while still numbing my pain?
Is this my fate?
'Cause your only son still can't seem to find a way

So, help me
Please, someone, come quick
I think I am losing it
Forgive me, I inherited this
From a stranger I'll never miss
I'm sick

So father, where the hell are you now?
I think that you would be proud
Your son, who so unluckily
Fell right next to the tree

I hope you're proud of me!
I hope you're proud!
