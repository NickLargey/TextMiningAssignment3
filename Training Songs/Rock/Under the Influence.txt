On a train to nowhere in another nightmare
In a dream about falling for someone and taking her back to my room
Tangled up in her hair
And believing everything goes and then anything more is alright

On a road to somewhere
Where it goes i don't care
But it keeps on winding and winding and winding away
Sitting next to me are lovely senoritas
Reality way in the back of my mind

I'm under the influence i find it's all in my mind
And under the influence the blind will lead the blind
Thunder and lightning in my head but only in bed
I'm under the influence of something from the blue

When i wake a new day, on a better do day
But the dreams keep calling and calling and calling me back
Definitely no no
Need a new amigo to help me get my reality right

I'm under the influence i find it's all in my mind
And under the influence the blind will lead the blind
Thunder and lightning in my head but only in bed
I'm under the influence of something from the blue

What the hell will i do?
Facing up to tell you
Will i be breaking the ice and falling through?
Definitely no no
Found need a new amigo to help me get my reality right

I'm under the influence i find it's all in my mind
And under the influence the blind will lead the blind
Thunder and lightning in my head but only in bed
I'm under the influence of something from the blue
I'm under the influence of something from the blue
