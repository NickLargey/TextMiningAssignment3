I think I've seen that look before
Somewhere somhow I can't be sure
Teresa.
And though I see it everywhere
I cloose my eyes it's always there
Teresa.
From that expression you display
I think there's something you must say
Teresa.
So say it now it won't take long
It's better over better done.
Don't leave me hanging around
If you're just about to tell me Teresa.
I don't care anymore.
I think I'll find Somebody else just like I did before.
Don't look that way you're always saying
It's not a joke a silly game
Teresa.
So you don't care to look at me
Turn away but I can see
Teresa.
From that expression you display
I think there's something you must say
Teresa.
So say it now it won't take long
It's better over better done.
Don't leave me hanging around
If you're just about to tell me Teresa.
I don't care anymore.
I think I'll find Somebody else just like I did before.
