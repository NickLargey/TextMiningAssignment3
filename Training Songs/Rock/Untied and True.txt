Oh, my little Philly, I'm gonna ride you
I'm gonna write you a love story
And I'll make you my very own star
And when it's cold out
I'm gonna crawl inside of you

She's my little sapphire
I'm gonna shine you, girl
I'm gonna keep you close to my heart
And they'll never tear us apart

And when it's dangerous
I'll always protect you
I'm gonna keep you by my side, love
I'll give you my pride and never be cruel

And when it's over
I'm gonna bring my love to you
And when it's over
Well, I'll be untied and true

And when it's over
I'm gonna crawl right up to you
And when it's over
Well, I'll be untied and I'll be true

She's my little angel
She can part the clouds in the sky Lord
Bringin' down the heavens
With just a wink of her eye

The devil's never laid his hands on her
She never gives a reason why
She's never been sinned before
Never even heard the words

And when it's cold out
I'm gonna crawl inside of you
I'm gonna keep you by my side, girl
I'll dry your eyes, you'll never be blue
