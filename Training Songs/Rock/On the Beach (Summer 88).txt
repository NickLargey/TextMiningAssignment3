Between the eyes of love, I call your name
Behind those guarded walls, I used to go
Upon a summer wind there's a certain melody
Takes me back to the place that I know

On the beach, yea yea yea
Down on the beach, yea

The secrets of the summer, I will keep
The sands of time will blow a mystery
No one but you and I, underneath that moonlit sky
Take me back to the place that I know

On the beach, yea yea yea
Oh, down on the beach
Yea, down on the beach
On the beach, yea yea yea
On the beach

Forever in my dreams my heart will be
Hanging on to this sweet memory
A day of strange desire and a night that burned like fire
Take me back to the place that I know

On the beach, yea yea yea
Oh, down on the beach
Yea, down on the beach
On the beach, yea yea yea
On the beach, yea
