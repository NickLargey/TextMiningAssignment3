I never was a true believer 
I never asked you to come with me 
You can find your own way home. 
You can not use my indecision 
Belated promises and wisdom 
You can find your own way home 
Who's to know 
You don't live here anymore 
Your home is out there somewhere 
I hope you find it 
But nobody is going to help you 
Hope you find it in time 
I can't accept the things you gave me 
They would only suffocate me 
You can find your own way home
