What kind of song would you give
If you had a song to give
What kind of life would you live
If you had a life to live
Would you wanna make something good, that you could look on
Give you lots of pleasure, yeah you would

What about this thing that you gave
What if it weren't quite perfect
What about if it was something bad about it
Would you love it just the same
Would you still care about it

[Chorus]
The lights on the city looks so good
Almost like somebody thought they would
Thought they would

What kind of song would you sing
If you had a song to sing
What kind of life would you live
If you had a life to live
Would you wanna make something good, that you could look on
Give you lots of pleasure, yeah you would

[Chorus]

What about this thing that you gave
What if it weren't quite perfect
What about if it was something bad about it
Would you love it just the same
Would you still care about it

The lights on the city looks so good
Almost like somebody thought they would

[Chorus]
