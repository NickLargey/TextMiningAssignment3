Baby, it's nice to have you here right now
Baby, it's nice to feel you near now
While I cover ground

Home is anywhere we're bound
Yesterday the road was long, long without an end

Before you came along girl, I just pretend
To be always havin' fun
I was the lonely, lonely one, oh

Baby I'm a minstrel gypsy

I'd go anywhere they want me
But baby I'm home where you are
Baby I'm a minstrel gypsy
And I want you with me, yeah
Cause only with you I'm a star

Loneliness is no one's friend and time can pass so slow
When it's three AM long past the late night show
And every man needs love
The comfort of sweet love, oh

Baby I'm a minstrel gypsy
I'd go anywhere they want me
But baby I'm home where you are
Baby I'm a minstrel gypsy
And I want you with me, yeah
Cause only with you I'm a star

Baby I'm a minstrel gypsy
I'd go anywhere they want me
But baby I'm home where you are
Baby I'm a minstrel gypsy
And I want you with me, yeah
Cause only with you I'm a star

Baby I'm a minstrel gypsy
I'd go anywhere they want me
But baby I'm home where you are
Baby I'm a minstrel gypsy
And I want you with me, yeah
Cause only with you I'm a star

Baby I'm a minstrel gypsy
I'd go anywhere they want me
But baby I'm home where you are
Baby I'm a minstrel gypsy
And I want you with me, yeah
Cause only with you I'm a star
