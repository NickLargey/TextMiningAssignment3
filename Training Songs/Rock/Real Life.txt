(marie wilson, marsha malamet, liz vidal)

This ain't no warning
This ain't no countdown
This is the real thing
This is the right now
It's thought provoking
It might sound crazy
But I'm not joking
Hear what I'm saying
Ain't no excuses
Ain't no rehearsals
Don't be so stupid
Don't be so hurtful
Cause what you give out
You're sure to get back
It's gonna come round
Nothing will change that

This is your real life going by
Every day and every night
This is your real life

Don't be a loser
Don't be mistaken
There is a truth here
That you're not facing
Ain't no pretending
This is your one shot
And in the ending
It's all you got

This is your real life going by
Every day and every night
This is your real life

Look in the mirror, what do you see?
Is this how you pictured, yourself to be?
Isn't it time to open your eyes, open your eyes

This is your real life going by
Every day and every night
This is your real life
