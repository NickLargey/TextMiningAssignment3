Mary's not the Mary of yesterday 
She's gone with changing her hair 
She laughs and she cries 
And her mind seems to be 
A worried and jumbled affair 
Well, I have talked to Mary, I've searched her eyes 
And if you ask of Mary she'll tell you why. 
It's Mary's time to run, 
With the mad, with the sane, 
With the joy and the pain, 
Till she finds her place in the sun. 
Young birds fly in early spring 
Learn new songs to sing 
And each song they know can help them to grow. 
Mary questions everything she's ever known before 
And warn her as we may she just won't listen any more 
So let her find her way and soon will come the proudest day 
When everything's been sorted 
Through the streets will be reported 
All the people congregate to feel the love within her heart 
And to listen to the music in her mind.
