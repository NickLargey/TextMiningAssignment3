There's a life worth living and it's interesting
There's a calm that's real somewhere
There's a jungle stream and band that's playing
There's a tune worth whistling to
Don't be scared

You can't sit if you don't believe it
It's not the kind of thing you can see
It won't help you out if you forget
Cause it's not the kind of thing you can remember
Why must you give yourself a global rating
Numbers can mess up everything
Don't do that
