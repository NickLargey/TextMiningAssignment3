If I ever leave you 
You can say I told you so 
And if I ever hurt you babe 
You know I hurt myself as well 

Is that any way for a man to carry on 
D'you think he wants his little loved one gone? 
I love you baby, more than you'll ever know 
More than you'll ever know 

When I wasn't makin' too much money 
You know where my paycheck went 
You know I brought it home to baby 
And I never spent one red cent 

Is that any way for a man to carry on 
D'you think he wants his little loved one gone? 
I love you baby, more than you'll ever know 
More than you'll ever know 

I'm not tryin' to be 
Any kind of man 
I'm tryin' to be somebody 
You can love, trust, and understand 
I know that I can be, yeah 
A part of you that no one else could see 
I just gotta hear, to hear you say 
It's all right 
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm only flesh and blood 
But I could be anything that you demand 
I could president of General Motors baby, heh 
Or just a tiny little grain of sand 

Is that any way for a man to carry on 
D'you think he wants his little loved one gone? 
I love you baby, I love you baby
I love you baby, more than you'll ever know 

If I ever leave you 
You can say I told you so 
And if I ever hurt you 
You know I hurt myself as well 

Is that any way for a man to carry on 
D'you think he wants his little loved one gone?
