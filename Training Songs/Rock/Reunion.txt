Got a letter. an invitation.
The date is here, and it's been ten years now.
And it's time for me.
Why would I spend more time with people that I hate,
Couldn't wait to leave behind?
Would we dance, make a toast,
As you boast about the things that you haven't done.
Oh joy, the thrills, this is fun.
Down the hallways I still remember
The things you said.
And I hang my head low.
And I try not to feel.
So why would I spend more time with people that I hate,
Couldn't wait to leave behind?
Would we dance, make a toast,
As you boast about the things that you haven't done.
Oh joy, the thrills, fun fun.

Beautiful, you were, popular.
It's cool it's so cool. so cool.
Beautiful you were, popular.
It's cool, it's so cool. so cool.
Beautiful, you were, popular.
It's cool it's so cool. so cool.
Beautiful you were, popular.
It's cool, it's so cool. so cool.
Beautiful, you were, popular.
It's cool it's so cool. so cool.
