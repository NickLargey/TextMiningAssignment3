Turn it down you say
But all I got to say to you is time and time again I say No!
No! No! No!
Tell me not to play
Well, all I got to say to when you tell me not to play I say No!
No! No! No!
So, if you ask me why I like the way I play it
There's only one thing I can say to you

There's a feelin' that
I get from nothin' else and there ain't nothin' in the world that makes me go!
Go! Go! Go!
Turn the power up
I've waited for so long so I could hear my favorite song so, let's go!
Go! Go! Go!
When it's like this I feel the music shootin' through me
There's nothin' else that I would rather do
