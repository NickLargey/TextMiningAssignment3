I woke up early today
And thought of seven different ways
To like myself less than you do
For any reason false or true

While you dig me
More than I dig myself
And I'm in love with you
'Cause I got nothing better to do

I just fish for sympathy
For any reason pitifully
You smile miles more than I do
So I just bounce me off of you

While you dig me
More than I dig myself
And I'm in love with you
'Cause I got nothing better to do

There you are giving, here I am taking
Two parasite hearts co-existing

While you dig me
More than I dig myself
And I'm in love with you
'Cause I got nothing better to do
