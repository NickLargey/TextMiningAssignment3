Never been to Texas
Never been to that old place
Never got to sing with all the boys
I don't want to wear a hat
I don't want to wear some boots
I don't want to sing about your blues

But I want you to say
Yes I want you to say
That you want me
You want me
You want me
You want me

Never been to Manchester
Never been to that old town
Never got to join in the big rave
I don't want to wear those flares
They twist around my head

I don't want to glorify the E

But I want you to say
Yes I want you to say
That you want me
You want me
You want me
You want me

I'm going up to Manchester
I'm going up to Texas
I'm going to get to sing with all the boys
And the singer sings his song
And the singer sings his song
And this is what he said to me

You got a head full of nothing
And you'll go far
You got a head full of nothing
And you'll go far
You got a head full of nothing
And you'll go far
Head full

But I want you to say
Yes I want you to say
That you want me
You want me
You want me
You want me
