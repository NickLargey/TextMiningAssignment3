She hides
You never know what you can find
She cries
That's what you'll face when behind

She's wicked
Oh
So wicked
I'll keep her
I'll do her
No!

She lies
You wouldn't believe how they fly
She's a villain
Her beauty is just sorta disguise

She's wicked
Angel of death's in her eyes
So wicked
I'll keep her
I'll do her

She shines
She shines
She shines
She shines
She warms sometimes
She shines

Yet the world came crashing in
Yeah the sun came crashing down
Yeah the oh clear shine lighting the place
What a beautiful glow from the light of her face

Yeah!

She hides
You never know what you can find
She cries
That's what you'll face when behind

She's wicked
So wicked
I'll keep her
And I'll keep her
And I'll do her

Cause she shines
She shines
She shines
She shines

She shines, shines, shines, shining
Shines, shines, shines, shining
What, what, what, what
Shut up, won't shut up
