"I don't know why you don't go back to college and get your degree," he said
"You could be anything you want to be if you'd only believe that you're
Worthy, beautiful, you don't need their approval,
And I'll be the rock that you can lean on..."
"I've watched you work the room - people hanging on every word,
You build it, then kill it, leaving a mystery everybody needs,
You're broken, beautiful, you fascinate them all,
And they'll be the wind that you will lean on..."
"And why are you everybody's girl?
Why (do) you throw your arms around the world?
When I am all you need to see you through,
I don't believe it, no, I don't believe it, no, I don't know, know about you..."
"I don't know why you don't give up the wild life and come be with me, you know,
'Cause I feel you, and I'm real, you've gotta believe that I never would leave
You, 'cause
I'm strong, dependable, and I could give you the world,
Why can't I be the one you lean on?"
"And why are you everybody's girl?
Why (do) you throw your arms around the world?
When I am all you need to see you through,
I don't believe it, no I don't believe it, no, I don't know, know about you..."
Because I always fell short, because they always wanted more
Because he left and shut the door before you came along
I couldn't feel anybody's love, so everybody's love was not enough
But I know one day, it's going to fill me up
And that's why I am everybody's girl
That's why I throw my arms around the world
'Cause I cannot believe it could be true
I don't believe it, no I don't believe it, no, I don't know, know about
Why I am everybody's girl
That's why I throw my arms around the world
'Cause I cannot believe it could be true
