Spitting out through the cracks and dirt
Watch it trickle watch it overflow
Gain momentum swallow simple life
Never want you never want you around here

I had a home now it isn't a home
I'll protect you I'll protect you
I'll still protect you
'Cause people in this town keep staring at the mighty wall

Great wall
Hold back disaster, comfort me 
Great wall
Don't tumble down around my feet

Kiss my cheeks so the children don't know
Fight your silence fight it blow by blow
You had a heart now show me your heart
'Cause people in this town keep staring at the mighty wall

Great wall
Hold back disaster, comfort me
Great wall
It's cracking up now, now can't you see?

Great wall
Hold back disaster, dam my fear
Great wall
Don't tumble down I need you here

I'll protect you I'll protect you
I'll still protect you
People in this town keep staring at the mighty wall

Great wall
Hold back disaster, comfort me
Great wall
Don't tumble down around my feet

Great wall
Hold back disaster, dam my fear
Great wall
Don't crumble down I need you here
I need you here
