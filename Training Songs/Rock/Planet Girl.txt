She's a bip bop dirty star-shine thing
She kissed my skin like an angel's wing
Solid gold love in a rat skin fur
Planet earths spin in space for her
Blue static fizz on a detuned station
Sleeping beauty with a bad reputation
Divine, drunk goddess of love

I said you goddess of love
I love you planet girl.

Strange, deranged
She's a bullet-proof poem
Dance trance drugs in a star war zone
Laser beam lips give me kiss of life
Sex explosion with baby midnight
Psyhcotic erotic want to mad energy
Electrons snap when she touch me
Divine, drunk, goddess of love oh yeah.

I said you goddess of love
I love you planet girl.
