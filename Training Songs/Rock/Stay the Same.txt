So when I wake up
I feel the same feeling
the same feeling that I felt last night
Now my bones are cold
And my body aches
Like it did last night
It was the same feeling

Everytime we stumble
Everytime we fall
Everytime we try to make a start
Everytime we stumble
Everytime we fall
Everytime I feel you fall apart

I feel like nothing can change again
We see the same ghosts every day
And when it comes tomorrow we feel the same
We feel the same
We stay the same
We stay the same

So when we go out
We always dance the same
We always dance the same
Like we did last night
We always stay up
We always stay up late
I'm always losing sleep
Like I did last night

Everytime we stumble
Everytime we fall
Everytime we try to make a start
Everytime we stumble
Everytime we fall
Everytime I feel you fall apart

I feel like nothing can change again
We see the same ghosts every day
And when it comes tomorrow we feel the same
We feel the same
We stay the same
We stay the same
