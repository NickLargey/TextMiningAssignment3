Don't know what I'm doing here, but I say it again
Don't know what I'm doing here, but you might know my name
Room full of faces laughing, I'm so alone
Feel a little strange, 'cause I'm so far from home

Don't wanna fall
Remember don't look down
Don't wanna fall
Remember don't look down
Yeah, don't look down

Had a woman's love, but she sent me away
Can't live with a broken heart, but there's no place to stay
I won't be crying, I don't have the time
Better keep my head on straight, 'cause I'm walking the line

Don't wanna fall
Remember don't look down
Don't wanna fall
Remember don't look down
Don't look down

Getting kinda scared but you see, I'm here just the same
Gonna face the day, 'cause there's no one else I can blame
I got my trouble, I'll get it over and done
I'll never get too far if I keep trying to run

Don't wanna fall
Remember don't look down
Don't wanna fall
Remember don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down
