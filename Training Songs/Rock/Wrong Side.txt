Got you on the wrong side of me
Went and had my mind made up so suddenly
And it's bein' hungry when you can't take the fall away

Got you on the phone guiltin' me
Thinkin' how you looked at me so eagerly
But it was some of them kids in the city playin'

Ended up at home on empty with the windows down
Tryin' to say everything but knowin' you
I'd hate to see you lookin' so down

Wish you weren't so tied to me but you are
Sooner than it happens to all that you are
Right on my way home

Still in my mind won't you give us a call?
Summer's so fine I don't need you at all
Right you so said, "Yeah"

Ended up at home on empty with the windows down
Every time I look at you
I see you just like lookin' through the windows downtown

Ended up at home on empty with the windows down
Tryin' to say everything but knowin' you
I?d hate to see you lookin' so down

Got you on the wrong side of me
Went and had my mind made up so suddenly
And it?s bein' hungry when you can't take the fall away

And it saw this willin' to kill the rest of the day
I try to look at you that way it drives me, hey, oh, ah

Ended up at home on empty with the windows down
Every time I look at you
I see you just like lookin' through the windows downtown

Ended up at home on empty with the windows down
Tryin' to say everything but knowin' you
I?d hate to see you lookin' so down
