It's too hard to begin 
When you know it will end
And if you've got a friend
You better leave with him

When everyone wants to dance, I can't stand up
I know that I need love, 
But I can't pretend, I can't pretend

One day the moon will set for the last time
Maybe we'll become part of a mountain
We've always learned these things
You know I'm not crying
But you know I'm not trying to care

It's too hard to begin 
When you know it will end
And if you've got a friend
You better leave with him

When everyone wants to dance, I can't stand up
I know that I need love
But I can't pretend, I can't pretend
I can't pretend

Remember when you first touched my hand
We sparkled inside at the same time
And now it doesn't even matter

It's too hard to begin 
When you know it will end
And if you've got a friend
You better leave with him

When everyone wants to dance, I can't stand up
I know that I need love
But I can't pretend, I can't pretend
I can't pretend

I see us high, high on a mountain
I see us die, dying in a mountain

It's too hard to begin 
When you know it will end

I see us high, high on a mountain
I see us die, dying in a mountain
