Hey Mae, hey Mae
Won't you come on out, and let's play
Please say, okay
I say today is a good day
Hey Mae, today is a good day
Hey Mae, today is a good day to play
I asked the weather man
How does the weather stand
He said the sun is a-gonna shine
And I said, that'll be fine
Hey Mae, hey Mae
Won't you come on out, and let's play
Please say, okay
I say today is a good day
Hey Mae, today is a good day
Hey Mae, today is a good day to play

Hey Mae, hey Mae
Won't you come on out, and let's play
Please say, okay
I say today is a good day
Hey Mae, today is a good day
Hey Mae, today is a good day to play
We'll drink a soda pop
Go to the record hop
Where we can do the bop
Till we're about to flop
Hey Mae, hey Mae
Won't you come on out, and let's play
Please say, okay
I say today is a good day
Hey Mae, today is a good day
Hey Mae, today is a good day to play
