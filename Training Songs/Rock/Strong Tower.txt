Strong and mighty, strong to save us
Like a fortress never failing
Strong in battle, strong in kindness
When we stray, Lord, You're strong to find us

When the winds come hard against us
You are steadfast, You are true
When the ground beneath us trembles
Your foundation never moves

Strong tower, high and glorious
Strong tower, mighty in love
Our refuge, our defender
Strong tower, Lord, above

Strong to lead us through the shadows
Strong to carry all our sorrows
When the enemy surrounds us, closing in as darkness falls
Though his armies rage against us, they can never scale these walls

Strong tower, high and glorious
Strong tower, mighty in love
Our refuge, our defender
Strong tower, Lord, above

You are my shelter, my shield
You are the home I could never deserve
Here I will serve, ever under Your gaze
Here I will serve, ever singing Your praise

Strong tower, high and glorious
Strong tower, mighty in love
Our refuge, our defender
Strong tower, Lord, above

Strong tower, high and glorious
Strong tower, mighty in love
Our refuge, our defender
Strong tower, Lord, above

Strong tower, Lord, above
Strong tower, Lord, above
