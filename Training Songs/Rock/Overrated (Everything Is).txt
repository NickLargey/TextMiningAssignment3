Maybe I'm jaded and bored
Always lookin' for more
Waiting around for the next big fix
I know
I'm a wreck I'm a mess
But I couldn't care less
Don't know what it would take to change me

Every body is so afraid to be different
Please excuse me now if I don't get it

I think sex is overrated
So is always getting wasted
Designer drugs and dead end jobs and
Classic rock is so outdated
I'm so sick of therapy and all the things it's done to me
How can I be satisfied when everything is overrated?

Maybe the problem is me
But I won't make believe
And I can't take this mediocrity
What if this is a test and I deserve what I get
Will I wake up with all the answers?

Every body is too afraid to be different
Please excuse me now if I don't listen

I think sex is overrated
So is always getting wasted
Designer drugs and dead-end jobs and
Classic rock is so outdated
I'm so sick of therapy and all the things it's done to me
How can I be satisfied when everything is overrated?

Wo-oh

When everything is overrated

Wo-oh

When everything is overrated

Can't stand the normal
Can't stand the ordinary
Find me anything
That's extraordinary
Show me something
Show me anything
Am I the only one?
Am I the only one?

I think sex is overrated
So is always getting wasted
All my friends and family
They make my life so complicated
I'm so sick of apathy and TV show reality
How can I be satisfied when everything is overrated?

Wo-oh
