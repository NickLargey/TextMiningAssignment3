I've got something to tell you, I'm in love
I've been longing to tell you, I'm in love
You'll believe me, when I tell you
I'm in love with you

You're my kind of girl
You make me feel proud
You make me want to shout aloud
Yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love

Ev'ry night I can't sleep, thinking of you
And ev'ry little thing that you do
Yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love

Oh yeh, I'm sittin' on the top of the world
I'm in love with a wonderful girl
And I never felt so good before
If this is love, give me more, more, more, more

Ev'ry night I can't sleep, thinking of you
And ev'ry little thing that you do
Yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love

Oh yeh, I'm sittin' on the top of the world
I'm in love with a wonderful girl
And I never felt so good before
If this is love, give me more, more, more, more

Ev'ry night I can't sleep, thinking of you
And ev'ry little thing that you do
Yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love

Yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love

Yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love, in love

Yes, I'm telling all my friends, I'm in love
