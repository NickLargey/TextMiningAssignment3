You 
Gave me your word.
And now that your word
Doesn't mean that much
To me,
And in 
The silence,
I can hear
The truth ring loud and clear:
I never meant
That much
To you,
And it seems
A whisper to a scream
Was all that we knew.
Before the talk is through
I'm telling you...
[Chorus]
No more words tonight.
No more words.
I don't ever want to hear
You say you love me
One more time.
No more words tonight.
No more words.
I'll forever keep the silence,
And you can keep
Your lies.
You try
To throw me
One last line;
To throw me
One last time,
But now I guess
I'm wise to you.
And vows
Spoken
In the night
Are broken in the lights.
What you recite,
I have heard before,
So say no more.
[Chorus]
The dialogue is over.
I see your lips move,
But you don't make a sound.
You've lost what I have found.
A voice inside of me that sets me free.
[Chorus]
