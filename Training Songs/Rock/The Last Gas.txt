It's the way I feel
It's the way I feel
I'm in your hand, do as we planned
Show me the way you kneel
Don't you kneel, it's the way I feel
Hungry for thirst
Full fit to burst
Give me a go at the wheel
Cause I, I just don't know which way I should turn
Look around my friend we'll leave them all behind
I'm gonna take a look at all the things I find
So take a bow, leave me out.
It's the way I feel
It's the way I feel
I'm in your hand, do as we planned
Show me the way you kneel
Don't you kneel
It's the way I feel hungry for thirst
Full fit to burst
Give me, give me a go at the wheel
Last gas
Last gas
Last gas
Last gas
Look around my friend we'll leave them all behind
I'm gonna take a look at all the things I find
So take a bow, leave me out
Last gas
Last gas
Last gas
Last gas
Look around, look around, look around your mind
Look around, look around, look around your mind
Look around, look around, look around your mind
Look around, look around, look around your mind
