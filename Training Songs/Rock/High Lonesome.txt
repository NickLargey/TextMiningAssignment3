Just you and me and a little white pup
Sittin' here waiting for the sun to come up
To keep the chill away

Drinkin' our coffee at the first crack of dawn
Watchin' a doe while she nuzzles her fawn
It's my favorite time of day

High lonesome
God don't ever let this mountain change
High lonesome
I hope you will always stay the same

Sometimes in the evening when it's all kind of still
Sweet mountain music floats over the hill
On a laurel scented breeze

Sometimes when the night birds are scolding the mist
I think I might know where Heaven is
It's just above the trees

High lonesome
God don't ever let this mountain change
High lonesome
I hope you will always stay the same

Watchin' my summertimes turn in to falls
Seein' my song growing honest and tall
Keeps me satisfied

If I live forever or I die today
All I would ask is you just let me lay here
On this mountainside

High lonesome
High lonesome
High lonesome
