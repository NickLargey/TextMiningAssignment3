Yeah, into the mists of time and space
Where we have no say, over date and place, oh yeah
Don't get embarrassed if it happens a lot
That you don't know how you started
Or where you're gonna stop, oh, yeah

And if at times it seems insane, all the tears in searching
Turning all your joy to pain, in pursuit of learning
Buy a dream and hideaway, can't escape the sorrow
Your mojo will have no effect, as we head into tomorrow

Round and round like a twisted wheel
Spinning in attempt to find the feel, the feel
Find the path that will help us find
A feeling of control over lives and minds, oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And if at times it seems insane, all the tears in searching
Turning all your joy to pain, in pursuit of learning
Buy a dream and hideaway, can't escape the sorrow
Your mojo will have no effect, as we head into tomorrow

Yeah, yeah, yeah
And if at times it seems insane, all the tears in searching
Turning all your joy to pain, in pursuit of learning
Pray and act it will connect, can't escape the sorrow
Your mojo will have no effect, as we head

Into the stars and always up
Drinking from a broken cup
Whose golden gleam is fading fast
Praying that it has not passed

Oh, into tomorrow, oh yeah
Into tomorrow, oh, yeah
Oh, into tomorrow, oh
Into tomorrow, oh
Into tomorrow, oh
Into tomorrow, oh
