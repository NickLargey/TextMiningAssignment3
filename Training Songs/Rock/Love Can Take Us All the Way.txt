Here we are, the moment has arrived
Time is finally on our side
Every whisper is breathing on the fire

Where do we go'
All the way,
From here
It's not far
How do we know'
It's a case of taking heart
Where do we go'
All the way,
Too far
Don't be afraid
Tell me how far
Love can take us all the way

Reckless love, it gives too much too soon
Still, what I feel is wrapped up in you
But hearts don't beg when they're only passing through

Where do we go'
All the way,
From here
It's not far
How do we know'
It's a case of taking heart
Where do we go'
All the way,
To love
Don't be afraid
Tell me how far
Love can take us all the way

The way your love is filled with broken dreams 
Of those who didn't take it all the way

All the way
From here
It's not far
How do we know'
It's a case of taking heart

Where do we go'
All the way,
From here
It's not far
How do we know'
It's a case of taking heart

Where do we go'
All the way,
To love
Don't be afraid
Tell me how far
Love can take us all the way

Where do we go'
All the way,
From here
It's not far
How do we know'
It's a case of taking heart

Where do we go'
All the way,
To love
Don't be afraid
Tell me how far
Love can take us all the way
