Said purple haze let's kiss the sky
I won't beg but I can't lie
I tell you what we gonna do
We're gonna X-Rate this love
Do it over like a Re-run
And girl you know you want it too
S-O-U-L

I'm a soul machine, I'll teach you what I mean
You got to sweat enough to feel this love
I got to get you close to me
I'm a soul machine, I'll take you to your dreams
You got to sweat enough to feel this love
I got to keep you close to me
S-O-U-L machine, machine

Turn off the sun turn on the night
If you can rock then you can ride
I tell you what we gonna do
We're gonna escalate this buzz
Do it over just because
I lose myself inside of you
S-O-U-L

I'm a soul machine, I'll teach you what I mean
You got to sweat enough to feel this love
I got to get you close to me
I'm a soul machine, I'll take you to your dreams
You got to sweat enough to feel this love
I got to keep you close to me

I'm a soul machine, I'll teach you what I mean
You got to sweat enough to feel this love
I got to get you close to me
I'm a soul machine, I'll take you to your dreams
You got to sweat enough to feel this love
I got to keep you close to me

I'm a soul machine, I'll teach you what I mean
You got to sweat enough to feel this love
I got to get you close to me
I'm a soul machine, I'll take you to your dreams
You got to sweat enough to feel this love
I got to keep you close to me

S-O-U-L machine
I'm a soul machine
S-O-U-L machine (I'm a soul machine)
I'm a soul machine
