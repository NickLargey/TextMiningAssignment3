(That beat, that beat, that beat)
Eastern calls from way out wherever
Away I go, anchored in that beat
Thirsting for us too, three's a no man, but

[Chorus]
Remember, call that beat
Remember, call that beat

Finger lead them up, crime to rape the beat
Thirsting for us too, three's a no man, but

[Chorus: x2]

Finger lead them up (up), crime to rape the beat
Thirsting for us too (too), three's a no man, but

[Chorus: x2]
