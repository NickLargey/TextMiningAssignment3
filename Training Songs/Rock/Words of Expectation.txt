These are the words of expectation
These are the words of success, expectation
From a pleasing mog
From a pleasing pan
Every now and then I would like to try something like this
It is the modicum of my career
[I would like at the bottom of my..]
These are the words of expectation
These are the words of success, expectation
[Middle right or to the left
I have tears I shed tears
And I am here to enable everybody..]
The whole world is large, and whatever it is
The whole trend is effective
Whether middle, right or to the left
I have tears, I shed fears, I have tears, I have fears
And I am here to enable everybody to say yes, no
Or I don't know even
Like Leicester Polytechnic
Is scheisse, is scheisse
These are the words of success, expectation
These are the words of dead direction
[Clubs for the storks
The vision is top of the clubs
Paddy McGinty's goat]
I would like deep down
At the bottom of my odour, lingering, my heart and soul
To see the government wrecked
And my LPs roll
[The government's right and my LPs wrong]
These are the words of success, expectation
These are the words of complete disorientation
Think of him I was in a fix
But I show you now get out of it
Looks like an AWOL predic.
But I'll worm worm right out of it
I'm the head wrangler
They all come and it won't be long
And the roof of my mouth sticks to the tip of my tongue
I'm the head wrangler
The trials drawn out and long
When the cell door slams I won't be the one
I'm the head wrangler
I'm proud of the way I've avoided prison
If we carry on like this we're gonna end up like King Crimson
I'm the head wrangler
To please is the curse at worse
At parties I'm bitter
Get presented
Am bitter - a civilian policeman
Five smiles - I'm bitter
Get presented
With the pence, the reckless pence
Go to aid Halifax copter
To please is the curse and nurse
To please is the curse at worst
I'm the head wrangler
Think of him I was in a fix
But I'll show you now get out of it
Looks like an AWOL predicament
But I'll worm my way right out of it
I'm the head wrangler
These are the words of dead direction
Wrap it up.
