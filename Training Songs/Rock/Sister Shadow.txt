Here she comes now sister in shadow
Lights up my day 'til there's no tomorrow
Almond eyes set in olive skin,
Betray the anger burnin' white within
There she goes dumbin' down for them all
And speakin' in code when sufferin' is calling
When the city's steppin' out to play
She cuts a dash in tenement grey
Her memory lingers then fades and turns to black
Slippin' through my fingers, shiftin' shape and doublin' back

What you gonna do when the bells are ringin'
Happiness and joy and the birds are singin'
For you sister shadow and it's all so dutiful
Where you gonna go when the city is swingin'
Really reelin' and you're feelin' like it's so unreal
Sweet, sweet nothings loud and clear, sister shadow

Here she comes now sister of shiva
Dark destroyer, holy deceiver
I feel her rising as you're drawing near
Look in your eyes i see her shadow appear
Love is blind, it's a one way twistin' track
She's always behind me but there's no turnin' back

What you gonna do when the bells are ringin'
Happiness and joy and the birds are singin'
For you sister shadow and it's all so dutiful
Where you gonna go when the city is swingin'
Really reelin' and you're feelin' like it's so unreal
Sweet, sweet nothings loud and clear, sister shadow
