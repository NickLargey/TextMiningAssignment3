There's this little girl
And I think she's so fine
And I'm not giving up
Until she is mine
See, I want to be her boy
And I want her to be my girl
Because since I met her
I've been in another world

She was just my friend
And now I want more
There's something special to her
She's not just another whore
I said...

What's the di-di-di-dillio, dillio
What's the di-di-di-dill, dill
What's the di-di-di-dillio, dillio
What's the di-di-di-dill, dill
What's the di-di-di-dillio, dillio
What's the di-di-di-dill, dill
What's the di-di-di-dillio, dillio
What's the di-di-di-dill (dill)
		

See, everybody else 
Has gotten involved
That's not the way 
This should have evolved
I should have just told you
How I felt
But when I'm around you
My words just melt

She was just my friend
And now I want more
There's something special to her
She's not just another whore

What's the di-di-di-dillio, dillio
What's the di-di-di-dill, dill
What's the di-di-di-dillio, dillio
What's the di-di-di-dill, dill
What's the di-di-di-dillio, dillio
What's the di-di-di-dill, dill
What's the di-di-di-dillio, dillio
What's the di-di-di-dill (dill)

She was just my friend
And now I want more
There's something special to her
She's not just another whore
She was just my friend
And now I want more
There's something special to her
She's not...
