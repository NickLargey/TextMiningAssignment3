Here comes this feeling like a dark cloud
Chokes me and lures me into self doubt
Here comes the shadow of my melancholy
It creeps up like a shiver in a cool breeze

There’s a new moon on the horizon
And a new day, new day
There’s a new me emerging
In a new way, new way

Goodbye to all you petty little worries, yeah
Goodbye to you sweet sorrow and pain

There’s a new moon on the horizon
And a new day, new day
There’s a new me emerging
In a new way, new way, yeah

Shake me, spin me around 
And make me see what’s real
Take me up to the edge of all
I need to see 

There’s a new moon on the horizon
And a new day, new day
There’s a new me oh emerging
In a new way, new way

There's a new moon on the horizon
And a new day, new day
There's a new me oh emerging
In a new way, new way

New moon on the horizon, new moon
