So tired of waiting I walked an empty land
I was looking for something to help me understand
But bad luck kept turning my dreams into sand
I didn't want pity, I had my share of friends
I wanted somebody more special than the rest
I was aching inside like I was approaching the end
Just about that moment the timing was so right
You appeared like a vision sent down to my life
I thought I was dreaming when I saw you that night

That's when love walked in through my door
That familiar feeling I had once before
love walked in through my door
And it felt so strange

It's hard to remember being on my own
That kind of loving makes a hard man lose control
But I sleep so much better now I'm not alone
So promise me baby you're always gonna stay
I don't think I could take it seeing you walk away
You don't need to doubt it, I remember that day

That's when love walked in through my door
That familiar feeling I had once before
love walked in through my door
And it felt so strange
Like a long lost friend that hadn't changed
Giving me hope again

Love walked in
Love walked in

Just about that moment the timing was so right
You appeared like a vision sent down to my life
I thought I was dreaming when I saw you that night
