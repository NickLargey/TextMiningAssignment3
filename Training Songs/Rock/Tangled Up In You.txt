What in the world were you thinking of last summer 
What was the price you paid in silver and gold 
Well I might be wrong but I've got such a surprise for you 
Am I wrong to tell you that I'm over you 
What can I do to make my dreams all come true 
What can I say to make the cruel world go away 
Am I wrong to tell you that I'm over you 
Am I wrong to tell you that I'm over you 
You know I've been waiting a long time 
You know I've been waiting a long time, tangled up in you 
The truth is only one step behind 

Tangled up in you 
What was the word that he used to make you his own 
What was the line that made you succumb to his will 
Am I wrong to tell you that I'm over you 
And I wrong to tell you that I'm over you 
You know I've been waiting a long time - tangled up in you 
You know I've been waiting a long time 
The truth is only one step behind 
Tangled up in you 

Tangled up in you 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
You know I've been waiting a long time, tangled up in you 
You know I've been waiting a long time 
The truth is only one step behind 
Tangled up in you 
I'm lost and I'm lonely and I want you to hold me, yeah yeah 
The truth is only one step behind 
Tangled up in you
