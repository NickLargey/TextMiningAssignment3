New York City, so cold and so damp, & people are dressed so funky
Let's leave Chicago alone with bitter clouds
That town's a little bit too rugged, for you and me, girl

Rollin' down the Imperial Highway, nasty little redhead at my side
Santa Ana wind blowin' hot from the north, yeah we was born to ride
Gonna roll down the window, put down the top
Crank up The Beach Boys, baby, don't let the music stop
We're gonna ride it till we just can't ride it no more

From the South Bay 2 the Valley, from the West Side 2 the East Side
Everybody's very happy 'cause the sun is shining all the time
Looks like another perfect day
I love L.A., I love L.A., you love L.A., I love L.A.

West Side to the East Side, South Bay to the Valley
Now rolls in Hollywood, yeah, I love it

Look at that mountain, look at those trees
Look at that bum over there, man, down on his knees, oh
Check out those women
There?s nothin' like em anywhere (you can?t seem them, man)

(Century Boulevard) I love it (Victory Boulevard) I love it
(Santa Monica Boulevard, ooh) I love it (Sixth Street) I love it

From the South Bay 2 the Valley, from the West Side 2 the East Side
Everybody's very happy, 'cause the sun is shining all the time
Looks like another perfect day...Do you love L.A.?
