Got so lost that I went to church
Sorry God but you made it worse
Made me sit behind a fence
Haunted by the evidence

I guess you don't want me to think
So instead I'll dream and drink
Got too drunk to drive home
In the cab I grabbed my phone

And made a call I might regret
To a girl that I just met
Lately things are not okay
I just wanted to hear somebody say

If you need a reason as to why you're here
You don't need to look farther then me
If you need a reason as to why you're here
You don't need to look farther then me

Lovely, lovely quiet lake
How could this be a mistake
Too dark now to see your face
Your hair is blowing all over the place

The moon is caught in a frozen glass
It could not let this moment pass
The sun is waiting far away
Until I've had a chance to say

All that's missing, all that's lost
Every hope at any cost
Every dream too good to come true
Floods my heart when I'm with you

And if you need a reason as to why you're here
You don't need to look farther then me
If you need a reason as to why you're here
You don't need to look farther then me

Got so lost that I went to church
Sorry God but you made it worse
Made me sit behind a fence
Haunted by the evidence

I guess you don't want me to think
So instead I'll dream and drink
Got too drunk to drive home
In the cab I grabbed my phone

And made a call I might regret
To a girl that I just met
Lately things are not okay
I just wanted to hear somebody say

If you need a reason as to why you're here
You don't need to look farther then me, oh
If you need a reason as to why you're here
You don't need to look farther then me, oh

If you need a reason as to why you're here
You don't need to look farther then me, oh
If you need a reason as to why you're here
You don't need to look farther then me
