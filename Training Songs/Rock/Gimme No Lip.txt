I got some big six-shooters
Packed up on my steed
And only take 'em off
Unless I got some flesh to feed
Intimidation to the max
Is what'll do it to me
I'll rip it right and rip it left
Just to make your heart bleed

Layin' down in the dirt
A big bottle of wine
Rather listen to some blues
Or love a woman 'til she's blind
Got a lot of time to waste
On shining my big guns
When I ride into your town
You and your sister want some fun

I'm looking for a Juliet to take my cowboy blues away
The ten blue broken hearts behind me they're not mine
I'm a gunfighter looking for love
Gunfighter for love
Gunfighter for love
Gunfighter for love

I'm a six for all-American kid
My serial number's one nine seven six
Born down south where barbed wire plays
Where my parents met is in the U.S. of A.

Legendary, gunfighter
Buckshot, point-blank
Fast aim, six-shooter
Trail blazer, gunslinger
Pistol packin', rough rider
Wanted man, coach robber
Shot drinkin' cowboy
Gunfighter for love

I got some big six-shooters

And I only take 'em off

Intimidation to the max

I'll rip it right rip it left
Just to make your heart bleed
