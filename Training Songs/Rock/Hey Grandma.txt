Hey Grandma, you're so young
Your old man's just a boy
It's been a long time but this time
Bye bye bye
It's been a long time but this time
Bye bye bye
It's been a long time
This time round, this time round
Everything's upside-down, upside-down
It's gonna be good, you're looking so good
It's gonna be good

Hey except for these things on my mind
They're all sins, it's just a waste of time
But we're gonna have this time
Bye bye bye
But we're gonna have this time
Bye bye bye
But we're gonna have this time round
This time round
Everything's upside-down, upside-down
It's gonna be good, You're looking so good
It's gonna be good

**Oh... will make me feel so fine
Oh.....

(*repeat)

(repeat)
(repeat)
A long time this time round, this time round
Everything is upside-down, upside-down
