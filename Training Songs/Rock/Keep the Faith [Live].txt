Mother mother tell your children
Their time has just begun
I have suffered for my anger
These wars can't be won

Father father believe me
I am laying down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me, forgive your wayward son

Everybody needs somebody to love
Everybody needs somebody

Faith you know you're gonna live through the rain
Gotta keep the faith
Don't you let love turn to hate
Gotta keep the faith keep the faith

Tell me baby when I hurt you
Do you keep it all inside
Do you tell me all's forgiven
And hide behind your pride

Everybody needs somebody to love
Everybody needs somebody

Faith you know you're gonna live through the rain
Keep the faith, though you know its never too late
Keep the faith don't let love turn to hate
You gotta keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith

Faith you know you're gonna live through the rain
Keep the faith don't let love turn to hate
Keep the faith you know you're gonna live through the rain
Keep the faith, though you know it's never too late
Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith

Everybody needs somebody to love
Everybody needs somebody

Mother mother tell your children
Everybody keep the faith
Father father, please believe me
Everybody needs, everybody
Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith
