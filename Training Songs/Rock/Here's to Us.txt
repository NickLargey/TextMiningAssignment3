We could just go home right now
Or maybe we could stick around
For just one more drink, oh yeah
Get another bottle out
Lets shoot the shit
Sit back down
For just one more drink, oh yeah

Here's to us, here's to love
All the times that we fucked up
Here's to you, fill the glass
'Cause the last few days have kicked my ass
So lets give 'em hell
Wish everybody well, here's to us, here's to us

Stuck it out this far together
Put our dreams through the shredder
Let’s toast 'cause things got better
And everything could change like that
And all these years go by so fast
But nothing lasts forever

Here's to us, here's to love
All the times, that we messed up
Here's to you, fill the glass
'Cause the last few nights have kicked my ass
If they give ya hell
Tell em to go f*ck themselves, here's to us, here's to us

Here's to all that we kissed
And to all that we missed
To the biggest mistakes
That we just wouldn’t trade
To us breaking up
Without us breaking down
To whatever's comin' our way

Here's to us, here's to love
All the times that we fucked up
Here's to you, fill the glass
'Cause the last few days have kicked my ass
So lets give 'em hell
Wish everybody well

Here's to us, here's to love
All the times, that we messed up
Here's to you, fill the glass
'Cause the last few nights have kicked my ass
If they give ya hell
Tell em to go f*ck themselves, here's to us, here's to us (Go f*ck themselves)
Here's to us, here's to us
Here's to us, here's to us
Here’s to us, here’s to love
Here’s to us, wish everybody well
Here’s to us, here’s to love
Here’s to us, here’s to us
