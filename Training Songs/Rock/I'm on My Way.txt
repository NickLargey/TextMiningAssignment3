The night was dark
The moon was low
Believe me,
And I was proud
To have a girl like you.
The next day she
Was gone
Oh what a pity,
And now I spend
My days with searching you.

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
To Bali Bali.
I'm on my way

I'm on my way
To Mexico.
I'm on my way

I'm on my way
To New York City.
I'm on my way
To find the treasure of my soul.

I think that I
Shall never find
My darling.
I think that I
Will search my whole
Life through.
No place to hide
And so I keep on travelin'
No place to hide
Until that I found you.

Hey hey
I'm on my way
Oh oh oh
Hey hey
I'm on my way.
A ha ha
Hey hey
I'm on my way
Oh ho ho
Hey hey
I'm on my way
A ha ha
