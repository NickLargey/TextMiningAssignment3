Indeed there's such a thing as ghosts
More to cause you fear
You never know just where or when
But surely they'll appear

Quiet men turn into wolves
During certain moons
And sirens sing their siren songs
Sweet and deadly tunes

We're here to tell you
All of this is real
And if you're terrified today
It's how you're supposed to feel
For real
We're here to tell you
Ghosts are here for good
And if this doesn't terrify you
It should, it should

Don't you know the feeling
When blood has left your veins
Horsemen of apocalypse
Ride through poison rains

The devil's in the details
And in the grand design
And once he gets your number
He calls you all the time

We're here to tell you
All of this is real
And if you're terrified today
It's how you're supposed to feel
(For real)

We're here to tell you
Ghosts are here for good
And if this doesn't terrify you
It should, it should!
