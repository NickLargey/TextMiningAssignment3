Walking under skies
Waiting for the fall
Meet me at the cornershop
I'll show you it all
Free you of your mind
Something you wont find
In the west-end pages
With your google dirty fingers

It's a skin dive
In deep silence we are
Going underwater
It's a lifeline
Teardrop, bullets, all night
Dip into the water

Baby, that's what it feels like
When you come up for air
When you come up for air
You feel brand new
When you come up for air
When you come up for air
That's what it feels like
When you come up for air
When you come up for air
You feel brand new
When you come up for air
When you come up for air

Wipe us of the face
Of the human race
Whichever way you look
It's indisposed or disgraced
Fighting on the shore
The hoi polloi want more
Howling bloody murder
But it's nothing just a murmur

In your skin dive
In deep silence we are
Going underwater
It's a lifeline
Teardrop, bullets, all night
Slip into the water

Baby....that's what it feels like

When you come up for air
When you come up for air
You feel brand new
When you come up for air
When you come up for air
That's what it feels like
When you come up for air
When you come up for air
You feel brand new
When you come up for air
When you come up for air

A blushing rose is torn
From these sugar walls
I've misplaced my future
Could I please borrow yours?
Panic on the scene
You know what I mean
Anything you want to be
The only thing you want from me

Is skin dive
In deep silence we are
Going underwater
It's a lifeline
Teardrop, bullets, all night
Go inside the water

Babygirl you're swimming
A little too deep
So deep... That I think you might hit a reef
I think you low on oxygen
And you're too glad to leave
Babygirl swim to the top
Grab my hand and hold me and breathe

Baby... That's what it feels like
When you come up for air
When you come up for air
You feel brand new
When you come up for air
When you come up for air
That's what it feels like
When you come up for air
When you come up for air
You feel brand new
When you come up for air
When you come up for air
