Hurry up, don't slow down
Pick a time, don't let hands pull you down
If you're waiting

Have it up, move along
Say goodbye, don't let words stay too long
If you're leaving

It read, we missed you
Between the lines it said
Hold it high with a smile
Speak out loud with the mind of a child
If you're lucky

It read, we missed you
Between the lines it said
Hurry up

We really must be going, there's no time to delay
We have to leave a message because we can't stay
It really is important so remember take care
Please keep on moving 'cause there's nobody there

It read, we missed you
Between the lines it said
We've waited for so long
But now it's time
To keep moving along

Here and there are the signs
On the road give way to stop and go
When you're moving

It read, we missed you between the lines
It said, we've waited for so long
But now it's time
To keep moving along

Keep moving, you've got to keep moving
Keep, keep, you've got to keep moving

Keep moving, you've got to keep moving
Keep, keep, you've got to keep moving

To keep moving along
