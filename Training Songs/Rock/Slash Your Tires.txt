No point in screaming
Cause I'm only dreaming
That you came to pieces
And I came in peace
You're always loaded
Your life has imploded
Nine weeks of hell, man
But I'm feeling swell

And in my dreams I slash your tires
And in my dreams I set these fires
And all your fears, it's nothing new
And all your tears, they won't help you

You're always posin
And I was imposin
But I turned the tables
And I'm feeling fine
You're always loaded
Your life has imploded
Nine weeks of hell, man
But I'm feelin swell

And in my dreams I slash your tires
And in my dreams I set these fires
And all your fears, it's nothing new
And all your tears, they won't help you
And all your fears, it's nothing new
And all your tears, they won't help you
