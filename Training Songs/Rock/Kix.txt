All around the world you go
All around the world you go
All around the world you go
The more you go, the less you know, hey baby
You'll never stand a chance

All you're lookin' for is somebody to feed you
All you're lookin' for is something in the air
All you're gettin' are some trash to breathe
The more you leave, the more we love you baby
Why should you stand a chance?

All that you love, all that you need
You came in for KIX
All that you love, all that you need
You came in for KIX

You're a super accident, you're a major accident
Everybody's tryin' to pay the rent
