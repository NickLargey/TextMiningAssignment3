Now I see you and you laugh, my friend 
"Didn`t I tell you so," you say 
I just want to be alone, my friend 
Will you please just go away 

Today goes on like any other day 
It doesn`t know, it doesn`t care 
Never knew what loneliness could mean, 
having love and then despair 

[Chorus]
Goodbye tomorrow, I`m leaving you today 
Goodbye tomorrow, 
Don`t you be grieving `cause I`m leaving 
It won`t matter to you anyway 

Now it`s over What am I to do 
Will I find the love of you 
Can I be sure she`ll know what loving means 
Can someone else love like you 

[Chorus] 

Goodbye tomorrow, I`m leaving you today
