Should I close my eyes so I don't see your smile
Would it be a clever thing to do
And should I stay away from you for a little while
Should I leave it all behind

[Chorus]
When you are giving me salvation just like someone heaven sent
This wasn't meant to be baby can't you see
This is an open invitation for the beginning of the end
Though I'm flying now, I'm gonna be crying over you

Should I stop dancing on the edge of a knife
Would it be a clever thing to do
Should I lock my door should I stop kissing life
Should I get rid of you

[Chorus]

This love is forbidden fruit (baby just stop looking at me)
I should have cut you off by the root (this love just wasn't meant to be)

[Chorus]
