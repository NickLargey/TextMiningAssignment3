Why don't you dream anymore
What's in the way
How come you point to the door
And ask me to stay
Why don't you flash that smile
Like you used to do
Why don't you stay for a while
Uh well it's up to you, 'cause

You are the girl
That keeps me up at night
You are the girl
That makes me feel all right
You are the girl
Well you give me a twirl
You are the girl
In my dreams

Why don't ya talk anymore
What did I say
How is it what I came for
Is floating away
Why don't you flash that smile
Like you used to do
Why don't you stay for a while
Uh well it's up to you, 'cause

You are the girl
That keeps me up at night
You are the girl
That makes me feel all right
You are the girl
(You are the girl)
Well you give me a twirl
(You are the girl)
(You are the girl)
In my dreams

Why don't you dream anymore
What's in the way
How come you point to the door
And ya ask me to stay
Why don't you flash that smile
Like you used to do
Why don't you stay for a while
Oh 'cause it's up to you, 'cause

You are the girl
That keeps me up at night
You are the girl
That makes me feel all right
(You are the girl)

Oh you give me a twirl

In my dreams
