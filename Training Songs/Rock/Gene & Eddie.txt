Well be bop a lula she's my baby 
Well be bop a lula summertime blues 
Well it's something else man and you can't lose 
I'm gonna race with the devil and maybe I'll win 
And I'm gonna dance with skinny Jim 
Well hang on tight you better get ready 
We're gonna rock with Gene and Eddie 

Halleluja I love her so 
Bee I bickey bop bo bo go 
Cut across shorty you can't fail 
She got a red blue jeans and a pony tail 

Well hang on tight man you better get ready 
Cause we're gonna rock with Gene and Eddie 

Well come on everybody let's get together tonight 
Say mama can I go out tonight 
Well I sure miss you and the twenty flight rock 
Get your dungarees on let's a blue jean bop 

Well hang on tight you better get ready 
Cause we're gonna rock with Gene and Eddie 
Well hang on tight boys you better get ready 
We're gonna rock with Gene and Eddie 
Well hang on tight you better get ready 
We're gonna rock with Gene and Eddie
