So somebody's told you how to be a man
Just f*ck 'em and leave 'em
And score as many as you can
But always have someone who's close to your heart

And if you want to keep her, keep her in the dark
'Cause you love her
So you just can't tell her
Yet that's a lie and you know full well

You have to pay the price of admission
You have to pay the price of admission
You have to pay the price of admission
Sometime in your life
Somewhere along the line

And now she tells you she's fucked others too
She didn't spend those nights
Waiting in on you
But though she gave her all, she never gave her heart

And she wants to keep you so she cannot keep it dark
'Cause she loves you
So she has to open wide
She lets you in up close and blows away your pride

And you have to pay the price of admission
You have to pay the price of admission
You have to pay the price of admission
This time in your life

And lay it on the line
You have to pay the price of admission
You have to pay the price of admission
You have to pay the price of admission

So somebody showed you how to be a man...
