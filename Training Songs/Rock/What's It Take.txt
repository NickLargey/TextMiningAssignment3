(Robert Palmer)

You're lonely can I see you
I hire a private red-eye rocket
But when I walk in here
You want to go through all my pockets

What's it take?
Mamma what's it take?

I've known you all these years
And still you overhaul my letters
They don't confirm your fears
But when I'm dead you'll know me better

What's it take?
Mamma what's it take?

My mistake was thinking I had it covered
I haven't made the first move
What's it take to get it through to you mamma?
What does it take to love you?

I take you out to dinner
You ask me why I'm acting guilty
I thought I'd backed a winner
This love affair is gonna kill me

What's it take?
Mamma what's it take?

You say you're only teasing
I want to try a new position
You want to know the reason
I've got a Spanish Inquisition

What's it take?
Mamma what's it take?

My mistake was thinking I had it covered
I haven't made the first move
What's it take to get it through to you mamma?
What does it take to love you?

I want to hear the gossip
You say I like a real ambition
I ask you if you've got it
You document my inhibitions

What's it take?
Mamma what's it take?
Mamma what's it take?
What's it take?
