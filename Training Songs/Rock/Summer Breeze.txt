Would you like to tell me
All the secrets that you know
Would you like to tell me
While you're thinking
I want to tell you
Everything I know

How hard I try
I'll not understand why
'Cause there's nobody here
Nobody here but me

How hard I see I'll not understand me
'Cause there's nobody here
Nobody here I see

Summer breeze
Whisper softly thro' the trees
Make my cares slip away
My thoughts drift away from view
Summer song
Make my day
Make it long
Help this world walk on by
On its natural avenue

Would you like to tell me
All the secrets that you know
Would you like to tell me
If you're asking
I want to tell you
Everything I know

How hard I try
I'll not understand why
'Cause there's nobody here
Only my love for you

Summer breeze, summer breeze
Summer song, summer song

How hard I see I'll not understand me
'Cause there's nobody here
Nobody here but me

Summer breeze
Whisper softly thro' the trees
Make my day slip away
My thoughts drift away from view
Summer song
Make my day
Make it long
Help this world walk on by
On its natural avenue

Summer breeze, summer breeze
Summer song, summer song
Summer breeze, summer breeze
