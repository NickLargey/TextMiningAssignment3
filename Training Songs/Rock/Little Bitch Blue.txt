You never take me out to party
You're a little bitch blue
The man wrote his story
He never took account of you

You give a lot of hurtin'
Honey you're too bad
And the way that you're goin'
You ain't ever gonna last

Some think I'm crazy
Grew up too soon
Red hot lover
Sending all her money too too too
