Victim
She can take you 
Anywhere she wants to
She can show you things,

That make you weak
She can make you think,
That you're the only one,
She can steal your heart,

With just one wink,
Why she'll hold ya tight,
And she won't let go, 
She'll make it last and she'll make it slow,

She tell you things that you should not know,
'Cause your the victim, the victim of love,
Framed by the night, touched by the glove,
Your the victim, the victim of love,

She can freeze you, when she doesn't want to talk,
She can work it on in, yea she can go take a walk,
She can have or leave it, she can do the skidoo,
Well you better believe it, She's having fun on you,

She can hold you tight,
And she won't let go,
She'll make it last and she'll make it slow,
She'll tell you things you should not know, 

'Cause your the victim, victim of love,
Framed by the night, touched by the glove,
Your the victim, victim of love,
That's right,

Oh When she's calling you out,
You better run to her-er,
When she's just falling out,
You'd better care,

Oh when she needs somebody,
Oh you better run to her-er,
Oh when she gives in too soon,
It's just not fair.

Oh well she'll hold you tight, 
And she won't let go,
She'll make it last and she'll make it last ,
And she'll make it slow-o,

She'll whisper things, 
You'd never know,
'Cause you the victim, yea,
Victim of love,

You're framed by the night,
And touched by love,
You're the victim,
Victim of love,
