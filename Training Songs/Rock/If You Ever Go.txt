If you ever put me down, I would fall right through the ground
Couldn't make it on my own, couldn't stay here all alone
And there would be no sun, and there would be no one to run to

[Chorus]
If you ever go
Honey, you'll never know
What it would do to me
The hurt would be new to me
If you could ever believe
The love I got up my sleeve
Then you would never go
Honey, don't ever go

If you ever said goodbye, I would want so much to die
All the world would look so grey; couldn't face another day
And there would be no sun, and there would be no one to run to

[Chorus]

And there would be no sun, and there would be no one to run to

[Chorus]
