(Words Willcox / Music Darlow)
Praying to the silent man
A new day dawns
Behind acetylene tanks
A dog's lament
Wakes the new age
But falls in splintered fragments
Around his cage
Like everyone said there'd be
So much more to nineteen eighty-four
Rebel run
Don't shoot your gun
Rebel run
Run run run
Now get down
And stay down
You've gotta learn
To kiss the ground
You see a city
Well watch it fall
We're the hobos
Of planet patrol
Lean machines
Colliding
Out of control
Rebel run
Don't shoot your gun
Rebel run
Run run run
Now get down
And stay down
You've gotta learn
To kiss the ground
You've gotta get away
You've gotta get away
Rebel
You've gotta get away
You've gotta stay away...
It's just a power game
It's just a power game
Rebel
You've gotta get away
You've gotta stay away
