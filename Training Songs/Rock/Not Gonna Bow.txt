It's a long, hard road
What a change has come
Hard change has come

I've been out in a cave
For forty days
With only a spark
To light my way

I wanna give out
I wanna give in
This is our crime
This is our sin

But I still believe
I still believe
Through the pain
And through the grief

Through the lies
And through the storms
Through the cries
And through the wars

I still believe
I still believe

Flat on my back
Out at sea
I'm hoping these waves
Don't cover me

I'm turned and tossed
Upon the waves
When the darkness comes
I feel the grave

But I still believe
I still believe
Through the cold
And through the heat

Through the rain
And through the tears
Through the crowds
And through the cheers

I still believe
You can't take that away from me, no
I believe

I'll march this road
And I'll climb this hill
Upon my knees
If I have to

I'll take my place
Upon this stage
I'll wait till the end of time
For You

I still believe
I believe
You can't take that away from me
I still believe

For people like us
In places like this
We need all the hope
That we can get

I believe
I believe
Through the shame
And the grief

Through the heartache
Through the tears
Through the waiting
And all the years

I still believe
I must believe
I still believe
[Incomprehensible]

I still believe
