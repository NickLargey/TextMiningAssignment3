You ought to know what a liar I can be
I lay my cards on the table 
I let you know everything about me 
So how the f*ck didn't you know? 

You only saw what you wanted to see 
You only heard what you wanted to hear 
But just the same, but just the same 
What gave you the right to interfere? 

What I needed to know 
What I wanted to know 
What I needed to know 
Who made you the interloper? 

What I needed to know 
What I wanted to know 
What I needed to know 
Who made you the interloper? 

You wanna know about misdirection? 
You wanna know about misconception? 
Well all these things, all these things 
How the f*ck couldn't you know? 

You only saw what you wanted to see 
You only heard what you wanted to hear 
But just the same, but just the same 
What gave you the right to interfere? 

What I needed to know 
What I wanted to know 
What I needed to know 
Who made you the interloper? 

What I needed to know 
What I wanted to know 
What I needed to know 
Who made you the interloper? 

Interloper

You sick, you f*ck 
I took you in, you turned me out 
You sucked me in, I spat you out
