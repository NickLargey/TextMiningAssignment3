The moon is on the bright side,
But we've thought of everything,
Send the word to the prisoners,
Tonight, we getaway,

When you hear signs of confusion,
Come drifting through the door,
Get your belongings together,
Don't leave nothing behind, 
And hey boys tonight we getaway,
To the other side,
Head for the wall and getaway; 
We're sick and tired of hearing,
That the world is gonna blow,
So there's something we'll do to the leaders,
Before we go;

Let's stick 'em in a room together - Yeah!!
And make them fight it out,
Until they see nothing from nothing,
Will leave nothing at all, 
And hey boys tonight we getaway,
To the other side,
Head for the wall and getaway; 
Open the door - open the door, let me out, I want to go 
Das ist auch unsere welt,
This is our world too,
Oui see'est notre monde aussi,

Hey boys tonight we getaway,
To the other side,
Head for the wall and getaway;

"We'll give you anything you say,"

Hey boys tonight we getaway,
To the other side,
Head for the wall and getaway;

"We'll miss you more than we can say;"
