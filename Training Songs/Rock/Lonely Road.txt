Travel a lonely road
Bid an empty town, goodbye
No one to leave behind
No one to wonder why

Stay on that lonely road
And if you see a stranger smile
Offer to make believe
Linger a little while

What can you lose pretending?
Spending time now and then
No more than one more ending
Sending you back again

Back on that lonely road
Where you stumble, there you fall
But one day your star will rise
Shining from someone’s eyes

Someone who’s lonely
And wants only you to share
Their lonely road

What can you lose pretending?
Spendin’ time now and then
No more than one more ending
Sendin’ you back again

Back on that lonely road
Where you stumble, there you fall
But one day your star will rise
Shinin’ from someone’s eyes

Someone who’s lonely
And wants only you to share
Their lonely road
