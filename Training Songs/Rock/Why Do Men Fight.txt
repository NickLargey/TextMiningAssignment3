"Now when I talked to God, I knew he'd understand
Now when I talked to God, I knew he'd understand
He said, stick by me, I'll be your guiding hand"

I'd like to ask if I may presume
Live and direct from my living room
As we bend down to prey
And ask, "is there a better way?"

If you made the world, made the day and night
Are we all going crazy, why do men fight?
If you made the mountains and the sea
Now can you show a better way to be?

"Now when I talked to God, I knew he'd understand
Now when I talked to God, I knew he'd understand
He said, stick by me, I'll be your guiding hand"

And the wrong are the right and the right are the wrong
Why can't we all just get along?
And there's no one to blame
It's not some bloody game

If you made the world, made the day and night
Are we all going crazy, why do men fight?
If you made the mountains and the sea
Now can you show a better way to be?

Religion, race, colour, creed, whatever
Law, job, race, drugs, whatever
I can hear what they say that there must be a better way
Law, job, race, drugs, whatever
Why do men fight?

"Now when I talked to God, I knew he'd understand

I'd like to ask if I my presume
Live and direct from my living room
As you bend down to pray
And ask, "is there a better way?"

These things I planned I can't understand
If you made the ocean and the land
Trying to find
Some peace of mind

If you made the world, made the day and night
Are we all going crazy, why do men fight?
If you made the mountains and the sea
Now can you show a better way to be?

Religion, race, colour, creed, whatever
Law, job, race, drugs, whatever
I can hear what they say, there must be a better way
Why do men fight?
