So here I go and there you went, again
Just another stupid thing that I done wrong.
Locked up in my head, knocked down, beaten, left for dead
With all those brilliant things I should have said.
I gotta get away, and find something to do
'Cause everything I hear, everything I see, reminds me of you.

Still counting the days I've been without you 1, 2, 3, 4
Still counting the days that you've been gone.
Day one, was no fun.
Day two, I hated you.
By day three I wish you'd come right back to me.
Day four, five and six, well I guess you just don't give a shit.
Day seven, this is hell. this is hell.
I gotta get away, and find something to do.
But everything I hear, everything I see, reminds me of you.

Still counting the days I've been without you 1, 2, 3, 4
Still counting the days that you've been gone.
Still counting the days since you left me. 1, 2, 3 ,4
Still counting the days since you've been gone.

A thousand things I want to say to you, but its too late now.
A thousand things I want to say
A thousand things I want to say to you, but its too late now.
A thousand things I want to say

Still counting the days I've been without you.
Still counting the days that you've been gone.
Still counting the days I've been without you 1, 2, 3, 4
Still counting the days that you've been gone.
Still counting the days since you left me 1, 2, 3, 4
Still counting the days that you've been gone.
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
