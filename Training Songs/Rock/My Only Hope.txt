Look at me
Stand up straight
Interrupt the things that don't make
Any sense at all
Any sense at all
Don't take long
Now it's gone
In between the lines and spaces
Now that it's been said
Face is turning red
You get so tired all the time
And I get so wired all the time
But you keep asking why 

You're my only hope
Hold me up, stand me up straight
My only hope
Is it just a subtle joke
My only hope

Press the bruise
Beg or choose
Feelin' like a shadow 
Of my former self again
Broken badly bent
Cut my nose off my face
In spite of myself
There must be something in the way
Something in the way
You get so tired all the time
And I get so wired all the time
But you keep asking why, I won't comply
I can't deny

You're my only hope
Hold me up, stand me up straight
My only hope
Is it just a subtle joke
My only hope

With a secret smile
On an empty stomach
And the fish bowl feel
That you get for nothing
When you tie it on
And it pulls you under
Goin' down the drain
Is it all for nothing?

You're my only hope
Hold me up, stand me up straight
My only hope
Is it just a subtle joke
My only hope
You're my only hope
Hold me up, stand me up straight
My only hope
Is it just a subtle joke
My only hope

There's somethin' in the way
There's somethin' in the way
There's somethin' in the way
There's somethin' in the way
There's somethin' in the way
There's somethin' in the way
There's somethin' in the way
There's somethin' in the way
