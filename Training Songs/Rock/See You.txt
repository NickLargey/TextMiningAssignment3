Lori says to Billy we've been working for a long time
On this story trying to find a happy ending
We looked so long and hard for it
Maybe there just isn't one
See you

She says I make excuses all the time
They filled up half my life
But there aren't any reasons
For the way you treated me
Now if you'll excuse me please
See you

All the dreams I thought we shared
Were mine alone
And if only you could see in you the things I see in you
But you're too scared to look
See you

She says compatibility is people who communicate
Who share their hopes and fears
And co-exist in harmony, that doesn't sound like you and me
See you

Billy says I don't know why
I took so long to listen to you
Guess I'm stubborn with my heart
I'm sorry you were right all along
You're not what I want
See you
