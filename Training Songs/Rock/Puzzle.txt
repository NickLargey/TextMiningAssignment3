I got a puzzle in my head
Spend a lifetime finding pieces
It will take forever to put together
the square and the round
Something that proves I'm not
hangin' around

You want to leave you want to leave
But there's something inside you
just don't trust
You want to leave you make believe
That your life is not a wreck and it
will never rust

Don't want your money
Your milk and honey
You'll never love me
I won't bring you down

I got a desert in my heart tonight
I'll lie here like a dead man all
night
I still have a face it looks like mine
If only I could reach my mind

You want to leave you want to leave
But there's someone inside you
just don't trust
You want to leave you make believe
That your life is not a wreck and it
will never rust

Don't want your money
Your milk and honey
You'll never love me
I won't bring you down
