Seeing you, I knew why I'd come so far, and I thanked the stars for leading me to you. Your fairy tale prince, I'm trying so hard to make like an orchard in my own back yard. Oh the rain dribbles down me in my beatitude, my collar and shirt, down legs to battered shoes. Life is a breeze! I'm just making memories, good times or bad, (I'm making, I'm making) I'm just making memories, you're the best that I've had. And I'm still living my teenage angst, on the printed page and in other ways. So if I seem cruel, it's only the fool in me, that wants to try and see if you'll cry. Oh the rain dribbles down me in my beatitude, my collar and shirt, down legs to battered shoes. Life is a breeze! I'm just making memories, good times or bad, (I'm making, I'm making) I'm just making memories, you're the best that I've had. I'm just making memories, good times or bad, (I'm making, I'm making) I'm just making memories, you're the best that I've had. (solo) Uh I'm just making memories, good times or bad, (I'm making, I'm making) I'm just making memories, you're the best that I've had. I'm just making memories, good times or bad, (I'm making, I'm making) I'm just making memories, you're the best that I've had. No need to ask why I'm mischief and joy, I'm still the tall boy who just wouldn't crawl. I'm just making memories, good times or bad, no need to ask you're the best, you're the best that I've had. (I'm just making memories) I'm just making memories you're the best that I've had. I'm just making memories, good times or bad, (I'm making, I'm making) I'm just making memories, you're the best that I've had. I'm just making memories, good times or bad, (I'm making, I'm making) I'm just making memories, you're the best that I've had
