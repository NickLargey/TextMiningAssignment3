Step inside the reason why we look together then we find
Come inside the world's a ball we rise above it as we fall
Everybody's open air so love me love me -- love me where?
A million things and one to fly (say) life's a witch and then you smile

Took a trip inside
Your heart has seen much better days
Before we hit the high here's to you
Sideways

The moon is warm the river's high and love, forever never dies
Check inside yourself and see that life is what you want to be

Took a ride inside
Your heart has seen much better days
And before we hit the right one here's to you, sideways
Here's looking at you sideways
Sideways
Dreaming of you sideways

Sideways
Had a dream where everybody looked like someone else
The farthest I could get from was the closest to myself
Tonite I'll dream tomorrow's going to be that better day
And in the morning I'll remember you, sideways
Sideways

Sideways
Here's looking at you sideways
Sideways
I'm dreaming of you sideways
Gonna give it to you sideways
