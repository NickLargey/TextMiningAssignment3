"Let's make up or break up
'Cause We've seen better days"
"Yeah, they'll have to drag you
Kicking and screaming off the stage"
"Don't do me favors
Don't show your face"
"Don't tell me what to play
It's not your place"

"The fans wanted us to play
We hear and we obey"

You wanted the best
And you got the best
Aah, aah, aah
Aah, aah, aah

"Don't give me glances
Don't give me sighs"
"Well then, don't give me
Sweet talk, Pete, just testify"
"Hey, you live in fairy tales
You're just a fallin' star"
"Right, and who died and made you king
Just who do you think you are?"

"Everything's gotten way out of hand
But your wish is our command"

You wanted the best
You got the best
Aah, aah, aah
Aah, aah, aah

"Everything's gotten way out of hand
But your wish is our command"

You wanted the best
You got the best
Aah, aah, aah
Aah, aah, aah
