We took your Daddy's car
And drove it to the sea
We fooled around for hours
And then when we got tired and it got dark
We found a place to park
And we watched the sun set fire to the sea

Can you feel the sadness in our love?
It's the only kind we're worthy of
Can you feel the madness in our hearts
As the key turns and the engine starts?

We took your Daddy's car
And drove it into town
We steamed into a bar
And we bought the biggest bottle of champagne
And driving through the rain we sang
'God bless this car, and all who sail in her!'

Can you feel the sadness in our love?
It's the only kind we're worthy of
Can you feel the madness in our hearts
As the key turns and the engine starts?

We took your Daddy's car
And wrapped it round a tree
We didn't know what for
We didn't feel like driving any more
It was so good we got bored
And we are driving from the day we are born

Can you feel the sadness in our love?
Well it's the only kind we're worthy of
Can you feel the madness in our hearts
As the key turns and the engine starts?

Can you feel the engine start?
The engine
The engine
Engine start?
