Get busy there's a timeline
You're not the only one
I'll wait for you at the back of the queue
I know it's not your fault

We need peace and love
We need mother nature
For the same reason

We want peace and love
We want mother nature
When they're in season

Hope, how'd you stand so tall?
You know our love is all

Hope, how'd you stand so tall?
You know our love is all

Say something that can move me
Just say something at all
It's so easy to be muted
But you chose to stand so tall
'Cause baby I'm in awe
Everything's so small

We need peace and love
We need mother nature
For the same reason

We want peace and love
We want mother nature
When they're in season

Hope, how'd you stand so tall?
You know our love is all

Hope, how'd you stand so tall?
You know our love is all

You know our love is all
You know our love is all

We need peace and love
All you mother fuckers
For the same reason

We want peace and love
All you mother fuckers
When they're in season

But the season's will change
Nothing remains
Now that peace and love have no meaning
