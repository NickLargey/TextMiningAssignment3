You wake up where are you
What's on your mind?
Confusion can't face it
You close your eyes
There's no one to turn to
No where to hide
Deep river, cool water
Your love has died

Well I know and you know, we’re killing time
We’re on an up down see saw, loop de li

I saw you cry
Sweet picture taste bitter, loop de li
Ambition no telling what’s on your mind
Hatred and bitter
Loop de li

Well I know you and you know, we’re killing time
We’re on an up down see saw, loop de li

You’re watching and waiting you walk on by
Delusion you’re drowning
You wonder why ambition no telling what’s on your mind?
Sweet picture tastes bitter,
Loop de li

Hatred and bitter
Hatred and bitter
Hatred and bitter
Hatred and bitter
Loop de li
