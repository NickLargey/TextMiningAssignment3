Here I am and I'm waitin' 
On a chance to 
Make it right 
Every word you say 

Makes my heart go bang bang 
'Cause it sounds so nice 
Well I've been alone 
And you've been a fool 

Oh baby don't you know that's the golden rule 
Well I've been alone 
And you've been a fool 
Oh baby don't you know that's the way I like it 

Let me take you away 
On the wings of my Superfly 
Maybe we'll celebrate 
All the room in the sky 

Heaven knows we'll go boom boom boom 
What can I do 
To get you in the mood 
Baby I give up 

I'm so misused 
And you're so confused 
It's such a drag 
Well I've been alone 

And you've been a fool 
Oh baby don't you know that's the golden rule 
Well I've been alone 
And you've been a fool 

Oh baby don't you know that's the way I like it 
Let me take you away 
On the wings of my Superfly 
Maybe we'll celebrate 

All the room in the sky 
Heaven knows we'll go boom boom boom 
Here I am and I'm waitin' 
On a chance to 

Make it right 
Do I turn you on 
Or maybe do I turn you off 
Could you just decide 

Well I've been alone 
And you've been a fool 
Oh baby don't you know that's the golden rule 
Well I've been alone 

And you've been a fool 
Oh baby don't you know that's the way I like it 
Let me take you away 
On the wings of my Superfly 

Maybe we'll celebrate 
All the room in the sky 
Heaven knows we'll go boom boom boom
