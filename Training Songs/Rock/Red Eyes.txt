Come and see
Where or when there's everything
On my ways
Be better, get to my soul
Against my way
Anyone can tell us you're coming
Baby, don't mind
Even if I lay anywhere

Colorado, it's easier to stick to the earth
Surrounded by the night
Surrounded by the night, don't go
Don't you abuse my faith
Lose it eternally, go nowhere
You're on my side again
So rather here, wherever it goes
Oh, baby, I don't wanna care

'By the way'
And if you see through the darkness coming my way
Well, if you hold close my side you're gaining

It all seems everywhere
Made of time, made of wool, I can't
Don't think they would mind
I will keep you here, but I can't

Oh, I'll talk to you if I can
I'll see you where I go

Flower my seed
Starts to accume please leave, their coming by soon
Does anyone care but myself?
So rather here, wherever it goes
Seen the darkness coming my way
I can hear the world just silent
The ups and downs of society
