Do you claim to drag your net through deep waters?
Come dive in pale shallows with me
Yeah, there's underwater life
Haunted old wrecks
Even non-believers find something to see

I'll be down in the basement
I'll be out in the flat field
I'll be winding up the wires
Staring at your hologram, trying to make it real

There's an '82 Honda getting all its tapes stolen
Outside a party where the tension is real
There's a band inside having all their hearts broken
Other kids all wondering how it feels

I'll be down in the basement
I'll be out in the flat field
I'll be winding up the wires
I'll be staring at your hologram, trying to make it real

I'll be down in the basement
I'll be out in the flat field
I'll be winding up the wires
Staring at your hologram, trying to make it real
