Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself, 
And covered with a perfect shell, 
Such a charming beautiful exterior.
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes 
And perfect makeup but you're barely scraping by,
But you're barely scraping by.

This is one time
That you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone or anyone at all. 
And the grave that you refuse to leave 
The refuge that you've built to flee
The places you have come to fear the most,
Is the places you have come to fear the most. 

Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself, 
And hidden in the public eye. 
Such a stellar monument to loneliness. 
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes 
And perfect makeup but you're barely scraping by, but you're barely scraping by. 

This is one time
That you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone or anyone at all. 
And the grave that you refuse to leave 
The refuge that you've built to flee
The places you have come to fear the most,
Is the places you have come to fear the most.
