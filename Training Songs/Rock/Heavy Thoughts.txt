Life has me running in circles as of late
I've been searching for some kind of saving grace
You don't know what you do to me
Why can't you let this go?
Headstones and broken bones give me a reason to stand on my own

When life doesn't give you what you want you've gotta pick up the pieces and move on
Heavy thoughts on my mind
Always sick of chasing time
This is the end, could this be the end

Actions speak louder than words
We know it's worth the wait
It lingers in our hearts and runs through our veins

This could be the end of everything I know
Even when you love you still let go
Always thinking I can do this on my own
We're all in this together
Change will always happen but I know If you open your heart you will grow
This could be the end of everything we know
We're all in this together
And I'm on top of the world
