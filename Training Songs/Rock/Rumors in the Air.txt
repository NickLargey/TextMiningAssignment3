Used to call me by my first name
Now you never even call me at all
Used to say I was your only flame
It was so simple I believed it all

Well, I hear you've got a new friend and lover
Who keeps you warm on the cool, cool nights
Oh, there's a rumor in the air, don't seem right

Rumors in the air
Like a thief in the night
Taking more than their share
Taking more than their right

Rumors in the air
Like a thief in the night
Rumors
(Rumors in the air)

Used to call me when you felt the pain
Now you never even feel at all
Used to swear that we would never change
And like a fool I believed it all

Well, I hear you had a weekend of trouble
As you stare me down with those cool, cool eyes
Oh, there's a rumor in the air, don't seem right

Rumors in the air
Like a thief in the night
Taking more than their share
Taking more than their right

Rumors in the air
Like a thief in the night
Rumors, rumors
(Rumors in the air)

Used to call me by my first name
Now you never even call me at all
Now you say that I'm the one to blame
Doesn't matter how I feel it all

Well, I hear you got a new friend and lover
You'll take him down, it's so plain to see
Oh, there's a rumor in the air killing me

Rumors in the air
Like a thief in the night
Taking more than their share
Taking more than their right

Rumors in the air
Like a thief in the night
Rumors, rumors
(Rumors in the air)

Rumors in the air
Rumors in the air
Rumors in the air

Rumors, rumors, rumors
Rumors in the air
