Don't ever worry that I'll leave you
That's such a foolish thing to do
How could I ever go
When in my heart I know
I'd never find another you

I mite find other arms to hold me
But they would only leave me blue
The thrill of your embrace
Is what I can replace
I'd never find another you

Though there are times when we may quarrel
I can't stay mad at you for more than just a minute or two now
I know I never want to leave you
Cause if I searched my whole life through
I know there'll only be
A second best for me
I'd never find another you

I know I never want to leave you
Cause if I searched my whole life through
I know there'll only be
A second best for me
I'd never find another you
I'd never find another you
