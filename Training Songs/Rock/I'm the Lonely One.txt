I can think of nothing better  
Than dancing on the beach  
See a girl, you can go and get her  
Your troubles will be out of reach     
(On the beach) You can dance to the rock & roll  
(On the beach) Hear the bossanova, played with soul  
(On the beach) You can dance, twist and shout  
(On the beach) Everybody hear me come on out     
On the beach (Come on, everybody, stamp your feet)  
On the beach (You can dance with anyone you meet)  'Cause your troubles will be out of reach  
On the beach     
Mm, this is fun 
Mm, won't you tell me I'm the one you're gonna dance with  Yeah, bossanova     
Mm, this is fun  
Mm, won't you tell me I'm the one you're gonna dance with  Yeah, twist and shout now     
You can do the dance that you want to  
With anyone that you meet  
And if the bossanova doesn't get you  
The twist'll have you on your feet     
(On the beach) You can dance to the rock & roll  
(On the beach) Hear the bossanova, played with soul  
(On the beach) You can dance, twist and shout 
 (On the beach) Everybody hear me come on out     
On the beach (Come on, everybody, stamp your feet)  
On the beach (You can dance with anyone you meet)  Ã¦Cause your troubles will be out of reach  
On the beach
