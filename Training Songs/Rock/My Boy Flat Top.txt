Young and strong, his top is flat
Cool haircut, never wears a hat
I don't mean maybe, he's a real hep cat
My boy-flat top
Big broad shoulders, man, they're pips
Dreamy eyes really crazy lips
When he shouts, "Hey baby"
Well the girls they flip
My boy-flat top
I'm tellin you that snazzy guy
Really sends you my oh, my
He's the most, the dreamers goal
You ought to see him rock and roll
Got no dough, but just a nod
Gets the girls, tho it may seem odd
He's a real smooth lover in his old hot rod
My boy-flat top
