Round and round and round it goes
And where it stops nobody knows
So crazy, I got this feeling inside
Want you back in my arms again
Come on tell me I want you still by my side
Tell me I am the only one,
You know it and I know it,
This love is stronger than anything
Oh girl you know that it's true,
Forever together with you

Round and round and round it goes
And where it stops nobody knows
Round and round is our love,
let's blame it on the stars above
Hey show me, and please give me your love
I just want to be close to you
Please open, oh come on open your heart
Sometimes you're still such a mystery
I feel it and you feel it
I want you here in my arms again
Oh girl you know that's love
Forever together with you

Heaven knows what we would know
This love is strong, oh please don't go
