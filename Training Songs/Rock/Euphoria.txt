Well Ma's out there, twitchin' in the kitchen
Dad's in the living room, fussin' and a-bitchin'
I'm out here, kicking the gong for... Euphoria!
Chorus:
Euphoria - When your mind starts reelin' and a-rockin;
Your inside voice starts squealing and squawking
Floatin' around on a belladonna cloud, singin'... Euphoria!
There's a man in the corner sittin' underneath the table
Sad, makin' faces at a union label
Grittin' his ears and he rolled his eyes and hollerin' Euphoria!
Chorus
Patted Eve on the bottom, patted Adam on the back
Smiled at the serpent and the serpent smiled back
Took a bite of the apple, two bites gone, hollerin' Euphoria!
Chorus
