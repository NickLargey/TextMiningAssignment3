Mornings come and lord my mind is achin'
Yes it is
Sunshine standing quietly at my door
Just like the dawn my heart is silently breaking
With my tears it goes tumbling to the floor

Once again
The whole town will be talking
Yes they will
Lord I've seen the pity that's in their eyes
They could never understand it's her sorrow it's not a man
And no matter what they say we know she tried

Baby's packed her soft things and she's left me
She's left me
She's left me
And I know she didn't mean to make me cry
It's not her heart lord it's her mind
She didn't mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye

It's not her heart lord it's her mind
She didn't mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye
Goodbye baby
