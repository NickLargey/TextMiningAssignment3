So you think
You found a way of living
That prevents
You losing any sleep
Well, my friend
Take this that I'm giving
It's your piece of mind
You oughta keep

You'll run into trouble for sure
By living behind a locked door

Will you run the risk
Of being taunted
By doing what you want to do
Or do you prefer to have
Your whole life haunted
By the ones who
Choose to care for you

Beware of their motives my friend
Take care
You're still there at the end

Watch out for winter
It'll bite you with cold
Black spirits trying hard
To bribe you with gold

Would you steal a nickel
from a blind man
Well, right now
I do believe you would
It's not the thought of you
Doing it that hurts me
It's the mind behind it
What's no good

If this is your way
I don't want to know
It's only so far I can go

I won't go no further
Not for you or anyone
I have my own ideas on
What should be done

What should be done
