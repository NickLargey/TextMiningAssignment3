You're alone in the pack, you're feeling like you wanna go home
You're feeling life's finished but you keep on going
The reason is there but you won't find it till you've been and gone
Because you're living a hoax, someone's got you sussed, oh

Dull your brain or seek inspiration
You fearin' an illusion and then you're findin' a transfer
Drugs for the machine to play with your head
So you can stand back and watch or take part and learn

Look at the controller, a Nazi with a social degree
A middle-class hero, a rapist with your eyes on me
You feast on masturbation, a priest cheers to the nuns you f*ck
You'd wipe out spastics if you had the chance but Jesus wouldn't like it
