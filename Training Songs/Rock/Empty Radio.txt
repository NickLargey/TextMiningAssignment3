The song plays on my empty radio
I remember, kneeling before the parts on the floor
Of the radio I took apart to find Elvis
But he'd left this building
And I can't deny; since then, I've wondered why
The songs they play, and the songs I hear
Do they ring true in my ears?

You can't pull this wool any tighter over our eyes
And I wanted so, and I wanted oh-so badly
I want to go where I don't know
Why songs play on my empty radio

And the radio's turning me off, damn the radio
And I say damn the radio, full speed ahead

And my father'd drive; I'd take the shotgun side
With the window down and the signal clear
In hopes I'd hear the cheap trick record
Over and over, and over again
Till I could believe

And I wanted so, and I wanted oh-so badly
Who's got the answers 'cause I've got some questions?
When they hit the stage, do they feign the rage
That plays so well on empty radio?

Everything, it gets destroyed; (Where I don't know)
Everything, it gets destroyed; (Why songs play on my empty radio)
Everything is empty radio

And the radio's turning me off, I know that I...
The only thing that I think that I believe is we've been had, we've been had

Every grade level sings his song, but no one stays on top that long
You couldn't shoulder what he knew was the weight

And the radio's turning me off, I know that I...
I find it hard to believe, but if, if, if, if, if, if, if, I believe
That we've been had, we've been had
And the radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio...
