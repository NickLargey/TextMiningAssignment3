Who'd you drag around my door if I
Keep it cracked they won't be here no more
Who'd you leave along the way
Leave 'em there don't come back today

Now who's the one who treats you right
Yeah leave him there don't come back to fight
Now who's the lad who wants to be
It never was and it just can't be me

My luck is wasted
I'm on the run somewhere
My luck is wasted
I'm on the run somewhere

Throw the rocks and break the glass
I'll get down on my knees and kiss your ass
'Cause you're the one to be in my dreams
It never was It isn't what it seems

My luck is wasted
I'm on the run somewhere
My luck is wasted
I'm on the run somewhere

Now who's the dragon at my door
Well I shot it now, it don't come back no more

Gonna fire up someday
My luck is wasted
I'm on the run somewhere
Feel my hand wrapped around
My luck is wasted
I'm on the run somewhere
