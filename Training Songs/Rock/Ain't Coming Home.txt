Yeah! 

Turning back, 
It's my time to fly 
Too many decisions 
And not enough time 

My only sinful thrill living 
Is unnerved 
So back up mama 
Cause I ain't coming home 

Ain't coming home 
Ain't coming home 
No no no 
Ain't coming home 

Just sitting here sneezing 
It's my time to fly 
I always thought the devil 
Gave me nine full lives 
And I 
I take this with ____ 
Cause nothin' ___ 

And turnin' back 
It's my time to fly 
Too many decisions 
And not enough time
