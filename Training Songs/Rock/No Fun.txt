Yeah!
Depression is in session and there's
Not a lot of lessons to be learned now.
Chosen by the dozen with the ? are barely buzzin' and we're burned out!

and it's no fun
Yeah it's no fun
Well it's no fun

I think I'm going crazy
But it's maybe not the crazy
That you're used too.

it's no fuckin' fun (4x)
Yeah

the singer's in a ringer
Cause the songs that he's been singing
Reek off bullshit.
The drummers been a bummer
It's been one hell of a summer
And who needs it?

well it's no fun
Yeah it's no fun
Well it's no fun

I think I'm going crazy
But it's maybe not the crazy
That you're used too.

it's no fuckin' fun (4x)

well it's no fun
Yeah it's no fun
Well it's nooooooooooooooooo

it's no fuckin' fun...
