Time is on my side tho' the world keeps gettin' colder
'Cause I've got you, girl to ease my troubled mind
I'm a different man when your head is on my shoulder
I can find the answers in me that I never tho't I'd find

'Cause you look in my eyes pretty woman
The world is a peaceful place
All I can see when there's you 
And there's me is love upon your face
Stand by me, baby and we'll find the way 
Before our day is done
Look in my eyes pretty woman and we'll overcome

You're my guiding star, you're my faith
My hope, my power when I just can't 
Find a reason to believe
Touch my hand with love 
And you light my darkest hour
I can feel the warm returning 
And my pain about to leave
(repeat chorus)
