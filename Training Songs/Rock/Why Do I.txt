We swing high, we swing low
Never worry about a dull moment
You're mine, I'm yours
We fight while we know that we shouldn't

Ten dollar, ten times
On sale to the highest bidder
Ten dollar, ten times
Is the price of love considered
You're right, I'm wrong
You always knew a good thing in the first place
One sundown, one moon down
One hole in a sky-blue ceiling

Ten dollar, ten times
Every time you hold the trigger
Ten dollar, ten times
Is the price of love
Why do I, hurt you so
Why can't I just let you go
Why do I, hurt you so
While I idolize you forever more

Ten dollar, ten times
On sale to the highest bidder
Ten dollar, ten times
Is the price of love considered

Your "yes" against my "no"
We never worry Ã¢??bout a dull moment
You're mine, and I'm yours
We fight while we know that we shouldn't

Ten dollar, ten times
Every time you hold the trigger
Ten dollar, ten times
It's the price of love

Why do I, hurt you so
Why can't I just let you go
Why do I, hurt you so
While I idolize you forever more

Ten dollar, ten times
Why do I, hurt your soul
