Oh, Julie
Ah, ah, ah
Oh, Julie
Ah, ah, ah

Oh-uh-oh-uh-oh Julie
You'll never know how I love yo-ou-ou
Oh-uh-oh-uh-oh Julie
A teenage dream that can't come true

I see-ee you Julie
Each day as you walk by-why-why
But maybe some day, Julie
I'll be the apple of your eye

Although you're older than me, it makes no difference, you see
As you are my shining sta-are
You've heard of passion for love and jealousy, my dove
Well, that's the way I feel about you

I nee-eed you, Julie
You'll never know how my heart yea-ea-earns
Oh, please, please help me
My love just burns and burns

But some day, Julie
When I'm as old as yo-ou-ou
I'll take you, Julie
And make my dreams come true

But some day, Julie
When I'm as old as yo-ou-ou
I'll take you, Julie
And make my dreams come true
