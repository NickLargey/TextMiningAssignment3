I'm all mixed up, I'm all mixed up about, 
All mixed up about you 

And no I can't find no reason 
To explain the way that I feel 
I remember things being clearer 
At one time things were more real 

I'm all mixed up, I'm all mixed up about, 
All mixed up about you 

I'm not lookin' for sympathy 
I'm just frightened by this apathy 
Like footsteps way in back of me 
On a narrow street of stone 
And if time will answer all questions 
Then perhaps a film will be shown 
Everyone could mail-order tickets 
Yeah, you could sell a lot of shirts 
For the last picture show 

I'm all mixed up, I'm all mixed up about, 
All mixed you p about you
