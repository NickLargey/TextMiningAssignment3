Been dry long enough
My brain and body need some abuse
Rake me over the coals
And I'll try to think of an excuse

I set a goal and it won't be hard
Hit every bar on the boulevard
Bad idea yeah you're probably right
But I won't be your designated driver tonight

Cause I'm
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon

Just how much I've embarrassed myself
Well I haven't got a clue
Did I throw a drink in your face
Or tell you how much I love you

Oh shit I lost my ID
Hook up the Jagermeister IV
Bad idea yeah you're probably right
But I won't be your designated driver tonight

Off the wagon
I'm off the wagon
I'm on the town off the wagon
Off the wagon wagon wagon wagon, wee

Set a goal
Hit every bar
Bad idea
Designated
Alright, alright

Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon

I'm on the town off the wagon
I'm on the town off the wagon
I'm on the town off the wagon
I'm off the wagon wagon wagon wagon

Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon and on the town
Off the wagon

That's it
