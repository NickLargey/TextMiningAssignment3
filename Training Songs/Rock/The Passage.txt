It had been some time
Hope and lost in life
Now he doesn't know
Where to go

So he moves
On toward a pond
In the middle of
The unknown

And looks below
All the lines try holding his face
It's reflection doesn't know it's place
In the world (such a)

Callous world
Somewhere along his path
He now knows he crossed the gap
From a boy

To a man
So stand up tall
'Cause here we go
Through the passage

The passage
Time to let go
Of what is known
In the

The passage
So he walks on toward a tree
Feeling torn between
And sits below

The old growth
Pondering this time
The choices we make
All our lives

To find our lives
And this is were we'll have to make
One final chioce that will dictate
The rest of his life

What to decide?
As everything from the past
All the things that just wont last
Tear at his soul (as he)

Sits alone
So stand up tall
'Cause here we go
Through the passage

The passage
Time to let go
Of what is known
In the passage

The passage
So stand up tall
'Cause here we go
