If you're feeling lazy have another Sunday
If you could have a good slacking around for me to please you
The job can wait til Tuesday maybe even Thursday
Let it go mystical
Even this dump seems cool with you baby
Our love could not be better we'll always be together
What cha got not a lot not a lot of nothing always with you baby
Ain't it the truth baby
We're the happiest fools baby
Without a clue baby
And no particular use
Trying to be satirical on any given lyrical
If we can maybe yeah sleep through the rest of the day with you baby
So if you're feeling lazy come on won't you baby
Here we go just for show just for the fun of being dumb like you baby
Ain't it the truth baby
We're the happiest fools baby
Without a clue baby
And no particular use
And if the man comes to take us both away
I could do you yeah you could do Saturdays
We'll steal another room another hideaway
Laughing at all the people saying, "what do you do?"
Ain't it the truth baby
We're the happiest fools baby
Without a clue baby
And no particular use
