Would it be too much to ask you for a light
Or is that the kinda thing that always ends up in a fight
How's come you think that everybody's on the make
But if we carry on this way there's gotta be some give and take
But it's your life
Do what you like

[Chorus]
You got this way of turning magic into lust
You take it all for granted, you crush it in the dust
I see ya looking, but you don't even care
But all I wanna do is run my fingers through your hair, through your hair
Oh through your hair
But it's your life
So do what you like

Because you really don't owe me
You really don't owe
You really don't know me
You really don't know
It's your life
So do what you like

[Chorus]

Because you really don't owe me
You really don't owe
You really don't owe me
You really don't owe
You really don't know me
You really don't know
You really don't know me
You really don't know
But it's your life
So do what you like
Do what you like
Do what you like
Do what you like
Do it,
Do what you like
