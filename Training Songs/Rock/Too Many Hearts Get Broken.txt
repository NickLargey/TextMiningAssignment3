(Babe) you're the one I can see in your eyes
(Babe) you're the one, you're the once in my life
When you know there's a time
For a love that survives
And I look at you 
And I know that you are mine 

I've been wrong when I thought I was right
You go on puttin' hope in my life
But a single mistake can be all that it takes 

We're through
Know we're gonna make it, I know in my mind
We're through
If we're gonna make it then now is the time 

Too many hearts get broken
Too many dreams get blown away
Too many hearts grow cold
I know this time is the time 

(Babe) cross my heart I can swear it's true
(Babe) all I need is the feeling in you
'Cause I've waited too long (waited too long) 
For it all to go wrong

We're through
Know we're gonna make it, it's fate that we do
We're through
I could never face it a world without you 

Too many hearts get broken
Too many dreams get blown away
Too many hearts grow cold
I know this time 
Maybe I know, I know this time

The way she makes you burn
Past the point of no return
Love go wrong and leave you cold as ice

Too many hearts get broken
Too many hearts get broken

Too many hearts get broken
Too many dreams get blown away
Too many hearts grow cold
I know, I know deep down inside of me, this is the time 

Too many hearts get broken (this is the time)
Too many dreams get blown away
Too many hearts grow cold
I know this time, you're gonna make it

Too many hearts get broken
Too many dreams get blown away (this time, you're gonna make it, look at me)
Too many hearts grow cold
I know this time
