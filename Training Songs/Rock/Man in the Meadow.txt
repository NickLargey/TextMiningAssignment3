Extra extra read all about my 
Loss of sanity
I have often wondered what my
Life really means to me
Wasted days and broken dreams
Let it all slip away from me
And if you pick up the pieces of
A broken man, you'll find a
Fan of the family
Yeah the family

Now you're all alone
In the meadow
Sedate your lonely soul
With the man in the meadow
No need to telephone
When you're out in the meadow
'Cause you live your life alone
With the man in the meadow
And me

Saw a friend of mine
Guess he just didn't see me
Looked into his eyes
And he walked right through me
He lived a life of alibies and
Broken ties that set him free yeah
free, yeah free

And why'd this dream fade so
Fast
And why am I lookin' towards
The past to set me free
From me and my family
My family yeah yeah

Set down beside your grave
At peace with God and the holy
Slave
We're gathered here to shed
A tear
And think about our goddamn mortal
Years
You had your start
You made your mark
And then you turn around
And leave us in the dark, f*ck
In the dark

Now you're all alone
In the meadow
Sedate your lonely soul
With the man in the meadow
No need to telephone
When you're out in the meadow
'Cause you live your life alone
With the man in the meadow
And me
