Disappearing out of sight along the open road
Into indistinct horizons I had no time to reload
Like a silver bullet from a gun an arrow from a bow
Like an equine star you'll hear about it
Everywhere you go
All through nebula I was racing in my mind
I tripped the light fantastic and never looked behind
You slow down You slow down
Lights are changing
You slow down You slow down
Lights are changing
You fly so high and move so fast
You're running blindly from the past
Slow down You slow down
When lights are changing
Looking through your hollow eyes across the great unknown
Growing greater every second growing harder with each stone
Yeah and you who judge your freedom by the quantity you score
Does it make you any freer if you took a little more
All that summertime I revolved around your eye
In accelerating spirals in an asymmetric sky
You slow down You slow down
Lights are changing
You slow down You slow down
Lights are changing
You fly so high yeah and you move so fast
You're running blindly from the past
Slow down You slow down
Lights are changing
Oh changing all the time
Oh changing all the time
Now you slow down You slow down
Lights are changing
You slow down You slow down
Lights are changing
You fly so high and you move so fast
You're running blindly from the past
Slow down You slow down
Lights are changing
You slow down You slow down lights are changing
