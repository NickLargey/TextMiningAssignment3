Sometimes when your hopes have all been shattered
And there's nowhere to turn
You wonder how you keep going (going)
Think of all the things that really mattered
And the chances you've earned
The fire in your heart is growing (growing)
You can fly, if you try, leaving the past behind
Heaven only knows what you might find

Dare, dare to believe you can survive
You hold the future in your hand
Dare, dare to keep all of your dreams alive
It's time to take a stand
And you can win, if you dare

Everybody's trying to break your spirit
Keeping you down
Seems like it's been forever (ever), oh
But there's another voice if you'll just hear it
Saying it's the last round
Looks like it's now or never (never)
Out of the darkness you stumble into the light
Fighting for the things you know are right

Dare, dare to believe you can survive
The power is there at your command
Dare, dare to keep all of your dreams alive
It's time to take a stand
And you can win, if you dare

Dare, dare to believe you can survive
You hold the future in your hand
Dare, dare to keep all of your dreams alive
The power is there at your command, oh
Dare, dare to keep all your love alive
Dare to be all you can be
Dare, there is a place where dreams survive
And it's calling you on to victory
Dare, dare.
