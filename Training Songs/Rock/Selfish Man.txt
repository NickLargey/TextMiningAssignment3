I don't eat I just devour 
Everyone in every hour 
All is me, is all I need and that's all that I care 
Propelled through all this madness 
By your beauty and my sadness 
I'll never change or rearrange
'Till I've finished what I've started

And life leads me here 
It shows me, I have never really loved no one but me 
Like the time, you slipped through my hands 
I'll never understand 
Why I'm such a selfish man

Walk around me not before me 
I'll pretend not to ignore ye 
But I'll compromise if I realize you can do something for me 
I'm ugly and you know it 
But you think that I'm a poet 
So I'll keep the rhyme if I feel in time 
It gets me where I'm going

And life leads me here 
It shows me, I have never really loved no one but me 
Like the time, you slipped through my hands 
And I'll never understand 
No, I'll never understand 
Why I'm such a selfish man

All I heard was an unearthly silence 
Apart from the violence, explode in my head 
Where all at once was this moment of beauty 
No more since it slew me, no never again, again, again

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

No, I'll never understand 
No, I'll never understand 
Why I'm such a selfish man
Selfish man, selfish man, selfish man, selfish man, selfish man
