One two, princes kneel before you, that's what I said now
Princes, princes who adore you, just go ahead now
One has, diamonds in his pockets, and lots of bread now
This one simply wants to buy you rockets, hangin' in his head now

Yeah, (do-be-do's)

This one has a princely racket, that's what I said now
Got some big symbol on his jacket, ain't in his head now
Marry him your father will condone you, how 'bout that now
You marry me, your father will disown you just go ahead now

Marry him, or marry me,
I'm the one who loves you baby can't you see
I ain't got no future or family tree but
I know what a Prince and lover ought to be
I know what a Prince and lover ought to be

So If you, want to call me baby, just go ahead now
And if you'd like to tell me maybe, just go ahead now
If you want to buy me flowers, just go ahead now
And If you'd like to talk for hours, just go ahead now
