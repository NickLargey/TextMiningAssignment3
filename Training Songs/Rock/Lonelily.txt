I gave me away, I could have knocked off the evening
But I lonelily landed my waltz in her hands
In a way, I felt you were leaving me
I was sure I wouldn't find you at home

And you let me down, you could have knocked off the evening
But you lonelily let him push under your bone
You let me down, it's no use deceiving
Neither of us wanna be alone

And you're coming home
You're coming home
And you're coming home
You're coming home

I gave me away, I could have knocked off the evening
But I was lonelily looking for someone to hold
In a way, I lost all I believed in
And I never found myself so low

And you let me down, you could've called if you'd needed
But you lonelily got yourself locked in instead
And you let me down, it's one thing being cheated
But you took him all the way through your bed

And now you're coming home
And I'm trying to forgive, you're coming home
And I'm trying to forget, you're coming home
And I'm trying to move on, you're coming home
And you haven't called yet, you're coming home

And I'm trying to forgive, you're coming home
I'm just trying to forget, you're coming home
I'm trying to move on, you're coming home
But you haven't called, you're coming home
You're coming home, you're coming home
You're coming home

I gave me away, I could have knocked off the evening
But I lonelily loomed her into my bone
You let me down, there's no use deceiving
Neither of us wanna be alone
