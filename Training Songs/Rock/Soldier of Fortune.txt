I’m a soldier of fortune
An ambassador of pain
I had the world on a string
Then I threw it all away

I’m a prince of illusions
All spinning around in my brain
There’s a mockingbird calling
And this is what he’s saying

Girl stop rockin’
You’re driving me insane
I’m going out of my mind
And I won’t be back again

I was driving down the street
And I saw you in the rain
Now it’s breaking my heart
And I want you back again

I was stirred and shaken
Had a miracle in mind
In the heat of the night
I left it all behind

Girl stop rockin’
You’re driving me insane
I’m going out of my mind
And I won’t be back again

I’m a soldier of fortune
An ambassador of pain
I had the world on a string
And I threw it all away

Girl stop rockin’
You’re driving me insane
I’m going out of my mind
And I won’t be back again

Girl stop rockin’
You’re driving me insane
I’m going out of my mind
And I won’t be back again

Girl stop rockin’
You’re driving me insane
I’m going out of my mind
And I won’t be back again

I won't be back again
