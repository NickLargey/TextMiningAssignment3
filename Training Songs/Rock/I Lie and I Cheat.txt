Every now and then I think about my life
I see it around me and smile
What a happy life I got till now
Till now

Every night I sleep well, and I dream
I dream about everything I'm not
Oh, I'm not a loser

[Chorus]
'Cause I lie, and I cheat
That's why I lay down at your feat, boy
I lie, and I cheat
That's why I lay down at your feat, boy

Every now and then you give me flowers
Mostly the morning after
To show me that I was wrong
So wrong

It took me one hundred years to find you
It's sad I admit
But I can't quit

[Chorus]

Every now and then you blow me a kiss
But then you blew it with your fist
Pride makes me bear these bruises
When you grin
No roses without thorns

[Chorus]

I'm a liar
I'm a cheater
I'm a liar
I'm a cheater
I'm a liar
I'm a cheater
I'm a liar
I'm a cheater
I'm a liar
I'm a cheat
I'm a cheat
I'm a cheater

Every now and then I think about my life
