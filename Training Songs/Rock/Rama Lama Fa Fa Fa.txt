Rama Lama Fa Fa Fa

After some good tokes and a six pack
We can sock 'em out for you till you're flat on your back
You know, I got to keep it up 'cause I'm a natural man
I'm a born hell raiser and I don't give a damn

I'm the man for you, baby
Yes, I am for you, baby
Say, I'm the man for you, baby
Yes, I am for you, baby
I'm the man for you

Workin' here before your momma, soakin' wet
You think you're satisfied, you ain't seen nothin' yet
I said wham, bam, thank you, ma'am
I'm a born ass pincher and I don't give a damn

I'm the man for you, baby
Yes, I am for you, baby
Say, I'm the man for you, baby
Yes, I am for you, baby
I'm the man for you

Rama lama fa fa fa
Rama lama fa fa fa
Rama lama fa fa fa

[Incomprehensible]
Any old time, we can shimmy so good
We'll both be stoned of mind
I got to keep it up 'cause I'm a natural man
Robin Tyner's the name and I kick out the jams

I'm the man for you, baby
Yes, I am for you, baby
Say, I'm the man for you, baby
Yes, I am for you, baby
I'm the man for you
