Well you know sometimes it gets so hard
And everything, everything don't seem to rhyme
I take a walk out in my backyard and go
Do do loo do do, do do loo do do

Waiting for the sun to shine
And you know sometimes it gets so painful
Just like talking to yourself
When everything don't seem to have
No rhyme or reason we all go
Do do loo do do, do do loo do do
Waiting for the sun to shine

We move along
Keep singing our song
Straight to your heart like a cannonball
La la ti da, la la ti da, la la la la la ti da
Doo do loo do do, do do loo do do
Do do loo do do, do do loo do do, do do loo do do
(Waiting for the sun to shine)

Well you know, everyday we hear it
Through the grapevine
I am so sad, tired of hearing it
Through the grapevine anymore
Because you hear it through the grapevine
It's just a dirty rotten waste of time, we go
Do do loo do do, do do loo do do
While waiting for the sun to shine

We move along
Keeping singing our song
Straight to your heart like a cannonball
La la ti da, la la ti da, la la la la la ti da
We move along
Keep singing our song
Straight to your heart like a cannonball
We move along
Keep singing our song
Straight to your heart like a cannonball
We move along
Keep singing our song
Straight to your heart like a cannonball
Straight to your heart like a cannonball
Straight to your heart like a cannonball
Straight to your heart like a cannonball
