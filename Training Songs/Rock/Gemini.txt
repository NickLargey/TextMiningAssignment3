Crusted bloodstains down the nape of my neck
Concussed rhythms swelling in my bed
Who has been controlling everything I do and say?
They sure as hell have made some foul mistakes
Wait, something's shifting in this symmetry
Something's missing in my memory

Somebody's building a monster, it seems
And the parts look a lot like mine
Gemini! Gemini!

Gemini! Gemini!
Gemini! Gemini!
Memory missing
Symmetry shifting?
The old Sun has lumbered into a deep slumber
My Moon is soon on the rise

GEMINI!
