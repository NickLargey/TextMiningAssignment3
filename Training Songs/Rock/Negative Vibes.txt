Lord, Won't you give me the strength to be strong, and be true
Cos, Lord, when the devil gets into my head, I'm so blue

You knock me, if you're so mighty, why waste your time with me
If I'm bad, ignorant and sad
Why waste your time, you're mad
You're just mad, because your life is sad
You've done nothing worth while
Twist the knife
Because you hate your life
My life you want to spoil

I'm never going to let
Your negative vibes and comments
Get through to my psyche and cripple me
I'm never going to let
Your negative vibes and comments
Get through to my psyche and cripple me
I never will forget
The suffering that my people went through
In my country and overseas

Were no use, verbal abuse
That's all you have to give
You preach nil, you're so cynical
Jesus, wake up and live
Your bad vibe will drive away your tribe
And where will you be then
All alone
Heart as cold as stone
Hurting yourself again
