Hopelessly retarded
Spluttering decay
Crying out the lament every night and every day
Hiding in the twilight
X-ray shades
Suffering from constipation, tripping out in space
I've been recoiled into stone age
Covetous a dream
Obnoxious and depraved, waking up in a scream
Sleeping in the morgue
A weird effect on me
Think I lost my consciousness, left reality
My inner circle's helter skelter, echoes lovin' ecstasy
I know I'll find a way to live, a way for you and me
Totally addicted under detrimental spell
And if I had a shotgun, I'd blow myself to hell
Let me be your piggybank for nothing but your smell
If I had a shotgun, I'd blow myself to hell
Squalid and deranged
I'm the outlaw of the kin
Will never be the same again, stuck in deadly sin
I slouch along the street
Instead of struttin' down the block
I still did not recover from that stunnin' cold shock
Away from phony people
Besides the way of life
I won't be blamed for loving you, I'll take you - be my wife
