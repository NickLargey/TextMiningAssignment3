It's just peculiar
How things turned out
Don't need no ABC's
Or no expertise

To see what love's all about
No introductions
Only first names exchanged
No type of seduction

But my love it still came
I'm going through the canyon
These feelings I can't hide
I can't stay away

From you another day
I'll come apart inside
Still I'm going through the canyon
Not knowing what I'll find

I hope that he's still there
I know I wasn't fair
I think I've loved you all that time
I went in with caution

Not expecting to win
Love's hypnotized
Paralyzed
We were more than lovers, we're such good friends

Sad separation
Some other holding me tight
But my inclination
Was to steal away in the night

'Till I'm going through the canyon
These feelings I can't hide
I can't stay away
From you another day

I'll come apart inside
Still I'm going through the canyon
Not knowing what I'll find
I hope that he's still there

I know I wasn't fair
I think I've loved you all that time

I went in with caution
Not expecting to win
Love's hypnotized
Paralyzed

We were more than lovers, we're such good friends
Sad separation
Some other holding me tight
But my inclination

Was to steal away in the night
'Till I'm going through the canyon
These feelings I can't hide
I can't stay away

From you another day
I'll come apart inside
Still I'm going through the canyon
Not knowing what I'll find

I hope that he's still there
I know I wasn't fair
I think I've loved you all that time
