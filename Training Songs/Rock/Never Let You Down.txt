I'm trying to keep my feet on the ground.
I'm getting to like this feeling I've found.
I'm getting to love
The thought of having you around.
And I will never let you down.

Your friends were all well-meaning
When they said "No one is good enough for you."
They play with your emotions.
Dismiss the notion.
Do what you have to do.

'Cause people don't take chances with their hearts.
Since I've met you I am past the hardest part.
So remember one thing:
I will never let you down.

I'm trying to keep my feet on the ground.
I'm getting to like this feeling I've found.
I'm getting to love
The thought of having you around.
And I will never let you down.

Sometimes you feel defeated.
But, it's OK...
You're not the only one.
And all the complications,
The bad situations,
Happen to everyone.
It doesn't matter how it ended, or began.
Sometimes, the best that you can do is change your plans.
I hope you understand that
I will never let you down.
