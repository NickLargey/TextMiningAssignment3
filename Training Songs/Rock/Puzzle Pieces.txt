G-g-g-g-gotta say
Honestly, when you look at me
It's like a gun goes off, deep inside of me
I can hardly move
I can barely breathe, near your features

The t-t-t-t-t-t-trouble is
It's just so obvious
I still see all the lines, of surgery remnants
Where you cut away
Left your flaws behind, in the ether

F-f-face of puzzle pieces
That don't fit together
Puzzle pieces
That don't fit together

It's never right
But you just can't move on
You can't decide
Take away or put on
Your design
But you won't stop working
A masterpiece
In the flesh, it's your puzzle
It's your puzzle
It's yours

D-d-d-doctor's hands
Carry out the plans
To take you all apart and put you back again
Your face is canvas
And your own body serves, as your easel

It's just, it's just, it's just so hard to quit
When you're hooked on it
You're just a junkie craving one more plastic fix
Keep you up to date
With all the latest trends, of the seasons

F-f-face of puzzle pieces
That don't fit together
Puzzle Pieces
That don't fit together

It's ever right
But you just can't move on
You can't decide
Take away or put on
Your design
But you won't stop working
A masterpiece
In the flesh, it's your puzzle
It's your puzzle
It's yours
