Dirty on the ground is what I need
I got another one to tell you
And another one to make you believe
Pity in the grass tried to be
The one you needed when I told you
That you wanted something bigger than me

I've got friends in all the right places
I know what they want
And I know they don't want me to stay
I said that I've got friends in all the right places
I know what they want
And I know they don't want me to stay

'Cause you are not alive
When I need you
I need it quickly
In case you never know

I can't play where I'm not supposed to anyway

Dirty on the ground is what I see
I need another reason why
I need another reason, tell me to breathe
The dirtier the sound, the best I breathe
I tried to do it all for you
It didn't do anything for me

'Cause I've got friends in all the right places
I know what they want
And I know they don't want me to stay
I've got friends in all the right places
I know what they want
And I know they don't want me to stay

And you and I will find
That when I need you
I need it quickly
In fact, you'll never know

I've got friends in all the right places
I know what they want
And I know they don't want me to stay
I said that I've got friends in all the right places
I know what they want
And I know they don't want me to stay

He said I've got friends in all the right places
I know what they want
And I know they don't want me to stay
I've got friends in all the right places
I know what they want
And I know they don't want me to stay
