Somebody told me, somebody told me, somebody told me
Something about you

I didn't believe it, I couldn't believe it, I'm still reeling
'Cause I just can't take the blow

Well, there's laughter and love and there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your pretty face again

Well, there's laughter and love and there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your pretty face again

Well, there's laughter and love and there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your pretty face again

Full of forgiveness, you're just twisted, I'm a silly little saint
With a halo of smiles but it makes no difference, oh well
