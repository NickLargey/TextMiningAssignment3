Everybody says that they're looking for a shelter
Got a lot to give
But I don't know how to help her

I should just let it go
'Til they learn how to grow
And how to liberate

Everybody says that she's looking for a shelter
Got a lot to give
But I don't know how I felt her

They should just let it go
Till these cities learn to grow
And how to liberate

[Chorus]
Silence is easy
It just becomes me
You don't even know me
You all lie about me

Everybody says that I'm looking for a home now
Looking for a boy or I'm looking for a girl now
But I can still let it go
I can still learn to grow
Into a child again

[Chorus: x4]
