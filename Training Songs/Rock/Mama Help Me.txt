If a child lives with money well, he learns to spend his time
If a child lives with crazy he goes out of his mind
I didn't live with nothin' that's worth talkin' about
But I didn't live with nothin' no I never went without
But there is one thing that I really need to know
What do you have to live with before you learn to grow up
Mama, mama, mama, mama help me
Mama, mama, mama tell me what to do
I've taken giant steps I've wlaked far away from home
But I need a little help can I make it on my own
Some days I can and some days I can't
And some days I just don't know where it is I'm at
Mama, mama, mama, mama help me
Mama, mama, mama tell me what to do
Mama, mama, mama, mama help me
Mama, mama, mama tell me what to do
Crazy mean crazy people on the street
Mean crazy mean half the people that you meet
You can't love 'em you can't trust 'em
You can't take 'em anywhere
You can't hold 'em you can't tell 'em
That you ever really care
Tell me where will I go when I cannot go to you
Where I don't know when you go I'm going too
Mama, mama, mama, mama help me
Mama, mama, mama tell me what to do
Mama, mama, mama, mama help me
Mama, mama, mama tell me what to do
Mama, mama, mama, mama help me
Mama, mama, mama tell me what to do
Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy help me
Daddy, daddy, daddy tell me what to do
