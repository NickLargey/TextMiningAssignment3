Oh, the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meanin' what they say now
Never sayin', what they mean
And to while away the hours
In the ivory towers
'Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of black limousine

Lan, da da da da-da, Lan da da da da-dee
Talkin' 'bout you and me and the games people play

Oh', we make one another cry
Break a heart then we say good-bye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die
That the other was to blame
Neither one will ever give in
So we gaze at an eight-by-ten
Thinkin' 'bout the things that might have been
It's a dirty rotten shame

People walkin' up to you
Singin' glory, hallelujah!
And they try to sock it to you, ha
In the name of the Lord
They're gonna teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope and cheat your hate
Come on, get on board

Look around, tell me what you see
What's happening to you and me
God, grant me serenity
Just to remember who I am
'Cause you're giving up your sanity
For your back on humanity
And you don't give a da, da da
