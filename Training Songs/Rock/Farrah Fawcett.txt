i'll get most everything i wanted
 except for farrah fawcett
 i never see her anymore
 i left you while my voice was still changing
 while writing and arranging my life's pathetic little score
 i don't know if i'll ever get over her
 you were the closest thing, almost identical
 as far as i could tell
 like one of charlie's angels
 making out with you there in the closet (oh yeah, oh yeah)
 you reminded me of farrah fawcett (oh yeah, oh yeah)
 promise, you'll never make a promise
 you put me on your hit-list
 (at least you never were a bore)
 i'll take any thoughts you don't use
 i give away what i lose
 everything that i adore
 i don't know if i'll ever get over you
 you were the closest thing, almost identical
 as far as i could tell
 like one of charlie's angels
 making out with you there in the closet (oh yeah, oh yeah)
 you reminded me of farrah fawcett (oh yeah, oh yeah)
 i was still a virgin when i lost it (oh yeah, oh yeah)
 everything seemed like it really, really was
 medals from my tournaments
 d'amour have left me kind of sour
 maybe i should get a whore and charge her after for the hour (woo-hoo)
