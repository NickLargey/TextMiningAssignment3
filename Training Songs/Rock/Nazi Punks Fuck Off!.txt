Punk ain't no religious cult
Punk means thinking for yourself
You ain't hardcore 'cause you spike your hair
When a jock still lives inside your head

[Chorus]
Nazi punks
Nazi punks
Nazi punks, f*ck off!
Nazi punks

Nazi punks, f*ck off!

If you've come to fight, get outta here
You ain't no better than the bouncers
We ain't trying to be police
When you ape the cops it ain't anarchy

Stab your backs when you trash our halls
Trash a bank if you've got real balls

The real Nazis run your schools
They're coaches, businessmen and cops
In a real fourth Reich you'll be the first to go

[Chorus]

You'll be the first to go
You'll be the first to go
Unless you think
