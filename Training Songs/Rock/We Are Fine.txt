Trying hard to breathe, head between my knees
Take my hand and squeeze, say I'm alright.

Whisper in my ear, "happy you are here."
Everything seems clear, and we're alright, we're alright.

Tell me not to trip or to lose sight.
You are walking in my guided light.
Take my hand and help me not to shake.
Say I'm alright, I'm alright.
Say I'm alright, I'm alright.

It's okay to fear, everything is real.
Nothing left to steal 'cause we're alright.
We're alright.

Tell me not to trip or to lose sight.
You are walking in my guided light.
Take my hand and help me not to shake.
Say I'm alright, I'm alright.
Say I'm alright, I'm alright.
Say I'm alright, I'm alright.
