Well I believe there's a crisis
Maybe not scared but a little bit frightened
All of the time there's enough to be sure of one thing
You can't be exact about the next day
Do what you will, do it as you please
I don't need a doctor when I'm feeling alright
Though I have no cause for alarm right here and now
I wouldn't know what happens in an hour from now
I've got the weight of the world and it's resting
There's no immediate help for us all
On every shoulder whose head is protesting
There's another one with their back to the wall
It's another rhyme of time
Assigned to the subconscious mind
The domino effect right next to the pressure valve
Waiting to explode at the drop of a hat
So be it on your guard or something like that
Be it on your guard or something like that
Be it on your guard

[Chorus]
Are we here or are we right
Do you want another life
I can see the future's going round and down
Are we rolling on in vain
Like water going down the drain
I can see the future's going round and down

Who can be sure what the next day's gonna bring about
Whether you can be relied to survive
Is it evident, like an accident
Do you partially forget to look right from left
When you cross the road
Or board the train
Every minute somebody experiences an unforeseen occurrence
They mightn't see it coming
They may not even hear it
Could've been avoided if they heeded all the (warnings)
Who would ever know what the future's gonna hold
Or the way that these events work out
Only sixth sense ringing that alarm in your head
Are you ready to obey or accept the consequence
Are you ready to say what can't be said
Are you ready to pay for someone else

[Chorus]

[Repeat x2]
Are we here
Are we there
Are we anywhere else or do we really care

[Chorus]

Are we here
Are we there
Are we anywhere else or do we really care
