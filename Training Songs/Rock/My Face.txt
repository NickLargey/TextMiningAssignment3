My face is my backstage pass
Like the queen, don't need cash
You won't see me with an empty glass
I got the future, got the pass

Rock the girls, saying I'm obscene
Stick their numbers into my jeans
Places I go and drink for free
They say \"Is it you?!\" It's me!

I will rock you when I come clean
I live a life of which you dream

I work guitar and bass and drums
Singing all the same, singing all the run
I am the saviour, I am the Christ
I am the Satan, the Vishnu, the vice

This is here I am at last
With a rock black leather suit, first class
Saw my face in a magazine
She says \"Is it you?!\" It's me!

I will rock you when I come clean
I live a life of which you dream

Dream on, dream on
I got what you want

I was born... all the fuss...
Eyes move... all over us...
Eyes grow big... in my head...
I tell the town from the boring men

You can dream on, dream on

My face is my backstage pass
Like the queen, don't need cash
You won't see me with an empty glass
I got the future, got the pass

Rock the girls, saying I'm obscene
Stick their numbers into my jeans
Places I go and drink for free
They say \"Is it you?!\" It's me!

I will rock you when I come clean
I live a life of which you dream

Dream on, dream on
I got what you want

Dream on!
