I will come for you at nighttime
I will raise you from your sleep
I will kiss you in four places
As I go running along your street

I will squeeze the life out of you
You will make me laugh and make me cry
And we will never forget it
You will make me call your name

And I'll shout it to the blue summer sky
And we may never meet again
So shed your skin and let's get started
And you will throw your arms around me

Yeah, you will throw your arms around me
I dreamed of you at nighttime
And I watched you in your sleep
I met you in high places

I touched your head and touched your feet
So if you disappear out of view
You know I will never say goodbye
And though I try to forget it

You will make me call your name
And I'll shout it to the blue summer sky
And we may never meet again
So shed your skin and let's get started

And you will throw your arms around me
Yeah, you will throw your arms around me
Oh, yeah
Oh yeah

You will throw your arms around me
Yeah, you will throw your arms around me
