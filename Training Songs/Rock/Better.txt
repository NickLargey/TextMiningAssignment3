Ride around, you fight to fight, you bow your head down
Call the drive, a baby pill, until the sleep on
Singing in the choir for little voices screaming nonsense
Just to see what it will do to the common few
I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
Anybody else

Sitting on top of giant pile, for the worship
And a-sk how to win into our family seats
A little growth asks, so we're not back, but then you can’t imagine
That'll happen-heart and soul and everything between the night and moon
I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
Anybody else

I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
I’ll do it better, I’ll do it better
I’ll do it better than anybody else
Anybody else
