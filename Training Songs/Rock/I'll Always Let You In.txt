Hello, I thought you knew me better
But you don't know me at all
I know, love is like the weather
You can't control when you're gonna fall

You can't brake the ties that bind us, this I know
I'm never letting go, because

I can't face it--I tried to replace it
I cry every night ''cause you're gone
You say you've got something to prove
There's so much to lose
Girl we gotta hold on

I don't really care where you've been
I'll separate the lover from the sin
I'll always let you in

I'm through holding it against you
I just want to hold you, that's all
It's true, I never could forget you
I think it's time to place the call

If you will only see me, baby then you'll know
I'm never letting go, because

I can't face it--I tried to replace it
I cry every night ''cause you're gone
You say you've got something to prove
There's so much to lose
Girl we gotta hold on

I don't really care where you've been
I'll separate the lover from the sin
I'll always let you in

In my heart where you belong
That's where you've been all along

I don't really care where you've been
I'll separate the lover from the sin
It's not too late to get it back again

I can't face it--I tried to replace it
I cry every night ''cause you're gone
You say you've got something to prove
There's so much to lose
Girl we gotta hold on

I don't really care where you've been
I'll separate the lover from the sin
I'll always let you in
