Face in the crowd
You're talking too loud
But I can't hear you calling

Your head in the clouds
Whatever come out
Well I can't see you crawling while we're out

Life of a cloud
Lost in the sound
You can't see me crying

We're out on the town
No fun around
And I'm about to freak out

I been down

The needles and pins
Nobody wins
If you freak out all morning

Merry-go-round
Swim till you drown
I feel it kicking in from all around

With no one around
I'm bound to freak out
And I just keep falling round and round

I been down

I get down

Face in the crowd
You're laughing too loud
But I just keep on falling round and round

I been down
