This is getting hard to bear
Face it I’m not getting through 
I don’t even think you care 
All the things I want for you
I have been your champion
So why do you walk away

I, bought you the sky
And the oceans too
By, the look in your eye
The only thing I couldn’t do
Was fail for you
Don’t ask me to fail for you

Oooh, ooh yeah ah

My neck is so it down with gold
My glory always on display
Strangers in this street behold
You just turn your head away

I will be your victory
But still, you walk away

I, bought you the sky
And the oceans too
By, the look in your eye
The only thing I couldn’t do
Fail for you
Fail for you
Fail for you
Fail for you
Fail for you
Fail for you
Fail for you
Fail for you
