Feel the southern breezes
And the southern wind
Blowin' down around this
Dying land

D'Agostino's late last night I saw
A boy fifteen on the road
Nothing in the pocket
His hand to the sky
Nowhere else to go

Can you see it
Or believe it
What's beyond east orange
And farther yet

Come with me
I'll show you where the
Dogwood's bloom it's true
Lost n' found n' lost again

To the
Honeysuckle Blue

Runnin' through these
Caverns of gold
Runs a river of death indeed
An old hotel serves as a
Shelter for children
Of the street

Abandoned by the promised land
Set sail on your own
How much longer
Will the well
Be dry for those
Who roam

I got a ticket
In my pocket
To send the corner man
He's never been

Have you ever seen the
Blue ridge mountains boy
Or the chatahoochee
To the Honeysuckle Blue
