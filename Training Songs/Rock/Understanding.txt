When people ask me what love's all about
There's one thing I can say
Some people believe just what I'm putting down
Understand your troubles away

[Chorus:]
You got to do this thing we're feeling
You got to know just what I'm meaning
You gotta believe just what I'm handing
Understanding, understanding

Yeah, alright alright
Hey hey
You see I love this life I lead
And I want to love it with you
But people you don't understand
Just what I'm putting down
There's no more I can do

[Chorus]

Yeah, alright, come on
Just don't lose it
Come on children, I want to hear you one more time

[Chorus]

You know what I'm singing about
My baby's gonna care, gonna make it alright
With a little understanding
We can make it through the night, yeah
Baby, baby give me some
You know I got to have some
All you know we need is just a little understanding
You can talk to me baby
Tell me what's on your mind
With a little understanding
Everything will be just fine
