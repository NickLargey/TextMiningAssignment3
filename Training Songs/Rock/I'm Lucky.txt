I'm Lucky
I'm Lucky
I can walk under ladders
Yes I'm so lucky
That I'm as lucky as me

Struck it rich
Dirty rich
No work
And get richer
And the world
Loves a winner
Yes I'm so happy
That you're happy with me

You are happy too
Ain't you baby

Numero uno
Living for
Right now
And it's
L.I.V.I.N.G.
When I'm here with you

I'm lucky
I'm lucky
I don't need a bracelet
No salt
For my shoulder
I don't own a rabbit
No clover
No heather
No cross
No wonder
I'm lucky
