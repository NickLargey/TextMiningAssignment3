The embers, in my soul
Would ignite, a full moon
I wake up, on the floor
With a man, in my room

Another moment waking up
I never want to risk my life
For freedom

Wolf lie down
Are you ready to go?
Wolf lie down
Are you ready to go?

Decemberâ€™s, a long way bro
Disappear, inside me
I wake up, in a hole
With the sun, behind me

How many mornings woken up
I never want to risk my life
For freedom

Wolf lie down
Are you ready to go?
Wolf lie down
Are you ready to go?
Wolf lie down
Are you ready to go?
Wolf lie down
Are you ready to go?

The embers, in my soul
Would ignite, the army
I wake up, on the floor
With the sun, behind me

How many mornings waking up
I never want to risk my life
How many mornings waking up
I never want to risk my life
How many mornings waking up
I never want to risk my life
How many mornings waking up
I never want to risk my life
How many mornings waking up
I never want to risk my life
For freedom
