The tyranny of trying to know
Everything takes over the freedom of the mind
To find it's own quest knowing more about
Lets end lets long, enough stand in, closer
Of violence fair to these not then quandary
Fainting of the tendrils that are in my chest as my mate and me are

[Chorus]
Pull me out
Pull me out alive
Pull me out
Pull me out alive

Oh take me to cities where all hot spots are
Inform the institutions from the defunct
Soviet union when every arrow
Will be defined as post war to be a bossed
College course right if the universe is raised
And then body you will

[Chorus]

(Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
