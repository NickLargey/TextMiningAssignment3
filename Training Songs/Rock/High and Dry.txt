Tell me a story 'bout how you been burned
No one can hurt you, your lessons you've learned
All for the lover with the stars in his eyes
Feelin' the pain of all his bye-byes
Feelin' the pain of all his bye-byes

High and Dry, High and Dry
I could tell you things just ain't the same
Look all around you there's no one to blame
There's a reason for all those years
You do less cryin', there'll be fewer tears
You do less cryin', there'll be fewer tears

High and Dry, High and Dry
You know the road doesn't end,
When it reaches, reaches a bend
High and Dry, High and Dry
I could tell you things just ain't the same

Look all around you there's no one to blame
There's a reason for all those years
You do less cryin', there'll be fewer tears
You do less cryin', there'll be fewer tears
High and Dry, High and Dry
High and Dry, High and Dry
