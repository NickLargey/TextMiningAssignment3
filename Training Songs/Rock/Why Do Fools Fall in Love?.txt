Oh wah, oh wah, oh wah, oh wah, oh wah, oh wah
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do birds sing so gay? 
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love?

Why does the rain fall from above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?

Love is a losing game
Love can a be shame
I know of a fool 
You see
For that fool is me

Tell me why, why, why
Tell me why

Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of day?
Why do they fall in love?

Why does my heart skip a crazy beat?
Before I know it will reach defeat!

Tell me why, why, why
Why do fools fall in love?
