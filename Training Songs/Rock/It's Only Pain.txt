It's only pain
It only hurts
I am only down on the floor
Where I have been before
And I'll be here again
Though it hurts to lose you
It's only pain

We went so far
We flew so high
Now it's not easy
To watch it die
To just let go
And not ask the reason way
It won't matter anymore

It's only pain
It only hurts
I am only down on the floor

Where I have been before
And I'll be here again
Though it hurts to lose you
It's only pain

It's not my style
It's not my way
To see the future
In shades of grey
Though I still can't bring myself to say
That you don't matter anymore

It's only pain
It only hurts
I am only down on the floor
Where I have been before
And I'll be here again
Though it hurts to lose you
It's only pain
It's only pain
