Nothing is touched, I still want you so much
The feelingâ€™s so strong yeah -- but I could be wrong
A love affair ends, and now weâ€™re just friends
The real thing is gone yeah -- but I could be wrong.
In the morning when I wake up and itâ€™s a sunny day
All my troubles seem to fly away
Then I remember, and itâ€™s down and down I go.
I watch the rising of the moon
Darkness always comes too soon
When the night comes falling
Itâ€™s down and down I go.
Now I can see you donâ€™t need me
Youâ€™ll get along yeah -- but I could be wrong.
Day and night Iâ€™ve been soul searchinâ€™ in a stormy sea
All your tears washinâ€™ over me
When the truth comes callinâ€™, itâ€™s down and down I go.
I was dreaminâ€™ of the night we met
So many moments that I canâ€™t forget
When the night comes fallinâ€™, itâ€™s down and down I go.
Now it appears Iâ€™ve cried all my tears
The sadness is gone yeah -- but I could be wrong
Nothing is touched, I still want you so much
The feelingâ€™s so strong yeah -- but I could be wrong.
Time goes by and a love affair ends
Hearts run dry and now weâ€™re just friends
The real thing is gone, weâ€™ll sing you a song
But I could be wrong.
