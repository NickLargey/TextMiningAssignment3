I've been losing sleep
Just nodding sleep
That I wish that I lowed

Hm and I lost all my tapes
Of back masking piece
Just for asking peace
That I ought to be owed

And that’s the rent I’m paying
Just like my brother would say it

Out amongst the stars and the stones
Every kinda fortune gets old
Every kinda line is gonna come back to me
Just as I go

But that’s the rent I pay
Like my brother say it
That’s the rent I pay
Rent I pay
Like my brother say it
That’s the rent I pay

Ooh lala
Ooh lala
Ooh lala
Ooh lala
Ooh lala
Ooh lala
Ooh lala
Ooh lala

I've been losing sleep
And I’m nodding sleep
That I wish that I lowed

Hm and I lost all my tapes
Of back masking piece
Just for asking peace
That I ought to be owed

And that’s the rent I pay
Like my brother say it
That’s the rent I pay

Ah, rent I pay
Like my brother say
That’s the rent I pay

Everybody knows just where you've been going
Everybody knows the faces you've been showing
And if that’s your answer no I ain’t your dancer
And if that’s your answer no I ain’t your dancer
