Well, I've got a brand new lover
I love her, yes I do
She's my one and only
And her name is baby blue

Well now, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby blue, yeah
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby blue-ooh

Well now, when I met my baby
I say, how to do you do
She looked into my eyes and say
My name is baby blue.

Well now, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby blue o-ohhh
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby blue
(Now, now, now, now)

Well, I know my baby loves me
I know that she'll be true
I'm sure of this each time I look
Into her eyes of blue

Well now, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby blue yeah
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby blue
