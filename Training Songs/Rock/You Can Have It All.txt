I tell you what it's going to be like 
I saw you on the bus and that was that 
There's more to this than passing by 
There's more to this than meets the eye 

I tell you what it's going to be like 
I saw you on the bus, I saw your shoes 
They fell apart some time ago, 
I'll buy some more in 5 years 

[Chorus]
It's not my fault, I don't care 
I don't regret a single thing 
It's not my fault, I don't care 
I don't regret a single thing 

I tell you what it's going to feel like 
You've lost a limb and you can feel it 
It's too late, at night, not by my side 
'Cause I'm not there to hold you too tight 

I tell you what it's going to be like 
Well you can never hold my hand in public 
They can't know or understand 
That you and me are now together 

[Chorus]

You can have it all if that's alright 
And I will give it all to you cause you never fight 
You can have it all if that's alright 
And know that you can have it all if it's alright 

[Chorus]

You can have it all if that's alright 
And I will give it all to you cause you never fight 
Before that you could have it all if that's alright 
And I would give it all to you cause you never fight 
Before that you could have it all if that's alright 
If it's alright
