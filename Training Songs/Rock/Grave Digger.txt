I can't run to you, father
I need love
I can't talk to you, mother
I know it's got you caught up

But your sweet sinless sensation is not my style
And I'm not giving up

But tell me if I run away
How long will I bleed?
So tell me if I run away
How long will I bleed?

Colors blend
They're all black and white
God damnit, I can not bend
I'm all shriveled inside

But your sweet sinless sensation is not my style
And I'm not giving up

So tell me if I run away
How long will I bleed?
Tell me if I run away
How long will I bleed?

Ain't no point in tryna picking me up when I'm down
Yeah, you can stick out your hand
And you can lean towards the ground
I'll be tryna suck all of the liquid out the dirt
Tryna catch a curve, digging my own grave
Ooh mama
I'll be tryna suck the liquid out the dirt
Tryna catch a curve, digging my own grave
Ooh mama

But your sweet sinless sensation is not my style
And I'm not giving up

So tell me if I run away
How long will I bleed?
Tell me if I run away
How long will I bleed?
