For all that you breathe in, and all that you breathe out
You just can't breathe any life into something that's expired
Now every tear you've cried, will seem so uninspired
Don't matter what you do, it doesn't matter what you've done

I'll be on your side
I'm on your side
You'll always find me on your side

I've seen your crazy eyes and I've heard your crazy talk
You can say it's just bravado, but go lightly where you go
Cause to see you dig that hole is piercing through my soul
It doesn't matter what you've seen, it doesn't matter where you've been

I'll be on your side
I'm on your side
You'll always find me on your side
