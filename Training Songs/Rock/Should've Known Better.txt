I remember when you told me
You'd never give up
I took for granted all the times you
Gave me your love
Now it's over and you're saying
You've had enough

I wanted to die
When I heard you say goodbye
Now there's nothing I can do
Man, I should've known better

I had to watch you walk away
I should've known better
To think that I would be okay
I should've known better

I'm half the man I was yesterday
All I can say is I should've known better
Should've never let you get away
I should've known better
I should've known better

There's so much pain that lives inside me
That no one can see
A thousand reasons why you left me
Down on my knees
I was blind and you were angry
Now I'm coming clean

I told a lotta lies
And I always made you cry
But there's nothing I can change
Yeah, I should've known better

I had to watch you walk away
I should've known better
To think that I could be okay
I should've known better

I'm half the man I was yesterday
All I can say is I should've known better
Should've never let you get away
I should've known better
I should've known better
I should've known better

I won't let you walk away
?Cause now I know better
Give your love to me today

I had to watch you walk away
I should've known better
To think that I would be okay
I should've known better

I'm half the man I was yesterday
All I can say is I should've known better
Should've never let you get away
I should've known better

Should've known better
Should've never let you get away
I should've known better
I should've known better
