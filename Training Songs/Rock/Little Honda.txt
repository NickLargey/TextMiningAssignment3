GO!
I'm gonna wake you up early cause I'm gonna take a ride with you.
We're goin' down to the Honda shop, I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
Put on a ragged sweatshirt, I'll take you where you want me to.

First gear, it's all right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Second gear, I'll lean right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Faster, it's all right.

It's not a big motorcycle,
Just a groovy little motorbike.
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys,
That two-wheeled bike.
We'll ride on out of town
To anyplace I know you like.

First gear, it's all right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Second gear, I'll lean right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Faster, it's all right.

It climbs the hills like a Matchless,
Cause my Honda' built really light.
When I go in to the turns
Better hang on tight.
I'd better turn on the lights
So we can ride my Honda tonight.

First gear, it's all right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Second gear, Ill lean right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster) 
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Faster, it's all right.
