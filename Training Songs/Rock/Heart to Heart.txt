If to love you is forbidden
Then I'll just have to break the rules
And if our love must be hidden
Then we'll still be together
Because Those fools

Won't stop us meeting heart to heart
Can't stop a beating heart to heart

There's no weapon could deter me
No I won't stop at anything
One more threat it wouldn't acre me
'cause I'm only living for one thing

Won't stop us meeting heart to heart
Can't stop a beating heart to heart

Together we'll still be with each other
Forever just waiting for each other
Together forever

In the morning she awakens
She breaks down and cry 'cause her only
Heart had been taken
And she rather die than live apart

Won't stop us meeting heart to heart
Can't stop a beating heart to heart
