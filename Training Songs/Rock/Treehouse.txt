I have built a treehouse
I have built a treehouse
Nobody can see us
It's a you and me house

I have built a treehouse
I have built a treehouse
Nobody can see us
'Cause it's a you and me house

I've been climbing rocks and stones
Been collecting broken bones
I've been swimming across the lakes
Just to find this perfect place

I got lost into the woods
I've been covered up in mud
I've been going through a lot
Just to find this perfect spot

I have built a treehouse
I have built a treehouse
Nobody can see us
'Cause it's a you and me house

Nobody can see us
'Cause it's a you and me house
