I?ve been on this lonely road so long
Does anybody know where it goes
I remember the last time
The signs pointed home a month ago

Rented cars and empty motel rooms
Lead you everywhere but home
Crowds of people shouting
How they love the show
They don?t know

(*) the endless crowds of faces
Just keep on wearing a smile
The countless times and places lead me back
Please take me back home

(**) I wonder if these feelings ever change
How many times I?ll lift this load
Come tomorrow I?ll be gone again
Roads of sorrows coming to an end for me

Repeat (*)
Repeat (**)
