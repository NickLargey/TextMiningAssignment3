I don't know, am I wasting my time
I'm trying hard, to win this war
And you meanwhile,
Seem content just to lay down and die
You may find, I can't give any more more more
I'm telling you

We're only one step from heaven
Only one step from that golden dream
We're only one step from heaven
What can I say to you to make you feel

Please tell me, that I'm not trying in vain
And we can stop the rain, from falling on down
Who can say, come tomorrow it may be too late
Our last chance, to find direction home home
I'm telling you

One step from heaven
Can't you see
