They've got you movin' to the city
Oh my, you think you're lookin' pretty
But they've got their pistols too
Tucked down beneath their shoe
It's a new sensation
World annihilation
Moving to the music
Patiently it's waitin'
The city's screamin'
I can hear them breathin'
Cryin' out for wisdom
Hungry minds are feedin'

I know that you're tired of this
Cause you're a robot
They designed your life
But true souls said you know what's right
And you can join us on the other side

Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared?

They've got you marching to a drum beat
Oh my you got another nose bleed
They'll keep you so amused
You'll never taste the truth
It's a new creation
Total domination
Chains across your shoulders
Social captivation
Kill our leaders
Persecute our teachers
Criticize our culture
Crucify free thinkers

I know that you're tired of this
Cause you're a robot
They designed your life
But true souls said you know what's right
And you can join us on the other side

Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared?

Fill our eyes with money
Vanity that's cunnin'
Only on the surface
Diamonds look so stunnin'
Mass deception
Altered our perception
Sold it to the children
Made a new connection

I know that you're tired of this
Cause you're a robot
They designed your life
But true souls said you know what's right
And you can join us on the other side
