That's the way I like it
That's the way I want it
That's the way I like it
And that's the way I want it

I'm a dumb ass
I go too fast
When I shouldn't be moving at all
I know I'm the last

And your only chance
At having something meaningful
I won't ever be tricked into thinking that she loves me
Because no one does and no one will

I won't ever be tricked into thinking that she loves me
Because no one does and no one will
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I want it

I jump into things
Buying wedding rings
When I can't keep myself in line
Try to stop myself

Put it on its shelf
And save it for another time
I won't ever be tricked into thinking that they love me
Because no one does and no one will

I won't ever be tricked into thinking that they love me
Because no one does and no one will
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I want it

That's the way I like it
That's the way I want it
Here I am again left to my own devices
This is the last time

Anyone can bring me down
I won't ever be tricked into thinking that she loves me
Because no ones does and no one will
I won't ever be tricked into thinking that they love me

Because no one does and no one will
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I want it
And that's the way I like it

And that's the way I want it
That's the way I like it
That's the way I want it
That's the way I like it

That's the way I want it
That's the way I like it
