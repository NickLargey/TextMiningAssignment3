I'm losing my love of adventure.
I'm losing all respect for me and myself tonight.
I wonder what happens if I get to 
The end of this tunnel and there isn't a light.

I've worn down the treads on most of my tires.
I've worn down through the elbows and the knees of my clothing
And I'm striding down 
The gravel drive-way of desire,

Trying not to wake up my sleeping self-loathing.
Do you ever have that dream, 
When you open your mouth and you try to scream,
But you can't make a sound?

That's every day's starting now.
That's every day's starting now.
Don't tell me it's going to be all right.
You can't sell me on your optimism tonight.

Don't tell me it's going to be all right.
You can't sell me on your optimisn tonight.
It's a stiff competition to see who can stay up later:
The stars or the street lights.

All they really want is to be alone with the darkness
No more "Wish I may" no more "Wish I might".
It takes a stiff upper lip just to hold up my face
I gotta suck it up and savor the taste of my own behavior.

I am spinning with longing
Faster than a roulette wheel
This is not who I meant to be, 
This is not how I meant to feel

Have you ever had that dream,
Where you open your mouth and you try to scream, 
But you can't make a sound?
That's every day's starting now.

That's every day's starting now.
Don't tell me it's going to be all right.
You can't sell me on your optimism tonight.
Don't tell me it's going to be all right.

You can't sell me on your optimism tonight.
I don't think I am strong enough
To do this much longer.
God I wish I was stronger.

This song could never long enough
To express every longing.
God I wish it was longer.
I don't think I am strong enough

I don't
I don't
Think I can
I don't think  I

I wish I
I
