There's a fool born every minute babe
But this time it isn't me
It doesn't take 20/20
To see what I can see
Don't want to hear nothin' bout nothin'
Don't want to hear how you are sincere
Cause your actions speak louder
Than the words you whisper in my ear

Don't tell me nothin's going on
I can feel it down in my bones
You can say that everything's alright
But its me going for that walk alone
I don't want to hear your promises
I know the truth and you're lying
It's all over, all over, over but the crying

Go on and talk all you want baby
Just gonna sit right over here and listen
Just go ahead little girl
You've got my undivided attention
Oh, but I've been listening
To what you tell me with your eyes
Those blue, blue windows
Just can't disguise

Don't tell me nothin's going on
I can feel it down in my bones
You can say that everything's alright
But it's me going for that walk alone
I don't want to hear your promises
I know the truth and you're lying
It's all over, all over but the cryin'

You can laugh about it later
You can tell yourself it served me right
You've painted a picture I can't forget
You've laid it out in black and white

Don't tell me nothins going on
I can feel it down in my bones
You can say that everything's alright
But it's me going for that walk alone
I don't want to hear your cheap promises
I know the truth and you're lying
It's all over, all over
Over but the cryin'

Over but the cryin'
Over but the cryin'
Over but the cryin'
