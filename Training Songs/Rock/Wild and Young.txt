I fell in love with a southern girl
I gave her wings
But she don't wanna fly no more

Slow it down
Slow it down

She wants a ring
And she's slamming the door
"But baby don't cry
Whatcha in a hurry for?"

Slow it down
Slow it down

We are wild and young
We have just begun

So slow it down you move a little too fast
You take a deep breath, you make this last
These should be the best days of your life
So right, so right, tonight

I said we are wild and young
Oh, we are wild and young

Well, her free fall came a little out of the blue
What happened to the days of doing what we wanted to do?

Slow it down
Slow it down

Well, we should kick back
And getta have a little fun
Two kids getting high
Have a couple beers in the sun

Slow it down
Slow it down

While we are wild and young, yeah
Oh, we have just begun

I said we are wild and young
Oh, we are wild and young
We are wild and young
I said we are wild and young

Go on, slow it down you move a little too fast
You take a deep breath, you're making it last
I say that these should be the best days of your life
So right, so right, tonight

I said we are wild and young
I said we are wild and young
Oh, we are wild and young
