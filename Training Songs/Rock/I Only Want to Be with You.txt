I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never want to let you go
You started something
Won't you see
But ever since we met you've had a hold on me
It happens to be true
I only want to be with you

It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I want to spend each moment of the day with you
Love has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
Asked if I cared to dance
I fell into your open arms
And I didn't stand a chance
Now listen honey

I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey I don't care
You started something
Won't you see
But ever since we met you've had a hold on me
No matter what you do
I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
Asked if I cared to dance
I fell into your open arms
And I didn't stand a chance
Now hear it honey

I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey I don't care
You started something
Won't you see
But ever since we met you've had a hold on me
No matter what you do
I only want to be with you
Oh no matter, no matter what you do
I only want to be with you
