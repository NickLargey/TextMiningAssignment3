You think that you're so cool
That you're nobody's fool
But you've got a personality
Just like a bucket full of pee

How does it feel
To be a real asshole?
You're such a creep
You look like a sheep asshole

You know you've got no shame
And you've got such a stupid name
And one day you'll finally shut your trap
'Cause you are the cream of the crap

How does it feel
To be a real asshole?
You're such a creep
You look like a sheep asshole
Asshole asshole
You're such an asshole

You always look like an idiot
This may be news for you
You are the king of all stupidness
Maybe I'm an asshole too
Maybe I'm an asshole too
Just like you

You're such an asshole

How does it feel
To be a real asshole?
You're such a creep
You look like a sheep asshole

How does it feel
To be a real asshole?
You're such a creep
You look like a sheep asshole

You're such an asshole
Maybe I'm an asshole too
Maybe I'm an asshole too
