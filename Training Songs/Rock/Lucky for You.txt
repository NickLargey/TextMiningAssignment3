Once in a while 
When I'm sleeping 
My horses are wild 
And I'm weeping 
Just like a child 
I wake up dreaming that I've been loved 

Nights are in blue 
And castillian 
Thinking of you 
Senses reeling 
Diving into 
This illusion that I have been loved 

Lucky for you 
You know what to do 
When somebody hurts you 
Somebody enters your life then disappears 
Leaves you in tears 
Stirs up your fears 
If you have a clue 
About what to do 
Then that's lucky for you 

Still lucky for me 
You're amazing 
You made me see 
Sparks come blazing 
I was lucky to be 
Made to feel like I had been loved 

Lucky for you 
You know what to do 
When somebody hurts you 
Somebody enters your life then disappears 
Leaves you in tears 
Stirs up your fears 
If you have a clue 
About what to do 
Then that's lucky for you 

I didn't think you would sacrifice 
The love I made you receive 
I'd pay a grand for some paradise 
But I'm just too scared to believe
