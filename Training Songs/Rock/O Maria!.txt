Show me your stripes
Said the zebra to
The wicked spider
In the morning dew
I will provide
For you shelter and wine
If you can prove
That you are of my kind"

O ho Maria!
I'd break my wooden bones for you
You took my crystal heart
And shook it through and through
O ho Maria!
You broke my brittle bones in two
You shook your silver hair
And sent me to the moon

And then the spider
Turned onto its back
Displayed the colors
In three neat tracks
And said, when we go
We go alone

And so they crossed
The windy field
The spider provided
By the zebra's heels
And every bird
From above did cry
You will be bitten boy
And you'll surely die

O ho Maria!
I'd break my wooden bones for you
You took my crystal heart
And shook it through and through
O ho Maria!
You broke my brittle bones in two
You shook your silver hair
And sent me to the moon

We may be different
Two sides of the same fence
You bring your elegance
And me my dumb strength

You were so kind to me
Beneath the willow trees
You took my hand in yours
And I got down on my knees

They said I couldn't see it clear
They said that it would disappear
But when they came and sang their sermon
It fell upon deaf ears

Because I see but I cannot hear
And I feel but I cannot fear
And I know you to be true
When I saw you first come near

O ho Maria!
I'd break my wooden bones for you
You took my crystal heart
And shook it through and through
O ho Maria!
You broke my brittle bones in two
You shook your silver hair
And sent me to the moon
O ho Maria!
I'd do it all again for you
