I can't see another way
We're burning into feeling blue
Just tell me I'm burning out
I know every word is true

Older and older
The voice of wasted youth has never been so loud
Over and over
Like powder in the barrel pushin' deeper down

Give up, swallow it all, again
Swallow it all come on
Swallow it all

And now rise and now repeat
We deserve evereything we own
The long road to transience
The tightrope between our bones

All we are golden
Every other step is met with vicious eyes
Strangers and lovers
Sugar-filled assurance in between the lies

Give up, swallow it all again
Swallow it all come on
Swallow it all

Come on, swallow it all, come on
Swallow it all, give up
Swallow it all again
Swallow it all come on
Swallow it all
