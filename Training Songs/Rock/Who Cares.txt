You get so tired of chasing dreams; you think that nothing's true
You start to question everything, everything you do
Feeling scared but you don't know why, so you tell yourself you're doing all right
You're sick of all the empty days that make you so afraid of the night

And if you try to read a book and get between the lines
It doesn't matter where you look; you're only wasting time
When you meet somebody else, and you try to think of something to say
Even while you stand there talking you know your mind is drifting away

You get so tired of chasing dreams; you think that nothing's true
You start to question everything, everything you do
Feeling scared but you don't know why, so you tell yourself you're doing all right
You're sick of all the empty days that make you so afraid of the night
