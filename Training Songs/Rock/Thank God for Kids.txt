If it weren't for kids have you ever thought
There wouldn't be no Santa Claus
Or look what the stork just brought thank god for kids
And we'd all live in a quiet house without Big Bird or Mickey Mouse
And cool-Aid on the couch thank god for kids
Thank god for kids there's magic for a while
A special kind of sunshine in a smile
Do you ever stop to think or wonder why?
The nearest thing to heaven is a child
Daddy, how does this thing fly?
And a hundred other where's and whys
You really don't know but you try thank god for kids
When you look down in those trusting eyes that look to you, you realize
There's a love that you can't buy thank god for kids
Thank god for kids there's magic for a while
A special kind of sunshine in a smile
Do you ever stop to think or wonder why?
The nearest thing to heaven is a child
When you get down on your knees 
Tonight to thank the Lord for His guiding light
And pray they turn out right thank god for kids mmm thank god for kids
