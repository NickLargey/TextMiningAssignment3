Dear God, it's me again down here
Don't wanna sound insincere
I'm lost, sometimes you're so unclear
What can I do?
I'm feeling so far from you
Frustrated, irritated
Disconnected from it all
The weight of the world
Has pushed me to the wall

I surrender, to you I'm giving in
Come take me, save me
I want to start again
I'll open my broken heart
Cause I've reached the end
And you are the way to begin

I've seen a million empty smiles
Living in denial
I don't wanna live like that
Where northing's real
I hate how it is to feel

Frustrated, irritated
Disconnected from it all
I'm breaking, I'm aching for something beautiful

All the riches in this world
Couldn't fill this great big hole
It takes something so much more
Only you can take me
You can make me whole

I surrender, to you I'm giving in
Come take me, save me
I want to start again
I'll open my broken heart
Cause I've reached the end
And you are the way to begin

I surrender, I surrender
It's not the end, this is the beginning
