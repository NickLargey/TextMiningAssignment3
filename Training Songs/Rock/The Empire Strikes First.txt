We strike first 
And we're unrehearsed 
Here we go again 
To stage the greatest show on heaven and earth 
Come on, get your money's worth 

Don't want to live 
(can't live) 
Don't want to give 
(can't give) 
Don't want to be 
(won't be) 
E-M-P-I-R-E 
Don't want to live 
Don't want to be 
E-M-P-I-R-E 

We're comin' on fast 
And we're built to last 
We struggled once in 'Nam 
Now we're glad to finally say 
Those days have passed 
Tell me how long can it last! 

Don't want to live 
(can't live) 
Don't want to give 
(can't give) 
Don't want to be 
(won't be) 
E-M-P-I-R-E 
Don't want to live 
Don't want to be 
E-M-P-I-R-E 

We just started out 
You don't need to be afraid 
Yeah you deserve to be attained 

And our breathing hearts burst 
But even ten million souls 
Marching in February couldn't stop the worst, 
Couldn't reverse 

Don't want to live 
Don't want to give 
Don't want to be 
E-M-P-I-R-E 
Don't want to live 
Don't want to be 
E-M-P-I-R-E 

I can't live 
If it isn't with you
