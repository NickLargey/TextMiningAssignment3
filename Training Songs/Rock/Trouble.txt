Trouble hangs around my head 
It's safer not to leave my bed 
I'll just live my life through books 
'Cause I hear the real thing has a pretty bleak outlook 

If trouble hangs around then alright 
When trouble comes home ruins lives 

Trouble rents a house near me 
All I need is a hell-raising neighbor 
Copied me a brand-new key 
I would like to resist but I don't think I'm able 

If trouble hangs around then alright 

When trouble comes home ruins lives 

Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 
Down down down down 

Ruby says I am no fun 
But I'd be 'round the block before she had come along 
If I'm not in bed by closing time 
Send for the calvary 

If trouble hangs around then alright 
It's when trouble comes home ruins lives 

Down down down down
