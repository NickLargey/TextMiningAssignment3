I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old jukebox
But when my money's all gone I'm on the telephone
Hollerin' hey hey mama can your daddy come home

I'm living fast and dangerously but I've got plenty of company
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down
That's when I want to see the lights of town
Cause I'm a honky tonk man

I'm a honky tonk man

It takes a purty little gal and a jug of wine
That's what it takes to make a honky tonk mind
With the jukebox a moanin' honky tonk sound
That's when I wanna lay my money down
Cause I'm a honky tonk man
