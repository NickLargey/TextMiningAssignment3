I got a letter from the taxman I owe
I got a message from the president I owe
He said disobey the constitution ya owe
But it's not my generation that owes

And they tell us to lay low
We got you under control
And they don't know right from wrong
But they'll bring you all along
Let's go

I got a lawsuit from my best friend I owe
I got this itchin' irritation I owe
Mr. Policeman said no misbehaving I owe
He said give a little bit give a little bit give some more

And they tell us to lay low
We got you under control
And they don't know right from wrong
But they'll bring you all along
Let's go

I said the FBI the CIA the FDA the NSA
Our HMOS our PPOS the CEOS and the USA

And they tell us to lay low
We got you under control
And they don't know right from wrong
But they'll bring you all along
Let's go

C'mon c'mon
I said now all we need is love, all we need is love, all we need is love....
