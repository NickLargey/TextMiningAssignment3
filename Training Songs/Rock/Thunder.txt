Oh, sevens worth a say, like a lie, five and one
My favourite died in pain, by a guy, son of a gun
He jumped through the horse, I guess
Disappeared, no mess
Hell! We'll just have to rest, follow me down
If you can, follow slowly

Thus enter as we may, by a hole, in the floor
Deep darker than the black, seemed to hear
Many a rat
Tried harder as I fought, thought my life
Finally brought

Knees trembling in my legs
Wish to get out, out and about
Out and about
Here, now, fear, let me free
Now, here, now
Don't leave me fast here, oh please
You won't let me live again
This way

Come, don't be so afraid, by the fire, sit beside
Change all your whims and cares
To the tide of the night
This thought occurred to me
Did the ghost disappear?
Fire deep my heart, my soul, chase him off
Very clear, very clearly
