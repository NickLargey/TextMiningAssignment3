The tops of trees are on fire
And tonight these torches give us light
That we might have some direction in our lives.
But I can't see much of anything right now.
No I can't see.
I watched you come home from the mountains.
We all just thought it was a bad dream,
But in reality we knew the honest to god truth.
Now all we ask is a little sympathy from the clouds.
Now isn't it fate we're chasing after?
Or is she chasing after us?
Or has she come to kiss us our death depart?
We finally have a full understanding,
But I wish it wasn't on these terms.
Friend to friend.
I would do anything to make it end.
