What makes them walk away, after all these years?
These years of learning and the hard way by the lessons from the tears
I know it's not a game
But it feels like losing when someone you love throws you away

I'd fix it
I'd fix it
I'd fix it
I'd fix it if I could
And I'd always win
I'd always win
So you can always win the in end

How easy was it for you making those plans you made?
Before I became someone for you you know to try to dislocate
Oh, I know it's not a game
But it feels like losing when someone you love throws you away

I'd fix it
I'd fix it
I'd fix it
I'd fix it if I could
And I'd always win
I'd always win
And you would always lose

Look what I did to you
Look what you did to me
Fixed it
I'd fix it, I'd fix it if I could
And I'd always win
And I'd always win
I'd always win in the end
