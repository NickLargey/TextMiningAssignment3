Yo-Yo
The Osmond
(Joe South)

Ho, ho ho, just like a yo yo.
Ho, ho, ho, just like a yo yo.
Well it's hard for me to see
how you got such a hold on me.

First I'm up, and then I'm down.
Then my heart goes around and around.
Well, I'll bet you five dollars I'm the only fool
who'll climb up a string for you.

And need I say I can't break away,
you control every little thing I do.
I used to be a swinger,
until you wrapped me 'round your finger....

Just like a yo yo,
just like a yo yo.
Ho, ho, ho, just like a yo yo.
Ho, ho, ho, just like a yo yo.
Turnin', turnin' love keeps a-burnin'
like a fire in my heart
when we're apart, but when we're back together,
you keep changin' like the weather.
Whoops! Now up and down like a yo yo.
Just like a yo yo.

Ho, ho, ho, just like a yo yo.
Ho, ho, ho, just like a yo yo.
Where I go, and what I do,
well it all just depends on you.
You build me up just to let me down.
But I dare not to make a sound.

'Cause I'm so afraid you will cast me away
like a beat up, worn out toy.
So I hold on tight with all my might,
just to be your lovin' boy.
No matter what you say or do,
I'm gonna bounce right back to you now
just like a yo yo.
Just like a yo yo.

Ho, ho, ho, just like a yo yo.
Ho, ho, ho, just like a yo yo.
