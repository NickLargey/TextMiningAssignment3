I don't know why I love you like I do
After the things that you put me through
You stole my money, my cigarettes
I haven't see hide nor hair of you yet
I want to know, won't you tell me
I'd really love to stay

Take me to the river, and wash me down
She cleans my soul
Put my feet on the ground
I don't know why you treated me so bad
After the things we could have had
Love is emotion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen will never regret
Oh want to know, won't you tell me
I'll be in love to stay
Take me to the river

Hold me, love me
Please me, tease me
Till I can, till I can

I don't know why I love you like I do
After the changes you put me through
Your sixteen candles are right on my wall
They tell me who made a fool of them all
I want to know, won't you tell me
I'll be in love to stay

Take me to the river
Take me to the river
Take me to the river
Walk me to the water
Walk me to the water
Take me to the river
Just walk me to the water
Walk me to the water
Take me to the river
Take me to the river
