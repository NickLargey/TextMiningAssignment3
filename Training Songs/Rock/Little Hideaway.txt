We got a little hideaway that we go to
When we're alone together
A little place where we can go
And get to know each other

A place to see the sun
When the day is done
Hold on to that feeling
We've been missing

Oh we got a little hideaway
A place we go on special days

Try to get to know each other

A place to see the sun
Far away from everyone
Hold on the that feeling

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Ooh ooh ooh aah

Well we got a hideaway
A place we go on special days
Try to get to know each other
Hideaway
Far away from everyone
Aah
