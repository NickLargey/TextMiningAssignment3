When the girl in your arms is a girl in your heart, 
Then youve got everything,
When youre holding the dream, you can dream when you hold, 
You're as rich as a king,

So hold her tight and never let her go 
day and night let her know you love her so.
With the love of your life, spend a lifetime of love 
Make her young forevermore

So hold her tight and never let her go
