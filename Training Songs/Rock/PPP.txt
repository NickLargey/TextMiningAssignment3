Out in the heartland
I looked into your eyes
And I asked
"Are you ready?
Ready for this life?"

Did you see it coming
It happened so fast
The timing was perfect
Water on glass

Like tracing figure
Eights on ice in skates so well
And if this ice should break it would be my
My mistake

Between the cities
Between the thrills
There's something inside you
It doesn't sleep well

It won't last forever
Or maybe it will
The white clothes they gave you
You wear them so well

Someone once told me
In love, that you must
Place all you're given
In infinite trust

Yet I'm tracing figure
Eights on ice in skates so well
And if this ice should break it would be my
My mistake
