Help me get my feet back to solid ground
Cause were walking to the devil's beat 
And it's trying to bring us down.

Well the devil's get us rolling a six-sided dice
And it's burning up the oils and melting down the ice 
And the bank tills are ringing to through tune of war 
Do you ever wonder what it is we're fighting for?

Oh it don't feel so good when the sun don't shine
Oh we gotta leave this place leave it all behind
Oh before I lose my head and I lose my mind 

Help me get my feet back to solid ground
Cause were walking to the devil's beat 
And it's trying to bring us down.

Sweet mother nature's such a lonely girl 
What's she gonna do when we sell the world
Time will only tell if the prophecy's true 
Has the devil got the beat or has the beat got you. 

Oh it don't feel so good when the sun don't shine
Oh we gotta leave this place leave it all behind
Oh before I lose my head and I lose my mind 

Help me get my feet back to solid ground
Cause were walking to the devil's beat 
And it's trying to bring us down.
Come on and help me get my feet back to solid ground
Cause were walking to the devil's beat 
And it's trying to bring us down.

Oh it don't feel so good when the sun don't shine
Oh we gotta leave this place leave it all behind
Oh before I lose my head and I lose my mind 

Help me get my feet back to solid ground
Cause were walking to the devil's beat 
And it's trying to bring us down.
