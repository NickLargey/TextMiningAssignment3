Be bop, I love you, baby.
Be bop, I don't mean maybe.
Be bop, I love you, baby.
I'm stickin' with you.
I'm stickin' with you.

Years may come and a-go.
I will love you so.
No matter where we go,
I'm stickin' with you.
I'm stickin' with you.

New loves may come your way,
But my love's here to stay.
This is why I say,

Be bop, I love you, baby.
Be bop, I don't mean maybe.
Be bop, I love you, baby.
I'm stickin' with you.
I'm stickin' with you.

New loves may come your way,
But my love's here to stay.
This is why I say,

Be bop, I love you, baby.
Be bop, I don't mean maybe.
Be bop, I love you, baby.
I'm stickin' with you.
I'm stickin' with you.
