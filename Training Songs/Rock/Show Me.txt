I would like to see
All that no one knows
Just to see the reason
We must feel alone
Walking on my path
I don't do much more than that
Where to put my mind
Lord show me a sign
Show me suffering
Humankind can bring
Show me what's inside 
So I can see things right
Show me
I woke up to you
In a love and groove
I fell off my mind
Running around inside
Love has such an energy
Guaranteed to keep the world afloat 
Here here
Here here
When I start to run inside
I must still come out
I must hold my head up high
And know all these things
They can change 
With love
They can change 
With love
They can change
With love
