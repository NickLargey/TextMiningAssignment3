The universal eyes tell me where to go
White line movin' slow
Million miles an hour headfirst and alone
All I got is tuck and roll
All through my head
It's happenin' over again
Under forty over is u.f.o.
Hell bent stacked in rows
The galaxy is lined with hundreds more
Small town you bet we?re sure
All through my head
It's happenin' over again

As the day is long they keep movin' on

Laughin' at the notion of a signal light
Knew we'd gone too far
No one knew what happened but it seemed alright
We quickly jumped in the car
All through my head it's happenin' over again

King of the road says you move too slow!
