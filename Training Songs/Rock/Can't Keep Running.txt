Don't ask me where I'm going, I don't know
Which way the wind is blowing, I don't know
We've been over this again and again
Talking 'bout it only drives me insane
Think I'd rather take a walk in the rain

I know, I know I can't keep running
I know, I know you've taken about enough
I know I can't keep running
And I know you don't want someone
Running in and out of your life

This ain't no game we're playing, I need time, yeah
Listen yeah, to what I'm saying, I need time
Guess I saw it coming right from the start
I can't bring myself to break her heart
When I do it's gonna tear me apart

I know, I know I can't keep running
I know, I know you've taken about enough
I know I can't keep running
And I know you don't want someone
Running in and out of your life

Can't escape it, I gotta face it
Don't wanna leave you with your heart on the line
I can't refuse you, don't wanna lose you
Can't you see that I'm running out of time?

I know, I know I can't keep running
I know, I know that you've taken about enough
I know I can't keep running
And I know you don't want someone
Running in and out of your life

I know I can't keep running
I know you've taken about enough
I know I can't keep running
And I know you don't want someone
Running in and out of your life

I know I can't keep running
I know, I know I can't keep running
I know I can't keep running
I know, I know I can't keep running
