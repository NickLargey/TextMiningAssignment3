I know you're not the only one
That warned me and you told me so
I never took your advice
I never though that she could hurt me so
But here I am, I'm down on my knees
Somebody help me please
Tell me what it's like

To love someone
When they don't love you
To need someone
When they don't need you
To love someone
When you're down and out
Tell me what it's like
When you can't find out
Somebody

I never had a chance
She left, she didn't even say goodbye
I never thought she was that kind
But I was wrong, too late I realize
That it's over and I know that we're through
Can't somebody tell me what to do?
Tell me what it's like

To love someone
When they don't love you
To need someone
When they don't need you
To love someone
When you're down and out
Tell me what it's like
When you can't find out
Somebody

It's over and I know that we're through
Can't somebody tell me what to do?
Tell me what it's like

To love someone
When they don't love you
To need someone
When they don't need you
To love someone
When you're down and out
Tell me what it's like
When you can't find out

Tell me what it's like
To love someone
When they don't love you
To need someone
When they don't need you
