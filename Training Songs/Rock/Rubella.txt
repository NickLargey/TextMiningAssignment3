I'm inflamed with desire and its spreading like wildfire
She doesn't know it but she'll soon be mine
Its just a question of time
Rubella

I'm insanely obsessed and I simply will not rest
She doesn't know it yet but she's the one
And I won't stop until I'm done
Rubella

And the heart that she has stolen has swollen twice its natural size
I've lost six pounds since I laid eyes on her
Rubella

I'm in love with a girl she's affected my whole world
She doesn't know it but she's inside me
And now I'm gone completely
Rubella

She explodes like a fist and she burns from the first kiss
I haven't told her but she's all mine now
I knew some how I'd catch her
Rubella, Rubella, Rubella
