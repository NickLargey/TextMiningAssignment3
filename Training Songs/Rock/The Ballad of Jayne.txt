She was always something special
Diamond shining bright in the rain
Everybody dreams of angels
No one would ever know
How much I love you so

Now it all seems funny, kinda like a dream
Things ain't always what they seem
What a shame, what happened to Jayne

You were always on my mind
Shine like a summer day in the sun
Slowly wishes turn to sadness
Time don't heal a broken gun
I wish I never let you go
Even now I just want you to know

That it all seems funny, kinda like a dream
Things ain't always what they seem
What a shame, what happened to Jayne

Now she's breakin' hearts in heaven
Shinin' bright in the sky
I still hear her voice in the wind
I still think of you in the night, oh yeah
Well I guess you'll never know
How much I need her so

Now it all seems funny, kinda like a dream
Things ain't always what they seem
What a shame, what a shame
What happened to Jayne

Now it all seems funny, kinda like a dream
Things ain't always what they seem
What a shame, what happened today
What happened today
