Well, it was nearly summer we sat on your roof 
Yeah, we smoked cigarettes and we stared at the moon 
And I'd show you stars you never could see 
Baby, it couldn't have been that easy to forget about me 

Baby, time meant nothing, anything seemed real 
Yeah, you could kiss like fire and you made me feel 
Like every word you said was meant to be 
No, it couldn't have been that easy to forget about me 

Baby, even the losers get lucky sometimes 
Even the losers keep a little bit of pride 
They get lucky sometimes 

Two cars parked on the overpass
Rocks hit the water like broken glass 
I should have known right then it was too good to last 
God, it's such a drag when you're livin' in the past 

Baby, even the losers get lucky sometimes 
Even the losers keep a little bit of pride 
They get lucky sometimes 

Baby, even the losers get lucky sometimes 
Even the losers keep a little bit of pride 
Yeah, they get lucky sometimes 

Baby, even the losers get lucky sometimes 
Even the losers get lucky sometimes

Even the losers get lucky sometimes
