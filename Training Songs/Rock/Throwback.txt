Turn back the pages in the rays of the sun
Throw back Thursday to the way that it was
When we were young, when we were young

Scroll back in time through your account
Watch your face grow younger as real time runs out
Throw back Thursday to the way that it was
When we were young, when we were young

Oh, all the potential in the world
When we were young
All the potential in the world
When we were young, when we were young

Stop me if you've heard this one before
You know you caught my eye as I was headed out the door
I swear I know your face from another time, another place
When we were young, when we were young

Oh, all the potential in the world
When we were young
All the potential in the world
When we were young, when we were young

Who knows how much time we ever really have?
Together in this life or on our separate paths
We go through so many days, so many lives, so many ways
We fall apart, we come together, so in love
Yeah, to be loved, to be loved, loved

Oh, all the potential in the world
When we were young
All the potential in the world
Still living now, living now
Now
