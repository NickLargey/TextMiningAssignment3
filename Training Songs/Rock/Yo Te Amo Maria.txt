I'm a poor peasant boy, I'm a dirt farmer's son
And I feel like a king when I know that my work is all done
For at twilight I know, there's a place I must go
To sing my song of love for one who waits all alone

Yote amo Maria, Maria amor
Yote amo Maria, Maria mi amor

Oh, the beautiful sights of the great city lights
Where most people must run to try to have fun, not for me
For this woman of mine is much sweeter than wine
And I spend all the time I can find with my Marie

Yote amo Maria, Maria amor
Yote amo Maria, Maria mi amor

Oh, the joy of my life will one day be my wife
And we'll spend all our days watching the world roll on by
When her time comes to fly to that home in the sky
I pray the angels above will love her as much as I

Yote amo Maria, Maria amor
Yote amo Maria, Maria mi amor
