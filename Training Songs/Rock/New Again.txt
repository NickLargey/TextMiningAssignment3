Well my dear what long arms you have
All the better to hold you down
Slap my wrist with that sweet consequence

What are we, what are we to do
What are we to do with you
(Hey hey)
What are we what are we to do
What are we to do with you

Well I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
(Quite enough)
Well I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
(Quite enough)

Well my dear what deep roots you have
All the better to hold you down
We'll live inside the branches
Your family's nest asks
Boy where have you been
Well you don't know where I've been

What are we to (to do with you)
What are we to (to do with you)

I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
(Quite enough)
Well I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
(Quite enough)

Don't (don't) know (know) where I've been (where I've been)
Don't (don't) know (know) where I've been (where I've been)

My dear what long arms you have
All the better to hold you down

I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
(Quite enough)

You don't know where I've been
No you don't know where I've been
You don't know where I've been
You don't know where
You don't know where, no

I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
Well I am, I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
