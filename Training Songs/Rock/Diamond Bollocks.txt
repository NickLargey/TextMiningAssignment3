Looking back at some dead world 
That looks so new 
Offices and fountains that they named for you 
Dazzlements of accidents 
Rejoice their doom 
Hari-karis spinning round the golden looms 

Girl you dream infections 
From a nauseous heart 
Choice cut meats 
From derelict boulevards 

Hear that lonesome whistle blow 
No direction to be known 
In a senile revelry 
A tearful gaze turns away 
Emoting cold and grey 
Scented eunuchs 
Clothe our wretchedness 

Looking back at some dead world 
That looks so new 
Offices and fountains that they named for you 
So ungrateful to the who's and what's-his-face 
Terrorist confections 
Look so out of place 

Looking back at some dead world 
That looks so new 
Looking back at some dead world 
That looks so new 
Looking back at some dead world 
That looks so new 
Looking back at some dead world 
That looks so new 
Looking back at some dead world 
That looks so new
