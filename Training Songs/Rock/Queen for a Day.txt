I'm the base of the boardwalk
Hair teased up, I'm torn up
I'm gonna think myself silly 
'Til I'm not silly anymore
I'm gonna make myself silly 
Until I'm not really anymore
And I think I'm gonna be okay
And I'll be queen for a day

Queen for a day
Queen for a day

Tomorrow will be trounce
I'm talking trippy 
On a wave length (trippy on a wavelength)
The sun will be bouncy (oh so bouncy)
Today will be past tense
And I can make it to tomorrow if I make this show
I can make it all show be vulnerable
I'm gonna win up all their sorry 
Be the one to get the gold
I'll be queen for a day

Queen for a day
Queen for a day
Queen for a day
Queen for a day

When space invades there will come my turn
Once pigs fly past the moon
But tonight I've tuned out you
Yeah, tonight eclipsed your mood

Queen for a day
Queen for a day
Queen for a day
God, I need this
Queen for a day
Queen for a day
Queen for a day
God, I need this
