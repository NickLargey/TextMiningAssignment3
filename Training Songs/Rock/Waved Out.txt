Corroded lime I chased
From my old window world
Seemingly like an ancient demon
Waking up and waved out

Class examples of an onioned diagram
Im here to follow footfalls
Of a wasted plan 
Ive been waved out

And next there comes a positive post
The options arent so good
Plus once the intervention begins
Its painful

Forgive me, I must go
Ive been waved out
Ive been waved out
