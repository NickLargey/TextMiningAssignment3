Don't let it get you down
You see me crying

Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, what's the words that I said
Honey, what you done to your head

You see me crying
So hard to understand

Please say you'll stick around
And I got to be your lover, honey
Let me take you to town
And I'll show you everything that I Know
And I'll never gotta let you down
'Cause my love is like a merry go round

Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, what's the words that I said
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, what's the words that I said
