I’ve been down to North Marine Drive
A road curling round by your sea
A sea that matches all of your moods
A place where we always agree

And I’ve been down to North Marine Drive
Where I have scratched our names in the sand
And watched the sea take them away
Two names scratched in every spray

And I’ve been on a desolate cliff
Where once a great castle had been
And stood, with the wind in my mouth
On a wall so the sea could be seen

And here a chapel once stood
But now, just a handful of stones
But we, we are building it up
Ours as we stand here alone
