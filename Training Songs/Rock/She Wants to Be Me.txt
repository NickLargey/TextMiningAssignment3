At first I told myself
I need my head inspected
I notice little things
Same t-shirt and sun glasses
Then it got weirder see
She cut her hair like me
She bought a red guitar
Kept driving round in my car

I'm kissing her and she
She slams me against the wall
She crashed into a bus
Chasing some super model
She's analysed my smile
She's memorised my phone book
She always wears my clothes
Her favourite words are WOOOHOO!

She looks like, does like, sounds like me
She's stealing my identity
And I'm begging you
Somebody notice me somebody notice
I'm fading away here
What have I got to do to make you see
My girlfriend is a wannabe
And she wants to be me

I'm saying something's wrong
She's out back playing soccer
She used to do ballet
Now she's a heavy smoker
She's so obsessed with me
That she stands up to pee
And now her stupid games
Have started taking over
Don't need no special help
Don't need to see a doctor
I know you're worried but
I'm telling you just watch her
Looks like she's cracked my code
Knows things I've never spoke of
She wants sex all the time
And still find time to f*ck off

She looks like, does like, sounds like me
She's stealing my identity
And I'm begging you
Somebody notice me somebody notice
I'm fading away here
What have I got to do to make you see
My girlfriend is a wannabe
And she wants to be me

Me I'm not joking
She won't stop provoking me
I'm going under
What have I got to do to make you see
My girlfriend is a wannabe
And she wants to be me

I'm in the loony bin
Wearing a pale pink nighty
The nurse comes through the door
And whispers so politely
"Your boyfriend's here to see you
Look pretty and take a bath
I love his silly band
Can I get his autograph?"

She looks like, does like, sounds like me
She's stealing my identity
And I'm begging you
Somebody notice me somebody notice
I'm fading away here
What have I got to do to make you see
My girlfriend is a wannabe
And she wants to be me

I'm not joking
She won't stop provoking me
I'm going under
What have I got to do to make you see
My girlfriend is a wannabe
And she wants to be
She wants to be
She wants to be me
