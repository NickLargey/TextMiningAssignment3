When you wake up (I woke up) from a bad dream to the howling
of a lonely night
You feel (felt) the walls come closing in like the victim of
a one-way fight

I don't remember many yesterdays, I left a lot of things undone
Now I'm back and I'm here to say I'm looking after number one
Oh! Don't go where the road don't go
Oh, Don't go where the road don't go

Seeing people on the freeway takes me back to where it all begun
I was riding on a big wheel, I was walking in a midnight sun
I did a lot of favors then and asked for nothing in return
Now those friends have all disappeared, I guess there's still so much
to learn

[Chorus:] 
Oh! Don't go where the road don't go 
Oh, Don't go where the road don't go
Oh, Don't go where the road don't go
'cause you'll never run, you'll never outrun the gun
Now I'm the man up on the wire 
Not sung] Now I'm the man behind the wheel
When I said it don't come easy
Well I sure know how that feels

[Chorus: x2]

Don't go, don't go, don't go where the road don't go
