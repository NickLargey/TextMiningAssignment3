How did we feel that way?
I can't see what was happening
Do you still remember
How it came to be another way?

Two into time
Yes, we passed by as one together
Give us a chance too
Making songs and signs for
Open mind
Other people, must they see in through our blinds?
No of course no
At the time it was fine

Ain't life a disaster?
You go too deeply

I know what you're feeling
Does not fit in reality
You can't leave the scene now
That's more than you can tolerate

Later on too
Stop the showdown
You can star in
Some scene you feel freely
