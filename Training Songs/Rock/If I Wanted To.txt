Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

If I wanted to, I could do anything right
I could dance with the devil on a Saturday night
If I wanted to, I could turn matches to gold
smoke, drink, swear, and I would never grow old
I wouldn't have to be in love with you
If I only wanted to
If I only wanted to
 
If I wanted to, I could run fast as a train
Be as sharp as a needle that's twisting your brain
If I wanted to, I could turn mountains to sand
Have political leaders in the palm of my hand
I wouldn't have to be in love with you
If I only wanted to
Hey, if I only wanted to

I could leave tonight, and I would be all right
Stop holding on if I wanted to, if I only wanted to

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

If I wanted to, I could be as patient as death
Fix this hole in my heart leaking into my flesh
If I wanted to, I could turn sparks into ice
There'd never be another woman
Who could make you think twice
I wouldn't have to be in love with you
If I only wanted to, if I only wanted to

Hey, if I only wanted to
Hey, if I only wanted to

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh

Ah, hey if I wanted to
hey hey hey hey
if I wanted to
hey hey hey hey
if I wanted to
if I wanted to

oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh 
oh oh oh oh, oh
