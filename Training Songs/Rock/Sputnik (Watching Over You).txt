A satellite crashed down last night
On your front lawn
I came to see if you're alright
But you were not alone

I will be around, don't count me out
Take a look around, I'm counting down
Even though I feel like I'm in outer space
Watching over you

A cosmonaut crashed on my spot
On your front lawn
You played along, put your spacesuit on
And blasted off

I will be around, don't count me out
Take a look around, I'm counting down
Even though I feel like I'm in outer space
Watching over you

Another night another flight
I watch you go
If I don't tell you how I feel
You'll never know

I will be around, don't count me out
Take a look around, I'm counting down
Even though I feel like I'm in outer space
Watching over you
