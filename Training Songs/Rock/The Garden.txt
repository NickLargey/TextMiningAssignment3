THE GARDEN

I ran to the garden and the rose touch my nose and the grass touch my toes and I thought of you

I looked to the sky and the sky was passing by like a lazy butterfly and I thought of you

Oh what will I do if you never come true
What will I do
What will I do
What will I do
If you never come true
What will I do
What will I do
