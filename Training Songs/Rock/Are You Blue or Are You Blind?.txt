Sleep clouds disperse and settle on my bed 
Leave my eyes, but cling like cobwebs to my head
It's like a book I never read
All the dust inside my head

Can't be bought and you can keep tomorrow 
Can't be saved, there ain't no flies on me
Can't be caught, the plague that ate your soul
Can keep away from me

Down the evening rain falls
Waltzing round my feet
Paints reflections of the houses on my street
Drawn out as the night draws in
By the sound of laughing
The smell of sin

Can't be bought and you can keep tomorrow 
Can't be saved, there ain't no flies on me
Can't be caught, the plague that ate your soul
Can keep away from me

Smile again for me
As if you're going to say
Nothing could have done all this
Then gone away
I may have just saved my life
On a childish whim or a pretty rhyme

Can't be bought and you can keep tomorrow 
Can't be saved, there ain't no flies on me
Can't be caught, the plague that ate your soul
Can keep away from me (x2)
