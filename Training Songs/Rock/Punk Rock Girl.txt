One Saturday I took a walk to Zipperhead
I met a girl there and she almost knocked me dead

(Punk rock girl), please look at me
(Punk rock girl), what do you see?
Let's travel round the world
Just you and me, punk rock girl

I tapped her on the shoulder
And said do you have a bell?
She looked at me and smiled and said she did not know

(Punk rock girl), give me a chance
(Punk rock girl), let's go slam dance
We'll dress like Minnie Pearl
Just you and me, punk rock girl

We went to the Philly Pizza Company and ordered some hot tea
The waitress said "well no, we only have it iced"
So we jumped up on the table and shouted anarchy
And someone played a Beach Boys song on the jukebox
It it was California Dreamin'
So we started screamin'
On such a winter's day

She took me to her parents for a Sunday meal
Her father took one look at me and he began to squeal

(Punk rock girl), it makes no sense
(Punk rock girl), your dad is the vice president  
Rich as the Duke of Earl  
Yeah, you're for me punk rock girl

We went to a shopping mall
And laughed at all the shoppers
And security guards trailed us to a record shop
We asked for Mojo Nixon
They said he don't work here
We said if you don't got Mojo Nixon then your store could use some fixin'

We got into her car away, we started rollin'
I said how much you pay for this
Said "nothin' man it's stolen"

(Punk rock girl) you look so wild
(Punk rock girl) let's have a child
We'll name her Minnie Pearl
Just you and me
Eat fudge banana swirl
Just you and me
We'll travel round the world
Just you and me
Punk rock girl
