Well I ask ya
What a way to treat a guy
What a way to cheat and lie
Because I wanted you

Well I ask ya
Did you have to bring me down
Did you have to go to town
And smash my world in two

Don't think you're getting away with it
You're gonna pay me some how
You cruelly wrecked my life
But oh you want me now
Oh baby just you ask me
Get down on your knees and try

I won't break till I see you cry
Like me when I ask you
Alright

Don't think you're getting away with it
You're gonna pay me some how
You cruelly wrecked my life
But oh you want me now

Just you ask me
Get down on your knees and try
I won't break till I see you cry
Like me when I ask you

Well I ask ya
Well I ask ya
Well I ask ya
Well I ask ya
