Whoa

One look from you
Could turn anybody inside out
You tie me down
So tightly I can't move around
I scream and shout
Ecstasy
Um ha
Ecstasy

Tear down the barrier
Bring me to my knees
I feel the beat cross over me
In waves of ecstasy

Your pass day is due
But it won't make a stranger out of me
Some girls just say
That'll never be the kind of love I need
I scream and shout
Ecstasy
All right
Can't live can't live without
Ecstasy
Hey hey
Ecstasy
Girl come on
I like it
We going up
Whoa
Whoa
Um ha
Oh yeah
Tear down the barrier
Bring me to my knees
I feel the beat cross over me
In waves of ecstasy

I scream and shout
Ecstasy
That's right
I can't can't live without
Ecstasy
Whoa
I scream and I shout
Ecstasy
That's what I say
I can't live without
Ecstasy
Yeah yeah
