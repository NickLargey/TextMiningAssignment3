I'll tell you what I've done 
I'll tell you what I'll do 
Been driving all night 
Just to get close to you 

Baby babe, I'm moving so fast 
You'd better come on 
The moon is alright 
The freeway's heading south 

My heart is going boom 
There's a strange taste in my mouth 
Baby babe, I'm moving real fast 
So try to hold on 
Try to hold on 

Sleeping in my car, I will undress you 
Sleeping in my car, I will caress you 
Staying in the backseat of my car, making out 

So come out tonight 
I'll take you for a ride 
This steamy ol' wagon 
The radio is getting wild 
Baby babe, we're moving so fast 
I try to hang on 
Oh, I try to hang on 

Sleeping in my car, I will undress you 
Sleeping in my car, I will caress you 
Staying in the backseat of my car making love, oh yeah 
Sleeping in my car, I will possess you 
Sleeping in my car, certainly bless you 
Laying in the backseat of my car, making out 

The night is so pretty and so young 
The night is so pretty and so young 
So very young 

Sleeping in my car, I will undress you 
Sleeping in my car, I will caress you 
Staying in the backseat of my car making love, to you 
Sleeping in my car, I will possess you 
Sleeping in my car, certainly bless you 
Laying in the backseat of my car, making out, making out

Sleeping in my car, I will undress you 
Sleeping in my car
The night is so pretty and so young, yeah
