Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand here in the rain
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls

She takes just like a woman
She makes love just like a woman
And then she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamines, and her pearls

She takes just like a woman
She makes love just like a woman
And then she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

It was raining from the first, and I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear

That I just can't fit
I believe it's time for us to quit
But when we met again, are introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry, and it was your world

You take just like a woman
You make love just like a woman
And then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl
