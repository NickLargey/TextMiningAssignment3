Seems the world needs a change in its attitude
It doesn't seem like there's much that a man can do
They try to sell the earth on a wild crusade
Then complain about not bein' paid

How can some people have the nerve, hell hasn't froze but it's on the verge
It's gone way past the point of greed, how many lifetimes will we need

[Chorus]
'Cause it's never enough, they keep on takin' till they take too much
'Cause it's never enough, it won't be long until they run out of luck

We've been bought and sold for a thousand years
And all I got to show is a six pack full of tears
And all the while the fat cats they watch from the hill<
Nothin's changed, it never has an' never will

You better strap on your sharpest spurs
For the ride of your life, 'cause it's gonna hurt
You can't say you didn't ask for this
It's too late to find somebody's ass to kick

[Chorus]

Who's got the money and who gets the rent
By the time it's all over, you ain't got a cent, hey, hey

How can some people have the nerve, hell hasn't froze but it's on the verge
It's gone way past the point of greed, how many lifetimes will we need

[Chorus x2]
