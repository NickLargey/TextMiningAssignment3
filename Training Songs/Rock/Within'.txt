Cry without tears
See without sight
Night without day
And every day's black as the night

Fly without wings
Feel without touch
Touch without feel
And everywhere nothing is real

I want to see from within
I want to be where I've been
I want a truth not a lie
I want to live 'fore I die

Life without death
World without end
Sleep without dreams
And nothing is quite what it seems

I want something more than you'll know
Follow myself and go where you can never go
And I see though my eyes are closed

I want to see from within
(Cry without tears)
I want to be where I've been
(See without sight)
I want a truth not a lie
(Night without day)
I want to live 'fore I die
(And everywhere nothing is real)
(Touch without feel and everywhere nothing is real)

Inside you without your blessing
Inside me is me confessing
Outside you is outside me
And inside there is no guarantee

I want to see from within
I want to be where I've been
I want a truth not a lie
I want to live 'fore I die

I want to see from within
(Life without death)
I want to be where I've been
(World without end)
I want a truth not a lie
(Sleep without dreams)
I want to live 'fore I die
(And nothing is quite what it seems)

I want something more than you'll know
Follow myself and go where you can never go

Cry without tears
Night without day
