I'm standing at the raceway 
And I've got dust in my hair 
For some reason I feel lonely 
For some reason I don't care 
Watching them pack their cars away 
Where they'll be tomorrow 
Ain't where they are today 

ANd I've been thinking about your sweetness 
And I can't wait to wrap my arms around this 

I'm standing at the raceway 
And I'm singing a song 
I'm standing at the raceway 
Knowing soon I'll be gone 

And I've been thinking about your sweetness 
And I can't wait to wrap my arms around it
