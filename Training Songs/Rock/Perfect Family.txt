I feel it in my head, I feel it in my tiny heart
The way the world is built I'm sure that it will blow apart (HEY!)
The way the world is built I'm sure that it is killing me
This little horror show is barely even thrilling me

Somebody's talking to me (Who is it? Who is it?)
Sounds like the perfect family (Who is it? Who is it?)
Somebody's staring at me (Who is it? Who is it?)
It looks like the perfect family

The father's in the den, his pipe is filled with razor blades
The mother's hanging from the little crochet noose she made
And if you're wondering where the children are at twelve at night
They're dumpster diving & they're rolling bums as high as kites

Somebody's talking to me (Who is it? Who is it?)
Sounds like the perfect family (Who is it? Who is it?)
Somebody's staring at me (Who is it? Who is it?)
It looks like the perfect family...Well, well, well, well...

Feels so safe with them

Somebody's talking to me (Who is it? Who is it?)
Sounds like the perfect family (Who is it? Who is it?)
Somebody's staring at me (Who is it? Who is it?)
It looks like the perfect family...The perfect family...
The perfect family...The perfect family...
