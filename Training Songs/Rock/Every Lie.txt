So where did you sleep the night before
I doubt that your phone was dying
I'm supposed to believe that was what you wore
Said you were alone, I don't buy it

Now I can't stay

Surrounded by
Every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time
But why would you
Think you're gonna make it right
But how could you
So I can't stay
(surrounded)
Surrounded by
(surrounded by)
Every lie

You might as well just stop crying
It doesn't mean much to me anymore
A little too late to start trying
I'm taking this love of the life support

Now I can't stay

Surrounded by
Every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time
But why would you
Think you're gonna make it right
But how could you
So I can't stay
(surrounded)
Surrounded by
(surrounded by)
Every lie

Every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time
But why would you
Think you're gonna make it right
But how could you
So I can't stay
(surrounded)
Surrounded by
(surrounded by)
Every lie

Trying to undo
The love that I'm tied to
Who haven't you lied to?

With every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time
But why would you
You think you're gonna make it right
But how could you
So I can't stay
(surrounded)
Surrounded by
(surrounded by)
Every lie

Every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time
But why would you
Think you're gonna make it right
But how could you
So I can't stay
(surrounded)
Surrounded by
(Now you know why)
No I won't stay
(surrounded)
Surrounded By
(every lie)
Every lie
