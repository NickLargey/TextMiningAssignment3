If I promise that I’ll be real good you wanna take me out
No touching or feeling anything
If I promise that my hands don’t move, you wanna tuck me in
No touching or feeling anything
If I promise that my legs stand still, you wanna run your mouth
No touching or feeling anything
If I promise that my head don’t spin, you want a piece of my mind
No touch or feeling

Whatchu two timing for? (Avatar) I’m on my way, I’m alive
Whatchu two timing for? (Avatar) I’m on my way, I’m alive

I think you started in my head, but I’d stop anything for you
If I promise that my nose don’t bleed, you wanna cut my chase
No touching or feeling anything
If I promise that our eyes don’t lock, you wanna steal my soul
No touching or feeling

Whatchu two timing for? (Avatar) I’m on my way, I’m alive

I think you started in my head, but I’d stop anything for you
Fall asleep at the door committing a statutory folklore, you let yourself
Faking out the mall lines, sucking up your cosigns, poster prima-don't minds

If I promise that I’ll be real good you wanna take me out
If I promise that my hands don’t move, you wanna tuck me in
If I promise that my legs stand still, you wanna run your mouth
If I promise that my head don’t spin, you want a piece of my mind
