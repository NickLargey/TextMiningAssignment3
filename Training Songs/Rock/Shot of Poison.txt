Got a love for destruction
Got a feel for danger now
Hey Mr. Moonlight won't you follow me down
I need some company
Every guy tells me your no good
That's all right with me

Give me one shot of poison
A little twist is all I need
One drop of your sweet poison
Sets me free
Come on baby, poison me
 
Got a hunger for a fatal attraction
I'm savin' all my passion for you
I got a heart break habit that I can't kick 
Only you can ease the pain
I'm a midnight animal trying to score
Before I go insane

Give me one shot of poison
A little twist is all I need
One drop of your sweet poison
Sets me free
One shot of poison
A little taste of paradise
One drop of your sweet poison
Satisfies
 
Give me one last kiss before I die
I'm flying high
Oh, I want your love  - tonight
Baby, one shot of poison
A little twist is all I need
One drop of your sweet poison
Sets me free
 
One shot of poison
A little taste of paradise
One drop of your sweet poison
Satisfies
 
One shot of poison
Come on baby, poison me
One drop of your sweet poison
Sets me free
 
One shot of poison
