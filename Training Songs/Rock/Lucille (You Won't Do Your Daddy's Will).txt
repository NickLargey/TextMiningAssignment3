Lucille, you won't do your daddy's will
Oh, Lucille, you just won't do your daddy's will
Well, there ain't nothing to you, but I love you still

Oh, Lucille, please come back where you belong
I've been good to you, baby
Please don't leave me alone

Well, I woke up this morning
Lucille was not in sight
Asked my friends about her, but all their lips were tight
Lucille, you won't do your daddy's will
Well, there ain't nothing to you
I love you still

Well, I woke up this morning

I've been good to you, baby
Please don't leave me alone

Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart
I can't come around, baby, but you gave me such a wonderful start
