Hey, hey, it's me on the radio
Everybody knows my name
I'm a flying leather neck
I even got my own plane
The wild girls they hand you
Passions on a plate
We blew minds in the Carolinas
Now I'm ready for the Tennessee state

We're out on the road who live in motels
We all live a different kind of life
We out on the highway for a living
We may never ever see the light
Way down in Memphis
There's a king upon a golden throne
But when darkness fell across the tracks
I made my soulpatrol
I fell in love with a cute little fan
Emeretta was just sixteen
A guiding light, shining bright
Within this American dream
We out on the road who live in motels ..

Shining bright in my American dream
Shining bright in my American dream
Shining bright in this American dream
Gotta follow this American dream
Could have stayed here forever
Never ever wanted to leave
But we made a vow to stick together
And follow this American dream
We out on the road who live in motels ..
