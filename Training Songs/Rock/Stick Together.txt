Burning the candle is all I can handle
We'll save energy if we stick together 
Taking you over a shy casanova
We'll save energy if we stick together now Stick together now

I've seen what I'm doing and what I'm doing is best for me
And it's all gotta go before we're done
It's the only kind of opinion that I could give to anyone 
I could give to anyone

Burning the candle is all I can handle
We'll save energy if we stick together 
Taking you over a shy casanova
We'll save energy if we stick together 

Burning the candle is all I can handle
We'll save energy if we stick together 
Taking you over a shy casanova
We'll save energy if we stick together 
Now 
Stick together

Know what you're coming for
No need to tell you no more
A little bit in store keeps us guessing
