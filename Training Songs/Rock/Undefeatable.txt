I feel a lack of gravity, lost the weight of love
Feel my demons pulling me, but I won't give up
Hollow chains cut into me, tangled up on tongues
Ghosts that came to set us free, they lift us up
To kingdom come

We are the stars and the suns
The unforgettable ones say
(Wooooh oooooh)
And when we reign from above
The undefeatable ones say
(Wooooh oooooh)
The undefeatable ones

We are, the undefeatable ones

Here among the fallen leaves, can you feel it in your bones
There's a fire burning bright, that will free your soul
Can you see it in the moonlit sky
We can leave this world behind
We don't need no gravity, no
We don't need no gravity

We are the stars and the suns
The unforgettable ones say
(Wooooh oooooh)
And when we reign from above
The undefeatable ones say
(Wooooh oooooh)
The undefeatable ones

We are, the undefeatable ones

So I stood up straight and took my time catching my breath
I brushed off the dust and then I buried all the stress
I feel like I'm ready, I'm ready to go
I'm ready to make my way home

We are the stars and the suns
The unforgettable ones say
(Wooooh oooooh)
And when we reign from above
The undefeatable ones say
(Wooooh oooooh)
The undefeatable ones

We are, the undefeatable ones
