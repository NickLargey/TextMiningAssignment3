Yonder come little Maggie
With a dram glass in her hands
She's out running, with a new girl
With another, sorry man

Last time, a saw  Maggie
She was sitting by the sea
With her forty-four all around her
And her banjo on her knee

Phone her, can I? Everstanding
Just to see those two blue eyes

Witch on a chalion, like a diamond
Like a diamond, in the sky oh

I'm going down, to the station
With my suitcase all in my hand  Oh how can I ever stand it
I'm going away, away to leave you
In some far out distant land hey hey, hey hey
Hey oh
