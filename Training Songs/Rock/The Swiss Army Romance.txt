Sleep with all the lights on
You're not so happy
You're not secure

And you're dying to look cute
In your blue jeans
But you're plastic just like everyone
You're just like everyone

And that face you paint is pressed
Impressing most of us as permanent
But I'd like to see you undone

College night will draw the crowds
Dorms unload and you're heading out
Here is your moment to shine
Making up a history
It's nothing from the life you lead
But man, will they buy all your lines

Sleep with all the sheets off
Bearing your mattress 
Bearing your soul

And you're dying to look smooth
With your tattoos
But you're searching just like everyone
You could be anyone

And those friends you have are the best
Impressing most of us as permanent
But I'd like to see you undone

Youth's the most unfaithful mistress
Still we forge ahead to miss her
Rushing our moment to shine
Making up a history
It's nothing from the life you lead
But man, will they buy all your lines

We're not twenty-one
But the sooner we are
The sooner the fun will begin

So get out your fake eyelashes
And fake I.D.s
And real disasters ensue

It's cool to take these chances
It's cool to fake romances
And grow up fast

And grow up fast
And grow up fast
