I've got to go out
I won't be late
You've got to put your trust in me
I swear I shall not forsake

Hey little darling, I won't be late
Oh pretty baby, don't you lie awake
I'll give you love when I get home
It won't be long, it won't be long

Of course I love you, of course I love you
You know I love you, you know I love you
Of course I love you, of course I love you
You know I love you, you know I love you

Of course I love you, of course I love you
You know I love you, you know I love you
Of course I love you, of course I love you
You know I love you, you know I love you
I won't be late, I won't be late

When you talk yourself to sleep that way
Won't you dream that I'll be in your arms again, again, again

Oh pretty baby when I walk through the door
You'll be wonderin' what I did it for
Tell me, darling, tell me please
Why you miss me so badly

Of course I love you, of course I love you
You know I love you, you know I love you
Of course I love you, of course I love you
You know I love you, you know I love you
Suspicion, suspicion

Of course I love you, of course I love you
You know I love you, you know I love you

When I'm away I get afraid
When I feel when I'm away
With my deep blue eyes
My deep blue eyes

Suspicion

Of course I love you, of course I love you
You know I love you, you know I love you
Of course I love you, of course I love you
You know I love you, you know I love you

Suspicion, suspicion
Suspicion, suspicion
I love you, I love you, I love you
Do it like this, do it like this

Of course I love you, of course I love you
You know I love you, you know I love you
Of course I love you, of course I love you
You know I love you, you know I love you...
