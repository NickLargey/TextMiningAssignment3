I don't know my telephone number
But you kiss good and I'd like to
See you tomorrow
And I don't beg, I pay, I don't barter

And if we had a child I'd like a son,
Not a daughter
'Cause she'd be just like you
And you know that would not do

I'm no builder, I'm no gardener
I sing some songs, have a friend
Who's a photographer
There ain't no other language

I know how to speak
Some like their water shallow
And I like mine deep, so very, very deep
Tied to the bottom
With a noose around my feet

The clouds conspire
Above my head
I overheard them
Say I wish he was dead

Today the sunset
Oh it burned my eyes
And in the next room I hear someone cry

I like to dress up like the jury
Eat like a king, to poke fun at clergy
To talk like dirt
To love you like tar
But never fall in too fast

With my north star
While you pull your hair out
I buy the drinks at the bar

The clouds conspire
Above my head
I overheard them
Say I wish he was dead

Today the sunset
Oh it burned my eyes
And in the next room I heard someone cry
See it's never very far away
See it's never very far away
