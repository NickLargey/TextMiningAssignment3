Through the water
And through the flames
My baby left me
Without a trace

She took my money
And left the ring
And she didn't leave one clue
Of where she was going to

My baby up and left me alone
She signed 'Goodbye' on the letter that she wrote
My baby up and left me, now
Mr. Therapy Man, I need to ask you how can I live on?
Live on

Hey, hey
How could she do it? Break my heart away
When she used to be the one crying when we were apart?
I gave her all of me, gave her my soul
And that was exactly what she stole from me

Well my baby up and left me alone
She signed 'Goodbye' on the letter that she wrote
See, my baby up and left me, now
Mr. Therapy Man, I need to ask you how can I live on?
Live on

'Cause now she stole my heart away, she took my heart
Took my money, she left the ring
She didn't leave one clue
Of where she was going to
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Mr. Therapy Man

Through the water
And through the flames
My baby left me
Without a trace
