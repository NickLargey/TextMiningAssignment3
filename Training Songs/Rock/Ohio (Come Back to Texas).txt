She said she needed a break
A little time to think
But then she went to Cleveland
With some guy named Leland
That she met at the bank

There's nothing wrong with Ohio
Except the snow and the rain
I really like Drew Carey
And I'd love to see the rock 'n' roll hall of fame

So when your done doing whatever
And when your through doing whoever
You know Denton county will be right here waiting for you
Come back to Texas
It's just not the same since you went away
Before you lose your accent
And forget all about the lone star state
There's a seat for you at the rodeo
And I've got every slow dance saved
Besides the Mexican food sucks north of here anyways

I think I made a mistake
It's not that easy to take
She went to make a deposit
Then she cleaned out her closet
Guess I'll sit here and wait
For her to come back home
(I wish she'd come back home)
It shouldn't take very long
(so long, so long)
I bet she misses the sunrise
And misses the fruit flies
But I could be wrong

So when your done doing whatever
And when your through doing whoever
You know Denton county will be right here waiting for you
Come back to Texas
It's just not the same since you went away
I bet you missed your exit
And drove right on through the lone star state
There's a seat for you at the rodeo
And I've got every slow dance saved
Besides the Mexican food sucks north of here anyway

Troy Aikman wants you Back
Willy Nelson wants you Back
NASA wants you Back
And the Bush twins want you Back
And Pantero wants you back
And Bluebell wants you back

I got a premonition
of taking a petition
And the whole states gonna sign

Come back to Texas
It's just not the same since you went away
Before you lose your accent
And forget all about the lone star state
There's a seat for you at the rodeo
And I got every slow dance saved

Come back to Texas
It's just not the same since you went away
Before you lose your accent
And forget all about the lone star state
There's a seat for you at the rodeo
And I got every slow dance saved

Besides the Mexican food sucks north of here anyway

Besides the Mexican food sucks north of here anyway

Besides the Mexican food sucks north of here anyway
(yeah)
