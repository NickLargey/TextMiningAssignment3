I see you got yourself a brand new bag
You had enough of the imitation drag
Although you're leaping to the latest thing
You can't ignore the suspicion of a hallow ring 

Big bills
Cheap thrills 
Style kills 

You say you set your standards way too high 
So you convincingly effect a compromise
Some unsuspecting body's gonna pay 
When you discover that you can't always
Have your way 
Big pain, big pills, style kills 
If he won't you will style kills 
You say your lover's gotta a lot of nerve
Cause he won't keep you in the style that you deserve
You kid yourself you're only marking time
Till you fulfill the revenge in the back
Of your mind
Clear out, no frills, style kills 
You never take the blame for your mistakes 
Why should you give anyone an even break
If he won't you will style kills
