Walk on a lonely street
Don't know where I am
I don't understand

Lost in the wilderness
And apart for you
In the solitude

No matter where I go, I can't forget
Sometimes I wish we'd never met

You're my weakness
In the middle of the night
And I wonder who you're dreaming of

You're my weakness
And it's hard as a fight
Lying here without you
And I'm feeling like the end of the world
The end of the world

My heart is an empty place
For a memories
That I can't erase

Time could be standing still
And for all I know
It forever will

Without my arms around you I feel cold
And even losing all control

You're my weakness
In the middle of the night
And I wonder who you're dreaming of

You're my weakness
And it's hard as a fight
Lying here without you
And I'm feeling like the end of the world

Give me a reason to give up on you
Watching and waiting
The show that the stars, to shine on you

You're my weakness
In the middle of the night
And I wonder who you're dreaming of

You're my weakness
And it's hard as a fight
Lying here without you, lying here without you

You're my weakness
In the middle of the night
And I wonder who you're dreaming of

You're my weakness
And it's hard as a fight
Lying here without you
And I'm feeling like the end of the world
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
