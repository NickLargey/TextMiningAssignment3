You never knew when I was lonely
You never knew me at all
There's nothing holding me together
There is no one here to catch me when I fall

You never met me on the dance floor
Now I'm dancing on my own
Here comes the sunlight breaking through me
Nothing left here but the beating of my heart

Ooh ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh ooh, take me to the disco

I heard the music play forever
Or was it only in dreams?
Enter the sound of silence
All that remains is just the girl back at the start

Ooh ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh ooh, take me to the disco

Only the lonely could understand where I have been
Always on a journey inside myself
Remember me and what I used to be
I don't wanna be your enemy but I got to get away
I got to get away

Ooh ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh ooh, take me to the disco
