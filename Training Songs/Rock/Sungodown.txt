Last way to go I'll walk alone 
 Won't need your breast oh mother 
 No shelter left 
 Another soul will come to thee 
 I reached the top nothing undone 
 Your breath remains oh brother 
 Nothing to gain 
 Another soul will come to thee 
 Oh is this the way? 
 I have nothing else left but 
 Walk into your light 
 Into my "sungodown" 
 I think of the past and will not cry 
 I won't regret no hour 
 Sorry for that 
 Another soul will come to thee 
 The clouds aside the heaven's bright 
 You will receive oh father 
 My life today 
 Another soul will come to thee 
 Oh is this the way? 
 I have nothing else left but 
 Walk into your light 
 Into my "sungodown" 
 My way to go I'm not alone 
 Won't need your breast oh mother 
 Your shelter left 
 Another soul will come to thee 
 The clouds aside the heaven's wide 
 You will release oh father 
 Young soul today 
 And another soul will come to thee
