Show it to me one way 
I've got to see it all
Scientific radar
Reaching through the storm
There's got to be hope
As people move on
We've got to keep on believing

It's time to give it everything 
A world unite let us in
Hear me cry
Suffocate, let them die
A better life, say goodbye, hear me cry

I see everything silver and gold
Way up I'm reaching out
Clouds white as snow
There's got to be hope
As people move on
We've got to keep on believing

It's time to give it everything 
A world unite let us in
Hear me cry
Suffocate, let them die
A better life, say goodbye, hear me cry

Hear me cry
Why don't you hear me
Why don't they hear me
Suffocate
Let them die
A better life to say goodbye
Give, give enough I care
