Red red wine go to my head
Make me forget that I still need her so

Red red wine it's up to you
All I can do I've done
But memories won't go
No memories won't go

I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong and I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red red wine stay close to me
Don't let me be alone it's tearing apart
My blue blue heart

I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong and I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red red wine stay close to me
Don't let me be alone it's tearing apart
My blue, blue, heart
