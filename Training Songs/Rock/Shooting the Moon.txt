You're wide eyed looking for excuse
I got a bloodline looking for the root
Here you go now, now the choice is choose
Oh no man, you got something to lose

Acting funny like you have seen it all
You got a crown and I'm gonna knock it off
King of the castle, it's gonna fall fast though
Oh no man, I got something to prove

I am, I am, I am shooting the moon
I am, I am, I am shooting the moon
I am, I am, I am shooting the moon
I am, I am, I am

I could write a line and you could mimic me
You want the same things stealing my identity
You like what I say, you like what you see
Oh no man, you got something to lose

I can see this is headed for a brawl
You can copy cat but you ain't cat at all
I'm pulling triggers and I'm gunning for it all
Oh no man, I got something to prove

I am, I am, I am shooting the moon
I am, I am, I am shooting the moon
I am, I am, I am shooting the moon
I am, I am, I am

All that you tried to hide
All that you buried inside
Will get you back, so watch your back
It'll get your back, man watch your back

All that you tried to deny
All of your velvet tongued lies
Will get you back, so watch your back,
It's coming soon, shooting the moon

I am, I am, I am just shooting the moon
I am, I am, I am you gotta get shooting the moon
I am, I am, I am shooting the moon
I am, I am, I am

You gotta go man the writing's on the wall
Trip into the room like you're headed for a fall
I ain't answering cause you didn't call
I'm pushing back cause my back's against the wall
Too soon it's the rising of the moon
You better pull the trigger, better pull it soon
You better pull the trigger baby, just shoot
You better pull the trigger baby, just shoot!
