Hey baby, it's getting late now
And the years are rollin' on
Ain't no time to take it easy now
We been goin' too long
It's dirty, it's a pity
And time ain't exactly on our side
That ain't no reason now
Not to give it a try

Don't look inside the mirror
Your time is drawing nearer
How many dues do I have to pay
Before they take my soul away

Sick of being unforgiven
But there's blue sky's overhead
A dirty way to make a livin' yeah
But somebody's got to do it
I'm a lover, not a loser
I'm a lonely hearts one night stand
Not a penny in my pocket nor a dime in my hand 

Don't look inside the mirror
Your time is drawing nearer
How many dues do I have to pay
Before they take my soul away

If you've been hurt by love before
You don't think you can take anymore
I think it's about time you evened the score
Let's hit the door

Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy
