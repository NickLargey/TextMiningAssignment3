Sunburst
The morning moor
The light of God
The heart of youth
I look around me
My eyes find their rest on this garden
The flower of the west

The silent skies
An innocent heart
Holding the moment away
From time in the dark
All I see. All I know
Is touching the sacred earth
Warming the hallowed ground

Walk on
Walk on
Walk on

Sunrise
The colour frontier
The aging light
The sight that knows no fear
I look over Orinsay to the Trumisgarry shore
To Aloter
And the road to Ahmore

The silent skies
An innocent heart
Holding the moment away
From time in the dark
All I see. All I know
Is touching the sacred earth
Warming the hallowed ground

I survive the childhood universe
And I step the naked heath
Where the breathing of the vanished
Lies in acres round my feet
Past Loch Scadavagh Loch Fada
And the flatlands to the east
Where the dark blue mass of Eval
Meets the rising Rock of Lee
Between the Crogary and Maairi
I started to descend
Loch Aongais on my left hand side
I look across to Clett
Collies barking on the outrun
Dunlin dancing on the sand
Breakers show round Corran Vallique
And empty the Atlantic on the strand

The silent skies
An innocent heart
Holding the moment away
From time in the dark
All I see. All I know
Is touching the sacred earth
Warming the hallowed ground

Flower of the west
