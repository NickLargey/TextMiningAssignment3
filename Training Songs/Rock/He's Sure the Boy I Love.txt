I always dreamed the boy I loved would come along
And he'd be tall and handsome rich and strong
But now that boy I love has come to me
But he sure ain't the way I thought he'd be
(He's sure the boy I love)
He doesn't look like a movie star
He doesn't drive a Cadillac car
He sure ain't the boy I've been dreamin' of
But he's sure the boy I love
Let me tell ya now
He'll never be a big business man
He always buys on the installment plan
He sure ain't the boy I've been dreamin' of
But he's sure the boy I love
When he holds me tight
Everything's right
Crazy as it seems
I'm his whatever he is
And I forget all of my dreams
(Everybody knows)
He doesn't hang diamonds round my neck
And all he's got's an unemployment check
He sure ain't the boy I've been dreamin' of
But he's sure the boy I love
When he holds me tight
Everything's right
Crazy as it seems
I'm his whatever he is
And I forget all of my dreams
Everybody knows
He doesn't hang diamonds round my neck
And all he's got's an unemployment check
He sure ain't the boy I've been dreamin' of
But he's sure the boy I love
(He's sure the boy I love) oh, oh, oh
(He's sure the boy I love) oh, oh, oh
(He's sure the boy I love) oh, oh, oh
(He's sure the boy I love) oh, oh, oh
(He's sure the boy I love) oh, oh, oh
(He's sure the boy I love) oh, oh, oh
