Baby doll, you know your hair shines like like ink when you're not here
You left before I got here, so how do you know I'm late?
You better tell me when you gonna be on the menu

[Chorus]
Where are the prawns
Down by the sea
Where are the prawns
Down by the sea

Where are the prawns

Cookie pie, the waters rise above your legs beneath your eyes
Already the clouds are drowning and even the stars are damp
I'll be awake and dreaming all of us could go screaming

[Chorus]

Sea, sea, sea, sea, sea, sea, sea
Sea, sea, sea, sea, sea, sea, sea
Sea, sea, sea, sea, sea, sea
