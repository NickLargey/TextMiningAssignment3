A tangled acre
Oh tall tree shaker
Oh mountain maker
Oh mountain breaker
Oh faultline quaker
A torn-off anchor

And the hot hard healer
Is a sweet street feeler
And a wild wet wheeler
The pink prince of failures
Is a spoiled sea sailor
With terns and wailers

Pulled up the ribbon
Pulled up the ribbon
And brought into the light
Through the window, the dawn

Like an air-blue eagle
Sailing through the ceiling
At the edge of feeling
On the emerald island
All the shipwrecked spy him
And the searchlights shining

And then pulled up the ribbon
Pulled up the ribbon
And brought into the light
Pulled up the ribbon
Pulled up the ribbon
And watched all in the sky

But you pull up the ribbon
(Pull up the ribbon) pull up the ribbon
(Pull up the ribbon)
Across oceans of sky
Through the air, lifts on and on
Till starlit and in and out we're drawn
