Let me tell you 'bout this girl I know
She ain't nothing like any girl you've known before
'Cause everybody wants her
In her dress or her old blue jeans
When you see her you'll be coming apart at the seams
'Cause everybody wants her

She's got everything a man could ask for
She's animal and innocence
She could wrap you round her little finger
She's sharp as a knife, you ought to see her dance
Everybody wants her, they make it plain to see
Everybody needs her, she don't know it but she wants me

The first time that she passed my way
I got so nervous that I couldn't find a thing to say
'Cause everybody wants her
She's told so many guys to sling their hook
But I've been watching her eyes and I've seen her look
She knows everybody wants her

I'm never wrong with my intuition
I'm gonna say what I have to say
I got it worked out to the letter
I know I can make her see it my way

Everybody wants her, they make it plain to see
Everybody needs her, she don't know it but she wants me

She's got everything a man could ask for
She's animal and innocence
She could wrap you round her little finger
She's sharp as a knife, you ought to see her dance
You ought to see her danceÃ¢?Â¦

Everybody wants her, they make it plain to see
Everybody needs her, she don't know it but she wants me
