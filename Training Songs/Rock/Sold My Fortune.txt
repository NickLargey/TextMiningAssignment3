Please don't worry,
It can't hurt me
Anymore.

Ride my problems
To the water.
Let 'em go.

Sold my fortune. (x4)

Please have mercy.
There is so much
I couldn't see.

No one witnessed.
I was fallin'
To my knees.

Sold my fortune. (x4)

Don't feel sorry.
There was no way
You could help.

Broken my promise
I was keepin'
To myself.

Sold my fortune (x8)
