When I was just a little boy
I asked my mother, what will I be
Will I be happy, will I be rich
Here's what she said to me.

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera
What will be, will be.

When I was just a little brat,i asked my teacher,
what will i be?
will i be a mess, will i have success,
this is what she said to me

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera
What will be, will be.

when i grew up and fell in love
i asked my darlin' what should we be?
will i be happy, will you be sad?
this is what you said to me

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera
What will be, will be.
