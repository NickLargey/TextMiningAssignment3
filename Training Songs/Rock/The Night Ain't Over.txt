Staying up all night, this could be a party 
I've got some friends outside, looking for a good time 
You better head my way, this is where it's starting 
No rules, no laws, tonight you're gonna stay 

[Chorus]
Hey girl hold me tight, the night ain't over 
Hey girl hit that light- the night ain't over 

I'm staying up all night, this could be a showdown 
I've got this thing inside, telling me don't run and hide 
And there's so many roads, only you can go down 
Don't close, your eyes, there just might be another way 

[Chorus]

Ooh I might be losing my soul 
But life's only fun when it's dangerous 
And I don't wanna be told 
I won't play safe and start growing old 

It's five in the morning 
And I can feel the beads of sweat 
Running down the back of my neck 
It's so good to be with you again 
Oh-oh-oh 

Someday, wait and see 
This will be just a memory 
And I'll look back with no regrets 
Good times like this I can't forget
