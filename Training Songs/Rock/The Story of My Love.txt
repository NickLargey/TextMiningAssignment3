Darling we're not very old
But there's a love story that has to be told
By stars above I swear that it's true
It's the story of my love for you
Of my love for you
It starts when you came in to my life
You vowed someday you'd be my wife
Sweetheart I thought the world of you
You made my world of dreams come true
My world of dreams come true
The years may come and the years may pass
'Til I reach the end of life's journey at last
Though time may change me in someway this is true
It'll never change my love for you
Won't change my love for you
When I'm gone please bury me
On the highest mountain in history 
So all the world can hear me cry
My love for you will never die
My love will never die
