I have one foot in the graveyard
And the other on the bus
And the passengers do trample
Each other in the rush.
And the chicken hearted lawman
Is throwing up his fill
To see the kindly doctor
To pass the super pill.
Well, I'm goin' down to revisit Dr. Bogenbroom.
Well, I'm on my way, three cheers for Dr. Bogenbroom.

Well, I tried my best to love you all,
All you hypocrites and whores,
With your eyes upon each other
And the locks upon your doors.
Well, you drowned me in the fountain of life and I hated you
For living while I was dying,
We were all just passing through.
Well, I'm goin' down to revisit Dr. Bogenbroom.
Well, I'm on my way, three cheers for Dr. Bogenbroom.
