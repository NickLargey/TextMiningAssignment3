If I was a prophet, if I was a saint
Sent here to save you, to bury the pain
Would I be different, would I belong?

Voices are silent, arms are at bay
A cloud of destruction is closer each day
Things could be different
We could belong (belong, belong, belong)

We are the human, we are the strays
We talk about heaven, we talk about grace
But things could be different, we could belong (belong, belong, belong)

Leave behind the renegades
Cross the desert through the haze
'Cause we must hold on yeah
'Cause we must hold on yeah
Moving forward one by one, to find shelter

'Cause they say (hey hey), things are much better than we know
We’re not the problem
So don’t hate (hey hey), things will get better if we show
We’re not the problem (Hey)

For the sake of the children
For the sake of us all
Bury the demons, brace for the fall
Things can be different, we could belong (belong, belong, belong)

We are the vision
We are the faith
We are the meaning
We have new taste
Things can be different, we can belong (belong, belong, belong)

Leave behind the renegades
Cross the desert through the haze
'Cause we must hold on yeah
'Cause we must hold on yeah
Moving forward one by one, to find shelter

'Cause they say (hey hey), things are much better than we know
We’re not the problem
So don’t hate (hate, hate), things will get better if we show
We’re not the problem

We go right back to the start
In sweet defiance
We were meant to be apart
Lie down in silence
We must find out who we are 
(we must find out who we are)
(we must find out who we are)
(we must find out who we are)

If I was a prophet, if I was a saint
Sent here to save you, to bury the pain
Would I be different, would I belong? (belong, belong, belong)

Cause' they say (hey hey), things are much better than we know
We’re not the problem
So don’t hate (hate, hate), things will get better if we show
We’re not the problem

They say (hey hey), things are much better than we know
We’re not the problem
So don’t hate (hate, hate), things will get better if we show
We’re not the problem
