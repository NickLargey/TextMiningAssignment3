twilight comes and the mood's complete
gonna hit the street grab some of that night time beat
my heart is beat beat beating ,like a drum
the night is in my veins we're gonna,have some fun tonight

chorus :

light the fuse i must ignite
i'm gonna set the world alight
light the fuse i must ignite
i'm gonna set the world alight
i wanna see you burn

i killed the cigarette, i killed the light
i'm killin' time the heat kills me on a hot summer night
i'm gonna dream a life,live a dream
hell for leather in my scheme of things tonight

repeat chorus
