(Na na nanana nana, na na nanana nana na) - Eden
(Na na nanana nana, na na nanana nana na) - Yeah 
Too far gone to turn around
As I make it into town
I said driver take my suitcase
Where's that good time goin' down
Hit the freeway to the skyline
Need some faster ecstasy
If she's got a prize
Then I've got the money
She said for you the first one's free 
And I thought I saw Jesus
in the hotel room
As we made love on the balcony
With a drink in my hand
Like they said it would be yeah 
So this is Eden
So this is Eden
And baby I knew it
That you'd lead me to it
I don't want to get out 
(Na na nanana nana,
na na nanana nana na) 
Eden 
Feel the pressure
rise in the elevator
Make our way down to the street
Soul sister sing a song for me
Drunks and junkies shuffle their feet
It's a three ring circus
Downtown Babylon
We're crashing and burning
For twenty-four hours the party goes on yeah 
So this is Eden
So this is Eden
And baby I knew it
That you'd lead me to it
Nobody gets out 
(Na na nanana nana, na na nanana nana na) 
Eden nobody gets out
(Na na nanana nana, na na nanana nana na) 
of Eden no no 
Breathe in
Breathe out
Check in
Check out 
It's a wild weekend
Ghost train ride to the other side
It's a funhouse suicide
It's making me feel more dead than alive yeah 
So this is Eden
So this is Eden
And baby I knew it
That you'd lead me to it yeah 
(Na na nanana nana, na na nanana nana na) 
Eden, nobody gets out
(Na na nanana nana, na na nanana nana na) 
Of Eden no no no no...
(Na na nanana nana, na na nanana nana na)
(Na na nanana nana, na na nanana nana na) 
Check in
You won't check out
