I know that you think I protest too much
I'm like a diva with a tragic touch
But if I wanna hide from the pouring sun
It has to be alright
And I could have my pride but I'll try to run
When a fool would stand and fight

And if I try hard enough
To 'do or die' and push and shove
I know that I would be too tough
Too tough to fall in love with you

You've really gotten underneath my skin
Must have been easy, it was always thin
So if I wanna cry in the burning rain
Don't worry I'll survive
But even when you're high I can feel your pain
That's what I call being alive

So if I fall I'll get back up
And there'll be tears and blood and stuff
Still I stand tall and I'm too tough
Too tough to fall in love with you, with you

And I can see your point of view
But I can see a way to be tough too, tough too

You know I hate it when you talk this way
'Cause you don't listen to a word you say
And it took a lot of time to grow your shell
Maybe enough's enough
And I could tell you why you should go to hell
But I don't want to be that tough

So if I try hard enough
To 'do or die' and push and shove
I know that I would be too tough
Too tough to fall in love with you
With you, with you
