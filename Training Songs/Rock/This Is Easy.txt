Yes I see we're moving on 
Over unfamiliar ground 
Wait a minute look around 
This is easy
Yes I see we're moving on
Maybe trouble's all we'll find 
But compared to what's behind 
This is easy 
And there were nights when we knew 
The sunshine would never ever reappear 
It's not a good time all the time 
Baby let's grab hold while it's here 

Baby baby do I need 
To explain or can you tell 
That I'm feeling oh so well 
This is easy 
And I know there's not one thing 
That could ever drag us down 
Wait a minute look around 
This is easy 
Remember this when the dreams you treasure 
Are scattered like bowling pins 
It's not a good time all the time 
Nobody always wins 
This is easy oh so easy 
If we're crazy, well, we don't care 
Like falling falling 
Falling thought empty air
