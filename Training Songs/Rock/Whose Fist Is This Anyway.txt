Playing for the hate team
Shut out, cut out of the mainstream

If you like to play victim
You play your part so well
That's how we'll treat you
If it suits you so well

Hey now, it's all turning
Watch your world burn
Hey now, it's all burning
Watch your world turn

Playing on the hate team
Shut out, cut out of the mainstream
Playing for the hate team
Hate team

Hey now, it's all burning
Watch your world turn
Hey now, it's all turning
Watch your world burn

If you never felt decent
And you feel rather mean
Don't wear your hurt so pathetic
Let your mind set you free, yeah

Playin' on the hate team
Shut out, cut out of the mainstream

Whose fist is this anyway?
Whose fist is this anyway?
Whose fist is this anyway?
