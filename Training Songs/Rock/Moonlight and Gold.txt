Moonlight and gold
Midsummer magic when the night turns to day
And songbirds greet the dawn
You lie awake
You watch and wonder while the moon fades away
And one more day is born.
Tides keep on turning, while hearts keep on yearning
To be where they know they belong
All on a new day, you see in a new way
The things you've been leaning upon.
Moonlight and gold
I will awaken to a love that runs deeper
Than the need in me.
While you are sleeping, the new day comes creeping
And life keeps on passing you by
Magic unfolds when the blue meets the gold
And the sun comes to open your eyes. 
Moonlight and gold
Midsummer magic when the night turns to day
And songbirds greet the dawn
You lie awake
You watch and wonder while the moon fades away
And one more day is born.
Oh yeah
