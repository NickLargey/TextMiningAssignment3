You can't even imagine
The tortuous state I've been existing in
I am allergic to water
It itches my throat and it blisters my skin
Still, I drink cuz I have to, I bathe cuz I have to
But boy it's a pain
But I don't cry
Cuz it hurts to cry
And I don't go outside in the rain

And you may wonder what would possess
Someone like me to go on
You may wonder how it's possible
Something so basic could go wrong
And all I can say is
If you stretch your mind all the way as far as it goes
There's someone out there who lives further than that
In a place you can never know

So right now if youâ€™re looking at me
You can assume that I am thirsty
And a good day is one when that ache in my brain
Can remain at a doable three
And I don't really want your sympathy
I'm just telling you so you'll understand
This is me, sincerely
Doin' the best that I can
