Hangin' at the station waiting for the final ride
Time passed by
And it's getting harder to pretend

Counting all the cracks in the pavement subdivides
Don't ask why
But I'm moving closer to the edge
Minutes go slow like the hours in my head

Finding that I'm right back on that train again
Turn to Mr. Driver, he's my only friend
I hope he knows which way to go
He could be held responsible
He could be held responsible
He could be held

Try to make your mark
Try to keep from fading away
Tell me lies
How to live and what you recommend
Seasons go slow like the years in my head

Finding that I'm right back on that train again
Turn to Mr. Driver, he's my only friend
But I'm just a temporary resident
Looking out my window I'll be home again

I hope he knows which way to go
He could be held responsible
He could be held responsible
He could be held

Finding that I'm right back on that train again
Turn to Mr. Driver, he's my only friend
But I'm just a temporary resident
Looking out my window I'll be home again
Home again

I hope he knows which way to go
He could be held responsible
He could be held responsible
He could be held
