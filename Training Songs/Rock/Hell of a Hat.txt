That's a hell of a hat that you're wearing
It goes real well with the earring
Five through the nose, bold and daring
You've got to pardon me if I'm staring

Man, I really dig your shoes
Phat fade and fresh tattoos
Bet the females can't refuse
And if I'm staring please excuse

Sharpest motherfucker in the joint
The other motherfuckers stop and point
The gear you wear seems complete
Why you gotta pack the heat

We question one accessory
Don't think the piece is necessary
We agree you're dressed to kill
But wonder if you will

Hell of a hat you're sporting Jack
Diamond cuff links and a sweet tie tack
The pocket watch must've set you back
You're the man, man, you're the mack

The pinstriped number, me oh my, that's rude
And that's a hell of an attitude
You made the scene and set the mood
I'm only staring, cause I'm nervous dude

Sharpest motherfucker, we repeat
No other motherfucker can compete
The clothes you chose, are stylish son
Why you gotta wear the gun

We question one accessory
Don't think the piece is necessary
We agree you're dressed to kill
But wonder if you will
