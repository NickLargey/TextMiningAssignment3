I can't think straight
Voices scream insane
Calling out to let me go
Just let me go

I have thought for far to long
Is it right , or is it wrong
Now I think that's my mind
It's just loosing time

But it takes so much time before you realise
Why some things never change
They always stay just the same
The first taste of death is sweet

Feel it burning , an internal heat
Driving me into white light, killing time
Well , it takes so much time before you realise
Why some things never change

They always stay, just the same
There's no comeback
When your playing with a stacked deck
If you loose , you only cheat youself

Come with me, take my hand
Help me to make a stand
I can't give in, cause my mind and my heart
Mind and heart bleed

Well, it's no surprise my friend
Another hero dies
What goes down comes back around, and it never
No, never lies

It takes so much time
Oh why do some things never change
They always stay, just the same.
