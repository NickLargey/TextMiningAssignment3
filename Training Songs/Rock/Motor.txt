She got a sweet funky power train
Rear-end drive make this man insane
She's ripping up that sweet horse power
She took me up to ninety miles an hour

Come-on ride with me
She got a motor

She got lips like shiny chrome
She's out jammin' 'neath the thunder dome
She got some serious leg suspension
She took me out into a new dimension

Come-on baby ride with me
She got a motor
Oh baby, come-on ride with me
She got a motor

Shiny block under silky hood
That bitch is jammin' like I knew she would
Hot black for exterior
Yo baby I got the case on your interior
When you put your heel to the floor
I want to blow more than just your doors
That's all right baby we need some action
We got the rubber baby, we got the traction

Come-on ride with me
She got a motor
Oh baby, come-on ride with me
She got a motor

Come-on ride with me
She got a motor
Oh baby, come-on ride with me
She got a motor
