I'm in love with two sisters
Only weapons can decide
Whose bed I share tonight

And the cold mister mister
He has got me in his sights
If he shoots me down
He has every right

They sharpened knives
I don't want to miss the last train
The bullets fly
Each one screams my name
Gorgeous eyes
To the right to the left of me
Gorgeous eyes
They made me do it again

Oh my heart don't stop
So judge me not
I think I think I think I think
I'm in love with two sisters
Only weapons can decide
Whose bed I share tonight

And the cold mister mister
He has got me in his sights
If he shoots me down
He has every right

Hit the lights
How fast you gonna run today
In Jesus' eyes
The minister cursed my name
I got skinned alive
The wolves ate what was left of me
If I survive
Damn straight I'll do it again

Oh my heart don't stop
So judge me not
I think I think I think I think
I'm in love with two sisters
Only weapons can decide
Whose bed I share tonight

And the cold mister mister
He has got me in his sights
If he shoots me down
He has every right

Take me back to the simple love
I can't dance no more in these murderers gloves
I feel my heartbeat in my brain
Can't get out of the hole I dug
Took a double dose of a deadly drug
Life was so simple yesterday

I'm in love with two sisters
Only weapons can decide
Whose bed I share tonight

And the cold mister mister
He has got me in his sights
If he shoots me down
He has every right
