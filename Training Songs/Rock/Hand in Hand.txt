She follows me down to where I go 
She comes in a cloud but she don't know 
She walks in a haze 
Do we get up before it ever gets too late 
Hand in hand we walk on down 
The alley and our common ground 
We walk in a haze 
Do we pass out before we ever know it's on 
She ain't never gonna get wise 
She ain't never gonna get wise 
She ain't never gonna get wise 
And I feel better with my hands tied 

She ain't never gonna get wise 
She ain't never gonna get wise 
She ain't never gonna get wise 
And I feel better with my hands tied
 
She follows me down to where I go 
Not pulling a chain not feeling low 
Don't wake me up I can't relate to any other song today 
Hand in hand we walk along 
The alley and our common ground 
I walk in a haze why should I care 
I'm waiting out the days go anywhere

She ain't never gonna get wise 
She ain't never gonna get wise 
She ain't never gonna get wise 
And I feel better with my hands tied

She ain't never gonna get wise 
She ain't never gonna get wise 
She ain't never gonna get wise 
And I feel better with my hands tied
