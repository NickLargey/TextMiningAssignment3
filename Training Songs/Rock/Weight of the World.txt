Embrace the love you find 
Cuz today is only time 
That slips through your hands 
And forever leaves you behind 

Yesterday life was alright 
But now a memory 
Cuz today I only find 
Hell surrounding me 

Caught on a thinner wire 
Looking down in the fire 
Hanging on another day 
You fall to pieces 
With heaven at your feet 
You're gonna find another way 
The only reason 
Anything should be 
Everything is on the line 
And the Weight of the world's on you 

Everyday I'm gonna try 
Until I find the key 
And my faith will never die 
Remembering what's real
