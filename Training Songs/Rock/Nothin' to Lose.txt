I bet you've been thinkin' 'bout everything you had
When you look back now it doesn't seem so bad
It's the same old story, never get a second chance
You should be so lucky somebody took a stand

When the nights get longer
And you're lying all alone
When the pain gets stronger
You gotta make it on your own

You better take it as it comes
'Cause it's never enough
When you got nothin' to lose
Gotta get it on the run, baby
When you ain't got nothin'
You got nothin' to lose

If you knew back then what you know right now
Well, it might of been easy, still you made it somehow
You fell head over heels, you were down and out
But you came back strong from a whisper to a shout

When the nights get longer
And you're lying all alone
When the pain gets stronger
You gotta make it on your own

You better take it as it comes
'Cause it's never enough
When you got nothin' to lose
Gotta get it on the run, baby
When you ain't got nothin'
You got nothin' to lose

Did you do it like you should?
'Cause it's never enough
When you got nothin' to lose
I know you gave it all you could, baby
'Cause it's never enough
You got nothin' to lose

When the nights get longer
And you're lying all alone
When the pain gets stronger
You gotta make it on your own
You gotta make it on your own

When you ain't got nothin'
You got nothin' to lose
