You're not as old as the trees
Not as young as the leaves
You're not as free as the breeze
Not as open as the sea

And your heart hasn't found a home
Endlessly it seems to roam
One day you will find inexhaustable ecstacy
And you will see
That you're beautiful and always have been
And everybody else can see
The love that you've been looking for
Is right there inside your door

Little Miss Divinity
You're the one that you've been looking for
Little Miss Divinity
Won't you lay your love on thee?

Hey now now now now now
Hey now na na hey
Hey now now now now now

If you need a friend then I'll be sailing right by your side
But if you need a lover you must leave it all behind
And if you need direction, the world can seem unkind
So listen closely my love 
You have time
You're doing fine

Hey now now now now now
Hey now na na hey
Hey now now now now now
Hey now na na hey
Hey now now now now now
Hey now na na hey
Hey now now now now now
Hey now na na hey
