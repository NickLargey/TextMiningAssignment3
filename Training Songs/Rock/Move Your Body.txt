We came to rock your town
To show you what it's like to get down
So turn up, step up, move your body right, show us how it's done
Before we ride into the night

Rocking this hard never felt so good
So rock your body right like you know you should
Throw your hands up into the air
And wave them all around like you just don't care

Whoa keep move your bodies to the rhythm of the beat
Whoaaaa Keep your bodies moving, keep your bodies grooving

Move your body, move move your body
Schools out and it's time to party
Move your body, move move your body
We got rock we don't need your money

Throw your hands up
And wave them like you just don't care
Do the robot
Like you were made from sylon hardware
Throw your hands up
And wave them like you just don't care
Do the robot
Come on let me see you throw your hands up in the air

Whoa keep move your bodies to the rhythm of the beat
Whoaaaa Keep your bodies moving, keep your bodies grooving

Move your body, move move your body
Schools out and it's time to party
Move your body, move move your body
We got rock we don't need your money

Move your body, move move your body
Schools out and it's time to party
Move your body, move move your body
We got rock we don't need your money
