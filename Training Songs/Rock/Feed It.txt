You're telling me that you're always broken
And when you're sick but you don't know why 
You're gonna be what you always hated
You've got something in your eyes 

Look now, you're throwin' it away 
Forget the benefits of today 
Right now, its time to get away
You've got no reason
To live your life everyday

Gotta stay on a one g basis 
Gotta feed it to let it go
I won't abuse it your own oasis

Half the weight and twice my lies
