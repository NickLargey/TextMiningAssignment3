Whoa I was so secure, i didn't see it comin'
She was half way out the door
Before i started runnin'

They say that love is blind
I didn't see the signs
All the things i didn't do
Made her give her love to you

She never looked that good for me
There's a new smile i've never seen
You must have set her spirit free
Cause she never looked that good for me

Well it's on her face, everything she needed
She finally found her place
It's like she's been completed

I think of all the nights
I should have held her tight
All the things i didn't say
Made her give her love away

She never looked that good for me
There's a new smile i've never seen
You must have set her spirit free
`cause she never looked that good for me

She never looked that good (for me)
She never looked that good (for me)
She never looked that good (she never looked that good)

I used to fantasize
Undress her with my eyes
But even in my mind
She never looked so fine

She never looked that good for me
There's a new smile i've never seen
You must have set her spirit free
Cause she never looked that good for me

She never looked that good (for me)
She never looked that good (for me)
She never looked that good (she never looked that good)
She never looked that good, ah
