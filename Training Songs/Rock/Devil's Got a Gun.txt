Look out, this thing is gonna blow
I heard it from the people in the know
There's trouble in the tenements below
There's fire where the flowers used to grow
I'm never going back
I'm running from the sun
Bullets at my heels
The devil's got a gun
I'm never going home
I'll be the only one
With daylight on my tail
And heaven on the run

Rain is jumping up into the clouds
A girl has ceased to make her father proud
Lovers wrapped up in cellophane
The bitter fruit has fallen from its prey
I'm never going back
I'm running from the sun
Bullets at my heels
The devil's got a gun
I'm never going home
I'll be the only one
With daylight on my tail
And heaven on the run

Help me I know not what I see
I'm a stranger to the face looking back at me
When the company of sisters is just like any mystery to me
Hold me, I know not who I am
If I'm a woman, you're a creature not a man
The eyes of a lover, they look like any other to me

It's down to the second hand
The tick tock is more than you can stand
The grinders and the wheels they never sleep
We're fighting to the bottom of the deep
I'm never going back
I'm running from the sun
Bullets at my heels
The devil's got a gun
I'm never going home
I'll be the only one
With daylight on my tail
And heaven on the run
Daylight on my tail
And heaven on the run
