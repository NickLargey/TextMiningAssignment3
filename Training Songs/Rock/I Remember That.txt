Nothing sounds as good as "I Remember That"
Like a bolt out from the blue, did you feel it too?
I remember that

Name me one little thing, you'll be wanting to keep
As you give up the ghost as you sink into sleep
Maybe her face in the morning, maybe his in the evening
Maybe words never spoken, aren't they the ones worth hearin'?
Say I remember that

Nothing sounds as good as "I Remember That"
Like a bolt out from the blue, did you feel it too?
I remember that
Nothing sounds as good as "I Remember That"
Like a bolt out from the blue, did you feel it too?
I remember that

'Cause that's all we can have, yes it's all we can trust
It's a hell of a ride but a journey to dust
And there's nothing pathetic listing clothes she'd wear
If it proves that I had you, if it proves I was there
Say I remember that

Nothing sounds as good as "I Remember That"
Like a bolt out from the blue, did you feel it too?
I remember that
Nothing sounds as good as "I Remember That"
Like a bolt out from the blue, did you feel it too?
I remember that

Did you feel it too?... I remember that
Did you feel it too?... I remember that...
