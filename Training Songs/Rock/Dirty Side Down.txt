Settle in, there's a paradise found
Oh, keep your shiny side up and your Dirty Side Down

Climb aboard climb aboard, it's a whisper
Climb aboard climb aboard, remember
Catch this ride, catch this ride

Set your course oh and take it in stride
Sometimes the simplest truth's look simpler outside

Climb aboard climb aboard, listen a whisper
Climb aboard climb aboard, remember

Fly,
Fly

Carved in the mountainside, over time, slowly
Stories told and no one lies, whispers in the old tree
Catch this ride

Settle in, there's a paradise found
Oh, keep your shiny side up your Dirty Side Down

Climb aboard climb aboard, listen whisper
Climb aboard climb aboard, remember
Catch this ride, catch this ride

Fly,
Fly

Carved in the mountainside, over time, slowly
Stories told and no one lies, whispers in the old tree
