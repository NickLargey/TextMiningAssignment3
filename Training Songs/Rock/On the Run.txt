When you're on the run
Lookin' for a friend you can depend on
Your phone it never rung for days that
When you're on the run
Lookin' for a friend you can depend on
Your phone it never rung for days that
When you're on the run

When you're on the run 
Used to make a stand
Right up until the day that you were wanted
Then you had to move
'Cause you were hunted 
Anywhere you hide
Tough to find a place to lay your head down

Your phone it never rung for days that
When your on the run
When you're on the run

You better keep lookin' behind you
When you're on the run
When you're on the run

*
Look out for the lies they're comin' down the line
*
*
Love upon the wire you gotta find out

You're phone it never rung
