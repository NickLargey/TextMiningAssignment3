Well that's the way it goes 
This city so cold 
And I'm so cold 
That's what I know 

Born to lose 
I said hey, born to lose 
I said hey, born to lose 
Oh baby I'm born to lose 

I have nothing to do 
I have nothing to say 
Only one thing that I want 

Living in the jungle 
It ain't so hard 
Living in the city 
It'll eat out your heart
