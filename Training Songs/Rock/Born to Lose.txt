No, you can't fool me with your crocodile tears
I would rather drown in them before I let you in
I was just a part of your game
The pawn on the board, the dice in your hand

Oh, all you did was waste up my precious time
I put my hands up and shout from the back of the line

'Cause I been on the back foot lately
I been playing catch up with you
But honey, you're a heart roller
Baby, I was born, born, born to me
'Cause baby, I was born to lose

No, I don't believe you, not for a second
You go and turn the tables all of a sudden
How do you expect me to trust
The snake round my neck, confessing their love?

Oh, all you did was waste up my precious time
I put my hands up and shout from the back of the line

'Cause I been on the back foot lately
I been playing catch up with you
But honey, you're a heart roller
Baby, I was born, born, born to me
'Cause baby, I was born to lose

Born, born, born, born to lose
Born, born, born, born to lose
Born, born, born, born to lose
Born, born, born, born

'Cause I been on the back foot lately
I been playing catch up with you
But honey, you're a heart roller
Baby, I was born, born, born to me
'Cause baby, I was born to lose
