Positive friction, under the upper crust
What does all this Hollywood really have to do with us 
True grit, timeless love 
There's no reason to pretend
Lets get together and become natural once again
Natural once again

There is a certain vibe, circulating in the air
Cast from all the energy that emanates from everywhere
Ah, such a lovely truth 
Beginning to unfold 
It's our brothers and sisters
All coming in from the cold...Natural once again

There's a family growing
I've seen it with my own two eyes
There's something that we're all knowing 
I hope its spreading like a wild fire
Back to a place one might call home

We have our own heroes 
They're dancing in the living room
We're busy, busy counting out from zero 
Not one minute too soon 
Back to a place one might call home
