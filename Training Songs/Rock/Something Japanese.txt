In Japan, when there be moonlight
And two strangers who be lonely
If by chance, they be meeting
One may find his one and only

There be something in the word "love"
There be something in the word "kiss"
There be meaning in the words "you and me"
This be feeling I not want to miss

There be hoping in the word "soon"
There be coolness in the word "wait"
There?s great promise when he say "he return"
These English words I learn to hate

If there be something in the word "love"
There be sadness in the word "cry"
There be madness in the word "unwed"
There be nothing in the word "goodbye"
