Beside yourself if radio's gonna stay
Reason, it could polish up the gray
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't nothing at all

Straight off the boat, where to go?

Beside defying media too fast
Instead of pushing palaces to fall
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't nothing at all

Raving station, beside yourself
Calling on in transit
Calling on in transit
Radio free Europe, radio

Beside defying media too fast
Instead of pushing palaces to fall
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't nothing but cattle call

Straight off the boat, where to go?
Calling on in transit
Calling on in transit
Radio free Europe, radio

Decide yourself
If radios gonna stay?
Have yourself a really
Wonderful evening and next day

Raving station, beside yourself
Calling on in transit
Calling on in transit
Radio free Europe
Radio free Europe

Calling on in transit
Calling on in transit
Radio free Europe, radio
Free me
