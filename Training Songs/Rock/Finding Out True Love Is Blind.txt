Ah chocolate girl, well you're looking like somethin' I want
(finding out true love is blind)
Ah your little Asian friend well, she can come if she wants
(finding out true love is blind)
I want all those self-conscious girls who try to hide who they are with make-up
(finding out true love is blind)
You know it's the girl with the frown with the tight pants I really want to shake up
(finding out true love is blind)

Hey carrot juice, I want to squeeze you the way until you bleed
(finding out true love is blind)
And your vanilla friend well she looks like something I need

(finding out true love is blind)
I want miss little smart girl with your glasses and all your books
(finding out true love is blind)
And I want the stupid girl who gives me all those dirty looks
(finding out true love is blind)

Wind you up and make you crawl to me
Tie you up until you call to me
Wind you up and make you crawl to me
Tie you up until you call to me

Oh brown girl with your hot pants shakin that thing on the street
(finding out true love is blind)
Yeah the short girls with the way they crawl knocks me off my feet
(finding out true love is blind)
And all the tough girls who never want me to see them cry
(finding out true love is blind)
And the girls who say treat me like a dog until the day I die
(finding out true love is blind)
