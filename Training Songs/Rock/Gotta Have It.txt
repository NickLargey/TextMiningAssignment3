I know where I shouldn't be
You take my heart and drink it for tea
You mix me up and walk out the door
You take my love and hurt me for more

But I gotta have it
Watch out for the damage
From new york straight to paris
I'm talking lenny kravitz

Whenever he is around
He puts me six feet under the ground
And when you call he can never be found
'cause he is always out on the town

But I gotta have it
Watch out for the damage
From new york straight to paris
I'm talking lenny kravitz

He is so funky and he's looking so good
And he does it like a good man should
And I would love him if I only could
But his heart is like a piece of wood

But I gotta have it
Watch out for the damage
From new york straight to paris
I'm talking lenny kravitz.
