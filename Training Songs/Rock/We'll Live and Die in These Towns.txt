You spend your time in smokey rooms
Where haggled old women with cheap perfume say
"It never happens for people like us, you know"
Well nothing ever happened on it's own
And well the toilet smells of desperation
The streets all echo of aggregation
And you wonder why you can't get no sleep
When you've got nothing to do
And you've had nothing to eat
Your life's slipping and sliding right out of view
And there's absolutely nothing that you can do, well

We'll live and die
We'll live and die in these towns
Don't let it drag you down
Don't let it drag you down now

We'll live and die
We'll live and die in these towns
Don't let it drag you down
Don't let it drag you down now

Dirty dishes from a T.V. meal
That went cold from the wind through a smashed up window
You can't go out if anybody calls you
'Cause you can't have a bath When there's no hot water
And your friends are out on the town again
And you ask yourself if it will ever end
And it's all too much for your head to take
Just a matter of time before you break, well

We'll live and die
We'll live and die in these towns
Don't let it drag you down
Don't let it drag you down now

We'll live and die
We'll live and die in these towns
Don't let it drag you down
Don't let it drag you down now

Now
Now

We'll live and die
We'll live and die in these towns
Don't let it drag you down
Don't let it drag you down now

We'll live and die
We'll live and die in these towns
Don't let it drag you down
Don't let it drag you down now
