I was listening to the radio
I heard a song reminded me of long ago
Back then I thought that things were never gonna change
It used to be that I never had to feel the pain
I know that things will never be the same now

I want to go back
And do it all over again
But I can't go back I know
I want to go back
Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back I know

I recall hanging out on Friday night
The first slow dance
Hoping that I'll get it right
Back then I thought I'd never ever stand alone
It used to be that a lonely heart was never shown
I know that things will never be the same

I want to go back
And do it all over again
But I can't go back I know
I want to go back
Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back I know

Can't go back

I can't go back

I know now that things will never be the same

I said
I want to go back
And do it all over again
But I can't go back I know
I want to go back
Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back I know

I want to go back
And do it all over again
But I can't go back I know
I want to go back
Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back I know

I want to go back
And do it all over again
But I can't go back I know
I want to go back
Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back I know

No, No
And do it all over...
