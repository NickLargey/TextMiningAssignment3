Totemo kanahsii uta ga dekita
Kesa me wo samashita toki ni
Anmari kanashii uta dakara
Kimi ni kikasetakunai kedo

Totemo kanashii hanashi ga aru
Kimi mo tabun ki ga tsuiteru
Honto ni kanashii koto dakedo
Futari no ai wa owatta

Ko shite
Futari dakiatte
Onaji asa wo mukaeta

Totemo kanashii yume o mita
Kesa me o samasu mae ni ne
Kanashii uta o utau boku ni
Kimi ga tada 'kiss' shite kureta yume

Gomen ne
Boku ha kimi no koto
Annani aishiteta noni

Gomen ne
Boku dake wo kimi wa
Konna ni shinjiteta noni

Gomen ne
Boku ha kimi no koto
Annani aishiteta noni

Gomen ne
Dakedo itsu no hi ka
Minna wasureru hazu

I wrote a very sad song
When I woke up this morning
But I won't let you listen to it
Because it's too sad a song

It's a very sad story
Maybe you noticed it too
It's really very sad
But our love is over

Like this
We held each other
We saw the same sunrise

I had a very sad dream
This morning before I woke up
I dreamt that I was singing a sad song
And you just kissed me

I'm really sorry
I've loved you so
But...

I'm really sorry
You've believed only me
But...

I'm really sorry
I've loved you so
But...

I'm really sorry
But in the end
We can forget everything
