I've been looking through my mirror
With somebody else's eyes
You broke me down
You fixed my blood stained pride

I've running through my window
At somebody else's world
You let me fall
Right through your open door

You came and saved me
You saved me from myself
You came and saved me
You saved me from myself

I've been running hard on empty
Sinking deeper in the sand
You let me down
Right on to solid ground

You came and saved me
You saved me from myself
You came and saved me
You saved me from myself

When everyone left me
You loved me and no one else
You came and saved me
You saved me from myself

I had hope in my heart
That you'd run for me, can saved it all
Now I feel in my heart that you've come for me
You leave me love

You came and saved me
You saved me from myself
You came and saved me
You saved me from myself

When everyone left me
You loved me and no one else
You came and saved me
You saved me from myself

Baby, you saved me from myself
Baby, you saved me from myself
You came and saved me
You saved me from myself

When everyone left me
You loved me and no one else
You came and saved me
You saved me from myself
