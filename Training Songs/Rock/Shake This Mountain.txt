I've lost the inspiration
I went out west to find.
Believed this pain and sorrow
Was out of sight and out of mind.
No more love and understanding.
One million hearts are set alight.
When this life gets too demanding,
I need help to live the lie.
Faith won't shake this mountain.
One sign is not enough
To lead us to the Promised Land.
I'm not so glad I found you
Too many hopes get cast aside.
Though we deny each other,
No alibi of self-defence.
