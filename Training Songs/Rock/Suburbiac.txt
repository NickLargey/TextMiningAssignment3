Sugar, Sugar, don't look now
Your place is falling apart and how
And all you want and all you need costs money, money
So let's make the most of your last 20 dollar bill
And hire a hitman to hit your boyfriend
Kissing you is like getting high on someone else's drugs
Kissing you is like getting high on someone else's drugs
Kissing you

Sugar Sugar don't you cry
We'll all grow old and then we'll die
But all I want and all I need is your money, money
So let's make the most of your last 20 dollar bill
And hire a hitman to hit your boyfriend
Kissing you is like getting high on someone else's drugs
Kissing you is like getting high on someone else's drugs
Kissing you is like getting high on someone else's drugs
Kissing you is like getting high on someone else's drugs 
Kissing you
