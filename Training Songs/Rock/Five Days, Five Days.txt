(One day, two days, three, four, five) 
A-that's how long that she's been gone 
And that's a long time 
Five days, five days 
Since you walked out the door 
Won't you please come home 
I couldn't stand five more 

Well the first day after she left me 
I laughed and told my friends 
That he'd be back before 
The sun is settin' low again 
Five days, five days 
Since you walked out the door 
Won't you please come home 
I couldn't stand five more 

Well, the second day after she left me 
I started to have my doubts 
I wondered if she was comin' back 
Really had checked out 
Five days, five days 
Since you walked out the door 
Won't you please come home 
I couldn't stand five more 
(One, two, three, four, five days more)

Well, the third day after she left me 
I started to watch the door 
Before the day was over 
I began to walk the floor 
Five days, five days 
Since you walked out the door 
Won't you please come home 
I couldn't stand five more 

Well the fourth day after she left me 
I really began to sweat 
She should have been back days ago 
But she ain't got back yet 
Five days, five days 
Since you walked out the door 
Won't you please come home 
I couldn't stand five more 
(One, two, three, four, five days more)
