From the silence comes hope when you said "everything in time", 
So lay your head upon my chest and don't worry it will be alright. 
From the silence comes a dream, you are there standing in a crowd. 
When words have all lost there worth just look into my eyes. 
And breathe with me in unison here with me [Repeat: x1]
