So when all things come to an end
Deadly switches all close at hand
Make your dreams and duties mingle
Laws and morals finally bend
Holy switch will you defend?
I'm switching all the time
Switching ain't no crime
Gotta change the climate
Gotta raise my rate
You see a boy in motion
Is never much too late

Switching's easy, oh, it's essential
And you know when you flick it
You can start a new episode
Warm love, can costume hatred
And the truth could be a lie
Yes a man can, switch to lady
Of indiscreet last goodbyes
And a blade can switch behind you
When you expect shells from the sky
Oh you go when it's your time
Switching down the line
Switching ain't no crime
Gotta change the climate
Gotta raise my rate
You see a boy in motion
Is never much too late

Switching's easy, oh, it's essential
And you know when you flick it
You can start a new episode

Switching's easy, oh, it's essential
And you know when you flick it
You can start a new episode
Switching's easy, oh, it's essential
And you know when you flick it
You can start a new episode
