Get hot
Get too close to the flame
Wild open space
Talk like an open book
Sign me up

Got no time to take a picture
I'll remember someday
All the chances we took
We're so close to something
Better left unknown
I can feel it in my bones

Gimme sympathy
After all of this is gone
Who would you rather be
The Beatles or The Rolling Stones
Oh seriously, you're gonna make mistakes,
You're young
Come on baby play me something like
Here comes the sun

Don't go
Stay with the all unknown
Stay away from the hooks
All the chances we took
We're so close to something
Better left unknown
I can feel it in my bones

Gimme sympathy
