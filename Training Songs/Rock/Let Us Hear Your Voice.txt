There's a rebellion on ice and you'll pay the price
As your freedom fades away
Dishonesty is high, so won't you even try
To stand up for your rights and say

We don't want your laws so take 'em back right now
They're bullshit anyhow
It's time we had our say the injustice cannot stay
They stabbed us in the back
And you can feel it bleeding if your heart's beating now

So let us hear your voice they said we have a choice
But I don't believe they really meant it so
We're gonna call their bluff 'cause we have had enough
Take the power back the foundation's gonna crack

I see the freedom at the end of the road
I've heard so many lies and I've taken the blows
Give it to me take it from me nobody knows
Sick of being used and I'm gonna explode
Total destruction all over the place
There is so much hate it's a fuckin' disgrace
Everyone is blind; can't see through the lies
But they aren't even looking at the wolves in disguise

So will you hear the call or let the judgments fall
This is it so wake up let's go
And track the liars down and then remove their crowns
And lash 'em with the binds they hold

We don't want your laws so take 'em back right now
They're bullshit anyhow
It's time we had our say the injustice cannot stay
They stabbed us in the back
And you can feel it bleeding if your heart's beating now

So let us hear your voice they said we have a choice
But I don't believe they really meant it so
We're gonna call their bluff 'cause we have had enough
Take the power back the foundation's gonna crack

I see the freedom at the end of the road
I've heard so many lies and I've taken the blows
Give it to me take it from me nobody knows
Sick of being used and I'm gonna explode
Total destruction all over the place
There is so much hate it's a fuckin' disgrace
Everyone is blind; can't see through the lies
But they aren't even looking at the wolves in disguise

And you can feel it bleeding if your heart's beating now

Everyone is blind; can't see through the lies
But they aren't even looking at the wolves in disguise

So let's hear your voice or we wont have a choice
Haven't we had enough today?
Rebellion's on ice but we'll pay the price
Don't let our freedoms fade away
