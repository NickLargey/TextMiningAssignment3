Pre>capo at 3 /c /b etc mean passing bass notes

G see /c /b
I wonder what you are thinkin'
Am7
Under the rooftops there
D
Pullin' tangles from your hair
G see /c /b
I wonder if the water you're drinkin'
Am7
Comes from a purer stream
D
The one where sunlight gleams
Bm am7
Things round here don't get any clearer
Bm am7 d
Stuff that once seemed in reach is not any nearer

I wonder if that house is still standin' or did they knock it flat
Well that's progress that's that I wonder who was more demanding
We were just young I guess neither would settle for less
Still it's not a whole life story is it
It's just a page I turned and there you were in it

I wonder how you are farin' not sliding down a slope
Takin' the knocks I hope
I wonder where your eyes are starin'
Not into some emptiness into someone's I guess
But that still won't make things any clearer
People seem to drift apart instead of getting nearer

I wonder what you are doin' under the evening sky
Watchin' your life go by
I wonder if that place is in ruins and all the doors are closed
That's just the way it goes
I wonder what there is worth keepin' from haunted episodes
That briefly woke us from sleepin' /pre>
