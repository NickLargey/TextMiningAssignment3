Hey old timer, can I ask you a question
While you're standing at the buffet?
Is this your first or second helping?
Why'd you come here anyway?
Hey old timer, why ya drinkin' the wine at Shakeys?
Hey old timer, I can tell your feet get achey.
Was it the ?? special that got you?
Did you cut your coupons in the Sunday Times?
You got your chili, don't forget your cornbread.
I can tell you come here all the time.
Did your friends say they couldn't make it?
Did you come here all alone?
Two-for-one's a stretch, you'll have to fake it.
Maybe we can share, I'm on my own.
Hey old timer, why ya drinkin' the wine at Shakeys?
Hey old timer, I can tell your feet get achey.
Hey old timer. Hey old timer. Hey old timer.
Hey old timer.
