(Rollin')
Since I was born they couldn't hold me down
Another misfit kid, another burned-out town
I never played by the rules, I never really cared
My nasty reputation takes me everywhere

I look and see it's not only me
So many others have stood where I stand
We are the young, so raise your hands

They call us problem child
We spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile
We are the youth gone wild
We stand and we won't fall
We're one and one for all
The writing's on the wall
We are the youth gone wild

Boss screamin' in my ear about who I'm supposed to be
Getcha a 3-piece wall street smile and son you'll look just like me
I said "hi man, there's something that you oughta know  I'll tell ya Park Avenue leads to 
Skid Row
I look and see it's not only me
We're standin' tall, ain't never a doubt
We are the young, so shout it out

They call us problem child
We spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile
We are the youth gone wild
We stand up, we won't fall
We're one and one for all
The writing's on the wall
We are the youth gone wild

Let me hear you wild

They call us problem child
We spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile
We are the youth gone wild
We stand up, we won't fall
We're one and one for all
The writing's on the wall
We are the youth gone wild (oh oh oh oh)
We are the youth gone wild (oh oh oh oh)
We are the youth gone wild 
Yeah yeah yeah
We are the youth gone wild (oh oh oh oh)
We are the youth gone wild
