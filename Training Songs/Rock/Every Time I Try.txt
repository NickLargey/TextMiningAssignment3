I want to hold you
But every time I try
Something keeps you
Out of reach
I want to love you
But every time I try
Something keeps
Love away
And I can feel it
So love me right now
Though it won't last
Girl don't make me try
'Cause I'll lose you forever
Every time
Every time
But every time I try
To put our love out
Like a fire
You keep me in your reach
And every time I try
To throw away my desire
You hold me
So close
And I can feel it
So love me right now
Though it won't last
Girl don't make me try
'Cause I'll lose you forever
Every time
Every time
