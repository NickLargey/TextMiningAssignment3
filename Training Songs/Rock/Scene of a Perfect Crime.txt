My eyes are jaded and complicated,
Tired of the liars and the masqueraded
Who steals our innocence away,
Like a thief in the night?
Who took away our faith in what we know to be right?
That was another world, then
That was another time
You can never go back to the scene of a perfect crime.

Whatever became of the child I was
I never want to lose her no 
I won't give her up
And now my heart is harder,
My skin is getting tougher and tougher
That was another world then
That was another time
You can never go back to the place where love is blind
You can never go back to the scene of a perfect crime

Whatever became of our sweet blind love
As long as we could be together it was more than enough
Now we're all grown up and we need so much
I never knew that the price would go up as such
That was another world then, then
That was another time

Well you can never go back to the place where love is blind.
Well you can never go back to the place where love is blind.
Well you can never go back to the place where love is blind.
You can never go back to the scene of a perfect crime.
