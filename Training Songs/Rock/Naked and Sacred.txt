[Chorus]
When I'm with you
I feel naked And sacred
And this world can be so cold
I want to hold you naked And sacred
Till I grow old

What does love mean?
Can love last?
I ask myself these questions
Haunted by the past
I've walked these city streets
I've known victories and defeats
Serchin', hopin', just barely copin'
Baby, I want to be good for you
I want to be true
Don't know how I'd live with myself
If I ever hurt you

[Chorus]

Since I met you
My life's changed
I feel like a bird
That's been let out of its cage
Baby, I want to be good for you
I want to be true
Don't know how I'd live with myself
If I even hurt you

[Chorus]

Your hand's healin' me
Your love's filling me
When you go away
Your heart's still in me

[Chorus x 2]
