So long, so very long, so long since I've seen my hometown
I'm coming home. Now I'm coming home.
I'm coming home. To the place I call my own.
You're in my soul. I can't explain how much you mean to me.
Long years, long trying years, away from home. I
N a foreign country. So strange, so very strange, it feels so strange.
To be back here again., Can't wait to see
What happened to my friends, my family.
Oh no, They've gone and named my home St. Petersburg.
What's going on? Where are all the friend I had.
It's all wrong, I'm feeling lost like I just don't belong.
Give me back, give me back my Leningrad.
No one, I blame no one, it's no ones fault. That the times have changed.
Go on, Oh life goes on, I'll carry on.
And turn a new page. Can't wait to see what's my fate, what's my destiny.
Oh no, They've gone and named my home St. Petersburg.
What's going on? Where are all the friend I had.
It's all wrong, I'm feeling lost like I just don't belong.
Give me back, give me back my Leningrad.
