(Bom, bom, bom, ba-ba-ba-va-yom bom-bom-ba-yoh...)

So you feel you can't go on
(that) you got nothin' left to lose
There is no one left to love
(that) you got nuthin' left to choose

Can't live for yesterday
'cause we gotta move on in a different way
Today is another day
Can't stop now today is another day

Can't stop this love, can't stop
We're movin'
Can't stop this love
Got to keep movin'
We got faith in what love can do
(shake it, shake it, shake-skake it, shake it)- don't look back we're gonna make it through
Can't stop now, got to keep movin'

You feel you got nowhere to run
There is nothing we can't do
You have so much left to love
In the end there's always me and you...

Can't live for yesterday
'cause we gotta move on in a different way
Today is another day
Can't stop now today is another day

Can't stop this love, can't stop bgs: we're movin'
Can't stop this love
Got to keep movin'
We got faith in what love can do
(shake it, shake it, shake-skake it, shake it)- don't look back we're gonna make it through
Can't stop now, got to keep movin'

A yo/front back middle to top we keep it groovin'
(shake it shake it, shake it shake it) no more sad songs singing the blues we keep it moving

Can't stop this love, can't stop bgs: we're movin'
Can't stop this love
Got to keep movin'
We got faith in what love can do
(shake it, shake it, shake-skake it, shake it)- don't look back we're gonna make it through
Can't stop now, got to keep movin'

You know we don't stop, even when the wheels lock
And when the beat knocks
People in the street rock
