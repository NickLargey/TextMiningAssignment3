What happened to you and me? 
One moment changed everything 
It's done and there's no way to take it back 
Mistake gave me the pain I never had 
There is no way to justify it so 
Now I breathe in and let it go 

This is the end of everything 
Goodbye my only 
I hang my head and I give in 
Goodbye my only friend 

Part of me I'll never see 
Come visit me in my dreams 
I feel my actions are destroying me 
Deep down below the shallow life I lead 
The pain is mine to keep and call my own 
I'll carry it until I'm gone 

This is the end of everything 
Goodbye my only 
I hang my head and I give in 
Goodbye my only friend 

I can't fogrive myself that I let go 
My life is worth no more than yours I know 

This is the end of everything 
Goodbye my only 
I hang my head and I give in 
Goodbye my only friend
