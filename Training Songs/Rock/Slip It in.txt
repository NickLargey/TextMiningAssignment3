Hey mama. Come on, come on.
I don't know.
Come on, come on. This is it.
I kinda got a boyfriend.
No, no. This is happening. This is the time, now.
Uh, oh, ok!
Alright, come on, go, go

You're loose
(Slip it in)
Put your brain in a noose
(Slip it in)
The next day you regret it
(Slip it in)
But, you're still loose

You say you don't want it
You don't want it
Say you don't want it
Then you slip it on in

In, in, in

You feel like a whore
(Slip it in)
But what you did the night before
(Slip it in)
You decided to be all loose
(Slip it in)
And go all crazy

You say you don't want it
You don't want it
Say you don't want it
But then you slip it on in

In, yeah

You slip it in [Repeat x2]

You say you didn't think
(Slip it in)
You said you had too much to drink
(Slip it in)
Is it in the chemical?
(Slip it in)
Or is it just some part of you?

You say you don't want it
You don't want it
Say you don't want it
But then you slip it on in

In, in, in

You regret how you felt
(Slip it in)
You felt it
(Slip it in)
You decided to be all loose
(Slip it in)
It's what you choose

You say you don't want it
You don't want it
Say you don't want it
But then you slip it on in

You slip it in [x2]

Alright! Hey! Hey!

You say you got a boyfriend
(Slip it in)
But you're hinting at my friends
(Slip it in)
And everybody else's friend
(Slip it in)
You're not loose, you're wide open

And you say you don't want it
You don't want it
Say you don't want it
Then you slip it on in

In, in, in

You're getting around
(Slip it in)
I'm not putting it down
(Slip it in)
It's just what it is
(Slip it in)
Getting it while it's around

You say you don't want it
You don't want it
You don't want it
But then you slip it on in

In, in, in

You slip it in [Repeat x2]

Mount up!
