I am just a school girl
Living in a fantasy world 
Now I'm outspoken
I walked around for a couple of years
Trying to convince myself
It was a plan I was to understand it

They say things to me like you're so beautiful
They spoke of other things like 
how much do you charge
You're youthful you can't hide behind that face
You're so youthful sit tight and stare

Oh

Silence stalks me pushes me through
I feel so broken
Turn the lights on a couple of times to see if you would exchange
I would not know if you turned them off

They said things to me like you're so wonderful
You spoke of other things like I love you 'cause
You're youthful you can't hide behind that face
You're so youthful sit tight and stare

Oh

Maybe I'm allowed maybe it's in the book
Maybe I could shout down the walls
9 till 5 I hope it doesn't show 
9 till 5 it's not a perfect thing

They said things to me like you're amazing
You speak of other things like is this going on my bill
You're youthful you can't hide behind that face
You're so youthful sit tight and stare

Oh

You're Youthful
You know this time will not do
You're so youthful I own you now

Oh

Youthful yeah
