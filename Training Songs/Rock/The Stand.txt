Can you feel a song rising up?
Can you hear the language of love?
Can we walk together
The winding road up to the rising sun?

Was a time when we could only see
Waves of grain from sea to shining sea
Now the world is smaller, but our dreams
Are larger than they used to be

Come on and stand, come on now, stand
Come on and stand, plant your sword in the sand
In this age of unreason
There's a time and a season for love, stand
I know you can

Like a pilgrim traveling in disguise
I searched for God, I found it in your eyes
Now, I know there is a place
Where sweet compassion never dies

It's between the darkness and the light
In the deepest stillness of the night
There's a fire that burns
Where hearts will find their wings and take to flight

Come on and stand, come on now, stand
Come on and stand, plant your sword in the sand
In this age of unreason
There's a time and a season for love, stand
If you feel love, stand

Allah, Buddha, Yahweh, Jesus, Brahma
People get ready there's a train it's coming
Many different legends, just one story
All aboard the train that's bound for glory
