You say it's over now but it's easy to see
You still belong to him you're not happy with me
You can hide all your feelings until he passes by
That's when I see the blues in your pretty brown eyes
Your pretty brown eyes (pretty brown eyes) keep telling me lies (telling me lies)
But they can't hide the hurt with a smile of disguise
You can hide all your feelings until he passes by
That's when I see the blues in your pretty brown eyes

Your pretty brown eyes (pretty brown eyes) keep telling me lies (telling me lies)
But they can't hide the hurt with a smile of disguise
You can hide all your feelings until he passes by
That's when I see the blues in your pretty brown eyes
