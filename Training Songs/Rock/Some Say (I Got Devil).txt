Some say I got devil 
Some say I got angel 
But I'm just a girl in trouble 
I don't think I'm in danger 
Don't think I'm in danger 
No, I know I'm not in danger 
But some have tried to sell me 
All kinds of things to save me 
From hurting like a woman, and crying like a baby 
Something like a woman, crying like a baby 

And all the things that I have seen 
Qualify me for a part in your dream 
Qualify me for this dream 

And though I'd like to tell it 
Exactly how I feel it 
Somehow the music 
Hides it and conceals it 
Hides it and conceals it 
Oh, it hides 

And all the things that I have seen
Can be hidden in a part of my dream
Gonna hide it in my dream

Some say I've got devil
Some say I got angel 
But I'm just this girl in trouble 
I don't think I'm in danger 
No I'm not in danger 
No, I know I'm not in danger
