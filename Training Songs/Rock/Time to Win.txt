It's time to win!
I built my soul on rock and roll
Then someone told me kids don't rock no more
Oh! oh! oh! oh! it's time to win!
I built my soul on rock and roll
Then someone told me kids don't rock no more
Oh! oh! oh! oh! it's time to win!

I got a red cup, you fill it up for me
I'm on the guest list, you better check for me
Head's heavy but the drink holds it up for me
Keep it up for me, keep it, keep it up for me
I see your hands down, you put them up for me
Chick, don't even pretend that you're not horny
Rhyme like I'm steve tyler, barb wire
The doors are open baby, light my fire

I built my soul on rock and roll
Then someone told me kids don't rock no more
Oh! oh! oh! oh! it's time to win!
I built my soul on rock and roll
Then someone told me kids don't rock no more
Oh! oh! oh! oh! it's time to win!

Oooweee, hit something, 2 points
Oooweee, sip something, 2 points
I'm leaning, I'm melted, I'm winning, bring your helmet
When we say jam like nba jam
Can't buy a bucket, f*ck it
Eyes china through my ray bans
Look at me kids, I'm winning
Stop the music, where's my ribbon?

I built my soul on rock and roll
Then someone told me kids don't rock no more
Oh! oh! oh! oh! it's time to win!
I built my soul on rock and roll
Then someone told me kids don't rock no more
Oh! oh! oh! oh! it's time to win!

I'm just a bad little mother showing off
And if you love me, let me see your hands up
And if you hate me why the hell'd you show up
I'm just a bad little mother showing off
Diamonds in my drink tonight
I want diamonds in my drink tonight
I'll get diamonds in my drink tonight
I got diamonds so I drink to life
Lining down the block tonight
Yeah they're lining down the block tonight
Yeah my show is gonna rock tonight
You're going to have to call the cops tonight

I built my soul on rock and roll
Then someone told me kids don't rock no more
Oh! oh! oh! oh! it's time to win!
I built my soul on rock and roll
Then someone told me kids don't rock no more
Oh! oh! oh! oh!
