I think of the distance
Between you and me,
Which doesn't explain
Why the strangest places
Still call my name.
I don't know how to live,
I only know how to disappear.
And I don't want to travel,
And I don't want to stay here.

They speak of destiny and fate,
And powers that move unseen.
And I get these pictures,
Of how my life might have been.
I hear home is where the heart is,
But I never get to learn
Where my heart is.

Upside down.
Upside down.
I'm always turning things
Upside down.

The timing was right.
But it was still a surprise,
To find my heart had followed my eyes.
I was just another man
With his eyes on you.
And a need for agony,
That he had to subdue.

Upside down...
In your eyes.
