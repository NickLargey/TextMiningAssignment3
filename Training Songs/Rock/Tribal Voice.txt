There's a walking of a rainbow dawn
And the sun will rise up high
There's a whisper in the morning light
Saying get up and meet the day

Well I winder if it's part of history
Full of influential mystery
From the spirits of my people
Who have just hone before
And the future of another day

All the people in the world are dreaming (get up stand up)
Some of us cry for the rights of survival (get up stand up)
Saying c'mon c'mon! Stand up for your rights
While others don't give a damn
They're all waiting for a perfect day
So you better get up and fight for your rights
Don't be afraid of the move you make
You better listen to your tribal voice!

All the people in the world are dreaming (get up stand up)

So you better get up and fight for your rights
Don't be afraid or the move that you make
You better listen to your tribal voice!
You better listen to your tribal voice!
