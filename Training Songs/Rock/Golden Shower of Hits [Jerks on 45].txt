Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely someone calls on me
And every now and then I spend the time to find a person who's so
Close to me

And then along comes Mary (ooh, ooh, ooh)
And then she want to give me kicks and
Now what to get from me will be memories
I really got the tales, all the trials and tribulations
No one's ever seen

Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Why do stars fall down from the skies
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

From the day that you were born the fairies got together and decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled angel dust in your hair
Golden starlight in your eyes, ooh

I find my baby, gotta hold her tight
Gotta grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been "when it's right, it's right"
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?

When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway

(Thinking of you's working up my appetite)
(Looking forward to a little afternoon delight)
(Rubbing sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite)
(And the thought of loving you is getting so exciting)
(Sky rockets in flight)
(Afternoon delight!)
(Afternoon delight!)

Have my baby
What a wonderful way of saying how much you love me
Having my baby
What a lovely way of saying what you're thinkin' of me
I can see it
Faces glowing
I can see it in your eyes, a happy knowing
'Cause you're having my baby
You're the woman I love and I love what it's doing to ya
Having my baby!
You're a woman in love and I love what's going through ya

Love, love will keep us together
Think of me babe, whenever
Some sweet-talking guy comes along
Singin' a song
Don't mess around, you just gotta be strong
Stop (stop!) I really love you
Stop (stop!) I been thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love

Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-Y or S-U-R-P-R-I-S-E
But the words we're holding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E
Becomes final today
Me and little S-O-B
Will be going away
But I love you both, and this will be pure H-E-double-L on me
How I wish we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E
