I make a miserable D.J. getting drunk, playing records up late 
Wearing out a hole in my heart on the couch from when you went away 
Today wrote out a prescription leave all calls to the answering machine 
I donâ??t remember anything but I know that you know where Iâ??ve been 

Where would I go? 
What would I do? 
I would be nowhere with out you 
Now I know heavens above you I can grow 
I just canâ??t make it on my own 

Watching terrible T.V itâ??s ok all our secrets we keep 
I used to dream of broken teeth now I lie awake watching you sleep 
If Iâ??m so independent why when you leave am I digging up holes 
To hide and wait 'til you come back like a bad actor between roles 

Where would I go? 
What would I do? 
I would be nowhere without you 
Now I know heavens above you I can grow 
I just canâ??t make it on my own 

Good morning baby itâ??s raining outside 
But weâ??ve got all day and the suns in your eyes 
Frisky on whisky weâ??re champagne and wine 
Drinking in, sinking in love 
Where weâ??ll go I gloriously donâ??t know 

Iâ??m nowhere without you 
(now I know) 
Heavenâ??s above you 
(I can grow)
