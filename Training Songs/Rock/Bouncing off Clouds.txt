Bouncing off of clouds
We were
Is there a lone lost-and-found?
Make it easy
Make this easy
Itâ??s not as heavy as it seems
Wrapped in metal
Wrapped in ivy
Painted in mint ice cream

We could bouncing off the top of this cloud
(Iâ??ve put on my silver)
Bouncing off the top of this cloud
Failure to respond worked
I talked but did you listen
Bouncing off the top of this cloud
(Iâ??ve put on my silver)

Ooh but would you say has it come to this
(Iâ??ve put on my silver)
Bouncing off the top of this cloud
Well you can stare all day at the sky
But that wonâ??t bring him back
That wonâ??t bring him back
You say youâ??re waiting on fate
But I think we decide
I think we decide
Where we take our lives

Make it easy
Easy
Easy
We could make this easy
Easy love
Easy
We could make this easy
Make this easy
Itâ??s not as heavy as it seems
Make this easy
Make this easy
Itâ??s not as heavy as it seems
Wrapped in metal
Wrapped in ivy
Big umbrellas smiling

We could bouncing off the top of this cloud
(Iâ??ve put on my silver)
Ooh but would you say has it come to this
(Iâ??ve put on my silver)
Bouncing off the top of this cloud
(Iâ??ve put on my silver)
Ooh but would you say has it come to this
(Iâ??ve put on my silver)
Bouncing off of clouds 
We were.
