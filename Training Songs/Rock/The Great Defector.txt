I am the defector
And you?re the farmer?s daughter
You been teasing us farm boys
Till we start talkin? about those rabbits, George
Oh won?t you tell us ?bout those rabbits, George

I am the defector
I give it what it need
Let?s make a new world order
Let?s make it rhyme

You?re the chocolate at the end of my Cornetto
I love the way your underwire bra
Always sets off that X-ray machine

Comin? into land and
Now I love the colour of it all
Blue lights on the runway
I love the colour of it all

I am the defector
?Cause someone stirred my soul
With that great big stick of hers
Kinda looks like an oar

The accountants have taken the movie
Yeah, they?re on set
The people from the mobile phone company
Say who gets to play and who gets to not

You?re a picture of the check out girl
Hand me a plastic bag
I got the sweats trying to open it
As it all piles up, I wish I didn?t bite my nails

Comin? into land and
Now I love the colour of it all
Blue lights on the runway
I love the colour of it all
Getting ready to spill my guts and
I love the colour of it all
To the waitress on roller skates
I love the colour of it all
Oh the colour of it all

I am the great defector
So I must affect an air
Of a man who?s maybe seen too much
But still just manages to care

Still you?re the chocolate at the end of my Cornetto
I love the way your underwire bra
Always sets off that X-ray machine

Comin? into land and
Now I love the colour of it all
Blue lights on the runway
I love the colour of it all
Getting ready to spill my guts and
I love the colour of it all
To the, to the waitress on roller skates
I love the colour of it all
Oh the colour of it all

Waitress on roller skates [x8]
(Love the colour of it all) [x2]
