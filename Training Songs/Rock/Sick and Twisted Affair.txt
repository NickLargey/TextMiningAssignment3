(Smell the fear)
There’s no reflection when you look in the mirror
You’re out for blood and you can smell the fear
You need poison
Like it’s the only thing that keeps you alive
You hear voices
They just keep telling you they need me tonight

She hides until twilight
Then she takes control
I’m like your dirty little drug
And you never get enough
Just a little bad habit that you have from your friends
I’m like your dirty little drug
And you never get enough
Said you didn't want it but you're in a sick and twisted affair
You won't be alone tonight
(A sick and twisted affair)
You won't be alone tonight

I give you wings when you’re free falling
I’m in your dreams, I’m the creature a calling
You go colder
I am the only thing that keeps you alive
Can’t stay sober
One taste and it can take control of your life

She hides until twilight
Then she takes control
I’m like your dirty little drug
And you never get enough
Just a little bad habit that you have from your friends
I’m like your dirty little drug
And you never get enough
Said you didn't want it but you're in a sick and twisted affair
You won't be alone tonight
(A sick and twisted affair)
You won't be alone tonight

Take control
I’m like your dirty little joy
And you never get enough
Just a little bad habit that you have from your friends
I’m like your dirty little drug
And you never get enough
Said you didn't want it but you're in a sick and twisted affair
You won't be alone tonight
(A sick and twisted affair)
You won't be alone tonight
(A sick and twisted affair)
You won't be alone tonight
(A sick and twisted affair)
You won’t be alone tonight
