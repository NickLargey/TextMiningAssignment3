I see the black fade to grey
I feel forwards as the only way
Yesterday all my happiness seemed so far away
Now it looks as though its here to stay

Shine like stars
Shine like stars do

Cast a wish to the moon afar
Spare a thought for the one who matters
If we could only mend the breaks
Open up our arms to fate sweet fate.

Shine like stars
Shine like stars do

I see the black fade to grey
I feel forwards as the only way
Hold on tightly and hope it all lasts
Celebrate the future
Forget the past.

Shine like stars
Shine like stars do
