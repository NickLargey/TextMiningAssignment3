You were looking for the sunshine
High up above,
I saw you in ther window crying.

I was standing on the outside 
As I caught your eye
How could you think that I could let you down.

(chorus)
Your fired eyes look so weary
Oh girl, why do you hide
To hold you close, I need you near
Oh girl, stay by my side.

Then I looked & saw the sunlight
Breakin' in through the clouds, now
I just want to see it shine in your heart

(chorus)
Your tired eyes look so weary
Oh girl, why do you hide
To hold you close, I need you near
Oh girl, stay by my side.
