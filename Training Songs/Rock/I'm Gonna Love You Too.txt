You're gonna say you miss me
And you're gonna say you'll kiss me
And you're gonna say you love me
'Cause I'm gonna love you too

I don't care what you told me
You're gonna say you'll hold me
And you're gonna say you love me
'Cause I'm gonna love you too

After all, another fella took ya
But I still can't overlook ya
I'm gonna do my best to hook ya
After all is said and done

I don't care what you told me
You're gonna say you'll hold me
And you're gonna say you love me
'Cause I'm gonna love you too

You're gonna tell me sweet things
You're gonna make my heart sing
And I'm gonna hear bells ring
'Cause I'm gonna love you too

A, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
After all another fella took ya
But I still can't overlook ya
I'm gonna do my best to hook ya
After all is said and done

You're gonna say you miss me
And you're gonna say you'll kiss me
And you're gonna say you love me
'Cause I'm gonna love you too

I'm gonna love you too
I'm gonna love you too
I'm gonna love you too
