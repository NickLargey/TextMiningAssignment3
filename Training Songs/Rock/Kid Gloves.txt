Well, they sprung me out of Quentin, 
I'm back on the mob's payroll 
They can buy my body 
Sure they can't buy my soul. 
I'm working out of Stockton 
I''m weighing in at two -o -one 
But there's a man in the front row 
Sent down by the mob with a gun. 

For 'Kid Gloves', 'Kid Gloves', I'm back out on the street. 
'Kid Gloves', the master to the beat 
'Kid Gloves', I'll do anything but dive. 

We'll the bought me out of Quentin. 
They've gone and placed their bets. 
I've got to throw the fight 
Just to save my neck. 
Saying 'yes' to the set up 
Made me feel so cheap 
But the street felt so good 
Now I've only got myself to beat 

A deal is a deal 
But you know I just can't win 
The mob oughta know 
My conscience is wearing thin 

For 'Kid' Gloves, I'm back in the ring 
'Kid ' Gloves, I'll fight anything 
'Kid" Gloves, I'll do anything but dive. 

'Kid Gloves', I'm back on the street 
'Kid" Gloves the master to beat 
"Kid" Gloves, Ill do anything but cry, 

'Kid' Gloves, I'm back on my feet 
"Kid" Gloves, The master to beat 
"Kid" Gloves, I'll do anything but cry 

"Kid" Gloves, I'm back in the ring. 
"Kid Gloves, I'll fight anything 
"Kid Gloves" I'll do anything but dive 

Well, they burned me out of Quentin, 
They've gone and placed their bets 
I've got to throw a fight 
Just to save my neck. 
Saying yes to the set up 
Made me feel so cheap 
But the street felt so good 
Now I've only got myself to beat 

"Kid Gloves, I'm back out on the street 
"Kid' Gloves,
