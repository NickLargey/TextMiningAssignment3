I never look good
Cos it's so hard to do
This salutation is made just for you
And I know
It won't change your mind

I tell you something
cos you asked for the truth
You say I'm sick of this, f*ck
Well, I'm sick of it too
I know we've done this before

But I guess I'll never change your mind
No I guess I'll never change your mind
But I'll try

When you catch me walkin' down your street
Falling over my endless sleep
Well you know, I'm keeping round your door

And if I'm running out of words
Speaking out of turn
And chilling at the top (unsure?)
Can't carry it that far

Well you know, you know the reason why

But I guess I'll never change your mind
No I guess I'll never change your mind
But at least you know how hard I tried
Well I guess I'll never change your mind

Well I guess I'll never change your mind
No I guess I'll never change your mind
But at least you know how hard I tried
Well I guess I'll never change your mind
