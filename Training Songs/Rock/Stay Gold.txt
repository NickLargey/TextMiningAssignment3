Standing outside of Dollar General
Another MLK Boulevard
Getting one more bag of dime store weed
To smoke in my backyard
Well I'm so damn bored I could cut myself
Only four more hours to kill
Every day until my mom gets out of working at the mill

You gotta stay gold, now my pony boy
Don't let them get you down
While the locals work for coffee
Remember You own this town
Not a soul is gonna listen
Yeah, your scream won't make a sound
With a world so black and white, boy
Stay gold, gold, gold, gold

We went by the Marietta train tracks
Where your sister lost her days
Traded a dirty magazine
To the pinball guy for plays
I remember you always saying
If you ever got out alive
You'd quit using and get married to
That girl on page twenty-five

You gotta stay gold, now my pony boy
Don't let them get you down
While the locals all work for taxes
Remember that you own this town
Not a soul is gonna listen
Yeah, your scream won't make a sound
With a world so black and white, boy
Stay gold, gold
Stay gold, gold

You gotta stay gold, now my pony boy
Don't let them get you down
While the locals all work for taxes
Remember that you own this town
Not a soul is gonna hear you
Yeah, your scream won't make a sound
With a world so black and white, boy
Stay gold, gold
Stay gold, gold
