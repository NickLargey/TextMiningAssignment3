Dizzy, dizzy
Oh so dizzy

Scorpio rising on the horizon
Thunder tumbling from the mountains
Harpy sirens strangle silence
A piece of mind left dying

Dizzy, oh so dizzy
Dizzy, oh so dizzy

Below the waves, below their grace
Your hair is gorgeous
Dancing harmonics, dancing hypnotic
Left dying

Oh dizzy, oh dizzy
Oh dizzy, oh dizzy

Oh dizzy, oh so dizzy
Oh dizzy, oh
