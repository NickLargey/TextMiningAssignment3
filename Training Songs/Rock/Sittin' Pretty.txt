If I point my gun at you
Are you gonna see it my way?
And if I tell you what to do
I think we can make it work this way

And if you run from me, I'll know
I'll find you and God help you
She just waits for me at home
I'm going down, I'm taking you

My baby's tied to a chair
Don't she look pretty, just sittin' there?
My baby's tied to a chair
Don't she look pretty, just sittin' there?

And if she wants some air, she tells me
(I can't breathe!)
And if she wants some love, I'll kiss her
And when I'm close, you know, she can smell me

And when I'm gone, I'll surely miss her
My baby's tied to a chair
Don't she look pretty, just sittin' there?
My baby's tied to a chair

Don't she look pretty, just sittin' there?
