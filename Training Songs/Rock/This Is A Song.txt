I don't wanna tell her
No, I don't wanna tell her
I lie awake in the dark
Lost in the beat of my heart
Well baby, look over your shoulder
You're not alone in this love

That I've been thinking of you
Lost in the things that you do
Maybe it's over
But over is not a word that you know

And if it hurts me baby
You know why
I go it alone
Hurt me baby if you like
It's already gone

I don't wanna tell her
No, I don't wanna tell her
I've been calling your name
Each time feels like it's in vain
Maybe it's over but over is not a word
That you know

I don't wanna tell her
No, I don't wanna tell her
I've been falling apart
Broke every rule from the start
Baby, look over your shoulder
You're not alone

And it hurts me baby when you try
To go it alone
So you can hurt me baby if you like
You're already gone

This is a song
And these are the words

I don't wanna hear it
Don't wanna hear it

This is a song and these are the words

Well I could be wrong

This is a song

Hurt me baby if you like

I don't wanna tell her
No, I don't wanna tell her
I lie awake in the dark
Lost in the beat of my heart
Mayi don't wanna tell her
No, I don't wanna tell her
I lie awake in the dark
Lost in the beat of my heart
Well baby, look over your shoulder
You're not alone in this love
Maybe, it's over but over is not a word
That you know

Do you want to know why
Do you know why
Do you know
She goes why
