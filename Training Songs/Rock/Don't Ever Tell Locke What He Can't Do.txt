I took everything you said
Harder than we should
Are we wanting more 
Than to try to sell you out
Are you one

he's trying to say we can't
Yes I can
And you can't have all that you want
Yes I can
And when your wrong I'm still not right

sign it off
And throw it back against the wall
You asked me how
And what if I resent you now
And what if I can't trust 
In anything you say

you're trying to say we can't
Yes I can
You can't have all that you want
Yes I can
And when your wrong I'm still not right

let's start again
Replace it
Let's start again
Erase it
So move along and face it

you trying to say we can't
Yes I can
You can't have all that you want
Yes I can
And when your wrong I'm still not right
