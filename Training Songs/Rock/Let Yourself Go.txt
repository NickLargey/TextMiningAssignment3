Come on, let's run, it's time for some fun
Can't you see, now it's come over me, since I met you
Don't hold it inside, we got nothin' to hide

Ooh tonight, come on and make it alright
It's right if you say that it's so
So come on and let yourself go

Reach for the sky, you know I might if I try
But all I want is just to be alone, and to hold you, ooh
Now what do you say, won't you see it my way

Ooh tonight, come on and make it alright
It's right if you say that it's so
So come on and let yourself go..............

Ride in my car, you can play my guitar
Or you could give it away, until the heartache starts to get to ya, ooh
Show me a sign, say you wanna be mine

Ooh tonight, come on and make it alright
It's right if you say that it's so
So come on and let yourself go
Come on, let's make it alright
It's right if you say that it's so
So come on and let yourself go
So come on and let yourself go
