SOLO GUITAR INTRO)
lately I've felt a little crazy
like I do when that moon's gettin' full
is there a change in the air or the way that I care
how can I explain how I feel
 
wish I knew me better
and I would if I half-tried
 
but my will is strong and it just carries me on
following the way that I feel
no my love ain't dead it just got to my head
and I need a little space to feel free
(GUITAR SOLO)
 
lately, I've gone a lot of places
and seen a lot of things I didn't need to see
maybe I followed a star a little bit too far
and lost something along the way
 
or maybe I needed to lose
something I shouldn't have had
but it feels so good to take a second look
following the way that I feel
no my love ain't dead it just got to my head
and I need a little space to feel free
(GUITAR SOLO)
 
I feel loose and contented
like to go where I want, when I can
if I set too much, my thoughts begin to rush
and nothin' is clear that I hear
 
I guess I'm a mover
just travelin' through my life to somewhere
 
but it feels so good to take a second look
following the way that I feel
no my love ain't dead it just got to my head
and I need a little space to feel free
while following the way that I feel
 
while I'm following,
following the way that I feel
while I'm following,
following the way that I feel
