Eh
Alright now, alright now eh
Ooh ooh eh
Huh aha

Just boy, school boy, dope boy
Noted down with added teeth with like 20 pair of shoes
Who ya gonna call now when the lawyer call your name? (mama)
And when it’s dead and in front of the state, look at all his dream (your mama)

Just boy, school boy, dope boy
Got a backpack full of time and you don’t know why
Why you don’t even respect the uncles
And the ladies that sacrifice to birth ya

And now you feel your blood’s on the ceil
You can’t just jitter it away
Nothing’s as the pill
And that’s still your mama
That’s still mama
And let your recognition show
That’s still mama

Just boy, school boy, dope boy
Stuckin around with an assault charge on your name
All the reason I make this song because I love ya
All the reason I take the time cause I don’t wanna bury ya

Just boy, school boy, dope boy
I ain’t gonna throw my hands up, I’mma love ya
Love ya, love ya
I know times can get hard
But I love ya so
It gets hard, you don’t get away you’ll be destroyed

And now you feel your blood’s on the ceil
You can’t just jitter it away
Nothing’s as the pill
And that’s still your mama
That’s still mama
And let your recognition show
That’s still mama
Your mama

Just boy, school boy, dope boy (dope boy)
I’m on fire
Cause I love ya
I do it, do it cause I love ya
I do it, do it cause I love ya
I do it, do it cause I love ya
I do it, do it cause I love ya
Do it, do it cause I love ya
Do it, do it cause I love ya
Do it, do it cause I love ya
Do it, do it

Pawnshop baby, had to clean your backside
When you can feed yourself, couldn’t clean your eyes
How on earth did you get so beside yourself
And I’ll be as a queen I’ll get it on
Boy, you’re gon refused
No matter how you feel

Your blood’s on the ceil now
You can’t just jitter it away
Nothing’s as the pill
That’s still mama
Your mama
That’s still mama
That’s still your mama
Let the recognition show

All breed from their mama
I remember mama
I remember mama, mama
I remember her loving
Kindest
