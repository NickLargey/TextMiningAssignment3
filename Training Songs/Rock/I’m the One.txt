[Chorus]
I'm the one
I've been here for you all along
I'm the one
Whose shoulder you've been cryin' on

Nice guys finish last
No one knows as good as me
We're just good friends
And you come to me for sympathy
And tell me that I'm not your type
Still you call me late at night
Every time he picks a fight
After all he's said and all he's done

[Chorus]

He's a total dick
That's the truth and you know I'm right
From everything you say
There's no way he'll ever do you right
You love a man who treats you wrong
You think you'll change him
But you're wrong
He'll use you, he'll say so long
After all he's said and all he's done

[Chorus]

I'm the one
Who wants you more than anything
You don't feel the same way
You made it clear to me
But I'll stand my ground
And maybe you'll hear what I've been sayin'
After all I've said and all I've done

[Chorus]
