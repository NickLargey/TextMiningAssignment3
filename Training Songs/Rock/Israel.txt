Realize if you're happy
Jesus sends you straight to hell

Israel
Israel

And should you dare, enjoy your body
Here tolls Hades welcome bell
Israel
Israel

You've found a middle course existance
We're all bones and flesh and shell
Israel
Israel

I can't answer for what armies do
They are not you
They are not you
They are not you

In other climes they bitch and whine
Just because you're not like them 
Israel
Israel

The sky is dark
For many others
They want it dark 
For you as well
Israel
Israel

Earth is just one big asylum
An explodes a prison cell
See us squirm in our own damaged spell
You were born
As guilty sinners
Before you stood up right, you fell
Put the fear of many gods
In Israel

Nature gave you 
Every impulse
Who are virgin priests to tell
Who, how to love
How to live
Israel
And they who reign, abuse, upon you
Upon you
They are jealous of you as well
Love yourself
As you should 
Israel
