When my head is all messed up,
And I feel like I'm all alone
I need to meet somebody,
Somebody let me take her home.

Girl for real I need love, but just for one night
Plus a tall mute chick, that don't want to fuss or fight
Just to light up my herb, and keep an eye on my drink
Girlfriend, try real hard not to think
And if the truck get pulled over while we smoking the hooch
Just hike up your skirt and stash the weed in your cooch
I need an everlasting joint, that don't cause lung cancer
And for her to get naked, and be my private dancer
I need huge boobs, on the daily in my face
Plus a girl that smoke and drink, and with me can keep the pace
That don't leave a trace of her life at all, I need a girl that chill and
Bone and ain't upset when I don't call
Naked on the ball, don't mind me talking shit
And when I find that kind of lady, I never let her quit
You know her mind function sick, when she speak you heed
And that's what I need

A yo I need love like I need a hole in the head
I need to come home to two bitches waiting in bed
I need handcuffs so the bitch don't leave
I need Nyquil and a blowjob to get me to sleep
I need a hot bitch to show off around town
I need collegiate pussy singing we can get down
I need a late night encounter to jerk to for weeks
I need my face buried in her lap till I can't even speak
I need a gang of ho's trying to f*ck each other
I need to bust in their face and wipe it up with the covers
I need girls who won't talk back to me
I need 1-2-3 bitches actually
I need huge titties on a bitch that's not fat
I need to stay clean with a backpack full of hats
I need them and they need me
I need love like I need the air I breathe

It's one of those weeks like one of those days
Can't get my head out outta this haze
I'm trapped in a maze tryin' to escape
But then I see this girl and her beautiful shape
Tight ass skirt just blows my mind
Nipple ring on her titty is oh so fine
A shock to my system I'm totally flippin'
Addicted to your love and I can't stop trippin'
