My mother spent 10 years sitting by a window
Scared if she spoke she would die of a heart attack
She listened as her dreams silently screamed
They drowned like little dolphins caught in a fishnet

Dear world I'm pleased to meet you

Hey everybody when you walk the walk
You gotta back it all up you gotta talk the talk
Hey everybody when I hear the knock
Don't want to measure out my life to the tick of a clock

Hey everybody when my daddy died
He had a sad sad story written in his eyes
Hey everybody when you walk the walk
You cannot measure out your life to the tick of a clock

I want to walk to the beat of my own drum
I want to walk to the beat of my own drum

Hey everybody
Can you walk the walk you gotta back it all up
But can you talk the talk
Hey everybody
Can you walk the walk?

I want to walk to the beat of my own drum
(Say what?)
I want to walk to the beat of my own drum
(Say what?)

I want to walk to the beat of my own drum
I want to live to the beat of my own drum
I want to take to the beat of my own drum
I want to hang ten, high, say pleased to meet you

Give to the beat of my own drum
I want to sing to the beat of my own drum

I want to fly, cry, win, lose, live, die, take five
Pleased to meet you

My daddy spent 10 years living on the outside looking in
He thought that he would never get back
Watched his dream walk across a silver screen
And he was standing there when the theatre went pitch black

Dear world I'm pleased to meet you

Hey everybody when I walk the walk
I gotta back it all up I vgotta talk the talk
Hey everybody when I hear the knock
Don't want to measure out my life to the tick of a clock

Hey everybody--can you walk the walk?

I want to walk to the beat of my own drum
(Say what?)
I want to walk to the beat of my own drum
(Say what?)

I want to live to the beat of my own drum
I want to laugh to the beat of my own drum
I want to play to the beat of my own drum
I want to hang ten, high, say pleased to meet you

I want to screw up to the beat of my own drum
I want to take it out of town and do it to my drum

Scream shout
Wipe out
Make love to my baby

It's a wonderful idea, but it doesn't work.

My own drum my own beat

Hey did you ever get the feeling that it's really a joke
You think you've got it figured out and then you find that you don't
So you say goodbye to the world and now you're floating in space
You got no sense of nothing not even a time or a place
Then suddenly you hear it it's the beat of your heart
And for the first time in your life you know your life is about to start

I want to walk to the beat of my own drum

There's someone knocking in the wall, was it an echo? ba da pa pa
