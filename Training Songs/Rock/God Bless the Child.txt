Them that's got, shall get
Them that's not, shall lose
So the Bible said, and it still is news
Mama may have, and papa may have

God bless' the child,
That's got his own
That's got his own
Yes the strong seem to get more

While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't
Ever make the grade
As mama may have

And papa may have
God bless' the child
That's got his own
That's got his own.

And when you got money,
You got a lots of friends
Crowdin' 'round your door
When the money's gone

And all you're spendin' ends
They won't be 'round any more
No, no, no more
And rich relations

May give you
A crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But don't take too much

Mama may have
And your papa may have
But God bless' the child
That's got his own

That's got his own
God bless' the child who can stand up and say
I've got my own
Ev'ry child's, got to have his own!
