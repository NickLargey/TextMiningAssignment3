Can you understand me now 
I'll get it through somehow 
You won't ever get me down 
Won't see me hanging around 
Can you dig it (oh, yeah) 
Can you dig it (oh, yeah) 
Can you dig it (oh, yeah) 
Can you dig it what I'm saying 
One little kiss isn't anything
You keep insisting on everything 
I won't be sad 
Ah, someone turn the lights off 

See how big and strong I've grown 
I'm standing on my own 
Can you dig it (oh, yeah) 
Can you dig it (oh, yeah) 
Can you dig it (oh, yeah) 
Can you dig it what I'm saying 
One little kiss isn't anything 
You keep insisting on everything
I won't be sad 
Ah, someone turn the lights off 

Can you dig it (oh, yeah)
Can you dig it (oh, yeah) 
Can you dig it (oh, yeah) 
Can you dig it what I'm saying 
One little kiss isn't anything 
You keep insisting on everything
I won't be sad 
Ah, someone turn the lights off 
Can you dig it 
Can you dig it 
Can you dig it
Can you dig it
