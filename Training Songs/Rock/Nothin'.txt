Every time I try so hard I get nothin' (nothin') 
They say try and you won't fail  I get nothin' (nothin') 
I did all that I could I got nothin' (nothin') 
I tried so hard  for nothin' (nothin') 
I never wanted it that way  guess there was nothin' I could say 
I don't know what I want 
But I know I don't want this 
I give up  I give in  I know I'm never gonna win 

I know it's really not your fault 
I'm gonna blame you anyway 
You say you're sorry but I know it won't do no good 
I give up, I give in, I know I'm never gonna win. 

I don't fuckin' care, I don't fuckin' care 
I don't fuckin' care anymore 
It's gonna be all right 
Cause I don't fuckin' care anymore.
