The soldiers of Islam are loading their guns
They're getting ready
But the Russian tanks are mowing them down
They're getting ready
There's children in Africa with Tommy Guns
Getting ready
While the Islam armies are beckoning on
Getting ready

There's a burning sun
And it sets in the western world
But it rises in the east
And pretty soon
It's gonna burn your temples down

While the heads of state are having their fun
Are they ready?
We're looking at the world through a barrel of a gun
Are we ready?
You stand there beating on your little war drum
Are you ready?
And it won't be long before your time has come
Are you ready?

There's a burning sun
And it sets in the western world
But it rises in the east
And pretty soon
It's gonna burn your temples down, down

There's a burning sun
And it sets in the western world
But it rises in the east
And pretty soon
It's gonna burn your temples down

Warhead, warhead, warhead
Warhead, warhead, warhead
Warhead, warhead, warhead
Warhead, warhead, warhead

Well, I don't know what it is but I feel something coming (warhead, warhead, warhead)
Stuck in the middle of the Yankees and the Russians
So pull back the hands tonight (warhead, warhead, warhead) 
'Cause bye bye planet let alone your nation
(Warhead, warhead, warhead)
