Did I hurt you all wash of waters broken
My fabulous to suck so close your eyes I'll cut you inside
And tell me did I hurt you hurt you your machine will die
And tell me what I've wasted tell me 

Gasoline is in my head
I'm turning on
Gasoline is in my head
Ohouwo-ho
Gasoline is in my head
I'm turning on
I'm turning on 

And tell if it kills you quietly the world is waiting
Bringing on its own arrival something tries to burn you inside
And tell me what I've taken taken my machine has died
Nothing's ever waiting tell me 

Gasoline is in my head
I'm turning on
Gasoline is in my head
Ohouwo-oh
And gasoline is in my head
I'm turning on
I'm turning on 

These hands have broken
Hard pressed on everyone
My words can't open you alone you alone 

Gasoline is in my head
I'm turning on
And gasoline is in my head
Ohouwo-oh
And gasoline is my head
I'm turning on
I'm turning on
