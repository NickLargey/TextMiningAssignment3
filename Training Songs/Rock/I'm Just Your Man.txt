Intro: e^ / a~ / e^ / a~ / e

E a e a
I'm not a page in history not something that bold
E a g#m be
I'm not the greatest mystery that was ever told
E a e a
I may not be who you wanna spend a whole life with alone
E a g#m f#m
I'm not that fascinating with features carved like stone

Bridge
F#m g#m a a be
But I'll tell you everything before you run away hey
G#m a be e a / e / a
I'll tell you what I am I'm just your man

I'm not a hero or even someone who does good
I'm not made of iron or steel or stone or gold or bronze or wood
I may not notice the little things sometimes I can't see
But I'm not the kind of fool I'm made out to be

Bridge
F#m g#m a a be
But I love you yes I love you you can understand hey
G#m a be e a
Then you'll know what I am, I'm just your man

be g#m7 c#m7
I'm just your ma a an just your man that's all
Be g#m7 c#m7 be a
And if I can't be that I'm no man at all

I'm not a burnin comet that fell out of the sky
E a g#m f#m
I know I'm just like the next clown when I get too high

Bridge
But I love you yes I love you and if you understand
Then you'll know what I am. I'm just your man
