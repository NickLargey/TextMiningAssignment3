Speed kills
Coming down the mountain
Speed kills
Coming down the street
Speed kills
With the presence of mind and
Speed kills
If you know what I mean

Got to feel
Woke up inside again
Got to feel
Less broke more fixed
Got to feel
When I got outside myself
Got to feel
When I touched your lips

The things we do 
To the people that we love
The way we break 
If there's something we can't take
Destroy the world 
That we took so long to make

We expect her gone
For some time
I wish her safe from harm
To find yourself
In a foreign land
Another refugee
Outsider refugee

How's it feel
Coming up roses
How's it feel 
She's coming up sweet
How's it feel
When it's all in spite of you
How's it feel
When she's out of your reach

The things we do 
To the people that we love
The way we break
If there's something in the way
Destroy the world
That we took so long to make

We expect her gone
For some time
I wish her safe from harm
To find yourself
In a foreign land
Another refugee
Outsider refugee

What happened to you? (x4)

The things we do 
To the people that we love

If there's something we can't take
Destroy the world 
That we took so long to make

The things we do
To the people that we love (x3)
The things we do
To the people that we
That we love
