Feel so low some days
And only I can taste
Resent security
Obscuring all I see

In my mind
In my mouth
In my soul

Only you provide 
These symptoms that I show
I could go out in style
Go back from where I came
But luck sees to us all
And rarely plays the game

We've seen it all 
Through many years 
Of lonesome hell
Back to a place 
Where we all terminate
