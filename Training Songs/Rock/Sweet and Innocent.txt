Lots of boys are gracious
And lots of boys are true
But they can't make me feel
The way I do when I'm with you
Sweet and innocent is your love to me
The way you hold me, not too tight
The tender way you kiss goodnight
Makes you the one exactly right for me

Even more, you and beautiful
Like the love I get from you
They say that you don't know the score
For this I love you
Sweet and innocent, young and beautiful
