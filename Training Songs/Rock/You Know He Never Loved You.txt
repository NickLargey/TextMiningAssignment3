All this time I've been trying hard to hear you
To understand you, and to console you
I know your life, it's never been that simple
But now's the time to close the circle
To start over again is something scary
I know those bruises in your heart are there forever
But now the time to start again stronger then ever
And show the world in your own way that your never going to go through this again

You know he never loved you
You know he never wanted you
He stabbed you in the back
And he broke your heart in half
But that will make you stronger
No suffering no longer
You'll learn from your mistakes
And there ain't no coming back
Now go enjoy your life and
Your going to laugh so hard
You are never going to cry once again for a guy
You know he never loved you
You know he never wanted you
But at least you learned somehow

But if now you can not stop thinking of his love
And his kisses and his caresses
If in the night, cant sleep because you miss him
Just remember the pain you've been through

To start over again is something scary
I know those bruises in your heart are there forever
But now's the time to start again stronger then ever
And show the world in your way that you will never going to go through this again

You know he never loved you
You know he never wanted you
He stabbed you in the back
And he broke your heart in half
But that will make you stronger
No suffering no longer
You'll learn from your mistakes
And there ain't no coming back
Now go enjoy your life and
Your going to laugh so hard
You are never going to cry once again for a guy
You know he never loved you
You know he never wanted you
But at least you learned somehow

Now's the time to start again stronger then ever
And show the world in your own way that you will never going
To go through this again
