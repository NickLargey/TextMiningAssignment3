Rachael thelmy is not very sure
A little girl inside her uniform
But aren't you really just a penny whore? 
Rachael tell me what I'm waiting for

Right now! right now! right now!
Right now! right now! right now!

Rachael tell me what I'm waiting for 
About the school yards and the uniforms
Rachael tell me why your sky is red
And how you picked up all these crazy men

Right now! right now! right now!
Right now! right now! right now!

Rachael, Rachael

Rachael tell me what I'm waiting for
Rachael tell me what I'm waiting for

It's just a playground
It's just a let down
It's just a playground
It's just a let down
