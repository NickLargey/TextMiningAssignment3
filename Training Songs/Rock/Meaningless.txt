Oil tankers in the National Guard
I came to meet you, my car died in your yard
Why turn the key?
There's so much here to see
These are my memories

Of precious places, precious things
That were meaningless before
We'd seen them together

Old hinges squeaking in the rain
That hotel by the highway where we stayed
There's something every hour
Who needs the Eiffel Tower
When we've got memories

Of precious places, precious things
That were meaningless before
We'd seen them together

The pen, the car
The paint, the pier
The moon and star
The message clear
Liberty raised her hand to us
As if to say, ''It's OK, live today, live today''

I said, ''Don't leave me, don't break the tie''
Then I left you and the time went rolling by
And here's what I can't stand
I know that every landmark 
Triggers memories
Of stupid places and silly things
That were meaningless before
We'd seen them together (repeat 3x)
