I'm not courageous, I'm everything that they say
Fame is outrageous, I'm really wasting away
I'm your man, I'm your genie, I'm your junkie
I'm your man, I'm your maybe, I'm your must be

Life's a little to intense
I'm a little too in pieces

If I could I would act like I should act
Little misunderstood

Rumors are dangerous, don't believe what they say
I'm not contagious, in time it will fade
I'm your man, I'm your monkey, I'm your magic
I'm your man, I'm your memory, I'm your static

Life's a little too intense
I am less than perfect
The world is too immense
I'm a little too in pieces

If I could I would act like I should act
Little misunderstood, little misunderstood

These four walls scream like sirens
Damn this neighborhood, I'm so good

Life's a little too intense
I'm a little too in pieces

If I could I would act like I should act
Little misunderstood, little misunderstood
