From the Single:
* Yes! We're on fire

Here we are, ready to run fast
And far better than anyone before
We chase the sun in the morning
We jump for gold
There are no losers in this game
Only winners participate
And you know I'm not a liar when I say
Yes we're on fire, Yes we're on fire
Yes we're on fire, Yes we're on fire
Silver, bronze and maybe gold
The blazing heat, the chilling cold
In this arena we all strive
To beat the records head up high
To break the records head up high
Yes we're on fire, Yes we're on fire
Yes we're on fire, Yes we're on fire
From javelin to boxing ring
From weightlifting to skating rink
Young and proud and passionate
Planet earth top athletes
The competition always fierce
With beating hearts and eyes so clear
To beat the records head up high
To break the records head up high
The sweat the tears, the blood we bleed
We are the living legends carving history
The flag that fills our hearts with pride
The joy that makes our spirit fly
And you know I'm not a liar when I sayâ?¦..
Yes we're on fire, Yes we're on fire
Yes we're on fire. Yes we're on fire
On fire, on fire, we're on fire
