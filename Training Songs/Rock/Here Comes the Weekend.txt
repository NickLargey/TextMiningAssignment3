Monday ain't a fun day, Tuesday's a blue day
Wednesday's a frenzy, Thursday's the worst day
Friday is great 'cause I can
Hardly wait until the weekend

I should be clockin' in at eight but I'm a little late
Can't blame my baby, 'cause I took her on a date
Two till ten and then it's Friday again
Here comes the weekend

Here comes the weekend
Here comes the weekend
My working week's so tough
I think I've had enough
Until the weekend

I've had an overdose of doctor's notes
But it just don't ease the pain
Goin' on the sick don't do the trick
Sooner or later I'll be clockin' in again

Working like a dog more than ten-hour day
Never see enough from my take-home pay
They pay me for the shift like I was given a gift
Here comes the weekend

I've had an overdose of doctor's notes
But it just don't ease the pain
Goin' on the sick don't do the trick
Sooner or later I'll be clockin' in again

Someday I'll be able to forget my working days
Life will be a grin because my ship is comin' in
Everything will go my way and I won't have to say
Here comes the weekend

Here comes the weekend
Here comes the weekend
My working week's so tough
I think I've had enough
Until the weekend

Here comes the weekend
Here comes the weekend
Here comes the weekend
Here comes the weekend
