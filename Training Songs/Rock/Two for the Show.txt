Two for the show
And my mother wants to go
It'll break her heart when I tell her
She's too old

I'm in my place
I got makeup all over my face
I think I know my lines
But I dunno

One for the money
Two for the show
Three for the lady on the radio
Four might be the one
You'll never know, you'll never know
If only there was a better way to go {way to go}
Two for the show

Waiting in the wings
While the queen of virtue sings
It'll break her heart when I tell her
She's out of key

If they gave her half a chance
She could soon learn how to dance
So she could earn her living
Gracefully

One for the money
Two for the show
Three for the lady on the radio
Four might be the one
You'll never know, you'll never know
If only there was a better way to go {way to go}
Two for the show
