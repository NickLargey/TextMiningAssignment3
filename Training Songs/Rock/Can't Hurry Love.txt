I need love, love to ease my mind
I need to find, find someone to call mine

Well, my mama said, "You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"

Rock

You know love, love don't come easy
Yet, I keep on waiting, anticipating
For that soft voice to talk to me at night
For those tender arms, wrapped around me tight

And my mama said, "You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"

How long can I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness will
Cause my heart, heart to break

Now I can't stand, to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a lover, to call my own
Well I feel that I, oh, I can't go on
But those precious words, keep me hangin' on

Well, my mama said, "You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"

"You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"

Rock

You know love, love don't come easy
Yet, I keep on waiting, anticipating
For that soft voice to talk to me at night
For those tender arms, wrapped around me tight

Well, my mama said, "You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"

How long can I wait?
How much more can I take?
Before loneliness will
Cause my heart, heart to break

Well, how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Well, now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
Those precious words keep me hanging on

Well, my mama said, "You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"

"You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"
