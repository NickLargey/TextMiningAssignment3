I've got a clearspot, a devilish psalm 
But nobody's home to fix the alarm, no 
Disgruntled woman, enchanted stains 
We're tempted by god but nothing remains 

Hey boys we speak better than young men 
But will be better than than an old man, 
Honey, you'll see 

Hey boys we speak better than young men 
But will be better than than an old man, 
Honey, you'll see 

My faith is hungry like a whale's frozen toes, 
Steal cap fingers and nobody knows 
It's raining concrete a tunnel wind blows 
Stones on my column the path that I chose 

Na na na na... 

(You ain't better than the rest)
