Yes, I'm a witch, I'm a bitch
I don't care what you say
My voice is real, my voice is truth
I don't fit in your ways

I'm not gonna die for you
You might as well face the truth
I'm gonna stick around
For quite awhile

Yes, I'm a witch, I'm a bitch

Each time we don't say what we wanna say, we're dying
Each time we don't say how do we feel, we're dying
Each time we gotta do what we wanna do, we're living
Each time we're open our minds to what we see, we're living

Yes, I'm a witch, I'm a bitch
I don't care what you say
My voice is real, my voice is truth
I don't fit in your ways

I'm not gonna die for you
You might as well face the truth
I'm gonna stick around
For quite awhile

Free you from the ghettos of your minds
Free you from your fears and binds
We know you want things to stay as it is
It?s gonna change, baby

It?s gonna change, baby doll
It?s gonna change, honey ball
It?s gonna change, sugarcane
It?s gonna change, sweetie legs

So don't try to make cock-pecked people out of us
Don't try to make cock-pecked people out of us
Don't try to make cock-pecked people out of us
Don't try to make cock-pecked people out of us

Yes, I'm a witch, I'm a bitch
I don't care what you say
My voice is real, my voice is truth
I don't fit in your ways

I'm not gonna die for you
You might as well face the truth
I'm gonna stick around
For quite awhile

I'm not gonna die for you
You might as well face the truth
I'm gonna stick around
For quite awhile

I'm a witch, I'm a bitch
I'm a witch
I'm a witch, I'm a bitch
I'm a witch

I'm a witch, I'm a bitch
I'm a witch
I'm a witch, I'm a bitch
I'm a witch
