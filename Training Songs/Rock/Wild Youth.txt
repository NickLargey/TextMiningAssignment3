I'm walking in the street
With the latest on my feet
And the hair that makes the people stop and stare

I got no money, well, that's okay
Because I live from day to day
Well, I'm free to come and go just as I please

Wild, wild, wild, youth
Wild, wild, wild, youth
Wild, wild, wild, youth

My records are so loud
I gotta hang out with the crowd
Because the usual crew are sus on what to do

Mom and Dad says, I can't win
Because it gets you in the end
But the fragile is the gun that shoots the man

Wild, wild, wild, youth
Wild, wild, wild, youth
Wild, wild, wild, youth
Wild

Wild youth
Wild youth
Wild youth

Wild, wild, wild, youth
Wild, wild, wild, youth
Wild, wild, wild, youth
