Hang around and I'm paranoid
I can't help it now
But I don't know what the people know
I want something to count
Just stay where you are

We're right behind you
Stay where you are
When someone's lookin'
Stay where you are
I might not be the one that's true
But I'm trying, don't you know

Rattle coins in a coffee can
You shuffle on and on
Turn around, turn around
They're burning hotels down
Son, stay where you are

We're right behind you
Stay where you are
I'm always looking
Stay where you are 
I might not be the one that's true
But I'm trying, don't you know

Don't you know
Don't hang on, don't let go
Don't aim high, don't aim low
