The end of the movie reel- flap, flap flap
The wings of the pterandodon- flap, flap, flap
A big fat, pregnant, radish smiling
At the funniest pallbearer in the funeral.

The eye, a spoof of god.
The day, a crippled wolf.
Were you born to be a sprinkler system in a thunderstorm?

We can agree that we all like to look our best.
Or at the very least be the best at looking the worst.
It's no wonder that eventually we will all be on TV. 

The eye, a spoof of god.
The day, a crippled wolf.
