It's down to words I use
It's up to what I say
If you'll stay

Run my fingers down the page
Lost for words
What to say

I should be saying something
But what shall I say
Should be feeling something
What will I feel if you say
It's over
Please don't
Don't say
It's over
I want to you
Stay

The emotion's in my heart
Can't even write it down
Where do I start

Find the trigger for your smile
I'm desperate to get it back

I'm desperate
I'm desperate

Got to get back that feeling
Got to get back that spark
Got to get back that feeling
Got to get back that spark

Stay
Stay
Oh won't you stay

I should be saying something
But what shall I say
Should be feeling something
What will I feel if you say
It's over
Please don't say
Don't say it's over
I want you to
Stay

Got to get back that feeling
Got to get back that spark
Got to get back that feeling
Got to get back that spark
