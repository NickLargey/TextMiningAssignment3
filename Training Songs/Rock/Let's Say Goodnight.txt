If I say yes, I'm sure you'll say no
If I say stop I know you'll say go
What seems to be the problem here is you and me
'Cause we just can't agree
So let's just say goodnight and go home

You're always right, and I have never been wrong
The way we are it's getting harder to hang on
But who's to blame, when two things are
Never the same, it's not people that change
It's maybe living from day to day

What can I say, the Lord just made us this way
What can I do you know what I've been through
It's just this world, it makes it hard for a guy and girl
But we could give it a whirl
So let's just say goodnight and go home
