He's running on a tuff gnarl in his head
He's got a fatal erection home in bed
He's really smart and he's really fast
He's got a hard tit killer f*ck in his past
Saints preserve us in hot young stuff
The saving grace is a sonic pig pile
Amazing grazing strange and raging
Flies are flaring through your brains
Spastic flailing literally raising my roof
An adrenal mental man-tool box explodes in music creates utopia
You gnarl out on my nerves you weird and crush the cranking raunch
Flesh dirt force field lost and found let's burn your broken heart
Set our sight on sights not yet set let's scorch your wavo wig
Let's poke your eyes out
