You know what?
I'm in a good mood today
Well I'm so happy
It's not yesterday
Man it was brutal
With glad use of tissues
I guess you could say
That I had issues

But it's looking good
I've dug my way out
I'm changing up
What the story's about

When the world stops making sense
Just taking what you can get
When the people on the street
Start looking like silhouettes
When the words just sound like noise
I need a new alphabet
When the world stops making sense
I make a new alphabet

Small thinking people
With their small thinking ways
I don't have time
To hear what they say
This is my world
I'm staking my claim
Thanks for the invite
No thanks just the same

It's looking good now
Full speed ahead
I'll live today
Like tomorrow I'm dead

When the world stops making sense
Just taking what you can get
When the people on the street
Start looking like silhouettes
When the words just sound like noise
I need a new alphabet
When the world stops making sense
I make a new alphabet

I see, everything
Is crystal clear
It's here

You know what?
I'm in a good mood today
Well I'm so happy
It's not yesterday
Man it was brutal
But it's all in the past
It's good to know it don't have to last

When the world stops making sense
Just taking what you can get
When the people on the street
Start looking like silhouettes
When the words just sound like noise
I need a new alphabet
When the world stops making sense
I make a new alphabet
