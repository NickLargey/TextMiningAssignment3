From the East coast to the West
We ain't the worst, we ain't the best
Drink all night, I'm such a mess
There's something missing in my chest! 
Show me the hill, show me the view
I swear I'm coming back for you! 
I lost my mind, I lost my shoe
I found myself when I found?
Be my savior, be my woman

Come from L.A. back to Brooklyn
Take my body till the morning
Now I'm leaving without warning
She said let's stay up all night long
Everything's right, and nothing's wrong
That girl don't wanna see the dark
She came so quick, and now she's gone! 
What's coming next, I just don't know
I'll be your fort, I'm coming home

Now I'm alone, I can't relax
I won't forget about the?
Be my savior, be my woman
Come from L.A. back to Brooklyn
Take my body till the morning
Now I'm leaving without warning
What's your name, and what's your story?
Hell is heaven, I'm still horny

She's so fine and I'm so boring
I still want you in the morning
The morning
In the morning
I'm leaving, I'm leaving
Without warning
Be my savior
Be my woman
Come from L.A. back to Brooklyn
