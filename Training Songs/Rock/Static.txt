I sunk my eyes in static
You taught me how to see it
Now there's no sign of you at hand
So I stop looking at it

My head is splitting trying
To read the name that you abandoned
Congratulations sister
You put yourself right over

Though you don't think I understand
This sudden awkward rupture
This stuck-unhealing fissure
No love could possibly withstand

And I'd never say
It doesn't mean that much to me
Glad anyway
To see you struggle free

Pinned down but unexamined
Though you kept right on looking
At static there behind my eyes
Keep pushing one-way vision

I guess at least it's something
Since everything is so compromised
