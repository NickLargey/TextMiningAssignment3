Hold me love, I can't sleep again
Will I have to kiss your nose?
I want to lay here next to him, love
I remember walking in the rain
Rain was falling on my hands
I don't want to live 
Through that again, no

Outside the heart it gets dark now
And I was walking in the park now
Children singing songs that
Will now make all our 
Dreams come true
I'm in love with you
I know it takes is love

Love is a healing thing
When you give everything
You're loving the world
The world gives you love to hold onto
Remembering, we seldom remember love

Somewhere, just give me many chances
Far away, I'll see you through it all
Remember, just give me time 
To learn to crawl

In September, when the rain comes 
And the wind blows
I will see you walking 
In that coat, oh
And if you let me, I will keep 
You here inside the stars
I will love the sound of my sheets
Oh, you have moved beneath them

Somewhere, just give me many chances
Far away, I'll see you through it all
Remember, just give me time 
To learn to crawl
