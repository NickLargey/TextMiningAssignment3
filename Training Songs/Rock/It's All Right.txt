It's all right when you say that you're my girl 
It's all right when you're holdin' my hand 
It's all right when you say you love only me 
It's all right knowin' you understand 

It's all right when you whisper sweet words to me 
It's all right when I'm kissin' you 
It's all right just to know that you're mine 
It's all right to say that I'm in love with you 

Bridge: 
Little things don't matter anymore 
'Cause you know I love you, that's for sure 

It's all right just to know that my love is true 
It's all right when I'm telling you 
It's all right just to feel the way that I do 
It's all right to know that it's all right with you
