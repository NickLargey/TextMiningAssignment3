Let it never be said that romance is dead 
'Cause there's so little else occupying my head 
There is nothing I need, 'cept the function to breathe 
But I'm not really fussed doesn't matter to me 

Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby 
Do ya do ya do ya do ya 
Know what your doing, doing to me 
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby 

Due to lack of interest 
Tomorrow is canceled 
Let the clocks be reset and the pendulums held 
'Cause there's nothing at all 'cept the space in between 
Finding out what you're called and repeating your name 

Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby 
Do ya do ya do ya do ya 
Know what your doing, doing to me 
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby 

Could it be could it be that you're joking with me 
And you don't really see you with me 
Could it be could it be that you're joking with me 
And you don't really see you with me 

Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby 
Do ya do ya do ya do ya 
Know what your doing, doing to me 
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby 
Do ya do ya do ya do ya 
What your doing, doing to me
