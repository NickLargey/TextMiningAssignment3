Temperamental editors
Searching for the passion
Overpaid and over-rated
Looking for a cash in

Yeah, it's too late
If you want to read a little
Useless information
If you've had enough
With all the troubles with our nation
Yeah, well don't wait
And you read about 'em

You just can't sleep without
The pages of the magazine
Don't believe in all you read
You can't trust the tabloid magazine
And I'm about to break down

It's just a tabloid magazine
And I don't want to break down
I don't want to break down
Picture hungry journalists
Looking for some action
Running all the stories
Like it's going out of fashion
Yeah, it's too late

Everybody's reading
Everybody else's problems
Everybody's busy stopping
What they haven't started

Yeah, well don't wait
You can read about 'em
And you won't sleep without 
The pages of the magazine
But don't belive in all you read
You can't trust a tabloid magazine
And I'm about to break down
It's just a tabloid magazine
And I don't want to break down

I don't want to break down
I don't want to break down
I don't want to break down

Don't want to be around 'em
Better off without them
You know you can't escape them
Don't want to be around 'em
Better off without them
You know you can't escape them
Don't want to be around 'em
Better off without them
You know you can't escape them

And you read about them all the time
From the pages of the magazine
But you can't believe in all you read
Go!
