I can't change
It don't matter what I do
Tried to change
It don't matter what I do
I might walk away
But I come runnin' back to you

I won't lie
I don't know the shape I'm in
I won't lie
I don't know the shape I'm in
I make up my mind
Then I change it again

With the shape I'm in
A dose of love would do me good
It's such a state I'm in 
I wouldn't change it if I could

I can't hide
It don't matter what I say
I can't hide
It don't matter what I say
With the shape I'm in
There's no hidin' anyway
