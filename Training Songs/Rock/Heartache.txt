She got love more than I need
She got love, she's making me weak, I got heartache
I got love smeared all over my face
I got heartache

She got love, she's making me weak
You see the teardrops rolling down my cheek, I got heartache
I got love smeared all over my face
I got heartache, oh

He's got heartache, oh no
He's got heartache
He's got heartache

She got love she's making me burn
Like a fool you know I'll never learn, she had heartbreak
She said, "Love you are my biggest mistake"
She had heartbreak
Oh well she had a heartbreak

We had love, but I made her cry
She caught me lying in an alibi, she had heartbreak
She said, "Love, you are my biggest mistake"
She had heartbreak, oh

She had heartbreak, oh no
She had heartbreak
She had heartbreak

I said, "Love, please make me strong"
I hope this drugs don't last too long, I got heartache
I got love smeared all over the place
I got heartache, all over my face, yeah

I said, "Love don't let me down"
I'll make it up to you the next time around, I got heartache
I got love smeared all over the place
I got heartache, oh

He's got heartache, oh no
He's got heartache, heartbreak
He's got heartache, got heartache
He's got heartache
He's got heartache
