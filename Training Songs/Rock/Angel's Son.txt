Life is changing
I can't go on without you
Rearranging, yeah
I will be strong
I'll stand by you

You were fighting everyday
So hard to hide the pain
I know you never said goodbye
I had so much left to say

One last song
Given to an Angel's Son
As soon as you were gone
As soon as you were gone

I have a new life now
She lives through you
What can I do?
Feel so alone now
I pray for you
We still love you

You were fighting everyday
So hard to hide the pain
I know you never said goodbye
I had so much left to say

One last song
Given to an Angel's Son
As soon as you were gone
As soon as you were gone

One last song (I can't believe you're gone )
Given to an Angel's Son (I can't believe)
As soon as you were gone (As soon as you were gone)
As soon as you were gone
