When the world takes a bite
Left totally in the blur of the last night
Then and now don't make much sense
Twisted souls are the only evidence

I wonder why I do the things I do
One plus one has always meant
More than two
Happy, and then content
Change the channel and now I'm bent

On leaving you
On leaving you
On leaving you
On leaving you

There are three sides to every coin
Mine and yours and the one next door
Give a little ask for too much now
Even though I couldn't ask for more
So as this clears away
I can remember the place but not the face
Oh things so close and when I'm so close to nothing
But that's how things go

When three is two
When three is two
When three is two, two, yeah
When three is two, two, yeah ...

Hate you
Never would
Never ever could
I find, I find
That I never would
I see, I see
Right through your lies
Through your lies

Turn around
And I find that I never would
I stare, I stare
And I never could
I see, I see
Right through your lies
Through your lies
