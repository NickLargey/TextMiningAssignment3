There comes a time in your life
You have to stand up and fight
Get behind what you believe
Get a grip on what you see
There's a chance you just might get it right

Put all your hope in some dreams
Throw it to the wind let it all begin
I see you've made it this far
Rolled the dice and played the game
for the fortune and the fame

It doesn't matter at all
Who you are or where you're goin' to
You can figure it out 
It doesn't matter at all
Who you are or what you're goin' through
You can make it through somehow

Sometimes you're lost in the crowd
You can't see nothin' but clouds
Hold on and stand your ground
It's all yours this time around
Reach in and find what can be found

Put all your hope in some dreams
Throw it to the wind let it all begin
I see you've made it this far
Rolled the dice and played the game
for the fortune and the fame

It doesn't matter at all
Who you are or where you're goin' to
You can figure it out 
It doesn't matter at all
Who you are or what you're goin' through
You can make it through somehow
