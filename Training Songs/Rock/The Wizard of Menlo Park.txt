"Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow, and everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go."
Old Thomas Edison mixing up the medicine
Messing up time from Accrington to Amazon
See them all come with their wires and booms and their itchy little thumbs saying "Play your funky drum!"
Each jump in the dark we claim as our own
We know it's a lie; we never acted alone
Each jump in the dark, each jump in the dark
The machine became the star, beats to the bar, poor Gus Dudgeon lying in his car
Down in the basement messing with the moment
Alchemy and elements smashing up your instruments
Old Thomas Edison mixing up the medicine
Messing up time from Accrington to Amazon
See them all come with their wires and booms and their itchy little thumbs saying "Play your funky drum!"
A foot in the past, a head in a book, a soup of opinion, a ladle of luck
Each jump in the dark, each jump in the dark
Old Thomas Edison mixing up the medicine
Messing up time from Accrington to Amazon
See them all come with their wires and booms and their itchy little thumbs saying "Play your funky drum!"
From starlight to flashlight, sorting out the copyright
It takes a little time but the contract's airtight
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
The money's in the black but the needle's in the red
"One, two, one, two, check, Wednesday, Wednesday, Mississippi, yeah..."

Messing up time from Accrington to Amazon
