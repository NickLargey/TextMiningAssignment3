Sowing marbles into marshmallows
Sewing sequins onto rags
Cutting out my finest moments
Cutting anything that drags
Putting on my coat and tails
Putting on my party hat
Follow anything that moves baby moves
Just you try and follow that
And I learned to trust my body
And I learned to change my mind
Until this man of straw had nothing left to hide

[CHORUS]
I'm making a show of myself
Accidents that never happened
Loves that never could have been
Falling from a rock onto a soft place
Fall somewhere in between
And how could I be a hero
On my knees and four hours sleep?
You put a cat among the vultures
You set a child to catch a thief
And the call of the canvas
Becomes a curtain call
I lost my touch the day I learned to take a fall

[CHORUS]

I dance blind around the house
I wish you were still here
For me to stumble over
For me to be in fear of 
To show me
And everything I am
And everything I do
Is trying to paint a miracle
Bold lyrical and new
Just to show you
And I'm tired of playing trick or treat
And I'm tired of love that goes for a song
And I'm tired of letting circus animals loose
But I'm not tired enough to stop

[CHORUS]
