I got up feeling so down
I got off being sold out
I've kept the movie rolling
But the story's getting old now, oh yeah
I just looked in the mirror
And things aren't looking so good
I'm looking California and feeling Minnesota, oh yeah

So now you know, who gets mystified
So now you know, who gets mystified

Show me the power child
I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah, it gives me butterflies, gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again
Yeah I'm feeling
Oh, I'm feeling outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined

Oh yeah
Yeah
Someone let the dogs out
They'll show where the truth is
The grass is always greener
Where the dogs are shitting, oh yeah
I'm feeling that I'm sober
Even though I'm drinking 
I can't get any lower
Still I feel I'm sinking

So now you know, who gets mystified
So now you know, who gets mystified

Show me the power child
I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah, it gives me butterflies gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again
Oh I'm feeling 
Oh, I'm feeling outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined

Oh yeah, hmm

Outshined, oh oh 

Oh, so now you know, who gets mystified
Show me the power child
I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah, it gives me butterflies gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again
Oh I'm feeling 
Oh, I'm feeling 

Show me the power child
I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah, it gives me butterflies gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again
Oh, I'm feeling
Oh, I'm feeling
Outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined
