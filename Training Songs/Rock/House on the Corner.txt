There's a house on the corner, lives a man who went to war
And it tries to give him shelter from the pain of what he saw
There's a child out the window painting faces in the snow
And they smile a sad reminder of a life he used to know

There's a house on the corner, lives a man with empty eyes
For his heart has been broken for he was sold a pack of lies

Hold me closer (you know I can't)
Hold me closer (but you don't understand)
Hold me closer, open your heart
Hold me closer (I'm so alone)
Hold me closer (Oh you'll never know)
Hold me closer, open your heart

For he fought for his country, now he fights to clear his name
For the dead are always heroes and the living live in shame

And he said
Hold me closer (you know I can't)
Hold me closer (but you don't understand)
Hold me closer, open your heart
Hold me closer (I'm so alone)
Hold me closer (Oh you'll never know)
Hold me closer, open your heart
