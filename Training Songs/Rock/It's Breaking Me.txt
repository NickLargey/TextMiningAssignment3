So many long days
In so many ways
I try to get through
To what lies deep inside of you

Oh baby, ah, I said, you're breaking me up, oh mama
Yeah, you're breaking me down
You're lying in little pieces
Scattered all around

You're doing your worst
To see me get hurt
You're waiting to see
The tears running out of me

But, oh baby, yeah, I said you're breaking me up, woman
Yeah, you're breaking me down
You're lying in little pieces
Scattered all around

My tears have run dry
And you wonder why
I've found a new woman
Who don't do the things you can

Oh baby, I said you're breaking me up, woman
Ah ha, you're breaking me down
You're lying in little pieces
Scattered all around now
