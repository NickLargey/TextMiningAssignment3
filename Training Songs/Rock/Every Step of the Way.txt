I used to see you on the avenue
You were the girl that let me follow you
You used to hang out in the alleyway
You sewed a button on my shirt one day
I asked around until I found your name
Then underneath the arches in the pouring rain
I said - You (yeah, you) I want you
Every step of the way

I know that things are gettin' better
I know it's gonna be OK
So baby don't go - I ain't gonna let ya
I wanna be with you every step of the way
Every step of the way

Do ya wanna, do ya wanna, do ya wanna dance?
Take a chance, baby, take a chance
I'll be with you every of the way
I'll even show you how to strut one day
Ain't got a girl and it's a crying shame
'Cos I can't figure out who's to blame
I want you (yeah, you) I want you
Every step of the way

I know that things are gettin' better
I know things will be OK
So baby don't go - I ain't gonna let ya
I wanna be with you every step of the way
Yeah, every step of the way

I know that things are gettin' better
I know things will be OK
So baby don't go - I ain't gonna let ya
I wanna be with you every step of the way
Every step of the way
