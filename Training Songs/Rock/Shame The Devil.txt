There's a time, for living
And a time for love
There's a time, for forgiving, why'all
And a time to shove

Ohh there's more, won then lost
More hoping here to spare
And its waiting, waiting
Don't ya spend your whole life hesitating

Come and tell the truth
Shame the devil
There's more, light then dark
Honey shining down on you

More despair, then what you got
And baby you'll need the truth
This whole world, has had enough
Of people giving up

And its waiting, waiting
Don't you spend your whole life hesitating
Come on tell the truth
Shame the devil

And its waiting, waiting
Don't spend your whole life hesitating
Come on tell the truth
Shame the devil

Don't you know that its waiting, ah waiting
Don't you spend your whole life hesitating
Come on, let loose
Shame the devil
