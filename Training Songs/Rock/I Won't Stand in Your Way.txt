I, I got a low down dirty feeling 
That I've been cheated on, and lied to 
If it's so then it's wrong, we've hung on for so long 
Why don't we have that magic anymore 

I got a strange sneaking suspicion 
That it's been going on for some time now 
Something shines in your eyes, something stirs deep inside 
I won't stand in your way anymore 

You said that I'm just a little guy 
Who's easily led astray 
Well aren't you the same little girl 
Who alway gets her way

I, I got a low down dirty feeling
That I've been cheated on and lied to
(Yeah) If it's so then it's wrong
We've hung on for so long

I won't stand in your way
I won't stand in your way
I won't stand in your way
I won't stand in your way
Anymore
