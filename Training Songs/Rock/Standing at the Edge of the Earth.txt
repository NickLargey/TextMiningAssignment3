I knew that this moment would come in time 
That I'd have to let go and watch you fly 
I know you're coming back so why am I dying inside 
Are you searching for words that you can't find 
Trying to hide your emotions but eyes don't lie 
Guess there's no easy way to say goodbye 
So I'll be standing at the edge of the earth 
Hoping that someday you'll come back again 
I'll be standing at the edge of the earth hoping for someday 
Don't misunderstand what I'm trying to say 
I don't want to let you leave this way 
I want you to know that I stand right by your side 
And I know this may be 
The very last time that we see each other cry 
But whatever happens know that I'll.... 
I'll be standing at the edge of the earth 
Hoping that one day you'll come back again 
I'll be standing at the edge of the earth hoping that someday 
You'll come back to me 
I'll be praying for whatever it's worth 
Believing that one day you'll come back to me 
I'll be standing at the edge of the earth 
Hoping for someday 
And I know this may be 
The very last time that we see each other cry 
But whatever happens know that I'll.... 
I'll be standing at the edge of the earth 
Hoping that one day you'll come back again 
I'll be standing at the edge of the earth hoping that someday 
You'll come back to me 
I'll be praying for whatever it's worth 
Believing that one day you'll come back to me 
I'll be standing at the edge of the earth 
Hoping for someday 
Waiting for someday Believing in someday 
Praying for someday, I'll be.... 
Longing for someday Clinging to someday 
Cherishing someday, I'll be.... 
Thinking of someday Dreaming of someday 
Wishing for someday, I'll be.... 
Living for someday Counting on someday 
Knowing that one day.... 
I will see you
