I'd rather leave while I'm in love
While I still believe the meaning of the word
I'll keep my dreams and just pretend
That you and I are never gonna end
Too many times I've seen
The rose die on the vine
Somebody's heart gets broken
Usually it's mine
I don't want to take the chance
Of being hurt again
And you and I can't say good-bye
So if you wake and find me gone
Oh baby carry you see I need my
Fantasy I still believe it's best
To leave while I'm in love
Too many times I've seen
The rose die on the vine
Somebody's heart gets broken usually
It's mine I don't want to take
The chance of being hurt again
And you and I can't say good-bye
So if you wake and find me gone
Oh baby carry on you see I need my
Fantasy I still believe it's best to
Leave while I'm in love I still believe
It's best to leave while I'm in love
