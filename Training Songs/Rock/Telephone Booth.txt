I can't hide it,
So good to be here.
Lost in transit,
Out on a free year.
There's no truth,
Eying me sideways.

Just a telephone booth,
On a highway.

I ain't hiding,
There's been no breakdown.
Where I'm aiming,
I see the sundown.
One horizon,
Eying me sideways.

Just a telephone booth,
On a highway.

Everything for miles,
Is high on the silence.
Everything's my way.

Where I'm calling,
There's no religion.
No-one falling,
My absolution.
Is all truth,
Eying me sideways.

In a telephone booth,
On a highway.

I stand ready,
For any new direction.
That the sun may lead me down.
Everything for miles,
Is high on the silence.
Everything's my way.

In a telephone booth,
On a highway.
