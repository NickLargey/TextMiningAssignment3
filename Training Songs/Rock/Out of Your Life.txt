If you want me out of your life
Now all you gotta do is tell me
I ain't got a life of my own
And the one I got with you could kill me
You've been taking some time, does it weigh on your mind? 
If you think you've got an answer tell me, I don't know
But if you want me out of your life
Now all you gotta do is tell me

If you want me out of the way
Now all you gotta say is something
And do you think you'll tell me today? 
Well it seems I'm waiting here for nothing
You still call me your friend, yeah I think you're pretending
If you keep on ignoring me then I will go
But if you want me out of your life
Now all you gotta do is tell me

When all this confusion goes, what else could there be
But this feeling I knew that turned out to be true
When I saw you walking out you turned your back on me

If you want me out of your life
Now all you gotta do is tell me
I ain't got a life all alone
And the one I had with you near killed me
Now it's time to catch up on the ones I forgot
It took losing you to find the things that I still got
But if you want me out of your life
Now all you gotta do is tell me

Tell me
Tell me now, and I will get out of your life
