I wear rat's shoes
I pay rat's dues
I make rat's moves
I sing rat's blues

I see the world through 
Rat's eyes 
Burning
Rat's eyes 
Sullen
Rat's eyes 
Dirty
Rat's eyes 

If you look through rat's eyes
You can talk about shit real good
You will be always looking at shit
You are vermin

I see the world through 
Rat's eyes 
Burning
Rat's eyes 
Sullen
Rat's eyes 
Dirty
Rat's eyes 

I see the world through 
Rat's eyes 
Burning
Rat's eyes 
Sullen
Rat's eyes 
Dirty
Rat's eyes 

I want you to touch my filth
I want you to feel my filth
I want you to look into my eyes
I want you to look through my eyes

I see the world through 
Rat's eyes 
Burning
Rat's eyes 
Sullen
Rat's eyes 
Dirty
Rat's eyes
