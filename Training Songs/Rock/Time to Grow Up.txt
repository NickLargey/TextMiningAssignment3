The people I know have heard so many things
But things just ain't the same no more
Can't decide if I should do the same

So when you left we all asked why
I tried to see the lighter side
Of what we're doing with our lives today

It's not the time to grow up anyway
Time to grow up

I never thought that you would be the first
The words could never be reversed
Got your job and now you're on your way

So I'm wasting all my time
Just being here from day to day
Got no need to leave until I'm done
