Everybody's gonna pray
On the very last day
When they hear that bell
Ring the world away
Everybody's gonna pray to the heavens on the Judgment Day

Well you can sing about the great King David
And you can preach about the wisdom of Saul
But the Judgment falls on all mankind
When the trumpet sounds the call

All equal and the same
When the Lord, He calls your name
Get ready brothers for that day

Everybody's gonna pray
On the very last day
When they hear that bell
Ring the world away
Everybody's gonna pray to the heavens on the Judgment Day

Well one day soon all men will stand
His words will be heeded in all the land
Men shall know and men shall see
We all are brothers and we all are free

Mankind was made of clay
Each of us in the very same way
Get ready brothers for that day

Everybody's gonna pray
On the very last day
When they hear that bell
Ring the world away
Everybody's gonna pray to the heavens on the Judgment Day

Well the law is given and the law is known
The tale is told and the seed is sown
From dust we came and dust we'll go
You know the Lord once told us so

Each brother take His hand
Heed the meaning of the Lord's command
Get ready brother for that day

Everybody's gonna pray
On the very last day
When they hear that bell
Ring the world away
Everybody's gonna pray to the heavens on the Judgment Day

Judgment Day

Judgment Day

Judgment Day
