Mama, she done told me
She didn't like this rock and roll
But mama, mama, please
Mama, you just don't know
I don't want to hang up my rock and roll shoes
I don't want to hang up my rock and roll shoes
I get an old time feeling
Every time I hear the blues

They told me, "Get a job
And set yourself a goal"
But can't they understand
I just want to rock and roll
I don't want to hang up my rock and roll shoes
I don't want to hang up my rock and roll shoes
Something happens to me
Every time I hear the blues

I will do my homework
I'll clean the yard every day
I will even do the dishes
I'll do anything you say

That say that rock and roll
It'll soon fade away
But I just want to tell you
Rock and roll is here to stay
I don't want to hang up my rock and roll shoes
I don't want to hang up my rock and roll shoes
I get a good time feeling
Every time I hear the blues

Some might even say
It put the devil in my soul
But that's a bunch of shit
I just want to rock and roll
I don't want to hang up my rock and roll shoes
I don't want to hang up my rock and roll shoes
My feets got to move now
Every time I hear the blues
