And I wonder day to day
I don't like you anyway
I don't need your shit today
You're pathetic,in your own way

I feel for you, better fuckin' go away
I will behave, better fuckin' go away

I'm doing the best I ever did
I'm doing the best that I can
I'm doing the best I ever did

I don't need to fantasize
You are my pet, all the time
I don't mind if you go blind
You get what you get
Until you're through with mine

Life,I feel for you, better fuckin' go away
I will behave, you better go away
I feel for you, better fuckin' go away
I will behave, you better go away

I'm doing the best I ever did
I'm doing the best that I can
I'm doing the best I ever did
Now go away!

I'm doing the best I ever did
I'm doing the best that I can
I'm doing the best I ever did
Now go away!

I'm doing the best I ever did (go away)
I'm doing the best that I can (go away)
I'm doing the best I ever did (go away)
I'm doing the best that I can (go away)

I'm doing the best I ever did
I'm doing the best that I can
I'm doing the best I ever did
Now go away!

I'm doing the best I ever did
I'm doing the best that I can
I'm doing the best I ever did
Now go away!

I'm doing the best I ever did
I'm doing the best that I can
I'm doing the best I ever did
Now go away!

(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

I'm doing the best I ever did (go away)
I'm doing the best that I can
