No curtains on my window 
Outside the sun is sinking low 
I feel you letting go 
I will promise you anything 

Wind whispering in your ear 
I'll tell you what you want to hear 
If you'll only let me near 
I will promise you anything 

Well, I don't have to prove my intentions are golden 
I don't have to tell you where we're goin' 
Feel somethin' wild baby out there blowin' 
If you follow me 
 
Run with me if you dare 
Hold on I'm gonna take you there 
Solemn as a prayer 
I will promise you anything 

No curtains on my window 
Outside the moon is hangin' low 
True colors start to show 
I will promise you anything
