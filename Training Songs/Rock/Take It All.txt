If your hands are tied 
Don`t be afraid 
A chance in a lifetime 
Is on its way 

If you`re out tonight 
In shoes of glass 
Make it by midnight 
The future might pass 

[Chorus] 
The facts of life ain`t changing 
They don`t care about you 
The hands of time ain`t waiting 
They`ll go on without you 
Baby - take it all 
Baby - take it all 

For once in your life 
You got it made 
A sign of the times 
The past is paid 

So leave it behind 
Don`t be ashamed 
Innocent girl 
In a man`s world 

[Chorus]

Get it all - do it do it
