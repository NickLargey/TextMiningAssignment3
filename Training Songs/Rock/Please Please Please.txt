Going straight has never been easy
Close my eyes don't look to the left or right
When it hurts you know it's the price
You can't make it

Everyday I hide from the sunlight
Anyway I got near it on twice
Maybe I have never been brave
Yes I want to

Please please please
You've got to find a place of your own
Before they carve your name on a stone
You've got to lift yourself up from the ground

And it's a strange world dragging you down
Please please please
All belief the reason escapes me
Letting go can't make you feel any worse

All my life I know I was cursed
You can't break it
Please please please
You know it's hard for your mother and me

You know it's not what we wanted to be
You've got to lift me up to the sky
There's only seconds left till we die
You know it's not what we wanted to be

You know it's hard for your mother and me
And it's a strange world dragging you down
You've got to lift me up off the ground
