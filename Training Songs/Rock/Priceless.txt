Been a lot of places
In my life and time
Loved a lot of women
Oh boy, and I ain't lyin' ain't lyin'
You're the first and the last
That took my heart and mind
This time, baby, 
I'm layin' my feelings on the line

That makes you priceless
Your love is priceless
Honey, you're priceless
Honey, you're priceless

Once upon a time
I thought I had the world on a string
How can you miss seeing someone that
You've never seen
Thanks be to God
I love, I love the skin I'm in

That makes you priceless
Honey, you're priceless
Your love is priceless
Honey, you're priceless

If I had(a) known then
What I know now
I guess the ups and downs
I'd have to face them anyhow
Life is more to me
Than a mere fantasy
I once was blind to the truth, you see
And then came your love
And you've rescued me
'Cause how can you miss being somewhere
That you've never been
How come you're missing someone
That you've never seen

Oh baby, that makes you priceless
Honey, you're priceless
Ooh, you're priceless
Honey, honey, you're priceless
Honey, you're priceless
Honey, honey, you're priceless
I'd tell the world about it
I couldn't live without it
But then, how can you miss being somewhere
That you've never been 
How can you miss seeing someone
That you've never seen

Oh honey you're priceless
Oh baby, you're priceless
Honey, honey, you're priceless
Honey, honey, honey, you're priceless

Honey, you're priceless
And I couldn't live without you
Honey, honey, you're priceless
I couldn't pay for it
Priceless
Honey, honey, you're priceless
Honey, honey, you're priceless
Honey, honey, honey
