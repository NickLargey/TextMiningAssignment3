Tell me one more time, as I hold your hand that you don't love me
Tell me one more time, as teardrops start to fall
Shout it to me and I'll shout it to the skies above me
That there was nothing after all

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, tell me that you never wanted my loving
Baby, baby, tell me that you never
Tell me, tell me one more time, one more time
Say you're leaving, say goodbye
One more time, one more time
Say you're leaving, say goodbye

Tell me one more time, we never had a thing in common
Tell me one more time, as you turn and face the wall
Tell me I should know you never were my kind of woman
And tell me we were fools to fall

[Chorus]

Tell me one more time, your tears are only sad confusion
And tell me it's just been so long and that is all
And tell me one more time that love was only my illusion
You never answered to my call

[Chorus]
