People say that you're no good,
But I wouldn't cut you loose, baby, if I could
Well, I seem to stay down on the ground
Baby, I'm too far gone to turn around
Oh, if only you would make up your mind
Take me where you go, you're leaving me behind

Lord, you got those come and go blues
Lord, you got those some and go blues, yes, you do
Oh and you got me feelin' like a fool

'Round 'n 'round, 'round we go
Don't ask me why I stay here, I don't know
Well maybe I'm a fool to care
Without your sweet love, baby I would be nowhere
Here I'll stay, locked in your web
Unitl that day I might find somebody else

I don't know just when that would be
I don't know, I can't say as I can't see
Lord you got me feeling like a fool

Woman, you got those come and go blues
Lord, you got those come and go blues
Oh you got me feelin' like a fool, just like a fool
