If you're looking for a way out
I won't stand in your way
If you're looking for a way out
Don't stop at the tears that I'm crying
They'll only make you wanna stay
Don't kiss me again 'cause I'm trying
To keep you from running away

Oh baby tell me I'm wrong
Just say I'm crazy
It's with me that you belong
It's never easy when lovers have to part
Oh come on stop pretending
Tell me what's in your heart

If you're looking for a way out
I won't stand in your way
If you're looking for a way out
Don't stop at the tears that I'm crying
They'll only make you wanna stay
Don't kiss me again 'cause I'm trying
To keep you from running away
Don't stop at the tears that I'm crying
They'll only make you wanna stay
Don't kiss me again 'cause I'm trying
To keep you from running away
Baby don't run away
Baby don't run away
Say that you'll stay

Oh come on stop pretending
Tell me what's in your heart

If you're looking for a way out
I won't stand in your way
If you're looking for a way out
Don't stop at the tears that I'm crying
They'll only make you wanna stay
Don't kiss me again 'cause I'm trying
To keep you from running away
Baby don't run away

Stop pretending
Please baby now
Stop pretending 
Please baby now
Stop pretending

Won't you tell me what's in your heart?
Please baby now, stop pretending
Don't you know that I'll always, stop pretending
Please baby now, stop pretending
Won't you tell me what's in your heart?
