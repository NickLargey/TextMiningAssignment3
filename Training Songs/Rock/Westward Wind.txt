Seems like I remembered
Her best when the moon is high
And all those horizon she waits
Where the seas touches the sky
Wake up the time we've lost
The days gone by
And we'll walk the beaches
With the way the island teaches

Oh'o Westward Wind
To feel it myself and given the time
I spend with you again
Oh'o Westward Wind
Sailing away like a dream
Coming back again

She likes to gaze into your eyes of blue
It's been such a long time
Since I was there with you
Think of a hundred things that we can do
When the days are long and night
Are fill with smiles and laughter

Oh'o Westward Wind
To feel it myself and given the time
I spend with you again
Oh'o Westward Wind
Sailing away like a dream
Coming back again
