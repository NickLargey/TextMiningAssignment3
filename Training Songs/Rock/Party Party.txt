We`re gonna drink enough tonight to drown the average army 
By New Year`s Day the next door neighbour will be goin' barmy 
The milkman arrives at midday with his usual wisecrack 
Who knows a girl with Wednesday legs so when`s they gonna snap? 

[Chorus]
Why does everybody have to be so hale and hearty 
Can`t they see we're tryin' to have a party party party party 

The last thing I remember I was talkin' to some fellas 
Then she said she`d have a word for me with her good-looking mate 
And handed me a pint-pot filled with Advocate and Tizer 
And I woke up in the flowerbed fearing fertilizer 

[Chorus]
 
So shift yourself and shake your bod 
You got bullet proof insurance from fire, flood and Act of God 
You got to learn from your mistakes 
When you got a face like last week`s Cornflakes 

The doors and the window frames are by Pablo Picasso 
The party decorations owned by Michelangelo 
The fine music that you hear is by Stravinsky 
with overall design by Leonardo da Vinci 

[Chorus]

So shift yourself and shake your bod 
You got bullet proof insurance from fire, flood and Act of God 
You got to learn from your mistakes 
When you got a face like last week`s Cornflakes 

Two boys are upstairs in your bed 
Three girls are downstairs cryin' 
The Alka Seltzer in the glass is roarin' like a lion 
You think you've aged 10 years tonight and still never been kissed 
So you overdose on aftershave and try to slash your wrist 

[Chorus]
