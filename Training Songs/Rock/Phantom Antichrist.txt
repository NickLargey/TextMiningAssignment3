Ascending from an enemy appears
Ending the ever forming bliss
Two appear, a horror in the wilds
A fear that concentrates upon the eyes
Force of total violence, total death
Lies, a pure feeling of the west
To start the calibration of the childs
The cancellation revelation's sluts

Phantom's calling, across the land
Leaving trails of blood and sand
And this torture, and misery
Souls are awake enough to see
Far beyond the lies

Phantom antichrist
Phantom antichrist

Archers are the forever slain
The three became hopelessly enslaved
The inheritance of a thousand words
Four take the blessing of the sword
The traitors form, they will never yield
Pain becomes thunder, righteous leave
They are anxious for the fallen paradise
The kingdom of the phantom antichrist
Phantom's calling, across the land
Leaving trails of blood and sand
And this torture, and misery
Souls are awake enough to see
Far beyond the lies

Phantom antichrist
Phantom antichrist

Terror will prevail

Terror from the left, terror from the right
Oppression is the root to our great suicide
Overthrowing gods, overthrowing all
Exchanging of the stimulated mind contagion
Feeding off the woes, from human misery
Genocide, genocide, war doesn't cease
The shadow of his wings is falling on his limbs
Every other color, turning into black

Savior's calling, across the land
A new beginning, that has no end
An open mind of forceful will
Don't start laughing, feel the kill
Soul of love and light

Phantom antichrist
Phantom antichrist
