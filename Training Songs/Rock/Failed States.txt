29 years in human history:
The total duration of time without war.
What the f*ck am I acting so surprised for?
'Cause if I had a dime
For every single idiotic time
I felt like strangling some goof on the street,
I could afford a business class seat
On fucking Soyuz 13.
Straight sandwiched between
Tom Hanks and Lance Bass.
Already fighting, nowhere near space.

Each of us a failed state in stark relief
Against the backdrop of the perfect worlds we seek.
Perfect world. Fantasy.
