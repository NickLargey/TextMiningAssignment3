Maybe I'm a bad seed
Blame it on the TV
And maybe it was just because my grandma raised me
Tell me what all this is
Yeah, tell me what honest is
You need a body cast for all my broken promises

Told you not to hold your breath (told you not to hold)
You're turning blue the way I make you

Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat
I'm making you
Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat

I'm not a basic dude
But I'm just a waste of you
I know it's hard to face the music that I play to you
Like I'm droppin' a bomb
Go and cry to your momma
Life is such a comedy, so just spare me the drama

Told you not to hold your breath (told you not to hold)
You're turning blue the way I make you

Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat
I'm making you
Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat

And don't come crying over spilled perfume
It smells like shit to you
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Say you're dying, that's so typical you
I've got nothing to prove
Told you not to hold your breath
It's getting in the way I make you

Sweat, sweat, sweat
I'm making you
Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat
I'm making you
I'm making you
Sweat
