No, no, no...

I was sittin' there all alone when you smiled at me
I wasn't ready for a love affair but I was startin' to be
So I looked you in the eye until I felt the electricity
I started changing my plans for the night
When you walked over to me

I smiled at you and asked you your name
And I told you mine
So you told me your name and your number
And your astrological sign

I said it's really nice to meet ya
Come over here and sit on my knee
Well if you're gonna do something tonight
Why don't you do it with me

Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
