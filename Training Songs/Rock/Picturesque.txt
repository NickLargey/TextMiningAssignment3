And the sun is pouring in
Through the window
And right onto your skin

And I've never seen a portrait quite so picturesque

And the hours slip away
I always struggle for the right words to say

'Cause how could I try to describe in sentences that I cant believe a girl like you exists

[Chorus]
So don't forget to smile when you see the sun come out
'Cause your laughter and your love are all I've been thinking about
Just the thought of you sustains me and that smile of yours can make the whole world new
I love the way I feel when I'm with you

And when you say hello it makes me happier than you could ever know
The way you light up every room you've ever walked into
Makes me glad that I'm with you

[Chorus]
So don't forget to smile when you see the sun come out
'Cause your laughter and your love are all I've been thinking of
Just the thought of you sustains me and that smile can make the whole world new
I love the way I feel when I'm with you

And the sun is pouring in through the window and right onto your skin
