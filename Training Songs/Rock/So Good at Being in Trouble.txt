Now that you’re gone
It’s been a long lonely time
It’s a long, sad lonely time
Rolling along, I'm in a strange state of mind
It’s a strange old state of mind

Memories they mess with my mind
Who am I to deny
She was so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So bad being in love

Memories they mess with my mind
Who am I to deny, to deny
She was so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So bad being in love.
