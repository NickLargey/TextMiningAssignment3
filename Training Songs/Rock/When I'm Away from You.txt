When I'm away from you I can't stay still
My thoughts won't move from the way I feel
It happens time and time again
And the circle never ends

When I'm away from you well it hurts to say
My sense is gone so far away
I'm up all through the night
I can't tell wrong from right

When I'm away from you I see great big clouds
In the fog and rain all the lonely crowds
It seems to be so blue
Every night I'm missing you

When I'm away from you the sun don't shine
The moon don't come the words don't rhyme
When I'm away from you I can't let go
And you know, oh you know

It's all the things you do that make life worth while
Like the way you talk and the way you smile
It's all the things you do keep me hangin' on
And you know, don't you know

When I'm away from you the wine won't flow
The tides don't turn and the winds don't blow
I'm up all through the night
I can't tell wrong from right

When I'm away from you the sun don't shine
The moon don't come the words don't rhyme
When I'm away from you I can't let go
And you know, oh you know

It's all the things you do that make life worth while
Like the way you talk and the way you smile
It's all the things you do keep me hangin' on
And you know, don't you know

When I'm away from you my girl
When I'm away from you little girl
I'm up all through the night
Can't tell the wrong from right

When I'm away from you my girl
When I'm away from you my girl
I'm up all through the night
I can't tell wrong from right
