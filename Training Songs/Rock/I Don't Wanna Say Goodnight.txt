Baby, here we are; somehow I knew I'd feel like this
It's a funny thing that I had a hunch we couldn't miss
I should've tried to keep you from knowin'
But how can I stop my love from showin'?

CHORUS:
I don't wanna say goodnight (no no no no)
I don't wanna say goodnight
Baby, please don't make me

Was it the way you smiled the first time you caught me looking at you?
Or is it just tonight that's makin' me feel the way I do?
It's gettin' late & I should be goin'
But I can't stop my love from showin'

(chorus)

Don't send me away when I've been waitin' so long to hold you in my arms

Baby, here we are; somehow I knew it would be like this
It's a funny thing that I had a hunch we couldn't miss
I should've tried to keep you from knowin'
But it's too late now, you really got me goin'

(repeat & fade):
I don't wanna say goodnight (no no no no)
