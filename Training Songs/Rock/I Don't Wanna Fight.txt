There's a pale moon in the sky 
The kind you make your wishes on 
Oh, like the light in your eyes 
The one I built my dreams upon 
It's not there any longer 
Something happened somewhere and we both know why 
But me, I'm getting stronger 
We must stop pretending 
I can't live this life 

I don't care who's wrong or right 
I don't really want to fight no more (too much talking babe) 
Let's sleep on it tonight 
I don't really want to fight no more 
This is time for letting go

I hear a whisper in the air 
It simply doesn't bother me 
Oh, can't you see that I don't care 
Or are you you looking right through me 
It seems to me that lately 
You look at me the wrong way and I start to cry 
Could it be that maybe 
This crazy situation is the reason why 

I don't care who's wrong or right 
I don't really want to fight no more (too much talking babe) 
Let's sleep on it tonight 
I don't really want to fight no more (tired of all these games) 
But baby, don't you know 
That I don't want to hurt no more (it's time, I'm walking, babe) 
Don't care now who's to blame 
I don't really want to fight no more 
This is time for letting go

Hanging on to the past 
It only stands in our way 
We had to grow for our love to last 
But we just grew apart 
No, I don't want to hurt no more 

But baby, don't you know 
No, I don't want to hurt no more (too much talking, babe) 
So let's sleep on it tonight 
I don't really want to fight no more 
This is time for letting go
No, I don't want to hurt no more (too much, hey baby) 
Don't care now who's to blame 
I don't really want to fight no more 
'Cause it's time for letting go
