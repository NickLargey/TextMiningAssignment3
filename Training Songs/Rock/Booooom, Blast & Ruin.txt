I've had enough
You burn the bridge I'll cut the boat in half
Control
I've said enough, you keep the secrets I know you'll never spill
Sold

Boom, blast and ruin girl
Causes distraction
You're rooted in hell

I can't surprise you girl
The truth is in motion
You cover it well
But you're praying for some action so you won't realise
You used to be wrong, I used to be right

I flick the switch
I wake up in a copse of sweat and tears
Soaked
I swallow truths
We fit like ice cream on an open wound
It soothes

Sink like cathedrals girl
Into the ocean
We rise to the sun

I can't surprise you girl
The truth is in motion
You cover it well
But you're praying for some action so you won't realise
You used to be wrong, I used to be right

Boom, blast and ruin girl
Causes distraction
You're rooted in hell

I can't surprise you girl
The truth is in motion
You cover it well
But you're praying for some action so you won't realise
You used to be wrong, I used to be right
