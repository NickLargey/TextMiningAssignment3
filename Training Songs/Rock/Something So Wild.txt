Yet a wave of his hand's enough to get her back again
I d[Am]ispise every word that he [C]speaks,
'cos he [Am]tries to make her feel [G]weak
And he'll [F]put her down in public and he [G]treats her like a child
but he'll [Am]never make a lapdog out of s[D]omething so wild
Yet a [C]wave of his hand's e[G]nough to get her back a[Am]gain[F]
Yet a [C]wave of his hand's e[G]nough to get her back a[F]gain
And I [C]tried to convince her, to [E]make it on her own
But she's [Am]afraid to be a spinster, af[D]raid to be alone
Yet a w[C]ave of his hand..[G]...........[G]

I dispise every move that he makes
'cos I know what he's trying to break
And he'll put her down......etc.
