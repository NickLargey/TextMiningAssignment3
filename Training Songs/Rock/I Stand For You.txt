Jesus I stand for you
No matter what you lead me through
They will chase me out, and close me down
But Jesus, I stand for you

I'll always stand, I'll always stand
I'll always stand for you
In all this world, you're all that's true
I'll always stand for you
For you, yeah

Jesus, I've stood my ground
When unbelief was all around
And I have felt the sting, rejection brings
But Jesus, I'll still stand for you

Yeah, I'll always stand, I'll always stand
I'll always stand for you
For you, yeah
In all this world, you're all that's true
I'll always stand for you

A time will come 
When everyone
Will turn their eyes
On the risen son
But until that day, this world will turn away
And so I'll take your hand 
I'll always stand for you
For you, yeah

And I will always, and I will always, always

Guilty of disgrace
But you took my place
So Jesus, I'll always stand for you

I'll always stand, I'll always stand
I'll always stand for you
For you, oh
In all this world, you're all that's true
I'll always stand for you
For you
Always stand for you, oh
