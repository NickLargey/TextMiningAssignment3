I'm down on my back, no one beside me, where are the friends I used to know?
I'm goin', I'm gone, I can't take it anymore, gonna find my way
Won't you follow me up to Future Street
Nothing is complete, but we're all together

Back on my feet is how I'm feelin'
I've done my time, but that ain't real - it just ain't real
So no more, come on, I've heard that song, I'm gonna find my way
Won't you follow me up to Future Street

It will be complete, up on Future Street
Come on follow me up to Future Street
It will be complete, when we're all together
Hey, come on, come on, I know we'll find a way, discover today

I can't call home, there isn't a telephone
Yeah I've found my way, where I belong
Won't you follow me up to Future Street
Nothing is complete, but we're all together

Come on follow me up to Future Street
It will be complete, up on Future Street
Come on follow me up to Future Street
It will be complete, up on Future Street
