Just when I think I'm getting closer
Just when I think I understand
Here comes a chaos to surround us
Of all the years without a plan
And to the spaceship from the carthorse
We play along, it's in the game

This time is just the same

They say we're too young to be lazy
And you're not going anywhere
And though I know that you'll act crazy
That doesn't mean I never care
And when you're tired of chasing rainbows
Just look me up and say my name

This time is just the same

With the seasons and the rung(?)
Love is never changing, only time

And I'm not getting any younger
It is still the month of may
And where I'm going days are longer
I'm going to make it there one day
And I am not the same as you are
So wish me luck upon my way

This time is just the same

It's just the same

It's just the same

It's such a shame

It's just the same

It's such a shame

It's just the same
