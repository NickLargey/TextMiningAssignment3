By the time I got your letter, I lost my mind
I was trippin'
"When you gettin' better?"
It's a jagged line
Nothin' lasts forever when you travel time
I've been sippin' that Kool-Aid at the cosmos

'Cause the voyager's in every boy and girl
If you wanna get to heaven get out of this world
The voyager's in every boy and girl

When it finally hit me I did not cry
'Cause I was at the 7/11 flippin' through The New York Times
I saw it printed in black and white
The voyager goes up in smoke

The voyager's in every boy and girl
If you wanna get to heaven get out of this world
You're the voyager
You're the voyager

You scared me straight
Right into your arms
Ah-oh
Ah-oh-oh
Ah-oh
Ah-oh-oh
Ah-oh

The voyager's in every boy and girl
If you wanna get to heaven get out of this world
You're the voyager
You're the voyager
You're the voyager
I'm the voyager
