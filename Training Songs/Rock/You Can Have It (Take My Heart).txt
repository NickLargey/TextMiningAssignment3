Has there ever come a time, when you feel real nice
And you want to let someone know
That you really appreciate them?
All you have to do is moan a little bit for me
It goes something like this

You see, no time for wasting, baby
We're gone all through those moves
I'm offering satisfaction, darling
Girl, I'm giving you all my love

Anytime is the right time, baby
Come on and take my heart
It's all yours if you want it, baby
My heart is tearing all apart, I say

You can have it
(Yeah, if you want it)
If you want it
(Come and get it, baby)
(But if you want it)

You can have it)
(Come and get it, girl, yeah)
If you want it
(Yeah)

See, darling, there's no time for wasting, baby
Come on, please, make up your mind
Good loving is so pleasing, baby
Girl, I'm giving you all my time

You can have it if you want it
Just come and get it and, baby, it's yours, yeah
I've got it to give and if you want it
I know that you're gonna love it, just come on, girl

Oh, I knew you'd like it
Oh, baby, you got me saying something like
Listen now

One night while I was sleeping, baby
Had a dream of you and I
Found myself asking you, baby
Take my hand and be my wife

There's no time for wasting, baby
Because we've gone all through those moves
'Cause I'm offering satisfaction, darling
Girl, I'm giving you all my love

You can have it
(Yeah, if you want it)
If you want it
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
You can have it
(Ooh, baby, you really want my loving)

If you want it
(It's all yours, baby)
(You can have it)
You can have it any time of the day

If you want it
(Don't matter what place it is, you get it, baby)
You can have it
(Oh, yeah, come on, girl, get it)

If you want it
(If you want it, you can have it, don't you know that?)
You can have it
('Cause I will make you feel alright)

If you want it
(Oh, baby, can't you tell that I need it)
You can have it
(Come on, baby, come on, baby)

If you want it
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
You can have it
(Come on, darling, satisfaction guaranteed)

If you want it
(Oh, baby, baby)
You can have it
Like [Incomprehensible]

If you want it
(Oh, you're such a pretty little girl, baby)
You can have it
