Machines are rolling once again,
It's time to meet your new best friend.
He's in your face and in your pocket don't take your eyes off him.
Is he someone you long to be?
Identities are altered for you.
Never see what it's really like if it's ugly deep inside,
Consumer life, consumes a life to, -hit zero once again and follow life the
Way it's meant to be.
There must be something more in store for me.
We can't be forced to see.
Hit zero.
Once again without the thoughts of someone else to blend.
There must be something more 'cause I am bored.
We can be forced to feed.
He's got a book to sell you too,
A self made icon sold to you.
He's representing everything I wish had not existed.
But somebody else might come and be the one,
The one to follow.
There's something I've known,
I've seen this,
Herd mentality creates,
The fuel to run machines forever.
And I have been the worst of both extremes.
Self thoughts could be impossible it seems.
Hit zero once again and follow life the way it's meant to be.
There must be something more in store for me.
