What happened to Dignity?
Did it go away again?
Just like some worn out trend.
Well I still defend emotions.

What happened to Honesty?
I don't see it in the top ten.
I only see it in what has been.
'cause I still defend Devotion.

Am I alone?

Don't want to rest, Don't want to breath.
We don't want to hear about life.
Don't want to hear a spokesman.
I don't want to test on what you believe,
The god damn singer wrote the song!
Don't want to hear a spokesman.

What happen to Integrity?
I don't see it on MTV.
All I see is choreography
and I'll never be a dancer

What happen to puberty?
Bad Skin and insecurity?
And who the f*ck is felicity?
'cause I have problems of my own!

Am I alone?

Don't want to rest, Don't want to breath
We don't want to hear about life.
Don't want to hear a spokesman
Don't want to test on what you believe
The god damn singer wrote the song!
Don't want to hear a spokesman.

Don't want to rest, Don't want to breath
We don't want to hear about life.
Don't want to hear a spokesman
Don't want to test on what you believe
The god damn singer wrote the song!
Don't want to hear a spokesman.
