We're sending out the invitation
Come and join the celebration
This old town is up to something
Everybody's really jumpin'
Rock 'n' roll is dynamite

We got a hot time in this city tonight

Rock me baby like a long lost friend
Then roll me over and do it again
I'm so high I'm on the ceiling
Everybody's got the feeling
The music's like pure dynamite

We got a hot time in this city tonight

Ladies and gentlemen lend me an ear
I got the news that you been waitin' to hear
It's no trick, it's a rock 'n' roll treat
The heavy metal kids're dancin' in the street
This whole town is really havin' a ball
Even got 'em rockin' down at city hall
I never ever seen such a beautiful sight

We got a hot time in this city tonight

Hard rock rhythm is in your soul
Baby let the good times roll
The neighbors wanna call the cops
But the party's never gonna stop
Everything is gonna be alright

We got a hot time in this city tonight
