I'm tired of foolin' around
I'm trying hard but I'm no Clark Gable
There's something I want to say
Here are my cards on the table 

The woman I love has eyes of blue
A face like heaven and a body like you
The woman I love is standing next to me 

These words don't come easily
These words are a stranger in my town
But I am what I want to be
Forget the high-brow here's the low-down 

[Chorus x2]
It's funny how it never seems
To be the time or place
I can tell it to the world
But I can't tell it to your face 

I got a secret I don't want anymore
I'd tell you about it but I'm too damn yellow
What does it matter if you walk out that door
What's to lose baby What the hell 

[Chorus x2 ]
 
The woman I love is standing next to me
