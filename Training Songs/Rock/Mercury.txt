Quietly, almost elusively
Almost invisibly,
I found that I
for a moment
Had slipped away.
Ripped in two, then pasted back again,
Then crumpled up inside,
Then tossed aside
you know that
It feels so bad.
oh Mercury
oh Mercury
Happened once, then it
happened twice,
Then it happened thrice,
And now a fourth?
You know that?
Quietly, almost elusively
Almost invisibly,
I found that I
for a moment
Had slipped away.
oh Mercury
