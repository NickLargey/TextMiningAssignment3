Therapy? Screamager lyrics
With a face like this
I won't break any hearts
And thinking like that
I won't make any friends
Screw that, forget about that
I don't wanna hear about anything like that
Screw that, forget about that
I don't wanna know about anything like that
I've got nothing to do 'cept
Hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do 'cept
Hang around and get screwed up on you

Your beauty makes me feel alone
I look inside but no ones home
Screw that, forget about that
I don't wanna hear about anything like that
Screw that, forget about that
I don't wanna know about anything like that
I've got nothing to do 'cept
Hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do 'cept
Hang around and get screwed up on you

I've got nothing to do 'cept
Hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do 'cept
Hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do 'cept
Hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do 'cept
Hang around and get screwed up on you
