Lay down in sweet surrender
Your love so warm and tender

Sweet surrender, now
So warm and tender, now

Inside my waves are breaking
A light of my salvation

Oh, my waves are breaking now
Ooh, sweet salvation now

I'm seeking love and glory
Just like I always do
The bosom of the freedom
Are very rarely chewed

Out here the fire's still burning
So long into my night
Still captive and still yearning
Surrender to your light

A heart that never falters
A love that never dies
I linger in the shadow
The dimming of my light

The dimming of my light
The dimming of my light
The dimming of my light
