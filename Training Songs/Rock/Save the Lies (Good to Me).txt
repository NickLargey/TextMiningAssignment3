I'd like to find something
I got my best dress on
And I'll play from dusk till dawn
And when you sleep tonight
I'd hold my pillow tight
I'd turn all the lights off

Oh I say, don't say, that you're up to nothing, your sure up to something
Today, boy I'll start a laughing cause you will pay

Save the lies
I'm a saying I might get a bit rough, if he ain't good to me, oh, good to me
So I say with a smile cause I know, that he'll be good, you better be good to me, ya better be good

You better treat me nice
Or I'll come back to bite
Boy just you wait and see
I'll throw you in skin deep
Into reality
No this ain't fantasy

Oh I say, don't say, that you're up to nothing, your sure up to something
Today, boy I'll start a laughing cause you will pay

Save the lies
I'm a saying I might get a bit rough, if he ain't good to me, oh, good to me
So I say with a smile cause I know, that he'll be good, you better be good to me,
Ya better me good [Repeat: x2]

Gonna set your bright soul alight
I'm gonna play my right card tonight
I'm gonna fly my bike, ride my kite
I'm gonna eat you up, bite you by the [Repeat: x2]

Save the lies
I'm a saying I might get a bit rough, if he ain't good to me, oh, good to me
So I say with a smile cause I know, that he'll be good, you better be good to me,
Oh good to me
