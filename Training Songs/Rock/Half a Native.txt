I wasn't made for the sea
So I keep my anger on me
Won't tumble over or fall apart
I lose direction in the dark

I wasn't made for the flow
Hard times it rolls in my blood
I'm half a native
Half alone
I'll never make it on my own

I wasn't made for the rain
The sound brings me back there again
A lonely sailor looking through
The stillest water
Every glimpse of you
