The clouds in the sky have covered up my life
And the day just stays gray till it's night 
And the darkness outside is a mirror to my eyes
Cause my soul won't reflect any light 

Oh, I can't lie, I'm so lonely
Oh, make it right and just hold me

'Cause I'm freezing, there's no way to stay warm
Don't you need me?
Left me out in the storm
How could you forget me?
My sunshine has left me alone

You're so cold

Freezing, like when rain turns to snow
Don't you need me?
Like an old over coat
The seasons may change
But the ice still remains in my soul

You're so cold

The chills down my spine 
Are just memories of a time
Now I'm haunted cause I thought 
You were mine

I just can't get away
I've been frozen in one place
And I am not moving on
Tell me why I still love you boy?

Oh, I can't lie, I'm so lonely 
Oh, make it right and just hold me

'Cause I'm freezing, there's no way to stay warm
Don't you need me?
Left me out in the storm
How could you forget me?
My sunshine has left me alone

You're so cold

Freezing, like when rain turns to snow
Don't you need me?
Like an old over coat
The seasons may change
But the ice still remain in my soul

You're so cold

I'm freezing, there's no way to stay warm
Don't you need me?
Left me out in the storm
How could you forget me? 
My sunshine has left me alone

So now I'm freezing, like when rain turns to snow
Don't you need me?
Like an old over coat
The seasons may change
But the ice still remains in my soul
