You were like a toilet bowl at the end of the rainbow
Something like a pot of gold stuck under my pillow
Keeping me up at night you kept my head spinning
And wishing there were windows to throw you from, throw you from
Day or night
F*ck if I know
Hard to tell with no fucking window
And sundials
What good are sundials once the sun is gone?
What are you good for?

And we laid in my bed like a train wreck
And we both got laid like concrete
And we fought like soldiers
But we died... We died like flies
Day or night
F*ck if I know
Hard to tell with no fucking window
And sundials
What good are sundials once the sun is gone?
What are you good for?
