Words on a postcard from far away
Spoke of a time long ago
Laughed ourselves daft on that Saturday
Singing here we go
I'm a taxi driver
I'm a postal worker
I'm an office cleaner
I'm a striking docker
I'm a ballet dancer
I'm a Zapatista
I'm a pop singer
I'm a winner
(Chorus)
I'm a winner baby
I'm a winner baby
Olé olé olé olé
Top of the world
I'm on top of the world
Olé olé olé olé
Top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm a brick layer
I'm an ex-miner
I'm a single mother
I'm a bus driver
I'm a political prisoner
I'm a print worker
I'm a footballer
I'm a winner
(Repeat chorus)
Words on a postcard from far away
Spoke of a time long ago
Laughed ourselves daft on that Saturday
Singing here we go
(Repeat chorus)
