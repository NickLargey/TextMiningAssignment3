Society, We all know there's something wrong and we know it all along
Sincerity, You may think there's no one else till they put you on a shelf
Society, Pay your taxes stand in line help them plan for your demise
Society, Crush the weak to get your share cause nobody's playing fair
And no one cares

How long you pray makes no difference today
When it's society devices how you'll pay
When finding the truth makes no difference to you
Anyway you look at it you're gonna get screwed
You lose

Society, No one here can get along cause our history's to long
Sincerity, Think you're going with the flow but you never really know
Society, To all the leaders it's a game and it's making you insane
Society, Data patterns are supplied proof tap back up all the lies
Hardly alive

How long you pray makes no difference today
When it's society devices how you'll pay
When finding the truth makes no difference to you
Anyway you look at it you're gonna get screwed
You lose

Society, We all know there's something wrong and we know it all along
Sincerity, You may think there's no one else till they put you on a shelf
Society, You can go on with the flow but you never really know
Society, Pay your taxes stand in line you can vote or get a life
