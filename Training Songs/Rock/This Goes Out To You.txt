I’ve been around so many places
Identical odds a million faces
Ups and downs traditional phases
And I I I I
I ain’t gonna change the elite of the nation
Four corners of the world positive vibration
And stereo beats were our foundations
And I I I I

Hey You
This goes out to you
For all the things you do
Hey ey ey
This song goes out to you
For everything and all that we go through

All sold out uneducated
Block connected street related
All original never duplicated
And I I I I
I want you to know my appreciation
Through all of these years you’re an inspiration
In honor of you it’s a celebration
And I I I I

Hey You
This goes out to you
For all the things you do
Hey ey ey
This song goes out to you
For everything and all that we go through

You’re my one foundation
A higher renovation
A new revelation
And I I I I

Hey You
This goes out to you
For all the things you do
Hey ey ey
This song goes out to you
For everything and all that we go through
Hey You
This goes out to you
For all the things you do
Hey ey ey
This song goes out to you
