You stay away from me
Because you know I'm good for you
And you are masochistic too
The reason I want you so much
Is 'cause I know you're no good for me
So together we are perfect dontcha see?
I'm the one you want
When you're so close I try to flaunt it
But you pretend not to notice
Yet I know you're being BOGUS
When you flirt with other women
And I know I could be swimmin' in yer sea
I could be so jealous of someone like me
Someone's got it all yet they just don't see
I shut out acceptance so I won't get hurt
And move on to the next one who will
Treat me like dirt
Treat me like dirt
Treat me like dirt
Standing at the threshold of another
Bad obsession, yeah-too bad it's with
A person who could never treat me
Worse then how the way you treated me
When I was staring at the backside of your neck
I was hoping soon you'd turn around
And look me over, up and down my heart was racing
'cause I knew I couldn't face you after giving you my heart and soul
Andgiving you the body of my mind
If I had a dollar every minute
Every hour that I spent obcessing
MADLY how you treated me so
BADLY and how badly that I
Wanted you the night you
Left me outside in the cold
But the thing that really gets me
Is the way you walk right past me
Yes you're talking to some other
And pretending she's your lover
Just to get me turnin' GREEN
Inside like bein' seen with me
Would be a crime
I could be so jealous of someone like me
Someone's got it all yet they just don't see
I shut out acceptance so I won't get hurt
And move on to the next one who will
Treat me like dirt
Treat me like dirt
Treat me like dirt
4:30 in the morning
Pickin' up the phone I'm yawning
Just awakened at the minute
From a dream that had you in it
I can still hear your sweet talking
But the next day you'd be walking
Out on me
Some day soon I know it
Maybe in December snow I'm
Gonna get you all alone and 
Take you to a place I've shown
To no one else in this great
World-yes, the place where
You will see me as you GIRL
