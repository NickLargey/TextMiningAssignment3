Spend your lazy, endless crazy
Days inside my head.
You're so selfish, you're not the only
One who thinks he's dead.
I'm paid to smile, now I'm on trial
For what you think I said.
'Cause I never said that everything would be okay,
And I never said that we would live to see another day.

Motivate me
I want to get myself outta this bed.
Captivate me
I want good thoughts inside of my head.
When I fall down would you come around
Pick me right up off the ground?

I'm realistic, and narsosistic
You say I'm selfish and absurd.
You try to change me,
You try to save me,
You say I'm gonna learn.
I'm so blind, I'm out of time,
You're so unkind sometimes.
I never lied, I never lied, I never lied....
'Cause I never said that everything would be OK,
I never said that we would live to see another day...

Motivate me
I want to get myself outta this bed.
Captivate me
I want good thoughts inside of my head.
When I fall down would you come around
Pick me right up off the ground?
