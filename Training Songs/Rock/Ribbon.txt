my path is a wide ribbon
each bow cuts a circle into it
its clearance you're not given
given 'til you're through with it
my path is a wide ribbon
it's mapped out but it's all even
and this power is self given
and it's clear and it's bright and it's thick
and it's without
without edges
when will everything be quiet?
when will everything be quiet?
when will our fucking hearts cease to riot?
when will everything be quiet again?
each bow cuts a circle into it
?the inside sometimes full of ???
and it's easy for people to read things into these
shattered wings, but who knows
who knows really?
when everything will be quiet?
when everything will be quiet?
when our fucking hearts will cease to riot?
when everything will be quiet again?
