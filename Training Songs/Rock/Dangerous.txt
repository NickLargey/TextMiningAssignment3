Don't call my name, I just must answer
This ain't no game, I ain't no chanter
Don't get me wrong, I don't want trouble
You come back strong, I'll come back double
I don't mess around, I'm dangerous
She's like a knife, sharp but pretty
She'll break your heart just for fun
You bet your life, you'll get no pity
She'll drop you flat when it's done

Look but just don't touch, she's dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous

[Chorus]
Big city lights, cold city nights
Sharks taking bites, dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous

[Guitar break]

[Chorus]

So just get smart and keep away now
You wouldn't like the games we play now
It gets kinda' rough, we're dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous

[Harp solo to fade]
