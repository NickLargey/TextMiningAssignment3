Shove- the momentum drags us under
Your constant disregard your constant aggravation
Tell me nothing but home truths 
and you show me starvation
On a black and white screen, 
this is your movie queen
Stop and think a second (tune in-tune out)
It's something more than nothing (drop in-drop out)

I see the way you lie to them (tune in-tune out)
All for the country you say (f*ck them-f*ck us)
Progress is the alternative to which we align
Hopeless intuition, raped between the lines
You tune in you tune out
Climbing a ladder fucked before we get out
You tune in you tune out
Climbing a ladder fucked before we get out
This system this lie
