Free me from this restless curse
That follows me through the dark
Bring back an innocence
A strength to fill my heart

In this world of emptiness
That I have come to know
Love is only a lie
Only a lie, only a lie

Love is only a lie
Only a lie, only a lie
When the promise is broken
When your eyes open

Then the wind whispers and sighs
Love is a lie
My bird of paradise
Colored in blues and gold

She's got a soul on ice
And calculation cold
This bird of avarice
Has left me now I know

Love is only a lie
Only a lie, only a lie
Love is only a lie
Only a lie, only a lie

When the promise is broken
When your eyes are open
When the wind whispers and sighs
Love is a lie

So breathe a last and broken sigh
Oh silent night come now to me
And if I dream of light come down
And be with me and in the dark we will not see

Love is only a lie
Only a lie, only a lie
Love is only a lie
Only a lie, only a lie

When the promise is broken
When your eyes open
When the wind whispers and cries
Love is only a lie, only a lie
