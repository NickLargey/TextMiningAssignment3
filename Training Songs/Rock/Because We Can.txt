I don’t wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain’t a soldier but I’m here to take a stand
Because we can

She’s in the kitchen staring out the window
So tired of living life in black & white
Right now she’s missing those technicolor kisses
When it just ain’t alive

Lately feeling like a broken promise
In the middle staring down this town
There’s only one thing in this world that she knows
He said forever and he’ll never let her down

I don’t wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain’t a soldier but I’m here to take a stand
Because we can

She laid take out on the coffee table
Prepped the dishes poured a glass of wine
Turn down the sound and move a little closer
Here for the moment everything is alright

I don’t wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain’t a soldier but I’m here to take a stand

Because we ca-an our love can move a mountain
We ca-an if you believe in we
We ca-an just wrap your arms around me
We ca-an we ca-an

I don’t wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain’t a soldier but I’m here to take a stand

I don’t wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain’t a soldier but I’m here to take a stand

Because we ca-an our love can move a mountain
We ca-an if you believe in we
We ca-an just wrap your arms around me
Because we ca-an, we can

Because we can
