Stacey's got a brand new girl
She likes to play with sugar
â€˜Til it makes sweet pearls
She likes to taste the danger
Makes her feel complete
You like to be the resonance
between her feet
But she don't wanna listen anymore
She won't put on the pressure
though you beg for more
You're like a viper in the night
Her time running out before
You're ready to strike
She makes you wanna take someone
She makes you wanna take someone out
She makes you wanna take someone
She makes you wanna take someone out
She makes you wanna love someone
She makes you wanna love someone else
She makes you wanna love someone else
Love someone else
She makes you wanna love someone

Trevor's got a brand new boy
He can make it easier to give you joy
Yeah
He's the little runaround for your hard cash
Let's the winner run around until they crash
But he don't wanna listen anymore
He wants to be a bigger dog instead of your whore
He's spending your infatuation spending too much
Instead of playing gigolo and taking his cut
He makes you wanna take someone
He makes you wanna take someone out
He makes you wanna take someone
He makes you wanna take someone out
He makes you wanna love someone
He makes you wanna love someone else
He makes you wanna love someone, oh
Love someone else
He makes you wanna love someone
He makes you wanna love someone else
He makes you wanna love someone else
Love someone else
He makes you wanna love someone
Makes you wanna love someone else
