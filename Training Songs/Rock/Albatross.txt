Subtight turned on a dime
In the sultry west-coast night
How could you lost your roll
Amongst the hopeful and the drunk
You showed me so much
You showed me so much

Took us to the new house, speeding along
In a green machine
Riding the wake of another
Once a week
You showed me so much
Oh you showed me so much

Those days are now long gone
Wish I had your picture
Never been able to be true
So I wanted, I wanted
I wanted to help you
I wanted to
And I wanted to help you

And I have to admit
Things got weird for a bit
And I scream for you
There goes my man

And I scream for you
There goes my man

And I scream for you
There goes my man
