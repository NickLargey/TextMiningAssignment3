The girl cries, the boy cries, they never shed a tear
Your time flies, you wonder why you try to hide the fear
Show me in one tree a whole universe
Make love, don't fight, dismiss the curse

Warm night, candlelight, quiet neighbourhood
Be brave, sleep tight, what you have is good

Heartbeat keep time, listen to the world
Climb out, unfold, polish your pearl
Show me in one tree a whole universe
Don't try, simplify, let your magic work

Warm night, candlelight, quiet neighbourhood
Be brave, sleep tight, what you have is good

Four way serenade, a most special kick
Sight lines over time, there is no trick
More love, more light, up and down the dip
Wrap it up strong enough, make it last the trip

Warm night, candlelight, quiet neighborhood
Be brave, sleep tight, what you have is good

Warm night, it's all right, you're doing what you should
Night-night, sleep tight, what you have is good
