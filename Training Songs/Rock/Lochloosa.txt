Homesick but it's alright
Lochloosa is on my mind
She's on my mind

I swear it's ten thousand degrees in the shade
Lord have mercy knows, how much I love it

Every mosquito every rattlesnake
Every cane break, everything

Every alligator every blackwater swamp
Every freshwater spring â€“ everything

All we need is one more damn developer
Tearing her heart out

All we need is one more Mickey Mouse
Another golf course another country club
Another gated community

Lord I need her
Lord I need her
And she's slipping away

If my grandfather could see her now
He'd lay down and die

Cause every minute every second every hour
Every day, Lord she's slipping away

Homesick but it's alright
Lochloosa is on my mind
She's on my mind
