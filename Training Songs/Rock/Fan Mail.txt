Dear sirs,
To whom this may concern
There's facts Id like to learn
So many things I wanna know

Especially trivial info paraphernalia badges and regalia
Please send me everything
'Cause I
Am interested in you

And every thing you do
I find myself at all your shows
Could you tell me where you buy your clothes
Could you sign my little sisters face
Put your signature any place and please send me a bio

'Cause we've got fan mail
We really really read it
Fan mail
We really really need it

I sent you my letter now I want a reply
You don't know any better than you won't take your time with my
Fan Mail

So I would like to know just if and when
You'll be in town again
So that I could meet with you
And brag at my friends at school

Have you been all around the world
Have you seen every kind of girl
Or are you from the other side

'Cause you
You can't believe everything that you read
With the hypocrysy and the greed
The papers all the things that they say

They don't tell me anything anyway
That's why I've gotta get it straight from you
Concerning your situation
Without an obligation

Break
My Fan mail(Oohs and Aahs)

What's this I find to my surprise
Those fans that I idolized
No longer seem to exist
Now tell what can be the cause of this

Perhaps it could be their egos
I tell you heaven only knows
I didn't even get a newsletter
