This band played at the Empty Bottle
About 200 people were at the show
The jam session was awesome
It whipped a pony's ass!

The rock show was over at last
A lot of people met the band
The jam session was awesome
It whipped a jackass with a belt
It was a jam session
I like them
I like them
They're my favorite band in the whole wide world
They're fine dressers
They're nice guys
They're on this record on the other side
