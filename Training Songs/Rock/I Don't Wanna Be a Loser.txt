I don't want to be
A loser
I don't want to have
A broken heart
Oh I don't want to be
A loser
I don't want another girl
To tear us apart

Tell me, what can I do to keep from losing you
'Cause I could never live without your love

I don't want to be, no I don't want to be a loser
I don't want to hear
You say goodbye
Oh I don't want to be
A loser
End up with a million tears that I'll have to cry

Oh I'll fight with all my might, kiss you and hold you tight
Until you say I'm right, I don't want to be a loser in love

I don't want to be
A loser
I don't want another girl
To tear us apart

Oh please tell me, what can I do to keep from losing you
'Cause I could never live without your love
A loser in love, in love, I don't want to be a loser in love
Oh I don't want to be a loser in love
I don't want to be a loser in love
