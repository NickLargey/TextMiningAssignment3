This generation 
Rules the nation 
With vision 

I say pass the dutchie on the left hand side 
Pass the dutchie on the left hand side 
It a gonna burn, give me music make me jump and prance 
It a go done, give me the music make me rock in the dance 

It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon 
How does it feel when you've got no food?
You could feel it cause it was the month of June 
How does it feel when you've got no food?
So I left my gate and went out for a walk 
How does it feel when you've got no food?
As I pass the dreadlocks camp I heard them say 
How does it feel when you've got no food?

So I stopped to find out what was going on
How does it feel when you've got no food?
'Cause the spirit of Jah, you know he leads you on
How does it feel when you've got no food?
There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing 
How does it feel when you've got no food?
You could feel the chill as I seen and heard them say 
How does it feel when you've got no food?

'Cause me say listen to the drummer, me say listen to the bass 
Give me little music make me wind up me waist 
Me say listen to the drummer, me say listen to the bass 
Give me little music make me wind up me waist, I say 

Pass the Dutchie on the left hand side 
Pass the Dutchie on the left hand side 
It a gonna burn, give me music make me jump and prance 
It a go done, give me the music make me rock in the dance
