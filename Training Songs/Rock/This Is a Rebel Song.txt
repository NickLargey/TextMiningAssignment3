I love you my hard Englishman
Your rage is like a fist in my womb
Can't you forgive what you think I've done
And love me, I'm your woman

And I desire you my hard Englishman
And there is no more natural thing
So why should I not get loving
Don't be cold Englishman

How come you never said you love me
In all the time you've known me
How come you never say you're sorry

I do
Oh please talk to me Englishman
What good will shutting me out get done
Meanwhile crazies are killing our sons
Oh listen, Englishman

I've honored you hard Englishman
Now I am calling your heart to my own
Oh let glorious love be done
Be truthful Englishman

How come you never said you love me
In all the time you've known me
How come you never say you're sorry

I do
I do
