Now I'm sheddin' my skin ya gotta listen to me ill tell ya what I 
See never believe what  you read the shit is spreadin' like a disease
Never feel withdrawn time to move on get your groove on say 
Goodbye everything must die solidify and fly to a new level a place where love 
Is unconditional physical and non-denominational

Like a snake shed my skin leave my past where 
I've been...can you feel what I feel to hold on must be killed 
Don't cry over what's been spilled, can you feel what I feel?
Yeah Yeah, Yeah you! Can you feel what I feel?
Yeah Yeah, Yeah you! Can you feel what I feel?

See the kid rock bumpin' up and down 
Your block with no cares long hair swingin' middle 
Fingers in the air people stare n point I hit 
The joint and laugh - kiss my ass, the past is 

More than 10 years I've known from a complete 
Unknown to the hot zone, million dollar home 
And a diamond ring never thougt I'd amount to 
A damn thing, I'm the man sing like Curtis 

May mack on ho's like Ruby Ray, its been a 
Long time comin' but you know what's happenin'...
Straight pimpin' I'm sitting five times platinum

Like a snake shed my skin leave my past where 
I've been...can you feel what I feel to hold on must be killed 
Don't cry over what's been spilled, can you feel what I feel?
Yeah Yeah, Yeah you! Can you feel what I feel?
Yeah Yeah, Yeah you! Can you feel what I feel? =2x
