Back in my old hometown
They were long summer days
And there were leaves on the ground
And it was too cold to play

The city's colder then cold
It's faceless and grey
And all the dreams that you hold
Keep slippin away

[Chorus]
Slippin away, slippin away
Little by little, and day by day
Slippin away, slippin away
Little by little, and day by day, yeah
I feel them slippin away
 
Saw an old friend of mine
Asked if he was ok
He said everythings fine
Then his eyes filled with pain

Yeah he had nothin to lose
He had nothin to say
He's feelin worn out and used and slippin away

[Chorus]

Better put up a fight
Startin right here today
Get some use out of life
Before you just slip away

Yeah Slippin away, slippin away
Little by little, and day by day
Slippin away, slippin away
Little by little, and day by day
Slippin away, slippin away
Little by little, and day by day
Slippin away, slippin away
Little by little, and day by day
Day by day yeah
I feel them slippin away
Oooohhh ohhhhhhhhhh
