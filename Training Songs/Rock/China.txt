She'll suck on anything you give her
Stare at anything that's shiny bright
Her voice cuts through the sea even when its stormy
But she's only two feet high - she'll get higher

I hope she sees some things that will make her time happy
It all comes in so fast it all comes in

She sleeps through almost any sound
Even when its screaming loud and clear
But she wakes up and smiles at a friendly voice
If it whispers softly in her ear

I see in her new face, a clear beginning
It all comes in so fast it all comes in
She knows who she is without looking
She says it out happy when the feeling is there
She's an all new person who says just what she feels
She's a fat faced goddess of nowhere

I hope she sees some things that will make her time happy
It all comes in so fast it all comes in
