Cause i got no time and i got no fear
I can always always fall and scream you say
Cause i got no time and i got no feeling
You can always always blow and breath you say
Cause i got no time and i got no fear
You can always always cry and sing you say
Call us the one
We light the sunshine
Cause there ain't no time
We light the sunshine
Cause i got no time and i got no fear
Ain't no gold so clear and precious as we are you say
Cause i got no time and i got no fear
You can always always cry and sing you say
Cause i got no time and i got no fear
You can always always cry and sing you say
Call us the one
We light the sunshine
Cause there ain't no time
We light the sunshine
