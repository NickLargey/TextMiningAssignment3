Whoa, Yeah
When your heart's on fire,
Runnin' on the edge.
Do you know what I mean?
When your heart's on fire, yeah.
That's the only time your soul runs free. 

Gotta get away, get a little freedom.
Somethin' of my own.
People want to say, what I should be.
Why can't they leave me alone?
Don't know if the way I feel,
Hunger is the word.
I can't keep it inside.
I can feel the heat,
And the pressure's on.
Gotta break away, just to stay alive. 

And my heart's on fire.
And I'm runnin' on the edge,
Do you know what I mean, Ooh.
When your heart's on fire, yeah.
That's the only time your soul runs free.
Tearin' up the road,
Listen to the engine scream.
Give it all that she has.
Push it to the line,
But never lookin' back,
As I live each day like the last. 

You can try, for what you want,
And get what you deserve.
Don't let go of your dream.
When you bet your life,
You can have it all.
When it's do or die,
There's no inbetween. 

If your heart's on fire.
Livin' on the edge.
Ooh, and you're burnin' up, Whoa.
Oh yeah. 

You can live the way you want,
There's nothing to regret.
Every move you make,
And every chance you get. 

When your heart's on fire.
And runnin' on the edge.
Do you know what I mean, Ooh. 

When your heart's on fire, yeah.
That's the only time your soul runs free.
When your heart's on fire, runnin' on the edge.
Do you know what I mean?
Whoa, Oh.
Heart's on fire.
