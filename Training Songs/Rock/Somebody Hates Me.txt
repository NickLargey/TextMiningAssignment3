Hey! 
Hey! 

Yeah! 

I just made an enemy of someone 
I don't know, and they are upset about somethin' 
That I must have done, it really doesn't make much sense 
That I've got no 
Statement in my defense- What! 

[Chorus]
I know, 
No matter what 
No matter who 
No matter what I do 
Somebody hates me 
(Somebody hates me) 
Somebody hates me, somebody hates me 
(Somebody hates me) 
Somebody hates me, somebody hates me 
And I hate somebody too 

Did you misunderstand something that I did 
Or was it one of my jokes that you didn't get 
Or do you think you've got the way I think all figured out 
What did I say to make you feel not cool now- Well! 

[Chorus]

I know it's wrong 
I do it too (I do it too) 
And I guess I should say 
Don't let it get to you 

[Chorus]

Somebody hates me [Repeat: x5]
And I hate somebody too [Repeat: x5]
Someone like you
