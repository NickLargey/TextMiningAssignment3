Standing at the bus stop with my shoppin' in my hands
When I'm over hearing elder ladies as the rumors start to fly
Hear them in the school yard, in the scrap yard, in the chip shop
In the phone box, in the pool hall
At the shoe stall every corner turned around

Started with the school girl who was running
Runnin' home to her mum and dad
Told them she was playin' in the change room of the local football side
They said, "Tell us again", she told them again
Tell us the truth they found it hard to believe
'Cause he taught our Steve, even trained me
Taught uncle John who's a father of three

Only takes one tree to make a thousand matches
Only takes one match to burn a thousand trees, thousand trees

See it in the class room or the swimming pool
Where the match stick men are made
At the scouts hall at the football, where the wise we trust are paid
We all honor his name, did a lot for the game
Got his name knocked up above the sports ground gates
Now they're rippin' it down, stampin' the ground
Picture gather dust in the bar and the lounge

It takes one tree to make a thousand matches
Only takes one match to burn a thousand trees, thousand trees

Wake up, smell the rain
Shake up, he's back to stay
Hasn't been on a holiday
Growin' seeds, don't believe why he's been away

In the school yard, change room, playin' fields, bathroom
Phone box, office blocks, corner's turned around
They keep doubting the flame, tossing the blame
Got his name knocked up above the sports ground gates
Now they're rippin' it down, stampin' the ground
Picture gather dust in the bar and the lounge

It takes one tree to make a thousand matches
Only takes one match to burn a thousand trees, thousand trees
Thousand trees, thousand trees
