Yeah, ya, yeah
Yeah, ya, yeah oh

I would dig a hole all the way to China
Unless of course I was there
Then I'd dig my way home
If by digging, I could steal
The wind from the sails of the greedy men who ruled the world

Still you my best friend
And after a good good drunk
You and me
Wake up and make love after a deep sleep
Where I was dreaming
I was dreaming of a dreamgirl, dreamgirl, dreamgirl, dreamgirl

Well I was feeling like a creep
As I watched you asleep
Face down in the grass
In the park in the middle of a hot afternoon
Your top was untied
And I thought 'how nice it'll be the fall of your sweat down your spine'

You're my best friend
Or after a good good drunk
You and me
Wake up and make love after a deep sleep
Where I was dreaming
I was dreaming of a dreamgirl, dreamgirl, dreamgirl, dreamgirl

Caught by the wave my back to the ocean
It knocks me off my feet, just as I find my footing
Here you come again, dreamgirl, oh dreamgirl
That's all dreamgirl, but a dreamgirl, dreamgirl, oh wait dreamgirl
In my dreams dreamgirl, I'm dreaming dream girl
Deep in, deep in
