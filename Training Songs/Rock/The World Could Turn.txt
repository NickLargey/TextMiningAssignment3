Now the 11th hour
Is gonna' slip right through your fingers
Rise like an old prize fighter
That's been K.O.'d on the canvas

Haven't you learned?
In a heartbeat
The world could turn
The world could turn.

No sense in getting sad
Now he's pissed away the real fun
Some day a caped crusader
Will give you back the dreams you lean on

Haven't you learned?
In a heartbeat
The world could turn
The world could turn.

Haven't you learned?
In a heartbeat
The world could turn
The world could turn.

For every end there's a beginning
Oh what's a life if not for living?
Cause either way you just keep spinning
So just sit tight, we'll try to get through this alive

A teenager out of time
Trying to kick it with the cool kids
Some day this life will find you
Sitting pretty in your own skin

Haven't you learned?
In a heartbeat
The world could turn,
The world could turn.

For every end there's a beginning
Oh what's a life if not for living?
Cause either way you just keep spinning
So just sit tight, we'll try to get through this alive

Haven't you learned?
In a heartbeat
The world could turn,
The world could turn.
