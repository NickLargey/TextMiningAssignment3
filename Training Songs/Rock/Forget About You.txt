Oh no, here we go
Hear your voice on the radio
Like every single song is about you, uh

Every sec that we spent
Lots of mess stuck up in my head
Got me so distracted and confused

Baby, I think I've lost my mind
Feels like you crashed into my life
I keep on losin' track of time
I'm so messed up, yeah

I'm so messed up!

I can't remember what I did tonight
Or even yesterday
Like, dude, where's my car?
Excuse me, what's my name?

Someone gave me these clothes
I can't remember who
My mind's a total blank
But I just can't forget about you,
Forget about you

Think that it's comin' back
Something about the time we had
Wish that we would've been recordin'

So right, super tight
Can't recall a thing last night
But woke up with a smile in the mornin'

Baby, I think I've lost my mind
Feels like you crashed into my life
I keep on losin' track of time
I'm so messed up, yeah

I'm so messed up!

I can't remember what I did tonight
Or even yesterday
Like, dude, where's my car?
Excuse me, what's my name?

Someone gave me these clothes
I can't remember who
My mind's a total blank
But I just can't forget about you
Forget about you

I just can't forget about you (yeah, you, you, you)
Forget about you oh
I just can't forget about you

Which way is up? Which way is down?
Can't stop this room from spinning 'round
I'm floating high, high off the ground
Caught in my head, can't get you out

I can't remember what I did tonight
Or even yesterday
Like, dude, where's my car?
Excuse me, what's my name?

Someone gave me these clothes
I can't remember who
My mind's a total blank
But I just can't forget about you
forget about you

I just can't forget about you
Forget about you

Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh
Oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh
