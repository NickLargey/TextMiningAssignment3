Well you're real pretty
And you act like a cross between you know what I mean
It's a real pity
Cause you try to be mean, but you just can't fake it with me
You love the pixies
You're the ultimate pop queen you know what I mean
Yeah my girl is a true dream
And I'm not gonna hate you if you're not gonna hate me

You're my pop queen

Well, you're not that lazy
And you know how to act when you're with the upper class
My dreams of you are hazy
As we lie on the grass and we talk about daydreams
You're so unconceited
Yeah you couldn't be slack if I paid you the shirt off my back

You're my pop queen
