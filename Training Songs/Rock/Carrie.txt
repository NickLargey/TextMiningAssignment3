Carrie won't you write? don't let me worry
You know that it's right, and still I worry
We don't have the time to quarrel like we do
Life is so unkind, don't let's help it too.

Carrie won't you come or meet me half way?
You don't have to run or play it my way.
I concede to you, it's the simple thing to do
Pride ain't got no place, the future's in your face.

(Carrie won't you write)

(You know that it's right)

I concede to you, it's the simple thing to do
Pride ain't got no place, the future's in your face.

Carrie won't you write
Carrie won't you write
Carrie won't you write
Carrie won't you write
(Repeat and fade).
