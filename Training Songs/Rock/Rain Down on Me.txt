When you're young
Everything's easy
It's a summerbreeze,
You're alive but times they change
Everything's rearranged
Summer moves on,
Nothingcan stop these tears from falling

Love is deep,
Love is wide
I'm still here by you're side

Let it all rain down on me
It happened too soon
Lay your head
Down upon my shoulder

Let it all rain down on me
It happened too soon
Lay your head
Down upon my shoulder
(i'll keep you warm when the nights grow colder)

Don't hold back
I know it's not easy
Everyone gets a little scared
But time will heal even a heart of steel
So don't try to run

I'll try to stop tou're tears from falling

love is deep,
Love is wide
I'm still here by you're side

Let it all rain down on me
It happened too soon
Lay your head
Down upon my shoulder

Let it all rain down on me
It happened too soon
Lay your head
Down upon my shoulder
(i'll keep you warm when the nights grow colder)

I'll always be by your side
Holding you close
Holding you tight
I'll always be by you're side

Let it all rain down on me
It happened too soon
Lay your head
Down upon my shoulder
