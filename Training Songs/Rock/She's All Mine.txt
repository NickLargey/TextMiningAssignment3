Little Sheila likes to wag her tail
Snores in church and loves JJ Cale
She rubs my feet all day all night
Oh, she's all mine 

She loves to dance on telephone wires
Juggles balls that are all on fire
She smokes in bed drinking cherry wine
Oh, oh, oh she's all mine
She's all mine 

She loves to sweep the porch in noon
She's so slick and the world so crude
I'm like a miner at the world's greatest find
Oh, oh, oh she's all mine
