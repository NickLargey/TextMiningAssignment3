People run like tired lemmings headed for the sea
Borders of imagination keeping them from seeing things
Ancient guards in greying fortresses of old ideas
Standing guard on treasure that has long since
Disappeared from use

Oh we have got to find something better
Oh people we got to find something better

People run like tired lemmings they don't see the sun
Shadow pictures drive them on and keep them on the run
Knights in blazing armour stand upon a nearby hill
Shafts of gleaming light held high and no one sees them
Still

Oh we have got to find something better
Oh people we got to find something better

Long ago and far away the words ring like a bell
Stories poems books and songs have used these words and
Use them still
Long ago and far away is where most of us dwell
Time has chased us all away and left today under its
Spell

Oh we have got to find something better
Oh people we got to find something better
