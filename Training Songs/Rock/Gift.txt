The door is opening there's a glimmer of light
Keep on pushing it will give tonight
And I don't care if it takes me long
It really doesn't matter if its right or wrong

The fires are burning and its warm inside my soul
As we wander down the road
The gift is mine tonight

Don't care if the mood won't last
And I don't care if it goes slow or fast
The stage is set, the timing's right
Let me lead you to the light
A chance is all there's ever gonna be
It's here let's take a hold
The gift is mine tonight - tonight

The magic look is in your eye
The power to move and satisfy
And the promise that you bring to me
Lifts me up and sets me free.

I've thought of how it could be in the future everyday
I've thought of all the good things in the past
Everyday, every night.
I shouted at the sky but the sky was deaf
I looked into the ashes but the heat had all left
I never dreamed that it could be this way again

The magic look is in your eye
The power to move and satisfy
And the promise that you bring to me
Lifts me up and sets me free.

And I don't care if the cost is great
Stop and think about it, it's too late
The sails are set, the tide has turned
Time to go explore the world
The winds are blowing but its warm inside my soul
As we turn and leave the shore
The gift is mine tonight

The magic look is in your eye
The power to move and satisfy
And the promise that you bring to me
Lifts me up and sets me free.

The magic look is in your eye
The power to move and satisfy
And the promise that you bring to me
Lifts me up and sets me free.
