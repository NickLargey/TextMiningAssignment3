Here we are alone at last 
Face to face with no distractions 
Reaching out each of our separate world 
Everything happened so fast 
What could have been a chain reaction 
Who can say where it might be tonight, oh oh, oh 

This could be our first night together 
Listen to my heart and you`ll know it`s right 
Doesn't it seem there`s a spell falling over us tonight 
This could be our first night together 
If we only follow our heart`s desire 
Waiting like a fire to ignite, could be our first night tonight 

There`s a look you've got in your eyes 
All a glow and so inviting 
Telling me you`re watching my every move 
Why should we wait for a while 
When your touch is so exciting 
Full of fire burning beyond control, oh, oh, oh 

This could be our first night together 
Listen to my heart and you`ll know it`s right 
Doesn't it seem there`s a spell falling over us tonight 
This could be our first night together 
If we only follow our heart`s desire 
Waiting like a fire to ignite, could be our first night tonight 

First night together! 
Listen to my heart and you`ll know it`s right 
Doesn't it seem there`s a spell falling over us tonight 
This could be our first night together 
If we only follow our heart`s desire 
Waiting like a fire to ignite, could be our first night, tonight
