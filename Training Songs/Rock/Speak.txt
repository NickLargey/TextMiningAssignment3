Free, you better love me.
In time, you'll run away, from all your yesterdays!

Speak the truth, or make your peace some other way.
I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me,
Oh, will speak to me.

In way beyond your controlling mind (mind)
And no more believing all your precious lies!

Speak the the truth, or make your peace some other way.
I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me.
Oh, will speak to me.
Speak the the truth, or make your peace some other way.
I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me.
Oh, will speak to me.

Speak the the truth, or make your peace some other way.
I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me.
Oh, will speak to me.
Speak the the truth, or make your peace some other way.
I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me.
Oh, will speak to me.

Speak

Oh, speak

Speak!

Oh, speak

Speak
