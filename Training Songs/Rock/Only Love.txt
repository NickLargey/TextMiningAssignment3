You say that you can't take it anymore
Someone hurt you and so you close the door
Put the lock on your heart and hide the key
Gonna build yourself a wall of stone
Gonna live there inside it all alone
And you say love's the last thing that you need.

But every drop of rain that falls
Makes a flower grow
Don't give up now, don't give up now
Baby, don't you know.

Only love - can leave you twisted inside
Only love - can make you glad you're alive
Only love (hey hey hey) can mend a heart or break it
Only love - can make the tears tumble down
Only love - can turn your whole world around
Only love (hey hey hey) only love, hey hey hey.

So you sacrifice your trusting soul
So you can maintain complete control
When you're cold as ice you can't get burned
There's a chance you'll break each time you fall
But when you lose your faith, you lose it all
And it's gonna get lonely in your world.

But every drop of rain that falls
Makes a flower grow
Don't give up now, don't give up now
Baby, don't you know.

Only love - can leave you twisted inside
Only love - can make you glad you're alive
Only love (hey hey hey) can mend a heart or break it
Only love - you can't keep running away
Only love - you're gonna need it someday
Only love (hey hey hey) don't you know that's what we're here for.

And every drop of rain that falls
Makes a flower grow
Don't give up now, don't give up now
Baby, baby, don''t you know.

Only love - can leave you twisted inside
Only love - can make you glad you're alive
Only love (hey hey hey) only love
Only love - can make the tears tumble down
Only love - can turn your whole world around
Only love (only love) hey hey hey
Can mend your heart (only love) or break it.

Only love - can leave you twisted inside
Only love - can make you glad you're alive
Only love (hey hey hey) can mend a heart or break it
Only love (only love) only love
Only love (hey hey hey) can mend a heart or break it
(Only love) only love.
