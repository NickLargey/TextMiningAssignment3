Don't you hurt me,
Mr. Sun.
Speak to her,
Mr. Rainbow.
And take her under,
Your branches,
Mr. Tree.

Whisper to her,
Mr. Wind.
Sing to her,
Mr. Robin.
And Mrs. Moonlight,
Put in a word,
For me.

Talk to her,
Talk to her...

Tell her how I fear,
Should it end this way,
Since you are all her friends,
She'll listen to what you say.

Tell it to her,
Mr. Moon
Kiss her for me,
Ms. Raindrop.
And watch to see,
They all do,
Please Mr. Sun.

Talk to her...
Please Mr. Sun.
Talk to her...
Mr. Sun!
