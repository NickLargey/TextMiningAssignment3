Raise your hand if you don't care
What those platinum girls wear
Raise your hand if you're just here
To have a good time

Raise your hand if your lipstick
Doesn't make you a dumb chick
Raise your hand if the shape of your hips
Don't compare to the shape of your mind
You don't even stand a chance
I'm not taking off my pants

I'm here to start a one girl revolution
I'm not a barbie doll, shopping mall, silicone substitution
I thought I told ya
I'm a soldier
And I'm not leaving til the battle's over
One girl revolution

Raise your hand if you're smart, girls
More than push ups and pearls
Let 'em stare at our pictures, baby
While we take over the world
Raise your hand if you're not another carbon bopy wannabe like everybody else
Raise your hand if you've got something more to say

I'm here to start a one girl revolution
I'm not a perfect ten, paper thin, Hollywood illusion
I thought I told ya
I'm a soldier
And I'm not leaving til the party's over
One girl revolution

What are we selling, our brains or our belly buttons?
What are you buying, don't you know that they're lying?
What are you cryin' about, 
Don't just sit there and wait while they're selling us out!

You don't even stand a chance
I'm not taking off my pants

I'm here to start a one girl revolution
I'm not the girl next door anymore
Baby I'm an institution
I thought I told ya
Don't wanna know ya
Pack your bags, baby, 'cause this army's taking over
I'm here to start a one girl revolution

I'm the kind of chick that leaves you cryin for your mother
Keep on looking if you're looking for a cookie cutter
