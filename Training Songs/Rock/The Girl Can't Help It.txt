If she walks by the men all stand engrossed
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
If she winks an eye bread slices turn to toast
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
Yes, she's got a lot of what they call the most
She can't help it, the girl can't help it

The girl can't help it if she was born to please
And if she's got a figure made to squeeze
Oh won't you kindly be aware
The girl can't help it

She mesmerizes every mother's son
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
And if she smiles their steak becomes well done
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
She makes grampa feel like twenty-one
She can't help it, the girl can't help it

The girl can't help it if she was born to please
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
And if I go to her on bended knees
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
Oh won't you kindly be aware that I can't help it
Just can't help it
Cause oh, I'm hopin' obviously
That someday the answer will be
The girl can't help it if she's in love with me

She walks by the men all stand in rows
Yes she winks an eye 
Yes she's got a lot of what they call the most

Well, the girl can't help it if she was born to please
And if she's got a figure made to squeeze
Cause oh I'm hopin' obviously
That someday the answer will be
The girl can't help it if she's in love with me
