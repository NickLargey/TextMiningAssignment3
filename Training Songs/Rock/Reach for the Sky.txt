A spark of life--a beat in time
A lonely light that longs to shine
An open road that knows no end
A ray of hope around the bend
You got a dream--you wanna fly
You got an urge you can't deny
Within your heart you found a voice
Is calling you to make your choice

Reach for the sky--reach for the sky
Some men will quiver--some men will cry
Some deliver--and some will reach for the sky

You may be right--you can go wrong
You find the strength to carry on
Run satellite--your star unknown
And chase the light that guides you home
Live for the fight--fight to be free
You're facing down reality
Where others fall, you take your stand
Answer the call--your heart's command

Reach for the sky--reach for the sky
Some men will question--some will deny
Some find answers--and some will reach for the sky

Fight the fight day by day
Sing your song come what may
Race the storm--turn the tide
Some can never be denied

You walk alone through rings of fire
You never lose your one desire
Look for the sight that's hard to see
And know that all is meant to be
You take your dream and make it real
And see the truth it must reveal
And in your heart that truth will shine
Your cause will stand the test of time

Reach for the sky--reach for the sky
Some men will vanish--some will survive
Some go restless--and some will reach for the sky
