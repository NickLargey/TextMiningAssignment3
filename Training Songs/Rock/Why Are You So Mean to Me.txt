You tell mom I'll break your neck
She's already a nervous wreck
I don't smoke it every day
It doesn't hurt me anyway

Why are you so mean to me?
You'll regret it faithfully
Death for you won't embarrass me
Why are you so mean to me?

I remember my first time
It felt like this disgusting slime
I went home and cried a lot
I didn't think that I'd get caught

Why are you so mean to me?
You'll regret it faithfully
Death for you won't embarrass me
Why are you so mean to me?

Why are you so mean to me?
Why are you so mean to me?
Why are you so mean to me?
