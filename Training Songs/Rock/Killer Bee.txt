I don't want no trouble baby
I just wanted you to see
That I can get you much better love
I'll be that bitch she'll never be
I ain't no home-wrecker but you deserve that killer bee honey!

I'll give it up for anything but easy
Let me reply it's got to be me

You can't imagine what I am going through
And all those ladies stop and stare at you

Now come on and get it
Now let's get higher
Because I'm the kind of girl dancing on a thin wire

Walk down here baby
leave it all up to me
while I will make you cry for more
Before you know it you'll be begging me on your knees
Cause I got the fire yeah!

Now come on and get it
Now come on and get it

When it comes to making love
Yeah I'm the one you're looking for
But don't you waste all of your time
Come over here before I'll change my mind

Now come on and get it
Now come on and get it
Now come on and get it

Now come on and get it
I'll take you higher
Yeah I am the kind of girl dancing on a thin wire

Walk down here baby
leave it all up to me
cause I will make you cry for more
Before you know it that you'll be begging me on your knees
Oooh yeah!

Walk down here baby
leave it all up to me
I will make you cry for more
Before you know it you'll be begging me on your knees

Higher, higher, higher!

Ha, ha, ha, ha

Come on and get it
Because I got the fire and you'd put it on me
I'm taking you higher
I'm ready
