Changing strings, 
And banging on things 
A couple of girls from the school 
Would listen to KISS 
(With rockets for fists) 
Acting like saturdays fool 

Learned how to smoke, 
Told dirty jokes 
Talked about loose girls from Rome 
I made out with most of them 
So I raised a toast to them 
Especially now that I'm (old) 

And they're 45 with husbands who don't like their wives 
3 or 4 kids, make enough to survive 
In their paper mill jobs 
While their teen heartthrobs 
Are playing in bands 
Or they're dead 

Can I go back to when 
I was the winner 
Way before the rain came 
And washed away the sinners 
Everyone was something and 
Nothing was done right or wrong 

Smothering the cover of a '69 summer 
Played through a speaker of fuzz 
Nobody knew Bryan Adams wasn't cool 
The TV just told me he was 

Always heard the sound get me out of this town 
Resonating clear on my head 
Chuck ran away with our gear and the drugs 
I'm pretty sure that he's dead 

Or he's 46 and alone, 
Cast the heaviest stone, 
Suburban cover band playing bad to the bone 
In a bath tub of meth 
You can smell your own death 
you know when you can't look the past in the eye 

Can I just go back to when 
I was the winner 
Way before the rain came 
And washed away the sinners 
Everyone was something 
(And I could never do any wrong) 

Went back to the woods 
Where I hid all my goods 
In a rusted out cadillac door 
we all get nostalgic 
And fall for the hat trick 
Of thinking it'll be like before 

Like the football jocks 
Trying to please their pops 
And the stoners aping everything their bad uncles taught 
And the teachers who cared 
More than I ever knew, 
And knew I played clubs 
Let me sleep through school 
And my day job boss 
Who wrote it up as a loss 
But let me leave when i wanted and I never got caught 
Sleeping out on the field 
In the back of my truck 
Breaking into the bars 
Steal the beer and getting fucked 
By a girl twice my age, making minimum wage 
But the tan lines were good 
And she had a good face 
Is this what I've become 
Is this all I've become 
When do I become, 

I want to go back to when 
I was the winner 
Way before the rain came 
And washed away the sinners 
Everyone was someone and 
And I could never do any wrong
