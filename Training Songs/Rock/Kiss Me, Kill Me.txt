One, two, three
A tragedy that's built on destiny
It left you with everything but
Blood from the knife that I cut your heart out with
Now relax, close your eyes, what comes next is the surprise

This valentine is doomed
The smell of blood has filled this room
If I could do it all again
I would change most every single thing

I would let you

Kiss me
Kill me
Your kiss is torture
But killing me would be too easy

Our tragedy
Seems to be killing everything it sees
Like death itself

This valentine still looms
In the darkest hour, the killing moon
If I could do it all again

I would let you

Kiss me
Kill me
Your kiss is torture
But killing me would be too easy

Kiss me (You're all I'm wanting)
Kill me (This feeling's haunting)
Your kiss is torture
But killing me would be too easy

Killing me would be too easy

Your eyes unwind the tragedy of our lives
My eyes went blind
Believe when I say

Hell burns bright
When this night dies

Hell burns bright

Kiss me
Kill me
Your kiss is torture
But killing me would be too easy

Kiss me (You're all I'm wanting)
Kill me (This feeling's haunting)
Your kiss is torture
But killing me would be too easy

Kiss me (You're all I'm wanting)
Kill me (This feeling's haunting)
Your kiss is torture
But killing me would be too easy

Killing me would be too easy

Too easy, too easy, too easy, too easy
