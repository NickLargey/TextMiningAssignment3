Why am I lonely, why do I cry,
Am I gonna be a lonely one till the day that I die?
Yes, you don't be there while I sit here alone,
I can't believe my eyes, you've up and gone

I get so weary, weary and blue,
When I think about the good times that we two once knew
You, you know the reason why I sit here alone,
I can't believe my eyes, you've up and gone.

Once I have you here beside me,
When I had you here beside me I had your love to guide me,
And nothing, no nothing, no nothing, you don't know but from now on.

Lord I get so weary, lonely and blue
When I think about the good times, baby, we once knew.
You, you know the reason why I sit here alone,
I can't believe my yes, you've up and gone

All right babeâ?¦

Once I had you here beside me,
When I had you here beside me,
I had your love to guide me and nothing, no nothing, no nothing could go wrong, yeah

Lord I get so weary, lonely and blue
I keep on remembering little things, baby, that we used to do.
You know the reason you were my lonely one,
I can't believe my eyes, you've up and gone.

I can't believe what I'm seeing babe,
Everything in between me and you
You walked out of my door,
Bye bye babyâ?¦
