You want to mess with Limp Bizkit? (Yeah) 
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit (why?) 
Because we get it on (when?) 
Every day and every night (oh) 
See this platinum thing right here? (uh huh) 
Well we're doing it all the time (what?) 
So you'd better get some better beats 
And uh, get some better rhymes (d'oh!) 
We got the gang set 
So don't complain yet 
24/7 never begging for a raincheck 
Old school soldiers passing up the hot shit 
That rock shit 
And bounce in the mosh pit
