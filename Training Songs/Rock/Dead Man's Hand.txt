You can keep on pushing
But I know you're never gonna fight
You better keep on looking
Cause it's written down in black and white

Seven come eleven, you're rolling snake eyes
Every time you roll the dice
There's some good old blood
I'd help if I could
But don't you know my hands are tied

You got your back to the wall
Should you raise or call?
I wouldn't take that chance
You got the dead man's hand

The light in the tunnel
Is gonna be a rumbling train
Loaded full of trouble
The next stop has got your name

You got a one-way ticket on a dead end track
You take it on down the line
Before you knew what hit ya
You were flat on your back
But you thought that you were doing alright

You got your back to the wall
Should you raise or call?
I wouldn't take that chance
You got the dead man's hand

You stay on top to get a roll
You never stop till you lose it all
Yeah, you were hot but now you're cold
Watch another one take the fall

You gonna keep on talking
Hoping you can justify
Tell your story when you're walking
Cause the wishing well is running dry

You getting highs and lows
And the lady knows you're playing for your life
You're a dead man holding aces and eights
And your luck's fun out this time

You got your back to the wall
Should you raise or call?
I wouldn't take that chance
You got the dead man's hand

You got your back to the wall
Should you raise or call?
I wouldn't take that chance
You got the dead man's hand
