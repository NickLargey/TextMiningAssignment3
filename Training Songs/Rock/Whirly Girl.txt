Let me tell you 'bout the girl I know
She's been to Paris France
And she can dance
Like a spinning top
She's got no stop
She picks you up and then
She lets you drop
Listen

Oooh

Let me tell you 'bout the girl I know
'Cause she's really hip
And she can go go go
Like a straight shooter she's got her downs
Won't hesitate to put you on the ground
She's been with the Rolling Stones
On their tours
And in their homes
Won't tell you where she's bound
'Cause she ain't lost and don't want to be found
But

Oooh, maybe tonight
Yeah, she'll find the time
To give me her phone
So I can call her at home
But she's so whirly

Whirly whirly whirly whirly girl (yeah yeah)
Whirly girl (yeah yeah) whirly girl
Whirly whirly whirly whirly girl
Whirly girl whirly girl

Let me tell you 'bout the girl I know
She's been to Paris France
And she can dance
Like a spinning top
She's got no stop
She picks you up and then
She lets you drop

This girl just combs her hair
And takes her tea
With millionaires
She's sitting in the latest styles
With open legs
And mysterious smiles

Oooh, maybe tonight
Yeah, she'll find the time
To give me her phone
So I can call her at home
Hey

Oooh-oooh

Whirly whirly whirly whirly girl
Whirly girl whirly girl
Whirly whirly whirly whirly girl
Whirly girl whirly girl

Ooo, whirly whirly
Ooo, whirly whirly
Whirly whirly whirly whirly girl
Whirly girl

Watch her go go go
Watch her go go go, oh
Watch her go go go
Watch her go go go, oh
