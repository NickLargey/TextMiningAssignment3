I've come back this morning
To where I first came alive
Here within this terminal
Where the buses arrive

I was a commuter on the 804
Worked for a computer
On the 19th floor and

You came down the aisle of the bus
And you sat by my side
Shoulder up to shoulder
We shared that 9 o'clock ride

Oh my heart was screaming
As you left your seat
Following your movements
I was at your feet and

Oh... down into the terminal
Both of us smiled
So... we entered the terminal
Just as you smiled

"Won't you leave out work for today?"
You asked of me then
So I phoned in sick on the way
To the home of a friend

We were all alone from 10 a.m. till 3
Really thought the fire
Had gone out of me but

You awoke the sleep of my life
From gray into red
Made the weary wonder of Wall Street
Rise from the dead

Could have held up
Budding my entire life
But I had to get home
To the kids and the wife and so

I left for the terminal where I began
Baby no, I wouldn't have left
If I'd been half a man

So here I am this morning
Where love had asked for the dance
Here within this terminal
Where I passed on the chance

Lord I'll never find her
Though I've truly tried
Probably she's found another
Bus to ride and

I am now about to begin
The last of my days
I'm within what others
Would call a terminal phase

I myself can only say it's livin' dead
Riding to the office with
A song in my head that goes...

La da da...
And you know it grows
La da da...
