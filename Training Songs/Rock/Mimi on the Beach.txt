I scan the horizon for you, Mimi
I scan for the both of us
I scan the horizon for you, Mimi
I stand and scan on the strand of sand
I stand and scan on the strand of sand

But first I'm sitting over here
See that giggle of guys and girls
A typical day at the beach
Well, typical 'til I make my speech

There is a girl out on the sea
Floating on a pink surfboard
With a picnic lunch and parasol
Sitting there like a typical girl

Well, this is not a locker room
And that's a surfboard, not a yacht
The arrangement's not quite, quite there

One girl laughs at skinny guys
Someone else points out a queer
Oh, they're all jocks, both guys and girls
Press the button, take your cue

And see the girl with perfect teeth
She picks up lonely guys in bars
Then she takes off when they've bought her drinks
Don't you have money? I ask
Of course I do

This is not a locker room here
And that's a surfboard, not a yacht
The arrangement's not quite, quite there

But the day was faultless in beauty pitched on tropical scenery
Stretched from white sand up to the open sky
Down to the shining sea again and then back to me
And Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach
Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi and me

Well, I'm still sitting over there
One guy just got up and brayed
They wag their words, they're all in heat
Well, I can ignore it, just don't steam up the view

And Mimi's still out on the sea
Floating on a pink surfboard
She's checking out her arms and legs
In case her casing's getting burnt

Well, this is not a locker room here
And that's a surfboard not a yacht
The arrangement's not quite, quite there

But the day was faultless in beauty pitched on tropical scenery
Stretched from white sand up to the open sky
Down to the shining sea again and then back to me
And Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach
Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi and me

You don't know me but I've been watching you all day
And I've come to the edge of the water now to have my say
The picnic lunch is off, Mimi, throw your parasol away
Put your belly to the board, Mimi and paddle out to sea
Then turn the board around, Mimi until you're facing me

Wait for the waves to start building, for the valleys to deepen
And the mountains to increase in height
When the right times comes, Mimi
You lift yourself up and stand there, Mimi
And see as far as you can see
Stand up, Mimi, stand up Mimi, stand up

I scan the horizon for you, Mimi
I scan for the both of us
I scan the horizon for you, Mimi
I stand and scan on the strand of sand
I stand and scan on the strand of sand

The great leveler is coming Mimi
And he's not going to stop to take your pulse
And he's not going to ask you why you're the way you are
And I think that's the worst part
You never get a chance to explain yourself

And he's going to take those mountains
And shove them into the valleys
Till there's nothing left except a vast expanse
And you'll float there, Mimi on the flat Sargasso Sea of your soul

And if they pull you away from your bleaching pink surfboard
And stretch you across the wind, you'll make no sound
Wet leaves on a dry map, nothing, nobody
The great leveler or the great escape?

But the day was faultless in beauty pitched on tropical scenery
Stretched from white sand up to the open sky
Down to the shining sea again and then back to me
And Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach
Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi and me
Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach
Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi and me

There is a girl out on the sea
Floating on a pink surfboard
A parasol floats nearby
The arrangement's not quite, quite there
