This time it's now or never 
The ones we are supposed to bow to 

In time we all crawl 
Believe in 
Believe in me 

In time we all fall 
Through her fingers 

Its alright to hide away underneath the ocean 
Open up the way I have to feel right 

In time we all saw 
Him open up her 

These words won't help you 
If your looking for answers 

Its alright to hide away underneath the ocean 
Open up the way I have to feel right 

She's what I crave
She's what I crave
She's what I crave
