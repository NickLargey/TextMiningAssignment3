Ever since the day you were we born you've been tipping the scales
On your own you try to pull them back, you always fail
Incrimination set by adding weight you can't undo
Your few good deeds will not compare to what you've stacked against you

Tipping the scales with your insolence
Tipping the scales with your greed
Tipping the scales with a wicked heart
That only leads to self destruction

All evil starts inside the heart before others can see
You're weighing down the scales whether or not
Those thoughts come to be
Even if you had the chance to have the scales set even again
You would weigh it all down in just one day from your thoughts within

Tipping the scales with your insolence
Tipping the scales with your greed
Tipping the scales with a wicked heart
That can only be changed if someone takes your blame

A sacrifice
If someone takes your blame
A sacrifice
Someone took your blame
A sacrifice
