Extreme Aggressions
From an extremely insane mind
Resting unconscious
Pushed up by white lines
Inhuman violence
I never thought it would come this far
Sadistic intentions
My greed for blood is growing more
And more
Extreme Aggressions
Seeing you suffer brings pleasure to me
Extreme Aggressions
My aggressions became to extreme to be
Kept under control
Hallucinations
From the darkest part of my brain
I still can't believe it
Am I really insane
I heard your pleading
But no one hears the screams of this soul
Of mine
Extreme Aggressions
Seeing you suffer brings pleasure to me
Extreme Aggressions
My aggressions became too extreme to be
Kept under control
Society, what have you done to me
Society, bring you to your knees
Once before I die
Now that I have lost the will to live
Once before I die
I'll take revenge on those who've led me to
Extreme aggressions
My emotions, twisted by your lies
Extreme aggressions
Condemned my soul to hell for all time
