In the shade of every moment I bled
Such a sorrow was to be expected

I let a good thing go
I let a good thing go

Now every feeling it kicks me to the bone
And takes me under to a place that I have known
There goes my quiet life I used to keep me warm
In the shade of this moment I am born

I let a good thing go
I let a good thing go

In the shade of every moment I bled
Such a sorrow was to be expected

I let a good thing go
I let a good thing go
Good thing go
