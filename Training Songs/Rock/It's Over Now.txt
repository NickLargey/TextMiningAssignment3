Four in the morning, still no call
What am I to think, do I matter at all?
So many things I need to say
But what's the use, your drifting away
I've always thought we could make it through
Nobody knows you like I do
Why don't you just come out and say it

It's over now, there won't be another next time
I can see it in your eyes, I hear it when you talk
you don't have to spell it out baby...

Words are strong, but the eyes never lie
We just see things from two different sides
You tried to hide it, but the words slipped out
Don't say I didn't try
And even in my arms, don't know you anymore
If you only knew how it tears me
Every time you walk out that door

It's over now, there won't be another next time
I can see it in your eyes, I hear it when you talk
you don't have to spell it out baby...you've thrown it away

All you ever give me now are lies and broken promises
You still know how to touch me babe
But your silence speaks the words...yeah

(GUITAR SOLO)

It's over now, there won't be another next time
I can see it in your eyes, I hear it when you talk
you don't have to spell it out baby...
