Starin' out the window like I'm waiting for a change
As if I'd stare long enough, I'd see it when it came
I used the book of numbers by the silent telephone
I called up everyone I found, but didn't talk to no one
And the rain comes down as if it's trying to wash me away
And there ain't no romantic movin' lines, like they say

[Chorus]
Standing alone, like I got nowhere to go
Standing alone, like the day that I was born

Out on my own, I believe this boy has grown, standing alone
Ain't no way to take a blow when every cheek's been turned
I can't show another side when every side's been burned
I'm helpless, can't fight a raging heart

And I got no use for bein' torn apart
And the world don't seem to have no use for me
'Cause you've given nothing, and nothing isn't free

[Chorus]

You can't keep it all inside, I need someone else to stand with me by my side
Give me something to fight, something to hold on to
I just don't want to be standing alone

And the rain comes down as if it's trying to wash me away
And there ain't no romantic movin' lines, like they say

[Chorus: x 2]
