Now your private life
Is in the public domain
And your one true love is just a lipstick stain

And your point of view
Is just a figure of speech
Well I rest my case, you're out of reach

Havin' some fun
Havin' some fun now
Havin' some fun
Havin' some fun now

Well the tough get goin', and the good die young
Maybe you're the only good your mama ever done
But you wouldn't know a good thing if you saw

One, two, three
I'm down on my knees
Four, five, six
Gotta lot to fix
Seven, eight, nine
Goin' outta my mind
And it's a fast free fall
From a long hard climb

Havin' some fun
Havin' some fun now
Havin' some fun
Havin' some fun now

And you wonder how
You ever got it so far
From a mel bay book
Into a long black car

And all along the way
They never made you cry
But they never got the joke
And you don't know why

Havin' some fun
Havin' some fun now
Havin' some fun
Havin' some fun now

The party's over and the war is won
And you know what you're doin'
'cause you know what you've done
But you wouldn't know a good thing if you saw

Havin' some fun
Havin' some fun now
Havin' some fun
Havin' some fun now
