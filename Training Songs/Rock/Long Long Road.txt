In the times too far to view
In the places I once knew
And every footstep that I've taken
Was just one step I took to you

In the strangers passing by
To the castles in my eyes
And in the busy streets and markets
Where I look baby, I look for you

Oh

And I know it's a long long road
That we walk together but as one
There's no longer two
Oh, me and you
When the road gets rough
We gotta pull together
Ooh

When the time no longer sides
There'll be choices I won't decide
And when that times comes
I'll go through it
With what I've learnt baby
From loving you
Oh, ooh

There's so many roads that you can go down
So many lonely lives that can be found
Many lead nowhere
And I had my share
And a lonely life just ain't that good
Yes I know (yes I know, yes I know
It's a long long road
That we walk together
But as one)

Yes I know (yes I know, yes I know)
It's a long long road (it's a long long road)
That we walk together (that we walk together)
But as one (but as one)

Never alone, two (yes I know, yes I know)
Oh, me and you (it's a long, long road)
When the road is long (take a walk together)
Gotta move together

Yes I know (yes I know, yes I know)
It's a long long road
Oh (that we walk together)
Gotta move together. ooh

Yes I know (yes I know, yes I know)
It's a long long road (it's a long long road)
