Keep all the motion
You're bringing along
This time for yourself
And go carry on
Go carry on

Help find me my fiction
In trouble and strife
Cherish a moment
With bunny the wife
Bunny the wife
Bunny the wife
Bunny the wife

Serenades for the lonely
Where trumpets play their part
Metal horns of happiness
Tearing me apart

Leave all emotion
And carry on
Man at the hour
Don't get me wrong
Don't get me wrong
Don't get me wrong
Don't get me wrong

Serenades for the only
Living souls around
Celebrated happiness
A shouting for your love

Serenades for the lonely
Where trumpets play their part
Metal horns of happiness
Tearing me apart
Serenades for the only
Living souls around
Celebrated happiness
A shouting for your love

Baby be out there
Somehow
Baby be out there
