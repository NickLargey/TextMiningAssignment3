You're trying to fool somebody, but you end up fooling you're self
You read from the "book of the dead"* but you don't know what is about
I listened to you now maybe you'll listen to me
You're trying much to hard to make you're world seem like a dream
You're stepping out of something
Yeah, You're stepping out of line
Stop making a movie of it
Oh it's just my style
Stop sitting around and thinking
You're gonna do no good
I thought you're poetry was sometimes good

You're stepping out of something
Sunlight Bathed the Golden Glow
Stop making a movie of it
Stop tellin' the things I know
Stop sitting around and thinking
You're gonna do no good
I thought you're poetry was sometimes good
