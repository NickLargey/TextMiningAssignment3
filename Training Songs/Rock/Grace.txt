I was up all night
dreaming of you
Pretty valentine
Bleeding again from the sole of her shoes
Cause she's got to carry the weight of the truth

Would you take it easy on me
Would you take it easy on me
Would you like to see me crawling
Would it do any good
Good would do if it could

I was up all night drinking of you
We got into a fight
Love always drains the life out of me
But I can't complain
I'm in the deep freeze

Would you take it easy on me
Would you make it easy on me
Would you like to see me crawling
Would it do any good
Good would do if it could
Through the grace of your heart

I'd be alright through the grace of your heart
Sleep through the night through the grace of your heart
Keep me in line through the grace of your heart
Keep me alive through the grace of your heart

I got up alright
Breakfast for two
Pieces of hate all over the room
Your love is a light that leads to my soul
That's melting the wall,
That's drowning me, so

Would you take it easy on me
Could you make it easy on me
Would you like to see me crawling
Would it do any good
Good would do if it could
Through the grace of your heart
The grace of your heart

I'd be alright through the grace of your heart
Sleep through the night through the grace of your heart
Swallow my pride through the grace of your heart
Buried alive through the grace of your heart
Love has no pride
Love has no pride
Grace
