I'll stick to your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
She said five seconds and you're high
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart

Thinking bout the right time
Talk in your head
To be mine
Give you a sign
I don't believe in you
You don't believe in me
So how could you make me cry

Five seconds to your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
There's no way to get iron
Five seconds to your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
Five seconds to your heart s
Traight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
She said five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't to your heart

You keep loosing on
On a stream
Could you feel
When it comes it sounds like
And when it comes we kiss
When it comes it sounds like
And when it comes we kiss

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart
She said five seconds in your heart
I can't get to your heart

That's no way to get it on
Five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart I can't to your heart
I'm not trying to make you cry
I don't believe in you
You don't believe in me
So how could you make me cry

That's no way to get it on
I don't know why
But I'm not trying to make you cry
Five seconds in your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart

That's no way to get it on I don't know why
But I'm not trying to make you cry
Five seconds in your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
Five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart
