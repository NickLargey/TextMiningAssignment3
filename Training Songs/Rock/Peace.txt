When the fog has lifted and the winter's gone
And the songs, they visit and we carry on
And in the light of the day
Gravel will sink, I watch them as they drive away

I didn't even know your name
But I got on my knees and prayed

I just wanna feel peace, please
Throw back the curtain, make me feel certain
And free, released
Take 'way my burden, make me stop hurting me
Please, I just wanna feel peace

The sun, it dances on a landscaped lawn
Our love's gone
The echo of it lingers on
I wanted, oh, to be like it
Was back when we were only kids, ooh
We were only kids

I just wanna feel peace, please (I just wanna feel peace, please)
Throw back the curtain, make me feel certain
And free, released
Take 'way my burden, make me stop hurting me (make me stop hurting me)

I just wanna feel peace, please (I just wanna feel peace, please)
Throw back the curtain, make me feel certain
And free, released
Take 'way my burden, make me stop hurting me (make me stop hurting me)
Please, I just wanna feel peace
