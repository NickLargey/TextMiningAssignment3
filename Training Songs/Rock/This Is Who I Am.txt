How many days will it take for you to understand?
Look into my eyes, this is who I am
Look into my eyes, this is who I am
You know, I cannot do anything about it

People have tried to change me over and over again
It's not for you to choose but that's alright my friend
'Cause I gotta go my own way whatever they say
I should do, keep the faith in me, that I will do
What's right and I show what I got inside

How many days will it take for you to understand?
Look into my eyes, this is who I am
Look into my eyes, this is who I am
You know, I cannot do anything about it

How many days will it take for you to understand?
Look into my eyes, this is who I am
Look into my eyes, this is who I am
You know, I cannot do anything about it

You know, I cannot do anything about it, la, la, la, la

How many days will it take for you to understand?
Look into my eyes, this is who I am
Look into my eyes, this is who I am
You know, I cannot do anything about it
