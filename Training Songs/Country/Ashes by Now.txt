This morning is Monday   
Where are you now?
Teasin' my memory  
Teaching me how to lay low when I don't want to
Your love is elusive this I know now It's making me crazy Leaving me out
In the open  
When I don't want to
I don't know why you do that to me (really low, soft volume) go to lead
The moments of pleasures
Never do last
Are gone like a suitcase full of your past    
Long gone, and in a hurry

Baby, I can't go through this again   
I don't need to go down 
More then I've already been
Just like a wild fire  
You're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby  
I should be ashes by now

The second street beggars alone in they life

Drunk on a sidewalk to hide from the night
Like I am  
They're just like I am

Baby, I can't go through this again   
I don't need to go down 
More then I've already been
Just like a wild fire  
You're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby  
I should be ashes by now

Just like a wild fire  
You're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby  
I should be ashes by now

Aaaaaahh 
Aaaaaahh    
Should be ashes by now
