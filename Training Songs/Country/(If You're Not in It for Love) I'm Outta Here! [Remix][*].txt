One, three, four, five

Mind if I sit down? Can I buy you a round?
Haven't seen your face before? Are you new in town?
It's the same old line, oh, every time
Are you here alone? Can I take you home?

Now every woman stays with every, "Pretty please"
Now there's a pair of lyin' eyes and a set of keys
He says, "Come be a star, in the backseat of my car"
Oh, but baby, slow down, you're goin' way too far

Let me make it clear to you, my dear

If you're not in it for love
If you're not willin' to give it all you got
If you're not in it for life, if you're not in it for love
Let me make it clear to you, my dear, yeah
If you're not in it for love, I'm outta here!

Babe, I can change your world, make you a cover girl
Yeah, you could be a beauty queen in a magazine
Now tell me, what's your sign? Why always the same old line?
I'll be number 409 if you change your mind

Let me make it clear to you, my dear

If you're not in it for love
If you're not willin' to give it all you got
If you're not in it for life, if you're not in it for love
Let me make it clear to you, my dear
If you're not in it for love, I'm outta here!

If you're not in it for love, baby
If you're not willin' to give it all you got
Oh, if you're not in it for life, if you're not in it for love
If you're not in it for life, if you're not in it for love
I'm outta here!
