My sweetheart is gone and I'm so lonely
He said that he and I were through
I started out drinking for pastime
Driving nails in my coffin over you

I'm just driving nails in my coffin
Every time I drink a bottle of booze
I'm just driving nails in my coffin
Driving those nails over you

Ever since the day that we parted
I've been so sad and so blue
I'm always thinking of you, love
And I just can't quit drinking that old booze

I'm just driving nails in my coffin
Every time I drink a bottle of booze
I'm just driving nails in my coffin
Driving those nails over you

You turned me down, you don't want me
There's nothing now I can lose
I'm just driving those nails in my coffin
And worrying, my darling, over you

I'm just driving nails in my coffin
Every time I drink a bottle of booze
I'm just driving nails in my coffin
Driving those nails over you

I'm just driving nails in my coffin
Every time I drink a bottle of booze
I'm just driving nails in my coffin
Driving those nails over you
Yes, I'm driving those nails over you
