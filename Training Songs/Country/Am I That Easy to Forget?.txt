You say you've found somebody new
But that won't stop my love in you
I just can't let you walk away
Forget the love I have for you.

Guess I could find somebody too
But I don't want no one but you
How could you leave without regret
Am I that easy to forget?

Before you leave me sure you find
You want her love much more than mine
Then I'll just say we've never met
If I'm that easy to forget.
