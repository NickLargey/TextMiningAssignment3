Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down, slow it down

Calm down, take it easy, take a break or rest
Before it's too late, take the weight off your chest
Because you're lovin' it too fast, too fast true love
If this is your tempo, let go real fast

'Cause I'm in no hurry to get nowhere
No don't move so fast, take a little more care
'Cause I'm here for your needs, they're always around
So let us take this love of ours and slow it down

(Slow it down)
Yeah, you're movin' too fast
(Slow it down)
Yeah, the longer it lasts
(Slow it down)
Yeah, let you're heart beat with mine
Slow it down
(Ooh, let's take our time)

Hush, ain't no rush
Nothin' can compare to a cold, cold touch
Let the rhythm of our hearts keep the beat
Let the passion and desire fire the heat

'Cause if I love too fast
I ain't gonna last, slow it down is all I ask
'Cause the slower the better, the better the feel
Rock to my rhythm 'cause my rhythm girl is real

(Slow it down)
Ooh, you're movin' too fast
(Slow it down)
Yeah, the longer it lasts
(Slow it down)
Yeah, let you're heart beat with mine
(Slow it down)
Yeah, let's take our time

Sittin' on your bed, in your head you look alone
Oh, let my love inside, my heart become your home
And let your spirit roam in the land of the free
While our vibrations blend, blinded in unity

Where the colors of the rainbow are up there in full flow
Hold on babe, I won't let go, no I'll never let you go

(Slow it down)
Yeah, you're movin' too fast
(Slow it down)
Yeah, if you want it to last
(Slow it down)
Yeah, let you're heart beat with mine
(Slow it down)
Ooh baby, let's take your time

(Slow it down)
Ooh, you're movin' too fast
(Slow it down)
Yeah, if you want it to last
(Slow it down)
Ooh, let you're heart beat with mine
(Slow it down)
Yeah baby, let's take our time

(Slow it down)
Girl, you're movin' too fast
(Slow it down)
Yeah, if you want it to last
(Slow it down)
Yeah, let you're heart beat with mine
(Slow it down)
Ooh baby, let's take your time

Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down, slow it down
