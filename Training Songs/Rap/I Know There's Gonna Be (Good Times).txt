Good times, good times
There's gonna be good times, good times
I know there's gonna be

Worth every date til we meetings
Have to turn it up on weekends
Bust a toast to your real friends
Tell me what you drinkin'

I know there's gonna be good times, there's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times, there's gonna be good

Good times, there's gon' be some good times
Remember we used to pull up and let 'em fight? That's that hood time
Remember when I used to grab on that ass when it was that wood time?
Yeah if that bitch walk up trippin' she get that mush time
I don't waste time, I don't waste time
I don't have patience, baby
She gon' get on top of this dick
And she gon' squish it like squish, then go fast, she Speed Racer
We gon' ball, Walter Payton
She my boss like I'm Prince's son
Come here bae, I'ma listen
I let her write me my suggestions
Pop quiz, it's a pop quiz
All my money comin' clean, you can't pop this
She got that pussy locked up like locksmith
Watch her come to my lights like a reindeer
Me and papi on the same pills
My diamonds could never stand still
Where you goin'? Can you come here?
I'll always take you back for your sex appeal (Good time, hey)

Come have a good time, bust a back wine
Know say you wan' gimme suckle and corn
Me deal with the scene rough like crime
I make ya sing this time

I know there's gonna be good times, there's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times, there's gonna be good

I'ma ride in that pussy like a stroller
I'll survive in a mothafuckin' gutter
That's my mothafuckin' woadie, like the Noila
And I'm comin' red like Coke-Cola
I'ma have a very good time
I swear to God I can't never sound like lil shorty
She say she likes all of her nigga's rhymes
Where is my phone? That pussy callin'
I want you to pass it to Thugger Thugger
Even in the summer time me and lil shawty cuddle
I swear to God [?]
Baby girl sit it down, you not known like an usher
I told lil' mama I don't bite but my teeth do
I wanna control you like voodoo
I'm steady screaming free Unfunk and DuLu
Every time I have a good time you do too (Good time, hey)

Come have a good time, bust a back wine
Know say you wan' gimme suckle and corn
Me deal with the scene rough like crime
I make ya sing this time

I know there's gonna be good times, there's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times, there's gonna be good

I know there's gonna be good times, there's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times, there's gonna be good
