Yeah Yeah Yeah Oww Oww hmm hmm
First time you said that you were leaving
I cried 'cause you said you didn't need me
But the second that I started seeing somebody else
It's when ya had to come back to me 
(Gone) continued movin now I'm better
I moved on
To someone who would treat me better
But now you're tripping 'cause you see I ain't all by myself
And you won't let be me boy

[Chorus:]
Why you gonna call me on my phone?
Every time you see another boy at my door
Oh boy you should've thought of that before
And now you want to come home 
And you're alone 
It's the same ol' same ol' sad scenario
Every time you say you want to be so low
Oh boy you should've never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know its the same ol' same ol'

Ooohhhh
You thought that you could keep on dreaming
This too you think that I won't keep on moving 
I admit it for a minute 
You was having your way
What can I say?
I wasn't over you (oh no)
Things change You and me 
Best forget it(no no babe)
No more playing i admit it
Don't you get it boy 
You take it back tryin to say like it was yesterday? 
But boy 
But you never really ever cared about me
Cause if you ever really cared about me
Then it wouldn't take another man 
To make you understand
That you want me (oh)
Cause if you really ever cared about me
You wouldn't ever broken my heart, left me
And now you want to come back and call me up

[Chorus]

I told you (I told you)
I'd leave (you know I told you)
(I told you I would leave you)
Next time (and it's the last time boy)
Boy boy boy you were told lets get it on
It's the same ol' same ol' same ol' same ol'
Boy boy boy you were told let's get it on 
It's the same ol' same ol' same ol' same ol'

[Chorus x3]
