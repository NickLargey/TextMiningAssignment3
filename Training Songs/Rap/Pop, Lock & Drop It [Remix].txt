H-U-E-Y (remix)
Bow Weezy
T-Pain
Hitz Committee

It's H-U-E-Y, home fly G five
And by the look in my eyes she have nice thighs
But her mama done gave her then grew from local to major
My pockets full of paper, born as a Missouri stater
Mami gon take it low if you can then touch your toes
You and your partna them, you can get dollas then
Trickin' ain't in my blood, but I'ma make it rain
I'm too rich for dolla bills, I consider that as change
Twenty five's on my range, I know that that's a odd number
The way you tootin' that thang can make the guys wonder
What's underneath or even if it's real
I'm hoping she a freak cause I ain't tryna chill
I'm tryna get it poppin, with a shortie like mine
That's willing to drop it low enough to blow my mind
It's H.U.E.Z. and Bow Weezy
Let's see if she can get lower than before on the remix

Toot that thang up mami make it roll
Once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock drop it for me maybe we can roll (oh)

Pop lock and drop it (8x)

Damn lil mama I'm sayin'

Aye, aye, let me holla at you for a minute

Hey what it is they call me Bow Wizzle

She moves her hips just like Shakira
If she was in a contest she would be the winner (yep)
From Ohio all the way to St. Louis, hey all the girls do it just put your back into it
Now shake what she gave you, I'm talking bout ya mama
If you wont do it for me then do it for these dollas
Cause I'ma make it rain, these other dudes is lame
They talk a good game, but they can't do the same
Now drop it up and down, now take it to the ground
If you wanna please me baby all you gotta do is
Pop, lock, and drop it

But baby don't stop it, we can do it like Chris Brown girl and get it poppin'
Man I'm a pro, look I'm far from a rookie
Girl get your pretty self over here gimme them cookies

Toot that thang up mami make it roll
