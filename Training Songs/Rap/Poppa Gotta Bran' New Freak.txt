[ VERSE 1: Baby Beesh ]
It's Baby Beesh, now you can call me Poppa Poppa
I got a brand new freak, and man, I'd say she proper
And it's all tremendously good and great, glorious
Smooth sailing and victorious
And about the old one, I had to fly the coop
Cause when you hunger for the loot, bitch, you get the boot
Size 10 to the chinny-chin-chin-a
And like that I had to do-koo-kin ya
So get ghost, adios, hit the roses
You been waved, my peace of mind has been saved
By the new freak and she's lovin this Latino
Showin off, lettin me know
Sexin is spectacular
I starts on the bottom, but ends up in the back of her
Hittin them, gettin them nice and juice
Young Beesh in the house from Potna Deuce
Yeah, and no stress in the love nest
Cool - cause baby doll keeps revenue level-headed
That's so thick as I speak
And poppa got a brand new freak
Now let me speak to ya...

[ CHORUS ]
 
[ VERSE 2: Rube ]
Poppa got a brand new freaky deak
You see, all my young potnas want to sneak a peek
Cause she got the cool grill with the cool trunk
That be hittin like Pippen on the alley hoop dunk
Last freak wasn't meant for poppa
She was fickle and predictable like a soap opera
Had to stop her in the tracks from makin me go savage
Let the hoe go, now Rube is blowin so lavish
I thought you knew, freak 2 is so righteous
Put her on the top of my list of my pipe bust
I might just open a bottle of ??why-Zippendale??
Show my new thang how poppa is livin swell
Put her in a spell, take her to the motel
It's all good, but I kicks down no mail
Cause I got no loose change and no time for games
Ain't nothin here ever strange, mang
Cause poppa's on top of thangs

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Chezski ]
Poppa got a brand new freak - like that?
And I been tappin that ass every since last weak
Like an animal, love that I'm villainous
Illinous, Chezski's the chillinest
Is out there mobbin for the folks squabbin
y'all don't understand about the Hillside hound hoggin
I creeps up on the proper for they want some of
The gut-runnin killer, call me beaver hunter
And smash up on the guts from the back porch
Give em that tropical vibe from the hot torch
And play the game dirty with my knuckles in it
Freaky little somethin, here I come for the late visit
(Wait a minute, man, you know I can't flex)
Unless I'm throwin on somethin cool that protects
And swing like a swinger really oughts to
And poppa got a brand new freak like I was taught to

[ CHORUS ]
