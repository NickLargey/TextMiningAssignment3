Money can't buy ya
Money can't buy ya
Money can't buy ya Honeyz

You'd better believe I'll stand my ground
Boy, I won't take it lying down

You'd better believe I'll stand my ground
Boy, I won't take it lying down

You keep acting strange whenever she's around
You're headed for danger, let there be no doubt
Sneaking round here late, creeping out the house
Honey, my suspicion is the only thing
Gonna be getting aroused

Boy, I won't take it lying down
Find you've been messing around
You'd better believe I'll stand my ground
Boy, I won't take it lying down
I'm gonna give it to you direct
Boy, don't give me no disrespect
You'd better believe I'll stand my ground
Boy, I won't take it lying down

Said the sweetest things, caught me off my guard
Promised me a diamond ring
Said he'd put it on his platinum card
How was I to know he was hitting on my best friend
Telling me then telling her the same sweet lies
Over and over again

When you gonna wake up (wake up)
When you gonna wake up to reality
(You ain't getting nothing from me, oh, no)
When you gonna wake up (wake up)
When you gonna wake up to reality
(Uh, gonna make a scene, gonna make a scene)
Money can't buy you Honeyz

Boy, I won't take it lying down
Find you've been messing around
You'd better believe I'll stand my ground
Boy, I won't take it lying down
I'm gonna give it to you direct
Boy, don't give me no disrespect
You'd better believe I'll stand my ground
Boy, I won't take it lying down

There ain't no smoke without fire
That boy's a natural liar
You'd better believe I'll stand my ground (hey, yeah)
Boy, I won't take it lying down
He'll tell you whatever you want to hear
And when he's done he'll disappear
You'd better believe I'll stand my ground
(Better believe it)
Boy, I won't take it lying down

You keep acting strange whenever she's around
You're headed for danger, let there be no doubt
Sneaking around here late, creeping out the house
Honey, my suspicion is the only thing
Gonna be getting aroused

Honeyz, money can't buy ya
Boy, I won't take it lying down
Find you've been messing around
You'd better believe I'll stand my ground (hey)
Boy, I won't take it lying down
I'm gonna give it to you direct
Boy, don't give me no disrespect
You'd better believe I'll stand my ground (hey)
Boy, I won't take it lying down

There ain't no smoke without fire
That boy's a natural liar
You'd better believe I'll stand my ground
Boy, I won't take it lying down
He'll tell you whatever you want to hear
And when he's done he'll disappear
You'd better believe I'll stand my ground (more lying)
Boy, I won't take it lying down (no, no, no, no, no, no, no)..
