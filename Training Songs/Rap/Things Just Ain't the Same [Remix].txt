I saw you the other day
And I almost lost my mind
I remember the things we did
I can't believe it's a waste of time

And sometimes I want to cry
And sometimes I want to die
Please help me understand
Why can't my heart just lie

Things just ain't the same
He could never be you
You should know the pain I feel
Understand what I'm going through

I'm still in love with you
And I know that you feel it too
But I feel that I can't go on
I just want you to come back home

I'm so ashamed of me
My heart is not complete
I know you walked away
My heart wants you to stay

Things just ain't the same
He could never be you
You should know the pain I feel
Understand what I'm going through

The water's in my eyes
Can't hide what I feel inside
I said the tears keep falling down
I can feel it when you're not around

I've lost control of me
Yet your love's a shame to see
I just cannot help myself
I don't want nobody else
