I'm so sorry, baby
I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me

Tears I see drop from your eyes
Tell me why you cry
Guilt I feel when you look at me
Did I let you down

Girl, you see that I
I apologize
Tell me what to do
To get through to you

Girl, it's not the same
I know I was to blame
Just tell me when will I
See you smile again

Tell me when will I see you smile again
'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar

Tell me when will I see you smile again
'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar

Promises I know I made many times before
And I broke each one of them
But I had to learn over and over again
Don't hurt the one you love

Girl, you see that I
I apologize
Tell me what to do
To get through to you

Girl, it's not the same
I know I was to blame
Just tell me when will I
See you smile again

Tell me when will I see you smile again
'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar

Tell me when will I see you smile again
'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar

Look, baby
Listen
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
You see, I just can't understand
Why I keep making this same kind of mistake
Over and over again
But there's one question that remains in the back of my mind now
And that is
When will I see you smile again

Tell me when will I see you smile again (maybe we can talk it over)
'Cause I know I messed up, baby (maybe we can work it out)
And I know you're fed up, sugar

Tell me when will I see you smile again
'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar (is there something I can do)

Tell me when will I see you smile again
'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar

Tell me when will I see you smile again
