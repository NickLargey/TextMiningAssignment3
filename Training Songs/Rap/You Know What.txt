I, I got something to tell ya girl
I got something that I wanna do (come on)
I, I got something to tell ya, I wanna you know what, you know what

I been looking for you for a long damn time
But you been gone away I nearly lost my mind
And now we're in the club and you're grindin on me
Touchin' on me, got me goin' crazy
That skirt you wearin' got a playa on swoll
As I glance at my watch I see the night is growin' old

I start to reminse about when we were shorties, back seat of my jeep, yes I'm feelin horny
As I play my position posted up on the wall (yeah)
Happy to hear the DJ say last call (last call)
'Cause what that means is we about to leave and I'm about to be all up on you and you up on me

'Cause I want you in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub
And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste
And when it's all said and done I'm gonna you know what, you know what
'Cause I want you
In the middle of the night I'm gonna rub you
And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste you
And if it's all said and done I'm gonna you know what, you know what

It's hard to keep in touch when you're off in school
But now you're right here we can do what we do
Start in the car and end up in the livin' room
Kiss around your navel while you're on the end table
Pushed the magazines down on the floor, I'm your soldier so I'm ready to go to war

And you told me you're hot and you're ready
Legs won't stop shakin', just give it to me daddy
And I like the way your body's lookin' right there
Knowin' we might not even make it upstairs
And what that means is just relax your mind and baby let it flow
It's goin' down and that's for sho

'Cause I want you in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub
And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste
And when it's all said and done I'm gonna you know what, you know what
'Cause I want you
In the middle of the night I'm gonna rub you
And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste you
And when it's all said and done I'm gonna you know what, you know what

Get fresh off the G.Fo, need no intro
Weezy baby nympho
Him so, gentle with it, still got mami's limpo
Little woody put his thang down like Mutumbo
Young dude, rich, smart, humble
Got something down low to make your walls crumble
Not rough though, slowmo, promo
We could go video, uh uh true that's right
Nasty that's all in me, how he rappin' got women like he R and B
What you know about your legs in the air, with your head in the chair and my hands in your hair
We could go there if what I'm sayin' sounds fair
Don't trip, I kiss every lip, don't flip
Flip up the doors on the out-of-country whip
I could take you out of this world, baby let's dip

'Cause I want you in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub
And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste
And when it's all said and done I'm gonna you know what, you know what
'Cause I want you
In the middle of the night I'm gonna rub you
And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste you
And when it's all said and done I'm gonna you know what, you know what

This is another one of those
Soul, soul, def
