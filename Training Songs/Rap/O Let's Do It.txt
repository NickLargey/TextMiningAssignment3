I fucked my money up, damn
Now I can't re-up
Ran off in his spot just to get stacks up
Now I'm back on deck,
So shawty what the f*ck you want
Heard he talkin' shit 
But this ain't what the f*ck he want
Locked my C.E.O. up
Now it's back to coka
Niggas talkin shit bruh, 
Hang him by a ropa
Hit 'em wit' the choppa
Call that shit hot lama
Call me waka flocka a.k.a. young wild nigga
A.k.a. young drug dealer
Got purp, got kush, got pills got white
In the trap all night with the hard and the soft
Stacks on the flo' watch girls keepin' it whippin'
Shook it to the left then he shook it to the right
So icy brick boys got it all night
These lame ass niggas ain't got no fight
Kick in my door we gon' shoot out all night
Home of he Braves shawty shoot 'em wit' a K

[Chorus: x2]
Yeah, O' lets do it
Ay
O lets do it
Ay
O' lets do it
Yeah, drug dealin' music
Ay

Ay

One shot man down
His brains go ka-pow
Ow, that shit hurt
So don't f*ck around
But that happen often off in Riverdale Georgia
You gone pay the life you live off in Riverdale Georgia
They gone lay yo ass out rock you to sleep like a baby
Hit squad shawty in the hood we got them babies
Ever since they killed my nigga 
Travis start poppin' pills and actin' crazy
Ever since they killed my nigga 
Travis start poppin' pills and actin' crazy

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, Flocka said lets do it
And this real money, so we getting to it
And yo bitch, she choosin', 
But if you ain't talking dollars, keep it moving
Catch me on the south, with Flocka Flame
And we got a problem if you saying Wocka lame
Cause we off the chain, you see my green flash
You wont beef O' lets do it, cause you ain't bad
Happenin' music, is for the drug dealers
Happenin' music, influence thug niggas
Okay, so if you gettin' to it
Ay, o' lets do it, ay o' lets do it

[Chorus: x2]
