[Featuring GangStarr] 
[Chorus] 
I've lost my ignroance and don't know where to find it 
so I search (search) furiously 
I've lost my ignroance and don't know where to find it 
yet I search (search) furiously 
stop this and lock this in your trophy case 
cause this one is built for the whole human race 
was INI the only one to experiment 
was the noise I organized ignorant (no) 
what is it then it must have been the pen 
or the vibes I send or the time that I spend 
thinking and sinking into the sink 
don't try to swallow this because it's too much to drink 
because 
[Chorus] 
but why do you search for ignorance (I don't) 
you can be a dummy Mr. Will (I won't) 
what is it that you seek then 
soul in the hip 
getto is the grip so the beat won't slip 
or slide or do a dive into an ocean of lyrical audio 
and here's a plate of video 
I search and disperse so verse rehearsal is universal 
like nova is nobel when I am flowing over ruffell and boulder 
I admit my style and wit is a homicidal tool 
I'm seeking knowledge like a student in school 
[Chorus] 
we don't know 
we don't know 
we don't 
(repeat 7x) 
I venture through darkness with power eclipse 
soul for my guidance my conscence equipped 
opens my thought my neighborhood compels me 
the contract swells the head 
I feed on my own so here we go into a cool down 
the fool found a sound but there's not enough to go around 
so we searchers and searchers we searches in ignorance 
the outcome of distortion is the evidence 
pre-dominant pre-dominance is how I stand 
phenomenon one phenomenon two (come come) 
I seek and I prosper my journey is endless 
keen is my eye sight analyze 
reality fantasy fantasize 
[Chorus]
