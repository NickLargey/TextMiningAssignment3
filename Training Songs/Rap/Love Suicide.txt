Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide

Ah, love suicide is killing me,
You’re getting into my head like a guillotine,
You’ve got me grasping for air in your
And now you’re saying some things
That you don’t really mean, that’s really mean,
How the hell I’m cut up between?
I forgot, trying not to intervene,
Putting up a fight like it ain’t a thing to me!
I swear it’s gotta be the worst position to be in, be in,
I guess you thought like you’ve been ignored,
And the ? turning to a jigsaw,
Cause when you’re down you gotta let
And we just can’t seem to find time to sit and talk,
I know she is in shock!
Ah, what happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house,
And everything becomes so cold,
Baby, that’s the only thing I wanna know!

Tell me the reason why
You commit a love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose
I'm all out of tears
Tell me get outta here
You made it very clear

You did it on purpose
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide

I feel like I’m about to break down,
Why you’re acting like kid up on the playground?
If you gonna sat on your mind, why don’t you let it out?
So the end of us is coming any day now, any day!
I thought we’d never separate,
I could be the.. but no defeated on the…
You know is probably for the best, anyway,
Cause my suspicions now…
What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house,
And everything becomes so cold,
Baby, that’s the only thing I wanna know!

Tell me the reason why
You committed a love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose
I'm all out of tears
Time to get outta here
You made it very clear

You did it on purpose, purpose
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Why would you hurt us?
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide

Does it make you happy to see me down?
Does it make your day to see me drown?
I guess I'm your entertainment
You don't know what you wasted
But soon you will see!

What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house,
And everything becomes so cold,
Baby, that’s the only thing I wanna know!

Tell me the reason why
You committed a love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose!
I'm all out of tears
Time to get outta here
You made it very clear

You did it on purpose, purpose!
You did it on purpose, purpose!
You made me feel worthless, worthless
Why would you hurt us, hurt us!
You did it on purpose, purpose!
You did it on purpose, purpose!
You made me feel worthless, worthless
Why would you hurt us, hurt us!

What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house,
And everything becomes so cold!
