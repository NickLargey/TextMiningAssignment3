I am the man who will fight for your honour
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of
We'll live forever, knowin' together
That we did it all for this ghetto ghetto love

I take back everything I said it don't mean nothing
Just a fight we had so many though
A ghetto love
I tell you that you gotta let me visit my son
But then you tell me no
A ghetto love
But shawty I can't take my eyes away
Even though we can't get along today
I made a promise to you that faithful day
So I say

I am the man who will fight for your honour
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of
We'll live forever, knowin' together
That we did it all for this ghetto ghetto love

I'm lookin' at this sexy girl from a distance
She's so damn style I'm a witness
Let me tell ya whoa
Move that thing ya whoa
Let me tell ya
And then I take her to the parking lot
Jump into my car and straight to my spot say whoa
Then she started a fight as we stepped out the club
Only cause a fan trying give me a little hug
So I say

I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of
We'll live forever, knowin' together
That we did it all for this ghetto ghetto love

Everybody say now
Ghetto for the ghetto for the ghetto ghetto love
Everybody say now
Ghetto for the ghetto for this ghetto love

I can't think straight when I'm on her ghetto love
With a ghetto girl, every day's a fight now
We get to war, I gotta get away while the getting is good
And get top and gone, lemme think like I know I should
But a real woman needs a little bit more than wood
She expects that from me cause she know I would
Do anything, anywhere, every time for my shorty
Even though we bicker I came right back to get her
Pull her close 'till her body says hello
This is the Kardinal and Mister Wolf Ghetto Love

I am the man who will fight for your honour
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of
We'll live forever, knowin' together
That we did it all for this ghetto ghetto love

Everybody say now
Ghetto for the ghetto for the ghetto ghetto love
Everybody say now
Ghetto for the ghetto for the ghetto ghetto love

And I'll fight for you until the end of time
Everybody say now
Ghetto for the ghetto
For this ghetto love
