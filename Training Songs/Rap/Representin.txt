Luda, yeah you representin' for bad bitches all around the world
The way you put it down in between the sheets is like no other girl
You done take it a whole another level of freakiness When you blow my mind
To the point where all these other women kinda feelin' like you stole their shine
So I better come with it
Ha, and I better come split it
And I admit that I'm feeling a little pressure, when you're telling me I better come get it
Ha but I'm the man for the job
Can't nobody do it quite like I do
And the same go for you, we a match made in heaven, I'ma stand right by you

Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey

You're incredible, edible, unforgettable
Body is so angelical, a rebel with a cause
Speaking in hypotheticals
Could I marry you if I wanted to I'll take you how you coming
Just learn to live with your flaws
Even though it's not that many
You give me that good and plenty And I walk around all day grinin'
My mind and body are gone
That JJ so so sublime
Throw it in the air and turn it to sunshine, you make me wanna call the crib
And say I'm never coming home
