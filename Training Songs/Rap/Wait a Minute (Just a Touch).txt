[Chorus]
Wait a minute, wait wait wait a minute, wait wait wait a minute, wait wait wait a minute.
Wait wait wait a minute, wait wait wait a minute, wait wait wait a minute.
Let me just wait a minute, let me just wait a minute, wait wait wait a minute.
Let me just wait a minute, wait wait wait.

Just a touch, we can take our time you ain't got to rush you know,
Just a touch, if you wait a minute we'll do all that stuff you know,
Just a touch, baby boy let's make it special, 
I'm a have it my way, right now you get just one touch.

My loves so professional, just because were kissin' don't mean were undressin', no.
You ain't creepin' and suggestin' those freaky little things we could do cause the answers no.
Baby I got let you know, if and when the time comes for me and you sex is slow.
Wrap it up cause I ain't carryin' your embryo, 
Your starin' at a women that would slap your arse to the fall.
You say I ain't right but you keep comin back cause this girl is tight,
You ain't spendin the night, uh uh after were done here it's back to the wife.
Yeah I know it feels so nice, swing by for some love and that
It's so special all you get to get is just a touch.

[Chorus]

My loves on overload, don't mean to boast but a kiss would make you overdose.
Hold me tight, hold me close, turn out the lights, knock you out, boy your comatosed
Boy your rockin' with the most, Estelle take you on a ride like a rollercoaster.
I heat it up like a toaster, boy bring your body over, I know what to do,
Lay it down put the zoom zoom on you, you tryna play it cool,
You know you want it true like a baby do, come on, boy am through with you,
Get your shoes on cause am using you because it's so special all you get to get is just a touch.

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
