Some of them men think
They freak this like we do
But no they don't
Make your check come at they neck
Disrespect us no they won't

Boy don't even try to touch this
Boy this beat is crazy
This is how they made me
Houston Texas baby

This goes out to all my girls
That's in the club rocking the latest
Who will buy it for themselves
And get more money later

I think I need a barber
None of these niggas can fight me
I'm so good with this,
I remind you I'm so hood with this

Boy I'm just playing
Come here baby
Hope you still like me
"F" you pay me

My persuasion can build a nation
Endless power
Our love we can devour
You'll do anything for me

DJ don't be scared
To run this,
Run this back

I'm repping for the girls
Who taking over the world
Have me raise a glass
For the college grads

Anyone rolling
I'll let you know
What time it is, check
You can't hold me

I wrote my 9 to 5
Gotta cop my cheque
This goes out to all
The women getting it in

Get on your grind
To the other men
That respect what I do
Please accept my shine

Boy you know you love it
How we're smart enough
To make these millions
Strong enough to bare the children

Then get back to business
See, you better not play me
Don't come here baby
Hope you still like me
"F" you pay me

My persuasion can build a nation
Endless power
Our love we can devour
You'll do anything for me
