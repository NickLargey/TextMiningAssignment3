Hey, yo, check the verse

Last night I thought to back
When we made good love
Listenin' to some Marvin Gaye
All night long

Now I want that old flame back
Make these moments once again comfort
So won't you, won't you, mmm
Do it for us, babe

Good lovin', body rockin', knockin' boots all night long, yeah
Makin' love until we tire to the break of dawn
But oh, come on, come on and turn the lights down, and let me get on it, yeah
‘Cause when I do, just me and you, it'll be so right

A-give me some good love

To makin' love to you, baby
All night long, baby, all night long, long, long, long
