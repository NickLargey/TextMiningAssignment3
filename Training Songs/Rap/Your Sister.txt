featuring Too $hort 

You know what? 
I'm 'bout to tell you some shit  that's gon' f*ck you up 
That's real  why' ain't gon' like it 
Well  shit 
F*ck  that's the way it is  check it out 

Verse 1: TQ 

I like to think back to when we spent the weekend 
In Cabo baby  your sister's boyfriend started trippin' 
And left her lonely 
After you went to sleep   I spent the night out on the beach 
Laid up on her body - how could I keep from hittin'? 
And every time I came to your house 
She always kissed me in the mouth 
Always stickin' her tongue out when you wasn't lookin' 
I want to f*ck you sister 

Chorus: TQ 

Now we been messin' round a long long time 
But now I want to f*ck your sister 
And I know it sounds foul but that's alright 
Cause why should I have to bullshit ya' 
(play wit' ya) 
I can't help it if she's the one that's on my mind 
Everytime I'm out wit cha 
I know we messed around a long long time 
But now I want to f*ck your sister 

Verse 2: TQ 

She comes to greet me when I ring your door bell 
Lookin' like cavvy 
She stands behind you in the kitchen - staring at me 
I like to see her when she's getting out the shower 
All the things she used to tell me when you wasn't listening 
Now the bridge is gonna get cha 

Bridge: TQ 

Ain't no need for us to stop messin' around 
I just want to hit it for an hour when she get out the shower 
On the sink guaranteed not to make a sound 
And you know you shouldn't have to be getting' mad at me 
I can't help if I want that ass badly 
So in the middle of the day when nobody else is around 
I'll be fucking your sister 

Verse 3: Too $hort (starts rapping during verse 2) 

It's time to wake up, control my own destiny 
Can't let my addiction to her get the best of me 
I ain't givin' up 
And I'll never stop tryin' live it up 
Cause there ain't no reason to be lyin' 
So you might as well let you know 
It's goin' down 
You wasting time asking me when, where or how? 
It's a mutual thing between me and your sister 
How you gon' feel when you seeing me kiss her 
Ever since she was young, I knew I would get her 
Waiting this long to f*ck can only make it better 
It's like way back when I was tryin' to get wit' cha 
I'm tryin' to keep it real girl, I ain't tryin' to bullshit ya 
be	-ITCH!!! 

Too seezy up in this motherfucker 
Representing all the way from East Oakland 
California style 

Chorus: TQ 

I wait until you go to sleep 
Then I get a little ass for me 

Chorus: TQ
