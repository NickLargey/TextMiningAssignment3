You taking cheap shots,its subliminal
I'm dissin you straight up
Wrinkle your face up 
Actin like you can't feel me yo
This is pay back, smash your single and your video
Put the tek to your neck and force a story out of ya
Snuffed your producer and drop-kicked your choreographer  (Hwa!)
Honeys scream "Wha?!"
We they see me jumpin out the money green truck
Into the club, so we can tear it up
Like the 3-6 "Sippin on sum syrup"
And mozarella sticks for dessert
I make beats like presto!
Platinum hits like this grow
Bustin shots in your projecto

Pump a lil wieght so I'm not frail

Eyes blood shine from puffin that green
Stay amped up  without the caffiene

Brush your, brush your breath wit Dentene
Rock my blue jeans like Bruce Springstien
Bitches on my dick, its just a small thing

Corona niggaz don't play, atleast me niggaz
Gun tottin maniacs wit the rotten liverz
Holdin it down, blowin it down
