I'm just a bachelor, I'm looking for a partner
Someone who knows how to ride without even falling off
They gotta be compatible, yeah, that takes me to my limits

And girl, when I break you off
I promise that you won't wanna get off

If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it

Sitting here flossin' and peepin' your steelo
And just once if I have the chance
The things that I would do to you
You and your body, every single portion
Send chills up and down your spine
Juices flowing down your thigh

If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it

I'm in a drop top 'Rari with a horse on it
You know that this the heat, you hear my voice on it
The Rollie on my wrist, it cost a Porsche, don't it?
And I'ma let you get this dick, just give me one moment
One night only, I'll never leave you lonely
And baby, you can call me, but only when you're horny
Pull up in the evening, then f*ck you 'til the morning
And we don't need no reason, just call me when you need me
I'm the King, don't play for Cleveland
I'll bless you like you're sneezing
Gucci Mane so freaky, I'll f*ck you while you're bleeding
Tricking, not deceiving, and I'm tricking like I'm treating
I love it when she tease me, but hate it when she leaving

If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
My pony

If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
