Bandana tied in front, on some thug shit
People givin me props; LOVE IS LOVE KID!
I live the life most teens dream about
A record deal - got mad guns cream n clout
Always packin my bags, bein out
If only my grand-ma-ma could see me now! (I miss you)
I'm the bomb, the man with crazy plans
My wordplay, make you Flip Modes like Baby Sham
A hardcore nigga for life with shady scams
want to do a song? One verse cost 80 grand!
I cock a glock like Funk Docta Spock
and I represent Roc-a-Blok DAILY
Let me ask my people in the back;
let me know, can you feel me?
Go for mine like Malik Sealy - REALLY!
Pace Won make the place jump, like aerobics
Like E-Dub I stay "Focused" - HUH!
No role models in the world livin right so I show kids
why'all sing the hook while I roll this - YO!

Made my debut with The Fugees, now I'm looney
Money hungry self-centered nigga actin MOODY
Got a +Wild Style+ like the movie, pack a toolie
Spend hundreds on herb, give the singles to my CUTIE
Bulletproof hats for the cats that want to shoot me
Hangin on my block with Big L, Cease and MOONEY
Huffin on a loosie, me and Jenz two deep
(YO YO YO - WHAT? HUH!) Hoodrat hoes be actin GOOFY
Sunburnt skin and white lips like a mooley
Rappers need to think if they really want to MOVE ME
