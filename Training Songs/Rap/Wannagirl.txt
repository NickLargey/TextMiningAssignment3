OK, roll the drums! 
I want to girl, I want to girl who always has the time, To send my world and count 
The stars above, I want to girl, I want to girl, who still believes in love, 
Someone 
Who's sensitive enough... 

I want to girl, oh, I want to girl that I can really trust, I want to girl, a girl 
That's patient 
And who'll love me when it's rough.. I want to girl, I want to girl as smart as 
She'is fine, Someone that I can say is mine.. 

This girl I'm describing, really does exist, baby have you noticed.. 

[Chorus:]
I want to girl like you, To be with me tonight, I want to kiss your lips, 
And hold you close if that's alright, I want to girl like you, to keep the feelin 
New, I want make the words to say the most...I LOVE YOU, And your love is all I 
Ever need... 

I want to girl, a girl who makes me laugh, I want her sentimental, and to be my 
Better half, ah yeah, I want to girl like the my father loves, If that's the one 
I'm dreaming of.. 

Only one girl lives up to what's on my list, So you need to know this.. 

Repeat [Chorus:]
This should be play at high volume, preferably in a residential area 

[RAP:] 
I want to girl if that's alright
I want to girl to hold me tight
I want you baby (if that's alright with you)
I want to girl just like you
I want to girl who makes me do...
Do anything she wants me to (if that's alright with you)

I want to girl that's patient
I want to girl that's kind
I just want you baby if that's alright with you
I want to girl who loves me
Who always has the time
I just need you baby if that's alright with you

Repeat [Chorus:]
