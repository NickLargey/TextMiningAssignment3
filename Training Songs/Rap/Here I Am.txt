I got a bunch of dollars I can spend them on her
'Cause she can be my lady she can be my lover
Call me on the late night get right he ain't acting right
Every super woman needs a super man, here I am

Sight seeing we might be in the Codra port
or that new white BM
Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face,
Next semester she transfer to Florida State
Cooking like home-etch for financial aid.
I highly doubt she has problems with financial aid, remember
meantime my finance is straight
I even open up the doors to the panantial states Boss
She used to fight with her moms till I sat em both down
Now she's tight with her moms (what?)
Yeah I put the ice on her arm,
Now she know she getting sliced spending nights in Milan (yeah)
We still blow weed together cheated on her but we still gone be together
With the house on the water hit the beach whenever
She's from the north and still can't believe there whether Boss

I got a bunch of dollars I can spend them on her
'Cause she can be my lady she can be my lover
Call me on the late night get right he ain't acting right

The previous was a test for ya, now you in the big leagues
A black Steinbrenner who wouldn't wanna play for me?
Ya last man was a chump and you can tell him I said it
He was talking a lot at first, but you can see that dead it
You can see I ain't sweat it,
Hell I'll even call him my self and tell him I dead it nah
Please don't confuse me miss
I'm tryna see if I could put you on my Christmas list
I hope you ain't offended by this
But I think your ass fine as shit and that's straight up real talk, all bullshit aside
she replied "I Like To Do The Wild Thing"
Action took place at my place, now my place is her place

I got a bunch of dollars I can spend them on her

He tell the truth baby like Fabolous
But you make it look glamorous
Here's spaghetti strapped heals not for amateurs
Risk quite rocky, talk like foxy, job like Roxy,
Spark that broccoli walk quite aky
That mean sexy I will save you if you let me
Fly with me, get high as me
A lot of alphabets girl I'm a G

'Cause she can be my lady she can be my lover
Call me on the late night get right he ain't acting right
