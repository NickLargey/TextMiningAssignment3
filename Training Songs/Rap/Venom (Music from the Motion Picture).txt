I got a song filled with shit for the strong willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Set you off 'till you
Scream, piss off, screw you
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When's something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like

Knock knock, let the devil in, malevolent
As I've ever been, head is spinnin' and this medicine
Screaming, "L-l-l-let us in"
L-l-lick like a salad bowl, Edgar Allen Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure
Hell, I meant Kahl√∫a, screw it, to hell with it
I went through hell with accelerants and blew up
My-my-myself again, Volkswagen, tailspin
Bucket matches my pale skin, mad win
Went from Hellmann's and being rail thin, Filet-o-Fish
Scribbles and Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on floor of the, motel then
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to mailmen
And I know they're gonna hate but I don't care, I
Barely could wait to hit them with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my

Venom
(I got that) Adrenaline momentum (venom)
Not knowing when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinking it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bit with the)
Venom
(I got that) Adrenaline momentum (venom)
Not knowing when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pin
Cocked, f*ck around and catch a hot one
I-i-it's evident I'm not done
V-venomous, the thought spun like your web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or a mud flap
Be strangled or attacked
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, f*ck a blood track
Like, what's her name at the wheel?
Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the end of the nut ration
And you look back and it's just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be the combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi
Translation, I will probably kill us both when I end up
Back in India
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the f*ck's happened
End of ya, when you're bit with the

Venom
(I got that) Adrenaline momentum (venom)

I said, "Knock knock, let the devil in, alien"
E-E-Elliot phone home, ain't no telling when this choke hold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're steppin' in with my
Venom
Put the ballpoint pen 'em
Gun cock, bump stock, devil eye, Buckshot
Tie a couple uggerots
Tie a couple knots, fired up and caught
Fire juggernaut
Punk rock bitches going down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the f*ck not?
You only get one shot
Ate shit till I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank till I faint
And I wait with a headache and I take anything in
Rectangular shape, then I wait
To face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasing me but I'm part of you
So escaping me is impossible
I latch onto you like a
Parasite, and I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the supervillain dad and mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me
