[ODB]
Man man, look up at the sky
All the stars man, the stars is beautiful tonight
Look at em!

[Chorus: Mya]
Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin from afar, reachin for the stars
Run away with me, to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner, to another, uh-huh

[Pras]
Uh, yeah, yo, yo
Some got, hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means
The surpreme dream team, always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to sellin raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floatin on this cream
Who the hell want to stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic immunity, no time for a Visa
And just because, I'ma shoot them one by one
Got five sides to me, somethin like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Lettin bygone be bygone, and so on, and so on
I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto
Keepin it retro-spective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
P-P-Politic with ghetto senators on the d-low

[Chorus]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
One two, and you don't stop, yo
My eyes is sore, bein the senator
Behind closed doors hittin truth to the seafloor
The rich go North ignore, the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open more and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal EVERYTHING, change the law
I find myself, walkin the streets
Tryin to find what's really goin on in the streets

[Pras]
Yea, yo, yo, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, dance around these fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater and make you do a pas de bourre
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doin ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, crowd yellin !Ole!
Who the hell want to see me, from B.K., to Cali
Come on

[Chorus]

[Pras]
Yeah... yo, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finances, losin bets in the horse race
Two faced, gettin defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Well I'm paranoid at the things I said
Wonderin what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin out
partyin with girls that never die, the C.O.'s
pickin on the small fries, my campaign tellin lies
Was just spreadin my love, didn't know my love
was the one holdin the gun in the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now, in the hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood

[Chorus]

[Pras]
Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
Yeah
All Stars, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]

[ODB]
Sing it baby, sing it babyeeeeeeeeee
To another, aheoehahahahhhhhhhhh
Yeahhhh, heeeee, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yeahhhh, heeeee, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
