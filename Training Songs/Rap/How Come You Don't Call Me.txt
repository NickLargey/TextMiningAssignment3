I keep your picture upside my bed (umm)
And I still remember everything you said (umm)
I always thought our love was so right
I guess I was wrong (oh)
Always thought you'll be by my side
Pappa, now you're gone 
What I wanna know baby, if what we had was good
How come you don't call me, anymore

Still like a fire on a rainy night 
I still like it better when you holding me tight 
Everybody said, everybody said, that we should never part, no no
Telling me baby baby baby why
Why you wanna go and break my heart 
All I wanna know is baby, if what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore

Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me, pappa
Oh, you got to try
I'll get down on me knees hoping you please
Please (oh oh) 
Won't you call me sometime, pappa

Why don't you call me 
Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone
You know I don't like to be alone
How come you don't call me (why must you torture me)
How come you don't call me
How come you don't call me
