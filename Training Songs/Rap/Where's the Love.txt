Where the love at
Momma told me there'd be days like this 
But I didn't listen 
Never question the woman's intuition 
My ambition is to give you what you miss 
Sweet love 
Take off your shoes  come and get your feet rubbed 
Us in the tub 
That'll be the shit 
Anybody that don't believe this can eat a dick 
I think we soul mates 
'Cause we got so much in common 
You make them hoes wait 
When you find the proper woman 
Then next to me 
Put your head on my chest 
Attraction stimulates me 
But it's not all about the sex 
I respect you got a mind 
And you self sufficient 
Opinonate yet know how to listen 
Now what's mine is yours 
If I'm ballin' you ballin' 
Tell that other nigga 
He can stop callin' 
Check this out 

[Chorus]
I want to be your man 

I want to be your man baby 
I'm talkin' about 
Providing you with all the lights, securities 
I mean, I think the first step is 
Going to pick out some rings 
What you like 
Baggets and pistol skirts 

Can't spend a life 
Without giving you my answer tonight 
Cause I gotta catch a early flight 
What you yellin' about 
The simple fact that I'm bailin' out 
I'm makin' moves 
My record sellin' out 
I need some affection 
Love can you teach me a lesson 
I might be sittin' fat down here in Texas 
But the thugs ain't mean 
So how deep is your love for me 
How real do you cut for me 
If the laws came and got me 
How long were you stuck with me 
If not long then don't f*ck with me 
I want you down on my team 
And support 
When I'm tryin' to make my green 
It's for real 
I throws some karats in your ring 
I'll make it last forever 
'Cause you know 
I had that cash forever 
We can ball till pass together baby 
Where the love at 

[Chorus]

Yeah that nigga Lil' Troy 
Short Stop Records 
Puttin' down like a G yo 
That's how we get our groove on 

Recognize the mobb 
I bet you cold working star 
When they see the flowers that I'm sendin' to your job 
Read the cards 
Stick it in your purse 
Let's keep it rosy 
'Cause everybody so nosy 
So you can't believe what people say 
Misery, loves company tell them keep away 
It'll be okay 
If you trust in me to make it right 
Before I hit you I'll ?? 
That's on my baby's life 
Will you be my wife 
Please take this ring 
And a service to token 
To make you realize baby I ain't jokin' 
I'm coping 
But my adversaries got me ?? 
I need a god-feared woman 
Who understands my heart 
Leave your baggage from past relationships 
Out of the picture 
I put my old flames out I done changed 
All of my digits 
And that's real 

[Chorus] 

I want to be your man 
Sober 
Ain't really no need to question me 
????? 
For my loyalty or my commitment life 
You know my presence 
But you alone 
To let you know 
You don't want to mess with me 
You need to spend time with me 

I bring the heat 
You want to play 
It ain't a thing ?? 
You say you changed 
You look the same to me 
Eat and ball too much 
On the real, cause I done stall too much 
Girl I want you all too much 
Ain't no way in the world 
Me and you an ball too much 
Imagine having cabbage 
Straight lavish 
Friends wish they can have it 
'Cause I push a rolez, sip crystal glasses 
I'm all wet 
Don't listen to your friends about me cheatin' 
They don't' know that 
Your best friend want me 
Tell that hoe that 
For show that 
You know she want the kids 
You should have knew this 
True this 
Two real niggas left 
I'm one of the fewest 
Holla at me girl 
I'm all this 
We can do this 
Do that love thing 
So I can prove that 

[Chorus]
