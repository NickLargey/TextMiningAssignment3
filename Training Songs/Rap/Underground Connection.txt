What up, what up. Yeah, yeah. East coast, west coast, flava in the mothafuckin house.

(Hurricane G)
Hurricane G and the m*thaf*ckin Delinquent Habits 
And we ain't havin it (word)
So what, ni***? You wanna get buck, bring the rock
Cause we don't give a m*thaf*ck
What the f*ck? I said what the f*ck?
What the f*ck? What the m*thaf*ck?
Yeah, yeah
Hurricane G comin through with the Tres Delinques
For mi gente
This track with Fuentes (???)
Blowin the spot makin shit caliente
Freakin them seats like Tito Puentes beatin drums
Flippin, flowin in different tongues
Leavin all you mothaf*ckas sprung without givin up a chocho
My lyrics is enough to make you loco, maric*n
My shit is phat like chicharron
F*ckin them seats up like Rome
N****s shakin more a** than strippers
For all my b*tches and n****s
I'm sellin records like thugs selling drugs
Gettin mad love
Cause I bring it real
Shit is tight if, and I bang green for my skits (???)

(Chorus)
M*thaf*cka what?
I don't give a f*ck
You can bring the rock we can get buck
What, m*thaf*cka, what?
I don't give a f*ck
You can bring the rock we can get buck
What
I don't give a f*ck
You can bring the rock we can get buck
What, what m*thaf*cka?
I don't give a f*ck
You can bring the rock we can get buck

(Delinquent Habits)
Aiight turn down the bass start to kickin up the treble
Put the music in my earphones so I can check my levels
Tu no sabes que es la mia venta my nachos clica (??)
Es los Tres Delinquentes sin dog why la Boricua-da 
I don't be braggin, that drama's for your mom
But this collaboration right here is da bomb
And when house comes the party starts to sway, G
Brownstyles pumpin it, bumpin PMP days
Muy chicaso
Bring a cord on and when I snort it
C*ke ought to clean your crock leave your punk a** retarded
The one to the two to the three delinquentes
Sing la Hurricane G to yo' frentes
High as a kite
Es la capitan p*nga loca
With a fifth of Bacardi and a brain full of m*ta
Representin all the clica from the southside
And any f*ckin body who got brown pride
Take us back to the avenue mi mocho pa' mi gente
Con la Hurricane G why los vatos Delinquentes
De Cubano marijuano que te deja pa' ampiado
Been down since '83, Divi es con mi hermano
I know you didn't think I would stop makin rolas
I gots to entertain all the vatos and the cholas
So take it to the neighborhood and spread it on the calle
Que es perro negro, no le vale madre

(Chorus)
M*thaf*cka what?
I don't give a f*ck
You can bring the rock we can get buck
What, m*thaf*cka?
Bring the rock
I don't give a f*ck we can get buck
What, m*thaf*cka?
Bring the rock
I don't give a f*ck we can get buck
What, m*thaf*cka?
Bring the rock
I don't give a f*ck we can get buck

(Delinquent Habits)
The Latin season that's the reason homeboy
For all the flava that's on the table 
The Blaxican once again suggesting quick and fabled
I'm struggling mics from mi Lunes to Domingo
Te chingo
Te digo gringos' got my back the lingo brindo
No mas o menos, simply stacks affect tracks
So set the move back
Porque ritmo pega duro like a kick to your sack
Why si me miras en los ojos recojo puro respeto 
Why las palabras de mi boca empezaron enlocesos
Asi lo es homeboys, I'm puttin dantas con mi clicas
Hurricane sin dogs, Delinquents blowin out your speakers
Otra ves, ya lo ves, somos tres
Bring the rock, that's how it is.
Cause we don't give a f*ck

(Chorus)
M*thaf*cka what?
I don't give a f*ck
You can bring the rock we can get buck
What, m*thaf*cka?
Bring the rock
I don't give a f*ck we can get buck
What, m*thaf*cka?
Bring the rock
I don't give a f*ck we can get buck
What, m*thaf*cka?
Bring the rock
I don't give a f*ck we can get buck

bitch!
