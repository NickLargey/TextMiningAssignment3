Uh, Felli Fel, Neyo, Yeesy, calm down, easy, easy.
Keep tellin' me you got a man,
But he can't do what I can,
Let me, show you what you been missin',
Keep show'in you the minor thing,
Let me, show you the finer thing,
Let me, show you what your missin',

Right about this time raise your glasses,
What's my motivation, that ass is,
Start a conversation, like as if,
You really want to know about a day in that shit,
Go ahead and tell the dj to play swizz,
So I ain't gotta tell these hoes who I is,
Bitches hating again that's music too me ears,
What's you think my fuel was for all of the years?
Im inspired when people don't like me,
They keep me writing so exciting,
Man, the drama is so enticing,
I might just bite ''a'' motherfucker like tyson,
Just too fly'ed a motherfucker so change,
Trow your cash, that's cake and ice'in,
I ask'd her you buying?
She said no just sight-seeing,
Maybe that's just because you ain't found the right thing? yeah!

Keep tellin' me you got a man,
But he can't do what I can,
Let me, show you what you been missin',
Keep show'in you the minor thing,
Let me, show you the finer thing,
Let me, show you what your missin',

Let me show you what is like too be the wife
Of a nigga with a life,
That make your head spin around,
See it's funny because I know what you like,
But I be see'in you with nigga's that ain't right, round hard top,
Know'in that you really, really want's your top down,
Know'in it is really time too stop running around,
We don't live twice, only life once,
And I know you like nice,
So how you gone front on me?
Baby, im the boss jd,
With him it's a limit,
With me it's a spree,
He buy car's,
I write you poetry,
He send flowers,
I send Mercedes,
Like ye, say, heaven is anything that heaven ain't is,
And yes, I guess, I'm into trick'in of buiss,
But shit, if you had it like I got it,
The you got it as a kid,
You say the same thing to a girl,
That I just said

Keep tellin' me you got a man,
But he can't do what I can,
Let me, show you what you been missin',
Keep show'in you the minor thing,
Let me, show you the finer thing,
Let me, show you what you been missin',

The life I live, fit for a king,
Now all I need fine little dime that's sharin my shine you sit back and watch the haters go blind,

I'm not tryin' to keep it lost too a minimum,
If you associating been in em winning em, then I say I was nine out of ten of them,
Frankly I know been and them I like spending them,
You like the smooth and can white lend'in them,
You wan't a thug, hey I look good in a timb,
You might win some, but everybody lost one,
I put a check on that like air force one's,
It's easier to lose her then to find her, so wine her and dine her, and treat her to the finer,
Things, lines, from the top designers,
Bling, shine, like you tryin' to blind her,
These are just reminders,
Just too sign ''her'',
Show her you find ''her'',
Eight, one of a kind ''her'',
See alote of ass, and that one behind her!
Let's just say that im diggin that like a miner, ya digg

Keep tellin' me you got a man,
But he can't do what I can,
Let me, show you what you been missin',
Keep show'in you the minor thing,
Let me, show you the finer thing,
Let me, show you what you been missin',

Kanye, Neyo, JD, low so, Felli Fel on the track,
All the hater take two step's back, and we gone!
