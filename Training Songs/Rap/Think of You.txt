Nooo...nooo....
You see it...no no no..no no
Listen baby

There's something crazy I'm feelin
And I don't even know what I can do about it
It keeps me up in the evenin
And I just can't clear my head..of you

Baby I don't know what it is.. that's tellin me
That nothing could be more than lovin you
I try to get my thoughts and my feelings together
But no matter how I try to find it, brings me back to you

(in the morning) I think of you
(day and night) baby I think of you
(everyday) I think of you
(and every other day) oooh, I can too
(when it rains) I think of you
(when I cry) baby I think of you
I don't understand what makes me think of you
Baby, I just do

Everyday this feeling gets stronger
Not a minute or hour goes by that I'm not thinking of the 
For the very first time in my life, I feel deep inside I know the answer
In what I feel is real

Baby now I know what it is..thats been tellin me
That nothin could be more than lovin you
Now I got my thoughts and feelings together
See I understand the vibe I'm gettin, now I run to you

(in the morning) I think of you
(day and night) baby I think of you
(everyday) I think of you
(and every other day) oooh, I can too
(when it rains) I think of you
(when I cry) baby I think of you
I don't understand what makes me think of you
Baby, I just do

(in the morning) I think of you
(day and night) baby I think of you
(everyday) I think of you
(and every other day) oooh, I can too
(when it rains) I think of you
(when I cry) baby I think of you
I don't understand what keeps me (keeps me) thinking of you
I do
