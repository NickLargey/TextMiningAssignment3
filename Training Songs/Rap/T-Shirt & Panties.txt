Picture this I'm in my bed
Body's hot
Soaking wet
Thinking bout tha things I like to do
I'm open wide when it comes to freaking you
Imagine me
Wet as can be
Between my legs
Ya tasting me

Boy when you get here you know my love will over flow
And you ain't gotta worry bout my clothes
'Cause I got my

T-shirt and my panties on.
(Just how you like it)
T-shirt and my panties on.
(Waiting for you)
T-shirt and my panties on.
(You can't deny it)
T-shirt and my panties
Got my t-shirt and my panties on.
Got my t-shirt and my panties on.

Don't be surprised when you come inside
Saddle up and be prepared to ride
Up and down ohh
Back and forth uhh ohhh
Can you feel it baby don't you just
Take your time cause tonight your mine
Gonna turn around and hit me from behind

Boy when you get here you know my love will over flow
And you ain't gotta worry bout my clothes
'Cause I got my

T-shirt and my panties on.
(Just how you like it)
T-shirt and my panties on.
(Waiting for you)
T-shirt and my panties on.
(You can't deny it)
T-shirt and my panties
Got my t-shirt and my panties on.
Got my t-shirt and my panties on.

I'm feeling kinda sexy now that we are all alone
Baby can we do it nasty
In tha privacy of my own home
Baby come a little closa
Come a little closa I unplugged all tha telephones
Because 2nite is special I got my t-shirt and my panties on

T-shirt and my panties on.
(Just how you like it)
T-shirt and my panties on.
(Waiting for you)
T-shirt and my panties on.
(You can't deny it)
T-shirt and my panties
Got my t-shirt and my panties on.
Got my t-shirt and my panties on.
