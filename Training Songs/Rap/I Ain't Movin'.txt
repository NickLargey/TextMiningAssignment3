Love is my passion
Love is my friend
Love is universal
Love never ends

Then why am I faced with so much anger, so much pain?
Why should I hide? Why should I be ashamed?
Time is much too short to be living somebody elses life
I walk with dignity, I step with pride

'Cause I ain't movin' from my face, 
From my race, from my history
I ain't movin' from my love, 
My peaceful dove, it means too much to me
Loving self can be so hard
Honesty can be demanding
Learn to love yourself,
It's a great, great feeling

When your down baby, I will set you free
I will be your remedy, I will be your tree
A wise man is clever, seldom ever speaks a word
A foolish man keeps talking, never is he heard

Time's too lonely, too lonely without words
Future voices need to be heard
Eyebrows are always older than the beards
Momma said be brave, you've nothing to fear

I ain't movin', I've been here long before
I ain't movin', ''cause I want more
I ain't movin', got my feet on the ground
As far as I'm concerned, love should win the rounds
