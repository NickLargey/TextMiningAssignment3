[Chorus: Lil' Mo & Nate Dogg]
A gangsta's for every day
So make sure that you keep it, G-A-N-G-S-T-A
And now that I know the game
I'll make sure that I keep it, G-A-N-G-S-T-A

[Nate Dogg]
Me and the ghetto where the poor people hang
Please pay attention they do ghettoish things
One out of three, yep a third of 'em bang
The other motherfuckers they be slanging that cane
Always out for money 'cause the money's the game
East side homey it's a Long Beach thang
You heard me right nigga this is DPG
With the superwoman standin' claimin' CPT

[Lil' Mo]
I-I, promise I'ma keep it G
Rep my south team, hands in the street
Recognize game, and they recognise me
'Cause a G like me comes naturally
Tho-ose, haters try to hate on me
But they got no choice but to do right by me
There's no way o' dividin' me
'Cause my OG's in the streets gon' ride for me
I-I, promise to do ghetto things
'Cause I'm the closest thing to ghetto in this industry
That's why I be chillin' when it's 90 degrees
While ya keep shit poppin' how I ride this beat
And people always saying to me
How can I tell I'm really a G?
'Cause an OG told a gangsta
A gangsta told a player
A player told Nate
And Nate just said to me

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
Nate Dogg reppin'
(Look!) X to the Z

I'm shifty, versus runnin' a buck 50
Tryin' to get large enough bank to get Britney
I'ma do Britney like Bobby did Whitney
F*ck her whole life off, donate my kidney (Yeah!)
Wake up to vodka, crash with the whiskey
My name holdin' to much weight, you can't lift me
Came from my first out ghetto with King Tipsy
Hold a torch over my city, you can't miss me
Niggas say f*ck me but can't f*ck wit' me
Twist this shit, make your finger tips sticky
I need me a wify, shit I mean wifey
I'm so fucked up I couldn't read my own writin' (Heh)
Clash of the titan, (Yeah!) no propaganda
Big ? hummin' for you Tony Montana
T-shirt, khakis, tucked in bandannas
Livin' amongst the most scandalous on the planet (Yo!)

[Chorus: x2]
