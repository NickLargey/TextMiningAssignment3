[Hezekiah]
You know you and I've been through many hardships in life 
They say people who believe, hardship has made us doubt 
The very God of gods 
But the apostle Paul said in his scripture 

We are troubled on every side, yet not in distressed 
We are perplexed but not in despair 
Persecuted but not forsaken 
Cast down but we are never distroyed 

And the conclusion of the whole matter is that 
Finally the storm is over 
It's time for us to reap what we have sewn 
No doubt my brothers and sisters 

God has given us a miracle, finally 
Blackstreet 

[Blackstreet]
Finally we'll make it through the storm and the rain 
It's time to give and praise and bless the Lord 
If you believe in miracles, just you wait and see 
'Cause finally we'll make it through it all 

Bless the Lord 
Bless the Lord 
'Cause finally we'll make it through it all 

Bless the Lord 
Bless the Lord 
'Cause finally we'll make it through the storm 

We've had our ups and downs 
Sometimes there no way out, I know He's there 
To lead me and guide me every step of the way, yeah 
Your grace, my joy, constant friend indeed 

Everything that I do, I owe it all to you 
I bless your name 

Bless the Lord 
Bless the Lord 
'Cause finally we'll make it through it all

[Hezekiah]: 
To every believer, all things work together for the good 
To him that love to Lord 
It's time for us to speak to those things 
That are not as though they were 

So I command every household to be blessed 
I command every marriage to work out 
I command every broken heart to be heal 
I command prosperity upon my life 

It's my time, it's my time, finally, finally 
The miracle is here 
Come on Blackstreet, c'mon Fellowship 
Let's bless the Lord 

[Chorus]
And because God is the greatest power 
We shall not be defeated 
Finally.
