Take me back to my dreams of G.I. Joe and make believe 
When I used to fall asleep. 
Playing army in the fort, watching Star Wars on the floor 
Looking up to so much more 
Take me back to that place where the sun shined on our face, 
Where our memories never fade 
Take me back to the day where we could always slip away 
Being cool under the shade 
Camping out under stars in the backyard with our cars 
We could stay out here for hours 
At home watching Scooby Doo in my He-Man underroos 
Telling me I have the power 
Take me back, take me back, take me back to a better place 
Take me back, take me back, take me back to a better day
