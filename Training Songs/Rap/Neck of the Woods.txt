Chyeah, gangsta to the core
Ankle-wrap flamer, paint your kitchen floor
With you're whore, shit you can't ignore
Things you endure when fuckin' with the boy
All I heard was, "Wheezy, don't kill me no more"
I hear your bullshit, I play matador
I'm out of category, I ain't there with y'all
I got a positive vibe, but I ain't scared of y'all
Get the kid negative, never that at all
That rat-a-tat go off, that blat-kak-kak-kak-kak-kak
I got a bitch so fine, her name PÃ©rignon
She no how to stash quarters in a carry-on
I blow out town grass when I'm out oftown
Uptown in the buildin', not a sound
'Cause killers don't get heard about
They get whispered about or you get murdered out, nigga

Well, let me take to to the neck of the woods
Of my hood (uptown), show you what we livin' like
Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
Got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, nigga

Look, the first shot, the first nigga got shot
We bust him open like a blunt on a Marley, nigga (yeah)
A hundred G's, nigga score some ki's
And then we went to the hood (believe that)
And then we started to ball, nigga (started ballin', nigga)
We know them people been paper chasin' (watch them)
So we stay out the way, then we pull out the Harley's, nigga (let's ride)
We keep the gauge close (yeah), incase you wan' know (uh-huh)
You come through the hood, I bet you a target, nigga
It's all good 'til you catch a case (stay up, nigga)
A nigga never escape because you addicted to money, nigga (you addicted to money, nigga)
Well, let me bring you back yesterday (yeah)
A lil' homie I know, he got full of that barma, nigga (ease up, nigga)
Fuckin' 'round with that Kid-N-Play (play too much, man)
Nigga fuckin' with Gs, a nigga twisted his body, nigga (nigga twisted his body)
Well, let me tell you about this game I know

All that play buckin' gon' get your face buttoned up
Now when you smirk, you look like Jay-Z shirt
Fuckin' with the turf
I'm puffin' on that Smurf, f*ck you, come holler
And tellin' Papa, "Put away your dollars, your son got chopppers"
And if you got enemies, your son got enemies (yeah, believe that, nigga, f*ck 'em)
That's uptown energy, nigga

Don't waste no time on no bullshit (bullshit)
It ain't hood shit, we'll spend a lil' paper, nigga (we'll spend a lil' paper, shawty)
But if you catch 'em in the hood, nigga (if you catch 'em)
It's all good (it's all good), shit, go 'head do me that favor, nigga (bow down, bitches)
Well, let me take you down deep in the inside (deep down)
It's where they hustle and the homies tryna get it right (grindin', nigga)
It's when you got to ride, it's when the homie die
And the money can't stop the pain in the inside (believe that)

Well, let me take to to the neck of the woods
