Yeah, hey,
Whoa
No, no, no, no, no

I'm stayin' home tonight
I don't wanna go nowhere
I'm just gonna love you, baby
All night long

I wanna rub your back and kiss your feet
Romantically I wanna be yours, baby
All night long

Girl, you hold the key to my soul
(It's obvious I need you)
Oh, anything you want is yours
(I'll go outta my way to please you)

[Chorus]
Girl, I wanna show you love
Romance you till you get enough (Oh)
Oh, baby, now let's stay home tonight
(Can't you see that-that I need you, baby)
Girl, here is where I wanna stay
No friends, no phones, no two-ways 
Oh, let's stay home tonight
(Don't you know that I need you)

There's no one else but you
Makes me wanna call up fellas
And say, "Later, dude"
'Cause I'm home forever

I just can't look at you and leave you, baby
I gotta stay right by your side, hoo...
Let's just stay home tonight

All you gotta do is say
(Just say what you've been needin')
Oh, you can never know your way
(Cause girl, I'm here for pleasin')

[Chorus]

Girl, you hold the key to my soul
(It's obvious I need you)
Oh, anything you want is yours
(I'll go outta my way to please you)

Girl, I got the remedy, don't you see
That we got to keep this thing so tight, so tonight
All about you and me, ah, baby
Don't that sound alright, oh

[Chorus]

(I'm talkin' no phone, no friends, no business)
(I sent the kids to your mama's, baby)
Oh, baby, now let's stay home tonight

Girl, here is where I wanna stay (Rose petals)
No friends, no phones, no two-ways
(Will lead you to the bed, baby)
Oh, let's stay home tonight (Let's stay home tonight)
(Let's stay home tonight)
