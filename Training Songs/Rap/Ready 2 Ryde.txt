Keep it shaking, Cali keep it quaking
Cause the Ryders got me bringing home the bacon
Show me love, and it wasn't no mistaking
That I would dedicate this melody, f*ck the hating

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
Cause she slipped and dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready to ride
To keep the heater right by her side

[Eve]
Hey yo, so what the deal Dogg, tell me, keep it real Dogg
Niggas seem stressed to the brain, how you feel Dogg?
Nigga I'ma ride, set it up, let it spill Dogg
Anything you want, I can flip, got the skill Dogg

[Snoop Dogg]
Baby girl you so sophisticated
Finance related, you graduated
To the next level in the game, wearing my name
Bad little brick-house, go and do that thing

[Eve]
Yo, niggas surprised when they open they eyes
Thick in the thighs wasn't part of they plan
Not just his bitch, I'm like his main man
Act shifty, your resistance gone swiftly
Bitches mad at a nigga, asking why he kissed me
Stop whining, just to cry and get the macking daddy
I don't like it when the angry chick is acting crabby
That's why he bagged me
Ghetto jewel, never loud and trashy
No stressing over chicks, problem? Bet I solve it fastly

[Chorus: x2]

[Snoop Dogg]
We gang-bang on these niggas like we 'posed to do
And I'll be damned if I let a bitch get close to you
We posted Boo, you, my, one and only
Quick to dump before the homies
Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?
You filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love
All that pushing and shoving, kissing and hugging
Thugging, dig it, dug-in
I'm loving every minute of it Boo
The way you stay true, and always kept your cool
You kept the heater right by your thigh
And when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride
You didn't run out, when I pulled the gun out
That's what I'm talking bout, no doubt
Ruff Riding, Eastsidin, to the realest y'know
D-O-double-Gizze, you know how we get busy

[Eve]
Hey yo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need
Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees
Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes
And if I heard you was fronting I hope on the case
Wild one? Maybe, but I'ma protect my baby
Test me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy
That's how I do for my Dogg, keep my niggas strong
Both sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song

[Chorus: x2]

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, E-V-E! D-O-double-Gizze! Y'know!
Ruff Ridin', Eastsidin! Foe life, yeah
And you thought it'd never happen
F*ck the haters, bow wow!
Woof, woof, woof, woof,
