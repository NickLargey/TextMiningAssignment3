Rubbing on that Italian leather
'Dem Konvict jeans on!
Ay yo Weezy! You Ready, yeah!

I get it in 'till sunrise
Doing ninety in a sixty five
Windows rolled down screaming ah!
Hey-ey-ey' I'm so paid
Number one hustla' gettin' money
Why do you wanna count my money
I'm a hustla' and I don't need them! One of them y'all see! I'm so paid

I see police on the crooked I
Doing a hundred on the Interstate 95
My shawty leanin' blasting that Do or Die
Pushin' that motherfuckin' wood cause we certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off
I'm a sniper sitting on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Then let them haters come and make the name of me that's why

I get it in 'till sunrise
Doing ninety in a sixt five
Windows rolled down screaming ah!
Hey-ey-ey' I'm so paid
Number one hustla' gettin' money
Why do you wanna count my money
I'm a hustla and I don't need them! One of them y'all see! I'm so paid

She said young why ya voice so hoarse
I just sound like money
Baby I should've been a Porsche (Vroom)
Paint lookin' like a sugar free Redbull
I'm so paid ya know I keep a pocketful
And that's before the taxes
Took my whole gross net and hid it under my mattress
I use to get bored count 20's for practice
Paper therapy we let the money relax us
Gold chains round my neck just like Michael Phelps
I made a killin' in the water killin' with da water
Against all odds and I will not stop
They try and keep me on bottom but I prefer the top
And my project chick I moved her next to Joc
She said the house was too small I moved her next to block
So baby get ya ass up I need an extra block
I told her do the speed limit and no extra stops and that's why

I get it in 'till sunrise
Doing ninety in a sixty five
Windows rolled down screaming ah!
Hey-ey-ey' I'm so paid
Number one hustla' gettin' money
Why do you wanna count my money
I'm a hustla' and I don't need them! One of them y'all see! I'm so paid

I am the boss it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off that's all
Guess what I won't be taking that fall
Homie I got cake that's what I'm paying them for (aha!)

Ain't that funny
Cause niggas want war but ain't got money
Cause I've seen them all talking 'till they start gunnin'
Quicker than Usain Bolt the fastest thing running

Yeah! Akon! Weezy! Jezzy!
Block oil holdin' down Jersey
Devine making sure we gettin' it up front
My little brother Boo got that vision baby-y!

I get it in 'till sunrise
Doing ninety in a sixty five
Windows rolled down screaming ah!
Hey-ey-ey' I'm so paid
Number one hustla' gettin' money
Why do you wanna count my money
I'm a hustla' and I don't need them! One of them y'all see! I'm so paid

Oh-oh, big money Weezy
White wife beater with the sig underneath it
How do I feel bitch I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers disappear from the precinct yea!
I'm ballin' we ball out
Thoughts of we fallin' 'til the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns at y'all house
Only to find out you live in a doll house damn!
But I thought you was tough though
We carry choppers on our necks call it cut throat
We bury cowards on the set that they come from
We know magic turn weed smoke to gun smoke
We, ride first when we ride
You, in a hearse when you ride
I put my shoe down baby
And I'm holding down Young Mula baby! That's why

I get it in 'till sunrise
Doing ninety in a sixty five
Windows rolled down screaming ah!
Hey-ey-ey' I'm so paid
Number one hustla' gettin' money
Why do you wanna count my money
I'm a hustla' and I don't need them! One of them y'all see! I'm so paid
