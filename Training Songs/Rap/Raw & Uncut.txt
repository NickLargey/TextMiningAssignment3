What
Spit what man
Man I don't know where that shit be comin' from dawg for real
Ain't no fuckin' rapper man
Sixteen
I don't know Jay
If you don't believe me then

Who you know who can spit till he pop the real
Never thought about rappin' 'til he coped his deal
I really held down my block for real
All I do is crack rock and how to pop the steel
How to box niggas in where they can barely move
Roll wit straight thugs never scary dudes
Keep bodies on them guns and we share our tools
Deuce one ball for Philly like Larry Hughes
Keep the desert eagle wit the beam tucked by the scrotum
Get locked in jail run a block sell open
Mind went to jail I get dro el's roll 'em
Rookie nigga clippin' niggas like L Odom
I got dough I choose not to spend it
Catch me in Avis and Budget in somethin' rented
Long as the windows tented (I don't give a f*ck)
I'm in it 
I was holdin' wit music rollin' in the gold infinite

[Jay-Z]
We keep it raw & uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it 
It might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and that's how life goes
But nigga this is the life you chose ya heard me

[Beanie]
We keep it raw & uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it
It might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thats how life goes
Thats just the life we chose

[Jay-Z]
We don't complain thats just how it be
I shuffle back against the ropes like Ali
I hustle through the alley through the valley of the death
And I never play fair in the eyes of the ref
F*ck it give me a tech and I'll come back right
Can't go inside the game ain't got enough strikes
Come at me wrong I'll come at you the same
Come at me sideways I'll come blastin' your brains
Come at me direct and I'll come back wit names
I'm hot like boilin' water, I'll come back wit cane

[Jay-Z]
Keep it raw and uncut for all the bitches and hoes
The first time you sniff it 
It might hurt your nose

[Beanie]
But only the strong survive and thats how life goes
I know I'm outta control
Me and jay same track you gotta be kiddin'
Its like that nigga Jordan, I'm Scottie Pippen
Its like Magic, Worthy
Parish, Bird and
Stockton, Malone shit
Who gonna stop and hold this
Game like Doc and Moses
Full court press and the rock control this

We keep it raw and uncut for all the niggas and hoes

[Beanie]
I use to catch that train and snatch that chain
Do anything for a game to catch some change
Whether it was shootin' the dice or clappin' the gauge
I was a nigga wit a strong arm like Satchel Paige
I'm tellin' you dawg I'm the wrong one to f*ck wit at all
I'm the type that'll set a broad day in the mall
Up in glocks wit body shops takin' a fall
F*ck you cock swats feds and all

[Jay-Z]
No no no homie, I didn't say I could hit you wit dirty o's
But I said if I can supply 30 of those
Ding ding homie come holla at the kingpin
The gods are reapal, the Carters is lethal
Hang wit psychotic people who like so f*ck niggas
Came up singin' that god was evils
Slang Heron to cats is like revolvin' a eagle
And I blew to the point I bought cars for the people
