Money fall out the sky when I speak
Gotta valet, can't leave mine in these streets
Can't carpool, the crew is too deep
Why tuck it all in? The jewels are too sweet
You should ball if you could
I be diggin' in my pockets
It ain't trickin' if you got it
And since a niqqa from the projects
Champagne out of a can would be the fly sh!t
And I'm a history major
Hood motivational speaker
Rap Led Zeppelin, best dressed list
Show you how to bubble off of large investments
Ya heard me, and this journey I'm the journalist
Line around the block to hear the words of the herbalist
Send ya girl to the Dominicans to perm her shit
Tell her tonight, we gonna see Nas return to his murder shit

It's still Nasty, bone in the flesh
God's son, never gone, never left
King, I play every card in the deck
The whole world waitin' for what I'm goin' do next
And y'all already know I came from
Queens bridge represent state one
Nigga I'm on (come on!)
I'm on (come on!)
I'm on (come on!)
I'm on (Nasir!)
Come on!

Out of the shadows, into the lights
I have a power, take back it's mine
We have a power
We are alive

I'm God's hit man
Chopard wrist band
New York crown jewel
No if and's
Top five, I'm the one, two, three, four
And the fifth man
Smoke a hookah in Istanbul
I'm quicksand
I'm 5 Mics, five points of light
Hit the stage like a meteorite
They wanna all hear Ether tonight
But we ain't beefin' tonight
That's history
So now when you mention me
Say I'm a mystery
Like six degrees or the seven hills of Sicily
I need a vasectomy
They resurrected me
But nothing is left for me
Just when you thought you'd seen the best of me
I take it a notch higher, yeah
Sip more wine than a Somalian
Get around town in a private Lear
And by sun down, I'm up out of here

It's still Nasty, bone in the flesh
God's son, never gone, never left
King, I play every card in the deck
The whole world waitin' for what I'm goin' do next
And y'all already know I came from
Queens bridge represent state one
Nigga I'm on (come on!)
I'm on (come on!)
I'm on (come on!)
I'm on (Nasir!)
Come on!

Out of the shadows, into the lights
I have a power, take back it's mine
We have a power
We are alive

Power, paper, palace is so high
Lookin' over skyscrapers, wildin' out in Dubai
Do I look like I never seen the better things?
Emerald ring, I chase cheddar mean
Pockets on swole since eighteen years old
Gettin' my dough, cigars are hand-rolled
From Guantanamo, Gallardo's, the car shows
The Narco Gestapo Optimo's
Cause I love the dough
More than you know
Still ain't reach the pinnacle
Braveheart general since 9-4
Got the belt to show
Certified classic
9-6, Street Dreams is blastin'
And no way, they wanna hire assassins
They still harassin'
I'm so platinum, it's natural
A niqqa is my acronym
Lights, camera, action and

It's still Nasty, bone in the flesh
God's son, never gone, never left
King, I play every card in the deck
The whole world waitin' for what I'm goin' do next
And y'all already know I came from
Queens bridge represent state one
Nigga I'm on (come on!)
I'm on (come on!)
I'm on (come on!)
I'm on (Nasir!)
Come on!

Out of the shadows, into the lights
I have a power, take back it's mine
We have a power
We are alive

Nigga I'm on
I'm on
Come on!

This is

We global now, we global
We international now, international
Nasir!
