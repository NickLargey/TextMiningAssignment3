[Chorus]
I gotta shake you off
Cause the loving's ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake you off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake you off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake you off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
'Cause I'll be on my way

See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say 'I told you so'

Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively

So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

[Chorus]

I gotta shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets

Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'm a hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind

You wasn't worth my time
I've leaving you behind
'Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because

I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

[Chorus]
