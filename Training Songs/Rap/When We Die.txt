So, where do I go, where do I go?
I don’t die young, not like Michael
My friend's psycho, so, I might go lie low
So, where do I go, where do I go?
Fun trips, she’s wearing lycro
Where do we go, where do we go
When we die, then we lie low?

How can you somewhat say?
Twins apart, faded grey
Is it like that dream I had?
And you are here like a dream

Where did you go, where did you go?
Why did you leave?
What do you need, what do you need?
Now you go, I hardly breathe
What do you see, what do you see?
I think of you and waste my day
So, where do we go, where do we go
When we die, then we lay low?

How can you somewhat say?
Twins apart, faded grey
Is it like that dream I had?
And you are here like a dream

How can you somewhat say?
Twins apart, faded grey
Is it like that dream I had?
And you are here like a dream

How can you somewhat say?
Twins apart, faded grey
Is it like that dream I had?
And you are here like a dream
