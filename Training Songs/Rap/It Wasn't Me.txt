Your girl wants to give it to me

I need to ask you a question 
This thing that I heard, it got me stressin'
I'm guessin' baby, comin to you for your confession
If you did it, then you besta tell me, straight up 
'cause what I heard completely overwhelmed me
Don't try to sell me, then compell me to be packin' and gone
Or better yet, I'll pack you up before the end of the song
But if I'm wrong, then my complete apology, you will see
This cannot happen, now you know that i don't want to believe
That you would be forever lettin' other women receive
The love you give me everyday, I find it hard to concieve
But if it's true then I'mma to tell you this is the end 
I'll ask you once, not again
Was you fuckin' my friend
Tell me now

Now let me tell you what she told me
She said that you was fake and phony
Fuckin' my homie, actin' like you don't even know me
Sayin' time and time againn that you was leavin' me lonely
Ridin' my pony, Angie and this chick named Romie
Tellin' me the way you hit it when i left for the keys
Talkin' 'bout the carpet burnin', she received to the knees
The multiple orgasms, with the greatest of ease
And orally the way you had her screamin', beggin' you please
And she was trouble from the start when I met her one night
If I leave, "Dear John" will be the letter you find
If you want her, you can have her, it ain't wetter than mine
It be another man's gain, it ain't better than mine
Now tell me

I know she lies, but the details was all too clear
And I know better than to run with everything that I hear
Trust was never a problem for us it was perfectly clear
It's been like happily ever after for the past 2 years
I know she wants you though, she said it on the night that we met
Now she takin' drastic measures, tryin' to see if she get
She fightin' in a battle that she know she never could win
Step it down to a 6 when you workin' with 10
want to walk in my heals
want to walk with my deals
want to know how it feel
I'm just bein' for real
I take your word for it this time, I'm stayin' with you
Make sure it never happen, I ain't playin' with you
Now tell me

I need to ask you a question 
This thing that I heard, it got me stressin'
