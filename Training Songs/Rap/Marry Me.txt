The say I'm an urban myth
They say black men don't exist
Prove them wrong, won't you marry me? Marry me
And they say I'm nothing but a stat on sheets
But here I am on my bending knees
Prove them wrong, won't you marry me? Marry me
So I'm asking every woman and girl
All over the world
If you wanna get married, you can marry me
And I know you've been hurt
So let me be the one who puts you first
If you wanna get married, you can marry me
Marry me

I'll wrap my soul around this ring girl
If I could, that's what you mean to me
Give me your hand and your heart girl
I swear it's safe for eternity

Baby I can feel your pain, let me heal your pain
After you leave with me, you'll never feel the same
I'll steal a plane, fly over hills and plains
Reach in the clouds, even steal the rain
So a seed can grow, believe me and know
I'm a king, you're a queen
I'll leave you, no
Got you covered in the best gold
I know you see the threshold, come get carried
Let's get married

They say I'm an urban myth
They say black men don't exist
Prove them wrong, won't you marry me? Marry me
And they say I'm nothing but a stat on sheets
But here I am on my bending knees
Prove them wrong, won't you marry me? Marry me
So I'm asking every woman and girl
All over the world
If you wanna get married, you can marry me
And I know you've been hurt
So let me be the one who puts you first
If you wanna get married, you can marry me
Marry me

I know you've been stressing
I ain't trippin' on the next man girl
You want a ring on your left hand
I'm groomed to be the groom and the best man girl

Baby you can take my name, and I could take the place
I can lift the veil, I can kiss your face
We can jump the broom, take a leap of faith
After we tie the knot, we can cut the cake
Tell your pops that it's okay
To give me your hand and gone give you away girl

They say I'm an urban myth
They say black men don't exist
Prove them wrong, won't you marry me? Marry me
See they say I'm an urban myth
They say that black men don't exist
Prove them wrong, baby marry me, marry me
