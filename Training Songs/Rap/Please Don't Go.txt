[Chorus:]
Baby please don't go
Please don't go
Stay right by my side
By my side

Rainy days bring back memories of you
And I will never lie
I want you by my side
Thinking of you
Makes me not want you to go
Please stay, stay with me

[Chorus]

Oh I can't face the fact
That I want you in my life
Don't Go my love I'll show
My heart I send to you
You are my friend
Don't leave I'll do anything you need
Rainy days brings back memories
Rainy days brings back memories
Rainy days brings back memories of you
Rainy days, rainy days brings back memories
Rainy days, brings back memories of you
Rainy days I think of you

Oh, baby please don't go, please don't go
Stay right by my side, stay by my side, by my side
Baby please don't go, please don't go
Stay right by my side, you're in my life, by my side
Oh ya
Rain

Rainy days, you, you, you, you
Please don't go

Please don't go
Rainy days, you, you, you, you
Stay right by my side
Rain

Stay right by my side
Please don't go
Rainy days, you, you, you, you
Stay right by my side, by my side, in my life
Baby please don't go, please don't go, please stay
I need you back in my life
Oh ya, by my side, oh ya
Don't go, baby please don't go
No, no, no, I want you back in my life, here
Please don't go, please don't go, 
Please don't go, please don't go
Don't run away, back in my life, baby
