Next time I sing a ballad
And they say that I'm too pop
What the hell, if it gets me to the top
Next time I'll be handsome
Or pretty at least
I will have big muscles, I'll lay on the beach
Next time I'll paint pictures
Like a real Van Gogh
Wear little black hats, hang my cigarettes so low
Sit in french cafes
Drinking french pernod
Next time gigolo, next time we go
Next time, next time, next time, oh next time, next time
Next time I'll be full blooded
'Stead of half-cherokee
I'll put on my warpaint, and they'll listen to me
Next time I'll tell my mama
With a baby on my knee (say gay)
I'll sweep and clean and dress my dream, kick that broke down washing machine
Next time, next time, next time, oh next time, next time
Next time I'll be kinder
And I'll be tougher too
I won't worry half as much, and neither will you
But for now I've got to go
On and strut my stuff
I'll sing my song and swing along, tomorrow I'll be better off
Next time, next time, next time, oh next time, next time
No, no next time
Wop, bob a loo bop bam
Next time
Anyone here seen ray charles?
