Heaven ain't hard to find
(All you gotta do is look)

Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hoping my information, elevates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smiling through your frown
I'm askin' Baby Boo are you down?
Although I know you've heard about my reputation
Across the nation, "Mr. I get around"
My temptation got me dripping wet, perspiration
I'm activated by the moves your making
Baby why you faking, strip naked get the love making
See its all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize till that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wanting, never touching but wishing
A straight thug on a mission until I get what I'm missing
Stop with the beeper, baby listen,
I know you're grown, but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tounge kissen'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes

Turn around one more time
Heaven ain't hard to find

(Heaven)
Heaven ain't hard to find
(Heaven ain't hard to find)

Heaven ain't hard to find
In fact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid, still believing in magic
It takes a lot of sacrifice
With all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes
Baby you're moving to fast
My conversations are getting deeper, but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug ?
And have you ever made love
With candles and bubbles sipping in your tub
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This thug passion
Help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that Alize
Come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends
Perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life
Baby and you'll be my soulja
And I know it takes some time
And you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time
Heaven ain't hard to find

(Heaven)
Heaven ain't hard to find
(Heaven ain't hard to find)

You think we all dogs, that's why you cautious when I approached you
Been talking since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact, I wink and you respond back
Look at me
What's all that? Huh
It's like the closer you get, baby the quicker I'm speaking
I got a flight out Chicago, lets kick it this weekend
I'm sipping Hennessy and coke
Tho' addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh god help me identify me truest thoughts
Your hidden motives full of passion who would of thought
Come hollar at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a player hater, label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends
I can soup you in my Benz
We'll ride, I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin
Until the end, it gets better with time
I'm makin' love to your mind baby
Heaven ain't hard to find
