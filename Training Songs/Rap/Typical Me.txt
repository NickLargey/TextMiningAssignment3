It's just one of those days
Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
Now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep
It's just one of those days 
Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
And now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep 
It's just typical me 
I must have one of them faces
Now it's stuck with me, I can't change it
I ain't troublesome, I'm the safest
But they won't let my clique in 'Faces' 
'cause I must be one of them artists
That gets kicked out the club the fastest 
'cause bouncers think they're the hardest 
I'll bang them and blame it on Marcus 
Yeah I got reason to get up
But I skank out and shuffle like Ke'l 
'Cause more times I'm just mellow
I'll bring up a pint before I say 'Hello' 
But yeah ravin's excitin'
So I put it all in my writin' 
And we ain't just always fightin' 
Just with the bouncers that think they're Tyson, 

'Cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind the 'on' switch, 
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick that real finer chick
Smiling with me
I try my best to not be aggressive but 
It's one of those days

Innit
Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
Now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep
It's just typical me 

I must just be unruly
So no-one call over Rudy 
But look at all the drinks he brought me
I drink too much when I was forty
Stand up to see a nuisance
A pest, a pain, a rage
The same shit happens almost every other day 
Almost every other rave
There's some sorta drama
But sometimes I'm cool I'm calmer
Frightened I can't afford to wear 'Prada' 
But I don't box just to prove I'm harder 
But don't piss me off today, I'm pissed already so
I guess it's gonna be one of those days

Typical me
It's typical
You can take me out the hood I'll still act like a criminal
So don't try and get physical
But let me weigh up my options
How big? They're menacing bouncers 
I'll bet twenty kgs, I bet they probably lift houses
So I guess a one on one just ain't the best way about this 
But this is my situation, every week, life's a bitch 
I'll probably get nominated and kicked out the Brits

'cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind the 'on' switch, 
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick that real finer chick
Smiling with me
I try my best to not be aggressive but 
It's one of those days

It's always Kano getting in the madness
Me I'm in the corner sippin' on Champers 
But for some reason, I gotta face the 'all' on a rampage
It's so typical 
I'm no little fool 
And no I don't wanna sit and talk 
I take a Mo and sip it all 
Everyday it is so predictable 
When I don't mean the tunes we listen to 
I have mixed feelings but I dunno what I'm gonna do 
So here's what is and what isn't true
It's just one of them days
One of them raves
Where some of us ain't in the mood for bouncers
You might see me move some bouncers
Here's what I do to bouncers

'cause you're on the door, and turn me away
I'm moving to you
I'm known to spoon, and knock with my fists
I'll tuck your crew in 
I'm on the list, so don't take the piss
That's what you're doing
I'll try my best to not be aggressive
But it's one of those days
