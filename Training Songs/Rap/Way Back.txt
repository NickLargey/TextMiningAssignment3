Way Back

Oh, yeah if I could go back, way back, way back

[Chorus]
If I could go back, way back. 
I swoop that n**** E up in my Cadillac, and we could hit a corner, get a fat a** sack 
I'm checking for ya ladies, where ya at? 
If I could go back, way back 
I swoop that n**** E up in my Caddillac, and we could hit a corner, get a fat a** sack 
Yes, I'm checking for the ladies, where ya at?

Remember that cool a** n****, true thugs, my n****, that G that put me on
Thinking about it, it should'nt go wrong, why would a n**** Eazy-E, he gone 
Never really had a chance to say thank you for giving Mo Thug mo love, and now that you laugh and sing on up above, you gotta be laughing, n****s we set it off multi platinum

Stacking my chips, I'm dropping these hits down every hour 
And I been smoking these weed trees with them sticky leaves
Blaze to the mighty power 
Six deep in the Benz-O, 6-double-O thug stroll to the studio, little Lay, Kray, Biz, Wish, Flesh Here to rhyme so cold, rap flow never heard before

As we ride, as we roll, roll 
Reminiscing out the games we played 
Those were the days, those were the days 
Never let em slip away

[Chorus]

If I can go back, I be me and Stack, hitting, thugging it in drawely 
When all of this rapping was really a hobby 
Rolling in a Malibu, mobbing with Wally
To this day, feeling like yesterday, when it was Bizzy, Flesh, [Wish], lil?Lay, and Kray

We took a one-way ticket to L.A. 
Creeping on a come up, we had to meet Eazy, better believe me  
Them was the good times, dropping them good rhymes, yes indeed 
And you know we put it down for the love of the cheese, for the love of the game, and the real O.G.s
 
For the love of my Cs, I'm a let it be known
Hip hop thugsta, clique tight with the bones 
And a war been on since the first song 
Remember them Northcoast thugstas splitting your dome 

Hit em home with Tha Crossroads
Dedicated to the lost souls  
Bennefit ya, forever we miss ya 
Better believe that well never forget ya 

Take a picture and capture the moment 
On a quest for the best, its victory 
Nevertheless, we stress this history 
Is you feeling me, is you hearing me?

As we ride, as we roll, roll 
Reminiscing out the games we played 
Those were the days, those were the days 
Never let em slip away

[Chorus]

I sending my chrome upside your dome, hater, disrespect my home, n****, lets get it on 
Fifth Dog flipped out, and its on 
Oh no, y'all testing the Flesh-N-Bone, you wrong 

Too many true soldiers set up for murder, stuffed 
Unsolved, and it makes me wonder who really involved in killing our prophets. 
Crossing them off the list, b****es 
So we still on the rise, it ain't no surprise 

Beat us, so violent, rowdy Mo Thug riders 
Eazy said it, real n****s don't die 

[Chorus x2]

This is for my homies
