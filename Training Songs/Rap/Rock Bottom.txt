(Let me hit some, let me get some
Let me hit some, let me get some)

The ship's sinkin' and the captain's asleep
Now I've been steady drinkin' since New Year's Eve
I've got a whole lotta nothin' but it's all for me
Savin' my pennies for the lottery
I'm a king bee baby, don't take no jive
And I go buzz buzz all around your hive
And that's just 'cause I was born to die
And it's with much love that I say goodbye

I solve the catch 22 with the Colt .45
When the rent's due and there's nowhere to hide
So where do you go when your soul is rotten?
I’ma get high till I hit rock bottom

All or nada
Through Hell and high water
Gotta do what I gotta
I’ma get high till I hit rock bottom
All or nada
Through Hell and high water
Gotta do what I gotta
I’ma get high till I hit rock bottom
(Let me hit some, let me hit some)

The tent’s burnin’ and the pope is dead, should I
Save the day or hit the opes instead?
I stay loyal to the foil
Burnt Reynolds,
Makin’ the ladies of the 80s just tremble

Bitch (bitch) you can’t get close to
Meetin’ my Ferrari Testa Rosa
Nowadays, they shave their chocha
Strict regiment of cigarettes and soda
And I ain’t even talkin’ ‘bout Cola
I freak hoes like a cop meets quota
What do you do when you’ve been forgotten?
I’ma stay high till I hit rock bottom

All or nada
Through Hell and high water
Gotta do what I gotta
I’ma get high till I hit rock bottom
All or nada
Through Hell and high water
Gotta do what I gotta
I’ma get high till I hit rock bottom
(Let me hit some, let me hit some)
