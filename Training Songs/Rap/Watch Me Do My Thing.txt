Yeah

Fly like an eagle through the sky
Makin' more money than you can and I don't try
I'm on that level, that money makin' rebel
Checkin' for my pay, no way

Can I settle for less than the best
Won't you make that purchase?
They know my material needs will surface
That's the only way I swang
Watch the way I do my thang

I can do anything
I wanna do, oh, in my life
You, you know you like the way I kick my game
I'm not ashamed to do my thing

Right now I feel so good inside
Doin' what I want
Right now I feel so good inside
Doin' what I want

Watch me do my thing
I like to do my thing
Watch me do my thing
Everybody sing

Watch me do my thing
I like to do my thing
Watch me do my thing
Everybody sing

Lady, I'd do almost anything for you
Anything your heart desires
It's easy to fulfill your needs
Because you believe in me

Right now I feel so good inside
Doin' what I want
Right now I feel so good inside
Doin' what I want

Watch me do my thing
I like to do my thing
Watch me do my thing
Everybody sing

Watch me do my thing
I like to do my thing
Watch me do my thing
Everybody sing

Yo, Batman and Romeo give me the mic so I can flow
LDB make it funky from here to Mexico
I can do it fast or slow, it really doesn't matter though
'Cause I'm a pro
What you say? You wanna take me toe to toe?

Uh, no dude, I don't think so
My crew is strapped my style is phat
And Immature's got my back on this funky track
You want fries with that
Coo coo cachoo, what you gonna do?

Watch me do my thing
I like to do my thing
Watch me do my thing
Everybody sing

Watch me do my thing
I like to do my thing
Watch me do my thing
Everybody sing

Welcome to the hip hop, the home of hip hop
You don't stop the way we rock, yo, Batman
24/7 around the clock, this is Eddie here from Good Burger
Are you shocked? [Incomprehensible]
Watch me do my thing

Watch me do my thing
I like to do my thing
Watch me do my thing
Everybody sing

Everybody sing
I like to do my thing, baby
My thing, my thing, my thing

Watch me do my thing
I like to do my thing
Watch me do my thing
Everybody sing
