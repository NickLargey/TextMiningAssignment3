[ Ant Banks ]
Huh
I mean
This is nothing, man
Bosses will be bosses, man
Hey V, what's happening, baby?
Talk to me
[ Vidal Prevost ]
Hey man
This ain't no harder than drivin a big wheel 
through a Georgia cotton field, man
This ruthless
The original game detector
Yeah
You know what I mean?
About you niggas smugglin, switchin, you know what I mean?
Runnin off with all my game..
[ Ant Banks ]
Oh boy
[ Vidal Prevost ]
All over, man
[ Too $hort ]
Oh, who really made this shit possible, nigga?
Them Town niggas
[ Vidal Prevost ]
Eassyde!

[ Ant Banks ]
Now let me take you to the Land that's still the greatest
Where the game we display is real contagious
It's filled with players, real gees and innovators
Beatin on haters like the Oakland Raiders
At the club we dance with a gangsta limp
Players pop collars and pose like a pimp
Strike out in the fall, ridin a haul
Now who the hell you thought taught rappers to ball?

[ Too $hort ]
10'000 studio sessions
Up all night, gotta count your blessings
You better take lessons
Who you testin?
We taught you everything you know, ain't no guessin
Like Iceberg Slim and Donald Goines
Town niggas from the Bay got it goin on
Spittin game, that's what you like 
So when I'm rappin on the mic, don't bite
Biatch

[ Dionne Jackson ]
Did you know we do this all the time?
Are you trying to find some peace of mind?
All you need to do is let us lead the way

[ Ant Banks ]
I mean
Oh boy
Pimping, this is what we do all day, every day

[ Dionne Jackson ]
Are you looking for that place to go
Where the true players kick game for sho'
All you need to do is let us lead the way

[ Dolla Will ]
Bosses will be bosses
So quick

[ Dolla Will ]
Yeah, it's the new millennium, yeah, Y2Yey
We been puttin it down right here in the Bay
Keepin new game to spit, what is it?
While the game ?proof? your ear ?hustle takin a nap? like they invented it
All in your video poppin your collar
What is it? That's a Bay thing, take it from Dolla
I'ma tell you what's real, ain't no time to play
We here to stay, the whole damn Yey, let me sweep away

[ Captain Save'm ]
I got kids that look up to me, and you can bet
I even made on-line investments on the internet
With overnight Fed-Ex's and faxes
Young producers and C.E.O.'s worldwide makin it happen
Independent distribution was the solution
For the cd's and computer-generated barcode we was usin
Street teams posted at the retail shops
Movin units out the moms & pops

[ Dionne Jackson ]
Did you know we do this all the time?
Are you trying to find some peace of mind?
All you need to do is let us lead the way

[ Vidal Prevost ]
Either you gon' be with it or without it
But us Bay Boys, we gon' be about it

[ Dionne Jackson ]
Are you looking for that place to go
Where the true players kick game for sho'
All you need to do is let us lead the way

[ Ant Banks ]
I mean
This is a everyday way of living for us pimping
Oh boy

[ Vidal Prevost ]
From doin burn-outs in old school Coupe De Villes
To popping x and gettin court dates for shootin to kill
Who was the first artist you ever heard to say the 'be	-i'
And what was the first cd you ever known to keep it p-i
Who was the first to work the ???? creases with the Levi's
The same soldiers on the frontline claimin Eastside
Oakland, known for totin, we showboatin
Rockin Roleys in 500's and keep the tires smokin

[ Ant Banks ]
It's rough in the hood tryin to raise your seed
want to hide all your problems, blaze the weed
A lot of homies is dyin, boy, I gots to live
Before I go I better stock a grip for my kids
And that's all that counts to me
But what it amouts to be
Is who will look out for me
(If I) didn't turn out to be
A gee, laced with game essential
I'm tryin to keep my kids from goin through what I went through

[ Dionne Jackson ]
Did you know we do this all the time?
Are you trying to find some peace of mind?
All you need to do is let us lead the way

[ Vidal Prevost ]
It's real simple, man
Follow the boss and you will never get lost like what

[ Dionne Jackson ]
Are you looking for that place to go
Where the true players kick game for sho'
All you need to do is let us lead the way

[ Ant Banks ]
