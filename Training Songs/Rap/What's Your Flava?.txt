What's your flava 
Tell me what's your flava 
Tell me what's your flava 
Tell me what's your flava 
Tell me what's your flava 

I met this fly girl in a club
Went by the name of pecan deluxe
This ice cream was high maintenance
When I took her out 
Nearly cost me twenty bucks
Met this chick named walnut whip
Nearly made me sick 
To the point of throwin up
So I called chocolate chip
With the sweet toffee crisp 
And I still can't get enough

You're what I want
You're what I need
I want to taste ya
Take you home with me
You look so good, girl
Good enough to eat
I wonder if I could peel your wrapper
I could be your fantasy

What's your flava
Tell me what's your flava 
Tell me what's your flava 
Tell me what's your flava 
Tell me what's your flava 

I take 'em in the middle of July
With the drop top down
In the park when it's summer, and
These ice creams lookin' so fly
That I just can't lie 
It all seems too bewildering
They got these grown men runnin round
Screamin out actin worse 
Than children, but who
Know better flow better stack cheddar
Get more tongues wetter 
Than this ice cream veteran

You're what I want
You're what I need
I want to taste ya
Take you home with me
You look so good,
Good enough to eat
I wonder if I could peel your wrapper
I could be your fantasy

What's your flava
Tell me what's your flava 
Tell me what's your flava 
Tell me what's your flava 
Tell me what's your flava 

Hey, I'm takin 'em apple and cinnamon
Girls I'm feelin em' 
Can't stop lickin 'em
That's why they got me dribbling
Hot fudge sauce and it's 
All over my timbalands
I take them caramel 
With a hint of vanilla
With a little chocolate sprinklings
They make me spend my dividends
These sweet things 
Make me feel like a kid again

You're what I want, you're what I need
I want to taste ya, take you home with me
You look so good, good enough to eat
I wonder if I could peel your wrapper
I could be your fantasy

What's your flava
Tell me what's your flava 
Tell me what's your flava 
Tell me what's your flava 
Tell me what's your flava 

I want chocolate, I want toffee yeah girl
I want vanilla girl, to rock my world
(What's your flava, tell me what's your flava)
(What's your flava, tell me what's your flava)
(What's your flava, tell me what's your flava)
(What's your flava, tell me what's your flava)
