featuring Money Boss Players 

[?1] 
A while ago  just want you to know 
Just who you're listenin to (say whaaaaat?) 
So listen let me tell you 
Who I am  and what I do 

Chorus: Sadat X and ?2 

[Sadat X] 
Check it out  the Wild see O W be	 O why's 
[?2] 
And we the capital M to the be	's to the P's 
[together] 
Money Boss and the Wild Cowboys  goin down in history  well... 

[Sadat X] 
Makin moves with my cats  it's the Money Boss Players 
It don't pay to have money if you ain't stackin layers 
When I say Wild Cowboys the name says it all 
I'm like your favorite, tell your man whatchu want to tell him 
I run styles, stack piles, more than a thousand empty vials 
The new rhyme era, makes me the New York terror 
Bronx niggaz hold ya corner if it's your girl get up on her 
And bodegas across the street, holdin guns 

[?3] 
It's mad heat niggaz on the quest to get the riches 
Fives threes or stitches 
Dicin dumb bitches 
Ridin in the sixes, windows tinted 
On the Rover, but now it's over 
The cocaine game is now sober so move over 
You're better off walkin nowadays 'cause cars is coffins 
So here lies New York for extortion and I'm off in 
any nigga in my path, fast you can ask 
Big Guy, see-Deb, and Lord, Trey Bag, and Cheeba Don 

[?4] 
AIyyo if you didn't know I'm from the Boogie 
keep a hoodie and start a nigga 
and flip a brick for the triple figures 
It's the young cat, black push wigs facts and brackets 
Bronx drug traffic, soldier heads wreak havoc 
It's the SB, from the one-six-sluggy, but yo 
I'm A-Solo with a pair of Peps and my Polo 
Peep my flow so, the Mafioso sell coco 
I'm chillin, prepared for all the snakes I might microwave 

Chorus 

[Cheeba Don] 
I keeps it low creepin, the cuban link peepin 
I plays the back of the Ac, with the tints half cracked 
Blowin smoke thinkin, about BM's and rims 
But my left and rights, ain't pushin nothin but some Tims 
Talkin bout (Cheeba), you got flow yeah (Cheeba) 
You got dough yeah bankrolls fly clothes yeah 
Chickenheads, swearin, they Buttafouco 
Just because they got a sixty dollar pair of Parasuco 

[?6] 
Well it's your franchise, I play Tims and BM's 
Knots, twenties and tens, blacked-out P's with rims 
I spring drops plus invest in spots 
So I can float yachts, while my crew play the lot 
Five hundred grand, me and my fam livin flam 
Money Boss comin through, with the grand new Land 
I play the back seater, me and Cheeba smokin reefer 
My crew got bricks, pushin sticks, lookin sick 

Chorus 

[?7] 
Well bust the collaboration, the Cowboys and the Players 
Money Boss from uptown to watch these Bronx niggaz lace this 
Sadat pass that pot, twist up so we can rock 
Get this louie and yo Mayor Rudy need to get popped 
For any altercations, we bring the beef to the streets 
That's word to mother, cause niggaz love the industry beef 
MC's is plastic just like the glock they packin 
Makin noise with some Wild Cowboys but not from daps 

[?8] 
Aiyyo these prophets is makin profits, street dimensions 
Niggaz died to play BM suspensions 
Niggaz minds is cluttered, ghetto blocks they stay flooded 
Crack sales prevail, niggaz murdered for half a hundred 
I live amongst players nigga these streets is ferocious 
New York, New York -- f*ck screamin coastes kid 
Fuhrealla, you ain't a killa till you killed the killa 
The Uptown endorses, the Money Bosser 

[Minnesota] 
Listen, like a player got bad bitches, the feds got snitches 
I play these streets for what they worth, BX my place of birth 
Bronx New York, stop the bank, went out and thanks spendin mon 
So f*ck a bitch, hocus pocus watch this broke nigga turn rich 
All you clown niggaz banned Money Boss sets the trends 
False rehearsal, all your rhymes sound like a car commercial 
Lay my shit down, world renowned, take your paper 
Minnesota I'm that nigga talkin trap with my Players 

Chorus 

Money Boss and the, straight flossin the 
The Cowboys in the, makin noise in the 
(repeat 2X and variations to fade)
