Seen two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I’m just paranoid
(And this is the remix!)

I got a bad light skin from Cali
She be in the club with all baddies
Little momma used to be my main bitch
But now we don’t speak the same language
I love my bitch, I could bang it
From my dark skin bitch know how to take dick
She say them red bottoms old now
You never heard of Dolla $ign, bet you will now
Tell 'em both of my bitches drive Range Rovers
None of my bitches eat leftovers
Both of my bitches look good as f*ck
Your bitch look like booga wolf

Seen two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I’m just paranoid

Yeah, I’m paranoid, I’m trippin'
I’ve been smoking, I’ve been sippin'
I’m fuckin' 'round with two bitches
But I never made them hoes my miss's

Got bad Spanish bitches in Miami
Shit, All the bitches Spanish in Miami
I'm get pussy like I am me, hating ass niggas can't stand me
Flown cross country out to Cali, work it out like Bally's
Introduce the hoes to my homies, titties feeling all silicony
All my bitches play sleepover
And then we f*ck, and then we bussin' do the sheets over
And then we f*ck and then we f*ck and then we buss
None of my bitches wan' f*ck with you (F*ck with you)
All of my bitches eat pussy too (Yes they do)

If I give a f*ck about a bitch, I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking endo to smoke
I get in with tooty, niggas acting looney
Do you, let your girl do me
Now I got a bitch out in Oakland, got a bitch in the A
Got a bitch out in Portland, got a bitch in the Bay
Got a bitch out in Queens, got a bitch in the Valley
I be reppin' the East, while I'm smoking the Cali, ha
Man this shit here getting risky
Feeling like $hort with bitches
Paranoid, rolla toya
Now I'm ballin' like A.I. on the Hoyas (swish) bitches moist
High getting bent, bitches got paranoid gotta be the Henn', then again
I be pimpin' like Hugh Heff, seen two of my bitches two step

I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I’m just paranoid
