Baby, show me what you feel
Come to me, show me somethin' real
I need to know, I need you completely
Closer baby closer, come on let's begin
Love is takon' over, gotta let it in
Oh I need to feel the heart of you
Need to reach the very deepest part of you

[Chorus]
Can I touch you there,
Touch you deep inside
Can I touch your heart ,
The way you're touchin' mine
Can I touch you there,
Touch you deep within
Can I touch you there,
Can I touch you... there

Baby tell me with your eyes
Tel me every secret darlin'
Every deep desire, till you and I
Are makin' love completely
Closer baby closer, can't be close enough
I can't help the way I hold you
I just hunger for your love
Ooh I need to feel the heart of you
Need to reach the very deepest part of you

[Chorus]

All I want to do is touch you baby
Touch the very soul inside of you
Ooh I need to feel the heart of you
Need to reach the very deepest part of you
Let me be the one to show you
Just what love can do

[Chorus]
