Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
There is no one like me
Th-th-there is no one like me, (Chiddy bang) like me
Manners, take a second look and you’ll see
(Hell we're pretty much amazing)
There is no one like me (Yeah)
There is no one like me, like me
(Mind your manners)
There is no one like

And all the people should be raising they glasses
Flow crazy, celebrating the madness
I never thought I would deliver no classics
Then I hooked up with them and then delivered mo classics
I be keeping it true, hotel good long as I can peep on the view
Like like, damn how high are we?
They gotta gamble in this life, Charles Barkley

I’m over protected, through the dopest of methods
Now my vocals perfected, this is audio breakfast
Yes, so tell a hater here’s the slammer
I know they hating on us, but mind your manners

Manners, take a second look and you’ll see, (And you’ll see)
There is no one like me, (Like me)
Th-th-there is no one like me, (Like me)
Like me (L-l-l-l-like me)
Manners, you better reconsider, (Consider)
'Cause you will never do better, (Do better)
There is no one like me, (Like me)
Like me (L-l-l-l-like me)

Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
(See this is etiquette right here, you know what I'm sayin')
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba there is no one like me
(Mind your manners)
There is no one like me
(Mind your manners)

So say la la la, I arrive a lot
Black-eyed I am, I surprised a lot
And I can’t rely, on another guy
I was caterpillared into a butterfly
I’m living in the moment, why won’t you go and own it?
And we don’t got the spirits, at least we could condone it
Order sake homey, I be sipping Thai Ku
And you get the wrong number if I don’t like you

Say I’m the man, tell me why I gotta lie too?
Anybody I’m the best, girl let me advise you
Why? Because I’m feeling invincible
Junior high school I had a crush on the principal
I guess I was turned on by the leadership
Now we got the game wrapped up on some pita shit
So tell a hater here's the slammer
I know they hating on us, but mind your manners

Manners, take a second look and you’ll see, (And you’ll see)
There is no one like me, (Like me)
Th-th-there is no one like me, (Like me)
Like me (L-l-l-l-like me)
Manners, you better reconsider, (Consider)
'Cause you will never do better, (Do better)
There is no one like me, (Like me)
Like me (L-l-l-l-like me, your manners)

Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
(We gonna be here forever, man)
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba
(Mind your manners) there is no one like me
(Chiddy) there is no one like

Say fool, Sam (Mind your manners)
Pretty much till they kick me out the booth
And we pretty much amazing

Manners, take a second look and you’ll see
There is no one like me (Mind your manners)
The-the there is no one like me,
(Yeah this is etiquette) like me
Manners, you better reconsider
'Cause you will never do better
There is no one like me, like me
(Mind your manners)
Manners, take a second look and you’ll see
Oh wait
(Mind your manners)
