Now your girl said you were out looking for me
If so, then you need to come and see
If you're ready for a night that you will never forget
I'll give you pleasure and real love
If you let me

Baby tell me what it is you want from me
Don't beat around the bush if you want my body

If you want it girl, I got it
Come and get with me
Girl I'll turn your body inside out
And bring ecstasy
If you want it, baby come and bring your body to me
If you need it, girl I got it, got it
Got-got-got got it, come on

Trust me girl
You need to come with me
I've searched all around the world
Finding you is like a dream
When we wake up, you won't feel the same about me
Cause you'll realize 
You're life won't be the same without me, whoa

Baby tell me what it is you want from me
Don't beat around the bush if you want my body

Just you and me
I told you bring your body, to me
And tell everybody about me
The things I'll do to your body
You'll love me and we can be

Uh, uh
I need a hot thug who can handle this
And in the hot tub with the candles lit
I got the Crisy-Cris on the bottle of ice
Like Biggie Smalls say, we fuckin' tonight
JE Heartbreak, make it flow better
Making love on a bed full of rose petals
Just hold on tight cause my love is real
I make you feel ecstasy without the pill
I wonder how many licks do it take
To make you, break you, make your body shake
Make my inside out
Ride out, spend a week in Hawaii, hide out
And if you want it you know that I got it
Give it to me daddy, you know that I'm bout it
And if you throwin' that shit
I'ma do my thing and throw this ass back at at you like a boomerang

Baby tell me what it is you want from me
Don't beat around the bush if you want my body
