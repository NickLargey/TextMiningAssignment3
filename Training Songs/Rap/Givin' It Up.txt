Now the funny thing is that I never thought that I
Would ever give in till I realized
That everything I need I found in your eyes
So I stopped my soul searchin', yeah

All the girls and the games, just the same old shit
I'm puttin' it down 'cause I'm sick of it, yes I am
'cause a life with you is what I'm makin'
So I decided, oh Lord, listen

I'm givin' it up
Runnin' the streets with my boys an'
Givin' it up
Steady smokin' gonna destroy me
I'm givin' it up

No more watchin' other ladies
Givin' it up
Oh yes, I'm givin' it up
Look here, I'm givin' it up

Oh, I'm givin' up my everything
Givin' it up
I'll give it up for you, baby
I'm givin' it up

I know it might sound crazy
Givin' it up
Oh yes, I'm givin' it up
Oh, I'm givin' it up for you, oh yeah

Now the chronic, I ain't even gonna lie
I love it but I put it aside for you
You worth it, yes you are
You know what? I'll even stop cursin', yeah
I'll give up up the streets and start workin', oh yeah

Now here's a method to my thinkin'
Rather be twisted on you 'stead of creepin'
And watchin' the game, I don't need it
'cause you're the only all star that I'm seein'
Yes, you are, oh sugar, listen

I'm givin' it up
Runnin' the streets with my boys an'
Givin' it up
Steady smokin' gonna destroy me
I'm givin' it up

No more watchin' other ladies
Givin' it up
Oh yes, I'm givin' it up
Look here, I'm givin' it up

Oh, I'm givin' up my everything
Givin' it up
I'll give it up for you, baby
I'm givin' it up

I know it might sound crazy
Givin' it up
Oh yes, I'm givin' it up
Oh, I'm givin' it up for you, oh yeah

Some of ya'll know what I'm talkin' about
When I say I'm gonna give it up
Fellas, if you feel me
Look towards your lady and tell her

Baby, I admit it, I got a couple bad habits
But girl, I would give it all up for you, baby
Baby, I admit it, I got a couple bad habits
But girl, I would give it all up for you, baby

I'm givin' it up
Runnin' the streets with my boys an'
Givin' it up
Steady smokin' gonna destroy me
I'm givin' it up

No more watchin' other ladies
Givin' it up
Oh yes, I'm givin' it up
Look here, I'm givin' it up

Oh, I'm givin' up my everything
Givin' it up
I'll give it up for you, baby
I'm givin' it up

I know it might sound crazy
Givin' it up
Oh yes, I'm givin' it up
Oh, I'm givin' it up for you, oh yeah
