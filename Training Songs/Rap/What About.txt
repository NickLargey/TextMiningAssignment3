What is gonna happen to us?
Think about the children
And all the things you promised me

You say you wanna leave
Without giving me a reason at all
Boy, I don't understand
What about all these plans we've made
You vowed that you would stay
Do you wanna be a man about it
Can we talk about it
Don't just leave

1 - What about faithful
(What about, what about faithful)
And all those things you promised me
What about the children
(What about, what about the children)
And how in love we used to be

At night I lay awake
Hoping you will take the time to call me 
I hardly see your face
We miss you night and day
How could you just turn and walk away
Do you wanna be a man about it
Can we talk about it
Don't just leave 

Repeat 1

What about the house, the cars
The papers and the mortgage?
(What about, what about)
And our estate that we both own
How could you dare break up our happy home
(Oh boy, what about my)
What about my life
You made me your wife
What is gonna happen to us?
