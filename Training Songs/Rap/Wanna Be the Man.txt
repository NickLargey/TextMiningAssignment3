Yo! bust this! 
I got a plan to take you by the hand 
And whisper in your ear that 
I want to be your man 
So understand the bottom line plan 
I do do do do want to be your man 

You've been on a mission baby 
To find the man in your life 
You heart, it's been illin' baby 
To find someone to treat you right 

The question now is me 
Will it hurt ya to believe 
The love you see in my eyes 
Tho distant you choose to be 
My sincerity will bring you around in time 

[Chorus]
Want to be want to be want to be want to be 
Want to be I want to be the man in your life!!! 

Right now I need your attention 
And be the man when you talk 
That you mention your old lover 
He don't need no extension 
Cause he's out and I'm whatcha missin' 

I've got a vision baby 
I can see a change coming in sight 
My heart's open to you baby 
I feel our love coming to light 

Alone you do all right 
My love will take you high 
Higher higher, higher higher 
I'll be there by your side 
On clouds we will ride 
Through the raining storm 

I need a minute and I'll be in it 
You've got the love 
And you know I want to win it 
Stop looking 'cause you've been found 
And your love is cold 
Sweeter than a chocolate mound 
So give it to me and understand 
That I'm the one who want to be your man 
I gotta plan to take you by the hand 
Cause I want to, want to, want to, want to, be your man 

Bust it! 
Yo! 
Let's dance yeah 

Funky music and this is def 
The kickin' sound of EWF 
And they do it like nobody else 
Hyped up like myself yeah! 

[Chorus]

Hold on baby, 
Wait a minute 
So give it to me 
And come my way and be my lover 
For the rest of my days 
Give it to me 
And come on through 
Cause I want to, want to, want to, want to be with you 

[Chorus]
