(And meanwhile, on the south side of town)

[Chorus]
Now, when you're rollin' through yo' motherfuckin' hood
What do you see?
(I see some motherfuckin' G's)
Now, when you're rollin' through yo' motherfuckin' hood
Tell me what you see
(Some motherfuckin' G's)

Roamin' in my motherfuckin' hood and thangs
Seems to me my motherfuckin' hood done changed
'Cause niggas used to kick it with the rival gangs
But now we gots to deal with them survival thangs
Forty-five in my lap when I'm on the creep
Niggas livin' shife, so I roll one deep
'Cause now they see me flippin' in the 1-9-9-4
C.S.I. nigga, black eight-fifty
And now they lookin' at me crazy
But off-brand niggas can suck a dick, because they can't fade me
And if it came down to the gun, black
I never cracked up on the pressure, 'cause I was trained for combat
So get yo' motherfuckin' boys together
I represent S.A., nigga, and we makin' noise forever
And gettin' paid at the same time
So you respect a muthafucka when a muthafucka claim mine
'Cause if you disrespect, you ass out
And they be rolling through yo' shit in the glasshouse
Actin' bad with the flashers on
Makin' niggas get they asses on
'Cause ain't no mutherfuckin' love for fools
Who come around this muthafucka trying to scrub, you fools
It ain't no haps on it, hops
We snaps on the cops
And straps on the glocks
And take the law into our own hands
'Cause you ain't fucking with a rookie, nigga; you fucking with a grown man
And we gon' show you what we mean by funk
Muthafucka, you ain't see my trunk
I got a (SK) and a (AK)
And a (12 gauge) that'll f*ck a nigga whole day
So recognize a real nigga from the streets
When you rolling through yo' mutherfuckin' hood, what do you see? 

[Chorus]

Hollerin' at my homie at the swisher house
Scope a forty bag, and we hit the spot
Put my shit in park, and got up under the tree
Pull the swishers out and gave the ganja to three
Rapped us up a fattie, and we started to smoke
Eyes gettin' red, 'cause we higher than coke
A nigga chillin', 'cause it's all good
And we ain't trippin' on the bullshit, nigga, because we all hood
But other niggas don't want to see it that way
But all I got to say is: you don't want to see that S.A.
Because we're all upon a mission
Killin' don't make us no different
And dyin' don't make it no different
'Cause I done been to mo' wakes in this past year
Than the motherfuckin' Bingos lost last year
So ain't no motherfuckin' thang for me
To kill a nigga who ain't fuckin' with the gang with me

[Chorus]

Formaldehyde smokin', niggas gettin' locked and
Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
Scoping, hoping for you to f*ck up and slip
So we can have a reason for fuckin' up your shit
(It ain't no motherfuckin' peace when they see me)
'Cause we never had a motherfuckin' peace treaty
So I know I got to get 'em with game
And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thing
'Cause it's kill or be killed; never cut slack
And if you cut slack they bust back; f*ck that
I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
'Cause if they bust one time, that be the worst one
And that's the one that can close the shop
So you gotta stand and hold the glock
'Cause in my motherfuckin' hood, that's how it be
But when you're rollin' through your motherfucking hood, what do you see?

[Chorus]
