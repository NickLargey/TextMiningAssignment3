[Layzie Bone]
Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
A yo we aint always been accepted like this till (Listen to the wind blow)
A nigga got dat Grammy
Open the door nigga,

Bone Thugs got a story that's similar to Mike Jones
You can ask my homies
I'm memba back in the days they didn't want me
Now I blew up they all on me
They smiles phony
Its hard to determine who really is rich or which of these niggas is fake
They tryna eat out of yo plate
And you cant get a break
Now how much can you take
For heavens sake
I cant wait they gone be
(Listening to the wind blow)

[Krayzie Bone]
Sittin' back blowin' on indo
Waving wit my middle finger hangin' out the window lets roll
Get yo muthafuckin' hand out my pocket
Now they wanna be wit a nigga
Feel like we partnas
Nigga we was lookin for a deal and you dodged us
Neva did call us
Where was yo promise
But now we ridin' by
(Listening to the wind blow)

[Wish Bone]
Nigga to the real to the sets
When it comes to the streets
Livin' peace so it can beat like a drum from the ghetto
Give all peace wont let is go
Say we wouldn't make it
Now we some of the greatest
Bumpin' through the trunk and yo ra yo radioooo

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
Yo don't love me now
And you'll never love me again
(You cant) you cant say it
You would never
?

[Layzie Bone]
For tru thugs from the double glock
A nigga ready to rumble
When trouble nocks
Two one way tickets straight off the block
We gonna this pay
Yall niggaz jus watch
'All eyes on me'
Like my name is Pac
Fuckin' hip hop clock
Gotta pass the glock
Takin' drastic shots
Till these bastards stop
When the casket drop
I be mashin' out
In brand new drop top flyin'nigga
(Listening to wind blow)

[Krayzie Bone]
Killin' them niggaz witta automatic weapon
When they step up
They get hit up wit the AK-47
Anybody tryna git the muthafuckin' blessin'
They betta not mess wit mine cuz I'm tellin'
Any you niggaz run up again
That it ain't no pretendin' go for sin u gonna git in
Boy you betta listen listen listen
(Listening to wind blow)

[Wish Bone]
If you get a change of foot
Inch for inch
You betta do it do it
Grab the game
Do it to it
Chase to chase
But still hood
Live it or love it
Dummies of the rocks
Duck up out of my hood hood hood

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

(Murder) mo murder them all [x4]

[Krayzie Bone]
? The wind blow
Never see me cuz I get ghost
So a nigga neva get close
I go fast or slow
No matter the tempo
Murda the instrumental
Murda the rhythm
I ride to the rhythm of murda
Its murda
This lyrical venom I serve a
Gone kill 'um at minimal murda
Nigga burn some some
Stick wit rans dats' that cash
Nigga you betta learn some (some some)
We got the hood hot lock
Even got the burbs bumpin' bumpin'
They probably tryna get in
Don't nobody wanna be left in the wind

[Layzie Bone]
Uh-oh
Niggaz that's not tryna listen to Bone
The early bird get the worm
Take the game by the throat and squeeze
Till the muthafucka broke believe
Its murda we wrote
Its dope that we serve on the curb to the booth
These niggaz don't feel it cuz we spit the truth
Aint never no fake and they got me to prove
Haters just hate and we do what we do

Let 'um talk to you in the face
Only because we blew up in they face
If was Bone hurtin'
If that was the case
I'll probably go loco and catch me a case
Nigga jus move and give me some space
When I let the wind blow in my face
Nigga don't quit till I finish the race
Number one is the place

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

[Krayzie Bone]
Now we ridin by [Repeat x4]
