Hip hop, that hop hop the hippy, when they
J-Kwon I'm known to stay pretty, when they
From the lou' we known to stay pretty, we be
Like the shine, I'm just like get it, get it
Do it mix, since when I said get it, hit it
No it don't but it sound good when I did it, did it
True gangstas, girl they let me hit it, hit it
Then we pass 'em, when they show off them

Now shorty you know how I do when I'm off in the club
Sipping apple juice too young to sip the bub
With my whole crew, about ten or fifteen thugs
All up in here, we not giving a what
And then I spotted shorty
Looking good and she's calling me
Small jeans, cute, had on a baby-tee
Looking like she want to get with me

Shorty! I came to get down
Well don't mess around in this party
I'm grinding on you, you grinding me too
Shorty! I'm feeling you, you're feeling me in this party
I know that you're down and baby I'm down
(I know that you're down and baby I'm down)
Shorty

Shorty's dancing all over me
I can feel the heat and girl you're sweet
The way you're grinding to the beat
Baby drop it, nonstop, back it up, shake your butt
Bring it on, baby I can see your thong
Now baby get in front of me
I like the way you move your body
The way you're looking at me
It's got me going crazy out of my head

Shorty! I came to get down
Don't mess around in this party
I'm grinding on you, you grinding me too
Shorty! I'm feeling you, you're feeling me too in this party
And girl I know that you're down and baby I'm down
(I know that you're down and baby I'm down)
Shorty

Look, look I ain't got to dance with the chick
Romance with the chick, hold hands with the chicks
They be wifin' em, ice dance on they on they wrist
I seen my initials when I glanced at her tits
Get, get to get it girl
So go on and get, get to get it girl
Another round of bub, 'cause she love this thug money
She love the club, c'mon

Shorty! I came to get down
Don't mess around in this party

Shorty! I'm feeling you, you're feeling me too in this party
I know that you're down and baby I'm down
(I know that you're down and baby I'm down)
