How do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

Feels so different being here
I'm so used to being next to you
Life for me is not the same
There's no one to talk to

Don't know why I let it go too far
Starting over is so hard
Seems like everywhere I try to go
I keep thinking of you

I just had a wake up call
Should have never let you fall
Baby, you were not the blame at all
When I'm the one that pushed you away

Baby if you knew I care
You wouldn't have never went nowhere
Girl I should have been right there

How do I breathe?
Without you here by my side
How will I see?
When your love brought me to the light
Where do I go?

When your heart's where I lay my head
When you're not with me
How do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

Girl I'm losing my mind
Yes I've made a mistake
Thought that you would be mine
Guess the joke was on me

Miss you so bad I can't sleep
I wish I knew where you could be
Another dude is replacing me
God this can't be happening

I just had a wake up call
Should have never let you fall
Baby, you were not the blame at all
When I'm the one that pushed you away

Baby if you knew I care
You wouldn't have never went nowhere (nowhere)
Girl I should have been right there

And now I wonder

How do I breathe?
Without you here by my side
How will I see?
When your love brought me to the light
Where do I go?

When your heart's where I lay my head
When you're not with me (I say)
How do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

I should’ve brought my love home, girl
And baby I ain’t perfect, you know
The grind has got a tight hold,
girl, come back to me
‘Cause girl you made it hard to breathe
when you’re not with me

Tell me, how do I breathe?
Without you here by my side
How will I see?
When your love brought me to the light
Where do I go?
When your heart's where I lay my head
When you're not with me
How do I breathe?

How do I breathe?
Without you here by my side
How will I see?
When your love brought me to the light
Where do I go?
When your heart's where I lay my head
When you're not with me
How do I breathe?
How do I breathe?
