F*ck the whole industry you tried to get rid of me?
Y'all must be kidding me y'all must be kidding me
Aye yo f*ck the whole industry come on
Staten Island come on hold me down
 
Monster cut truck balley shit
Champagne spilling while we hitting every bump that my Denali hit
Outfit is four thousand and better
The rhinestones in my Flintstones look crazy in my sweater
 
Pah it's not a big fairy tale that's my M.O.
F*ck bitches on the reg' with no problemo
Iceberg rabbits and the fox and more
Where I coped two more brought four for RZA
 
Bad Boy thank you for this special delivery
Catch me by the pool in my Tony Starks slippers
Wonder Woman armed Ghost is intelligent
Made thirty offa Def Jam I was killing 'em
 
Did cash on One-Sixteen I was feeling 'em

Show power the 'Child of the Ghetto' is born
Feet first preach give a speech I kick ya each verse
 
Groove let the shit just spit now it's dirt
Death pressing ya and ya like a hustler on the first ya need work
Stand by the grand high exalted
At your door with a portrait of the raw shit
 
Picture that while I spit anthrax
On your CD tape and wax so stand back
You don't really wanna jump the gun
In the airless flow with punctured lungs
Go 'head and stand there and bump ya gums
If ya want the problem we can hurry up and come bury ya
