Intro - RL]
Right now, I gotta rep where I'm from
North side, yeah, ghetto
Minneapolis, ghetto
I'm from the, ghetto
You know how we do, yeah

[Chorus]
For my people down South with gold in their mouth
For my people out East with a key in the couch
For my people out West that be bangin' it out
We ghetto ghetto ghetto ghetto (We)
For all my ladies that got airbrush on their nails (Ooh)
A little fire, roll some of that shit on themselves
Smoke a little weed and say it's good for their health
We ghetto ghetto ghetto ghetto

[Verse 1 - Posta Boy]
You know you ghetto when you front wit ya two-way
And gotta wash in cold water for the next two days
Shot, he was a lil' nigga eatin' the grub
My house so packed somebody gotta sleep in the tub
On the block niggas talkin' about they bust their gats 
But soon as the cops come niggas flush their crack
Why you stuntin' in the hood with a Mercedes Coupe
Still livin' with your mother, you a baby duke
You know all Harlem World and Minneapolis
Sittin' in the Caddilac we strap to this
Act straight it's the kid from the Tex
Posta, came to get it down wit the kid from Next
Black and white, America is like a raccoon
In my building the elevator is the bathroom
Ya'll know what the dizzeal, me and RizL
Real, recognize rizzeal

[Verse 2 - RL]
I didn't always have the six
I didn't always have the crib
So I gotta rep where I'm from
Even tho I live where I live
Back when I was a kid
How the city used to give
My momma money for groceries, 
Brown cartons of cheese
And vouchers for everything
Yeah
No matter how far I've come
I'll still represent where I'm from
I'm ghetto

[Chorus]
For my people down South with gold in their mouth
For my people out East with a key in the couch (Yea, yea, yea)
For my people out West that be bangin' it out
We ghetto ghetto ghetto ghetto 
For all my ladies that got airbrush on their nails 
A little fire, roll some of that shit on themselves (So ghetto)
Smoke a little weed and say it's good for their health
We ghetto ghetto ghetto ghetto

[Verse 3 - RL]
We run around with vice, Lords and G's
Russel Avenue a block after Queens
Roll in Cadilac, stoned D's
Grab Paulie and me and Nicky D's
It was me and J-Z
We in the park talkin' crazy
Now it's all good baby
Even after I got hooked up with KayGee
Yeah
No matter how far I've come (No matter)
I still represent where I'm from (Cuz I'm)
I'm ghetto (Ghetto yeah)

[Chorus]
For my people down South with gold in their mouth
For my people out East with a key in the couch 
For my people out West that be bangin' it out (I represent)
We ghetto ghetto ghetto ghetto (The ghetto)
For all my ladies that got airbrush on their nails (Uh-huh)
A little fire, roll some of that shit on themselves (So ghetto)
Smoke a little weed and say it's good for their health (Yeah yeah)
We ghetto ghetto ghetto ghetto (R-Hockey Stick yo)

[Verse 4 RL Rap]
From the ghetto, hood, gutta, street
Don't sleep cuz I'm R&B
What you know about checks on the 1st and 15th?
New kicks on the 1st and 15th
1328 RussellAve where
Cats used to hustle bad
With them wife killas and them 1-0 bags
Ha you don't understand me man
What you know about bein' frozen
With the furnace broken
So you sleepin' with the oven open
I been greedy always wantin' a mil, still
Nigga hungry even after the deal
I went from bein' poor, to Billboard
From the corner store, to the record store
My (Ghetto) and Postaboy
We ghetto

[Chorus]
For my people down South with gold in they mouth
For my people out East with a key in the couch
(Oh talkin' bout the ghetto)
For my people out West that be bangin' it out
We ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
For all my ladies that got airbrush on they nails
A little fire roll some of that shit on themselves
Smoke a little weed and say it's good for they health
We ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

[Bridge RL]
If you've ever had vouchers before
Bill-collectors knockin' at your door
Ran outta gas on the side of the road
Then you ghetto
Land Lord had to change the locks
Left your shit out front in a box
You tried to break in and he called the cops
Then you ghetto

We ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
We ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
We ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
