Ya know what I want 
Come here 
Nah, closer 
Check it 

[Chorus]
Pass some lovin' baby 
You're lookin' rather tasty 
I never take a small bite 
Got to last me all night 
After dinner we can see 
Just how long you'll be with me 
Slide that, real good, lovin' on 

I need a man with a big strong hand 
Packin' it in a gangsta stand 
The twisted dreads, not brushed babe 
Even with his hair shaved 
Ya need a brotha that'll speak his mind 
Never thinkin' twice about what he might find 
Pick me up in all ways 
Thought that (?) 
He won't

Call me up 2 hours late and tell me 
That our date ain't goin' on 
Other men knows that it's wrong, yeah 
He knows that
If he really wants these goods 
He could have it if he would 
Take off his clothes, and

[Chorus] 

I had brotha that had did me wrong 
Never took the time to listen to my song 
Never spent enough time 
Now I got to get mine 
When I say 'mine', I mean a new love thang 
Pressin' down the street with a ghetto swang 
Baby got it goin' on 
Really got it goin' on 
Baby 

Call me up 2 hours late & tell me 
That our date ain't goin' on 
Other men knows that it's wrong, yeah 
He knows that
If he really wants these goods 
He could have it if he would 
Take off all his clothes, and

[Chorus: x2]

Pass the lovin', need ya kissin' and ya huggin' 
You givin' me somethin' special 
Oh the man ain't never buggin' 
You got it goin' on from the flesh to the bone 
A rough neck tender always down with brown - stone 
I know that soon & very soon it's gonna be aiight 
So won't ya ring my numba, meet ya at my crib tonight 
We'll from A to be to see & then we'll jump to Q 
I'll blow your mind with all the nasty things I'm gonna do 
HeyxMG

[Chorus]
