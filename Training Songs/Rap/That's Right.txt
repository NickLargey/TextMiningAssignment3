This how I creep up on ya asses
See how the beat is building I creep up
(Just Blaze)
Let me show why'all what the f*ck I mean
Uh uh Jigga man ya heard?
Amillion ya heard?
Roc-a-fella ya heard?
The dynasty let's go

You pop Cris'? (That's right)
You a hot bitch? (That's right)
Make that nigga trick (that's right)
Get that dough, ma (that's right)
Let 'em know, ma (that's right)
Soon as you learn how to drive, make 'em put you in a five, mami

Yo you got dough (that's right)
Let it show (that's right)
If the money's slow (that's right)
You know the rest yo (buck buck buck)
For my thug niggas (right)
Bust a slug niggas (right)
F*ck that, get money, show love niggas 

Jigga man got Grammy's, sold grams, cops cannot stand me
Ladies want me to put cock in they hot panties
Big man on campus, six sedan
Over a hundred million made, niggas, shipped and scanned
Niggas cannot stop, knocking that big Pac,
Banging that big punch, poppin' my big gun quick
Run, duck as soon as the gun bust 
Forget where I'm from, be coughin' ya lungs up
Robbin' hood in a big truck
Pickin' the bums up
I never know when I can be down on my dumb luck
But the flow so tough I've been beatin' the drums up
Been hot so long like I'm heatin' the sun up
On the come up,ones and I'm beggin' niggas to run up
So I can take this heat and bang you to next summer
Number one rapper dippin' mo' mos'
Don't make me come press ya wit this fo0fo nigga

Five inch heels (huh)
Bitches want to grill (huh)

Oh come, come now 
Want to know where I'm from now 
Her's a little run-down

Pockets kinda plump now
Haters get the thumbs down
No need for all that, I never keep small stacks
Alright y'all lights out
Floss with the ice out 
Brag with the price out
Red-eye flights out 
Overseas hideout

Six drop shits

Any nigga that tell you money is the root of all evil ain't got shit
You a lying bitch
You rather live poor

'Nough said

Mami girl keep the doo rag
You know bag and shoes match
Get niggas for a few stacks
Quick to run through that
Broke niggas boo that
Bought my whole crew rap
The record I don't play around bitch I lay it down
Shit I only roll wit

6 double o whips 
Niggas that hold tips
Ice had ya hoes trip

F*ck with loose thugs 
Go collect them dubs
