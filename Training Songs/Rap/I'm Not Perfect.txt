We've been through things
Feels like we've been to hell and back
And the ones you've lost
I'd give my life if I could bring them back
(bring them back I'd give my life)
And your self esteem might be low from what people say (keep holding on)
Hold your head up high
I promise it's gonna be OK (ay oh hey)

I'm not perfect just like you 
(I'm not perfect)
So come on let me give you a hug 
(Come on let me give you a hug)
I got problems just like you (I got problems)
So don't nobody sit here and judge 
(Just like you)
I'm not perfect just like you 
(We're gonna stick together)
So come on let me give you a hug 
(Let's stick together)
I got problems just like you (woo oh yeah)
And everybody needs some love

When you're feeling bad
Some friends they can't be found
(Look around look around be found)
Cause some people love it just to see you when you're down (down yeah)
But it's ok pick yourself up
Start over again (that's what you gotta do)
If you try you will
You will succeed in the end
(The end I know you will oh yeah)

I'm not perfect just like you
So come on let me give you a hug 
(Come on and let me give you)
I got problems just like you (I got problems)
So don't nobody sit here and judge (oh yeah)
I'm not perfect just like you (no no no no)
So come on let me give you a hug 
(Come on and let me give you a hug)
I got problems just like you
And everybody needs some love

Shake a hand shake a hand y'all come on 
(Oh shake somebody's hand)
To every woman every man y'all come on 
(Oh to every woman every man)
Tell a friend tell a friend y'all 
(Ooh shake a hand with someone)
Cause united we stand y'all 
(United we stand by body we fall)

I'm not perfect just like you
I'm not perfect

I'm not perfect just like you
I'm not perfect just like you (oh)
I'm not perfect just like you (oh)

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
