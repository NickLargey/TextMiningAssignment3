Yeah uh
You know what this is
The fat gangsta!

[Chorus]
Maybe its the TS chain (I got em right)
Maybe its that Escalade (Come get em right)
Maybe its the way I do (Keep mamies like)
Joe I wanna f*ck wit you (Keep sayin' that)
I don't know what it is
All I know it that this chick
Is gon' leave wit me
Gon' creep wit me
Gon' freak wit me
Gon' leave wit me

I know it seems every song, is about like the same old thing
But when you rich, ain't nuthin' to do but fuckin' hang
Eat good, spend money, count chunks of change
Keep mah ladies lookin' good, when they touch the Range.
Never f*ck wit a bitch, if she can't be trained
Never leave wit a chick, if she don't give brain.
We could leave on trip, I got a private plane
I don't fly, but we could park it up and blaze.
Joe's the God
And I know you need somethin' to praise
Just have a lil faith, and you could be saved.
Uh, it's not mah fualt if they love the kid
It might be the chain or the whip
I don't know what it is.

[Chorus]

Um, I don't mean no harm
But their ain't a chick sicka then Remy Ma
And all the hot boys wanna f*ck wit Rem
And I don't turn em away
I'm like, I'm the bomb now.
Where's your gurl, don't matter to me
I'm way out of her league
She can't keep up to mah speed.
She's weak, she don't need to smoke weed
And wherever she's at
Is where she should be.
Now, where's your wife, I don't care
I'll be at the crib, when she ain't there.
Baby do mah nails, and lace mah hair
Take me out on trips and pay the fare.
Maybe.

[Chorus]

Damn, look at all the rocks he got
Ferrari drop 360,hard to top
The party's hot,all white linen affair
I'm doin the suit thang, white Nike Airs.
I'm in the middle of the crowd, like the Don is here.
Shorty whistlin in mah ear
Told me what she wanna hear,she said
"We thuggin'
Smokin' on sumthin'
Down to leave wit ya'll, As long as ya'll fuckin'."
Woo, thas how you do that there
See me wit mah boys, bring ya crew bak here
We ridin',she drivin'
On our way to the crib, long fish arrivin'.

[Chorus]

Maybe its the TS chain (I got em right)
Maybe its that Escalade (Come get em right)
Maybe its the way I do (Keep mamies like)
Joe I wanna f*ck wit you (Keep sayin' that)
I don't know what it is
All I know it that this chick
Gon' leave wit me
Gon' creep wit me
Gon' freak wit me
Gon' leave wit me

Gon' leave wit me
Gon' creep wit me
Gon' freak wit me
Gon' leave wit me
