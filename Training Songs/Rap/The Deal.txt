I signed my name with a smile
X marked the spot on the edge of denial

I got a deal one for two
And you said you’ll never have to settle on you.

I met the king of the rain
“Love for the pain?” I heard them say.
Here take my hands, wash them clean.
Cause I’m not the man I thought I dreamed.

Sometimes I’m dumb but I’ll never be numb
I can feel you.
You fill me like fire in my veins,
And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.

I might be lame but you move me the same
I can see you.
It’s a scene like stars in the day.
And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.

I threw my conscious away.
I’ve got my reasons, my problems today.
I turn and my heart skips a beat.
I see you running, smiling, welcoming me.

I might be dumb but I’ll never be numb
I can feel you.
You fill me like fire in my veins,
And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.

I might be lame but inside I’m the same.
I can see you.
It’s a scene like stars in the day.
And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.

Man, I’ve crashed out.
You know I’ve crawled for a mile.
And I’ve got pain, take it away.

I might be dumb but I’ll never be numb
I can feel you.

I might be dumb but I’ll never be numb
I can feel you.
You fill me like fire in my veins,
And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.

I might be lame but inside I’m the same.
I can see you.
It’s a scene like stars in the day.
And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.
