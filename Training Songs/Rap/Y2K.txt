When the smoke clears
You know who gon' be there
When the smoke clear yo
That's all we got to tell y'all right now
Y'all know who gon' be standing there right

See its our destiny to count G's an' a semi-squeeze
Shoot the breeze, volley how the computers might freeze
So I'm'a store water, guns, can foods and keep order
We spaz out you cats prepare for the slaughter
The struggle savoir, got my temple on the border
Line, ready to corner you off and get ???, said it
Screwball, read the credit, get your whole team wetted (Yo)
You dealin' with some loose cannons (Yo) ready to dead shit

I heard the world was over ahit suppose to blow like supernova's (Uh huh)
I'm on the hill high off the real, pumpin' my bolos (Yeah)
Prediction told us turn into rollers, don't let the street control us (What happened)
'Cause when those crackers pull the plug they gonna creep the holders
I send my deacon donors, black re-bels, who kill de-vels
And move through cells we rule this hell (Screwball)
Make it picture perfect cock it back and lay it out
Bomb the White House run up in the pentagon and spray it out

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey, do all they talk about is Y2K (Y2Kayyy)
Hey hey hey, load it up and let the tech nine spray 
Hey hey hey, do all they talk about is Y2K (Y2Kayyy)
Hey hey hey, load it up and let the tech nine spray

How many times sour limes and coronas
Powerful crimes in America, corna' to corna'
What'choo want to do, cops huntin' you
Aimin' for the kill, layin' still
Permanent forever chill in heavens field
Spreadin' doin' deals, more electric than eels
Respectin' the reals, countin' what'choo build
Prepare was heal journey, with hard times
Examine it, playa's have money at random
Sittin' pretty, sayin' come and get me

Standin' in front of the gates of hell
Smackin' niggas, pullin' out the gat on niggas
Sold crack, plus I'm a rappin' nigga
I got rhymes for days, I got gats that blaze
Ready for motherfucking war
See this is whatcha'll wanted, you know it got to be me (Screw B)
Everybody talkin' 'bout they whips with the TV
I need some of this motherfucking rap money
I'm sick of this motherfuckin' funny crack money
F*ck all y'all bitch ass niggas, y'all don't worry me
Screw be, QB, from here to eternity (To eternity)

[Chorus]
