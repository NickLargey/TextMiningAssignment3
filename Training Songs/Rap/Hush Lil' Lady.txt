Now you've been watchin' me
And I've been watchin' you
So I decided to just
Come and talk to you

Ain't tryin' to run no game
Just want to know your name
And by the smile
That's on your face

I see you feel the same
So can I talk to you and
Maybe after school
I could walk you home

If that's cool with you
And then later on
I'll call you on the phone
And then I'll make you mine
By singin' you this little song

Hush little lady
Don't you cry
Gonna bet that
I could show you

How to have a good time
Like me and you
Playin' after school
On the weekend
At the skating rink'll be cool

Hush little lady
Don't you cry
Gonna bet that
I could show you

How to have a good time
Like me and you
Playin' after school
On the weekend
At the skating rink'll be cool

Oh, oh, look
On the weekend
Me and you and some friends
We could go for a ride

In the back of the Benz
In the park take pictures
Me and you in the Hawk
Play games, hide-n-seek

Till it get dark
I like when you playin'
When you callin' my name
That's how I feel

Hope you feel the same
Stuffed dolls, merry-go-round
So me and you sit splash
Girl, how that sound, uh

I can tell you're feelin' me
And girl, it's plain to see
That you and me
We got a little chemistry

That's why I'm dyin' to do
Everything you want to do
Anything that you want
I can give, give it to you

So what's it gonna be
Is it gonna be you and me?
You gotta let me know
Don't keep me hangin' on

Tell me what I gotta do
To get it through to you
I want you to be my baby, so

Hush little lady
Don't you cry
