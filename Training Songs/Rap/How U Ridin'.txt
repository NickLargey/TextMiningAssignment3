How you ridin'? Gettin' bent behind tint you can't see through
And my rims way bigger than yours

Red truck, blue truck, green truck, black truck
Suburban, Excursion, that Tahoe, that 'llac truck
F*ck it a bucket, a Delta, a Cutlass
A Regal, a Montague whatever you thuggin'

It's suped up, it's couped up, it fold down with gray sound
When summer hit you gotta keep the roof up or it go down
That bad bitch now she be in that Mustang or that Sebring
Or stuntin' her ass off in that '05 her man bought

How much your paint cost? Look like it just got rained on
Tell me this when you stop do your rims stop or they keep goin'
Your Nissan, your Neon, your old man Caprice own
You finna take off them twenties and put them big 23's on

Watchin' the latest DVD's with the TV's on
It's hot AC in winter can turn your heat on
You hear them loud pipes as soon as you put your feet on
Bicycles, motorbikes, whatever you on the street on

How you ridin'? Want you ain't worried bout flossin'

What kinda motor up in it think it can f*ck with that Hemi

But that's the 415 shit I run with the 412

Hoes piled up in here all on laps be still
Can't wait to get to the room nimblin' on my ear
Y'all gon' get it just chill let me control this wheel

With a Beyonce face and some thighs like that
Attitude like Trina and a ass that fat

F*ck it I done told my cousin you can have that Lac
Gon get your shine on watch what I'm gon' snatch
I don't know but off the top I'm spendin' 85 stacks
With them cozy ass seats that massage my back

Jacksonville, Mississippi A-Town y'all niggaz wit me
They talk funny but them boys makin' money in New York City
Took some trips up to Houston be all the D-Town bootin'
Greg Street whats happenin' to they love that Gangsta Musik

If you gon' do it then do it from the Benzes to Buicks
Let your ends look stupid drop them up 22 it
Y'all niggaz is clueless don't you worry bout Trill
This another hit for y'all stupid clowns to steal
Game time
