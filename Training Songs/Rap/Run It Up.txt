You keep me decked out in the latest, takin' me to new places
Got me callin' my friends like, "Damn he's the greatest"
Said love is overrated, somebody lied, I’m faded
And the way you make me feel got me elevated
I don't ask questions
When you come around in that two seater, tellin' me that you're ready to go
I don't ask questions
You go out and you're tellin' me you got all this money to blow
Run it up, we run it up
I don't ask questions
I run it up, we run it up

Okay look flyer than a pilot at it's highest, I'm the flyest
I'm on weed and she on molly, I'm a king and she a goddess
Got codeine all in my body, got that dope since she a fiend
She say she need it in her body, plus she ain't seein' nobody
Promise you my world you're my favorite girl, I'm in love, bruh
Every single thing about her got me fucked up
I know every single thing about us stay between us
We made a promise, can't nobody come between us
Four thousand for the Yeezys, no limit on the Visa
Takin' trips to Ibiza
And we be coppin' red bottoms like sneakers
A cool million when you see us
They could never ever see us

Lately, I've been seein' you daily
On my mind like crazy, we should be like Jay and Bey
Baby you should come a little close to me
Take you 'round the whole globe with me
Treat you like a queen
Buy you everything, show you how life's 'posed to be
Girl you just don't know
Yeah, boy you just don't know, yeah
Baby I'd do anything, I mean anything
Just to go to sleep every night with you in my arms
She always mad when I ain't home, I be workin' late
Tryna put me out cause I ain't answerin' my phone
That was my mistake
If anything, know I got you, baby
If anything, every weekend I'm probably out of state
We gotta get paid
