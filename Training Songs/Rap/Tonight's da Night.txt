[Remedy]
Mic check, I walk around the Shao'
Wit the jet black nine by my waistline, kickin' the hype shit
I never claimed to be the best white rapper
But have to, show these muthafuckas what I'm after

I'm after ya soul, and after that, ya album
Beef after to that, Lounger Lo packs the gat, son
Chka-bang-bang, yo bust a slang wit my name
It's the Rem-D, on the six train

Sike, you muthafuckin' right, tonight's the night
To do what I want to do, to make you like, want to fight
What you expected when the darts been injected
I huff and puff and blow ya shit down, make ya head split

Huh, pop a pill, smoke a blunt and don't front
On the izim, if you do, my man, we gettin' bizum
A weak addict, oh yes, puff the magic
And smoke it 'til it's true, yes, I do, gots to have it

I don't care about any fuckin' star
'cause no matter who you are, you still catch a bullet scar
So listen up, or you'll bleed for what I'm sayin'
'cause tonight's the night, and me and my people's ain't playin'

[Interlude: Lounge Lo]
Yo, ain't supposed to be playin' man
Ah-yo, aiyo, what's that? That fat funky sting you're smellin'
"I'm a give it to ya, give it to ya, give it tonight" - female singer
Piss and pee, for I takeover there, man

Word up, you see it, ya'll, for real
I be the calling, man, aiyo Slash, hit me off one more time, baby
"Love me when you love you baby" - female singer

[Remedy]
You want to see me act fool, please, save it for the breeze
'Cause my lyrics in tracks, blow backs and buckle knees
F*ck the bullshit, I get down wit the two clips
And do shit, I shoot more shit then the troops hit

But tonight's tonight, whether wrong or right
This type of shit, wit the flavor like raw spit
Smokin' out, and it figures, it figures
The peeps around me, keep their fingers on the triggers

I keep a shorty between my lap cool, and flyin' down the freeway
Coppin' a wop 'cause it's "me-day"
Went over to pick my toys up, we make a lot of noise
'Cause, we can do that, cat, in my habitat

Yo, be nimble, I do the type of evil that men do
Like pissin' out my window on a bitch and her friend too
So turn the volume up a notch and let me in ya crotch
Bu-bump, I hit ya g-spot

That's the f*ck, when I jump at nature
Like, hump, hump, hump, hump, hump, hump
But if you want to see a dick gigantic, not romantic
More Slicker than my man Rick

You better check the White Pages, under Remedy
'Cause I ain't down wit no enemy
Distribution fucked up my first album
But this time I'm a let my fuckin' style run

[Interlude: Lounge Lo]
You, Jimmy Neutron, Frukwan
Hear another avalanche, huh, word up
"I'm a give it to ya, give it to ya, give it tonight"
I slip a mickey in ya bucket, push it up, real hard
Real hard, for sho', know what I mean
There's gonna be talkin'

[Remedy]
Wi-wi-wi-wiped by supply and demand
To expand my hand to the mic and let my mouth kick the phlim-phlam
I drink Bud, I drink Beck's, I gets mad drunk
I get a shorty in the forty, we go f*ck, yo, you

[Outro: Remedy]
Ah-yo take this shit off Charles man, ah-yo, put the new record on, man
Yeah, put that new shit on...
