[Memphis Bleek] 
Yeah...yeah, n****... 
Just Blazin' this s***, ya heard? 
It's ya main man...I'm back n****z...HOLLA! 

My break I'm fresh off it 
I never change, I'm stuck in these ways 
Nike Airs, sweats and Taurus (uh?) 
But I'm-a do it for my enemies 
They want to end my chill, want to see what that villa be 
Now what that sound like? 
Plus they know what a clip get down like 
Turn bags from bladders, legs to wheels, paint it peels 
'cause you f***in' wit' a n**** that'll jump out, raise the steel 
I live this way it's real...dog...no joke 
Blow smoke in ya b**** face, piss in ya wheels 
Slap ya custies, clap your workers, dead the strip 
Stick ya connect, yap ya b**** 
So let it be known I'm back for my grizzley 
The Sergeant, the Cap, the Mac holds 60 
For rookies and vets I'll bang 'til it click 
So run and tell ya duela the Ruger come wit' two clips, dog 
M-Easy, won't leave, my hood need me 
Pop fa' sheezy, who don't believe me? 
We all criminals but live like a diplomat 
We get low, when the dough low, get it back 

[Beanie Sigel] 
Here is something you can't understaaaaaaaaand 
How I could just kill a man for Killa Cam 
Me and my Roc killa fam, top billers man 
We run the spot, drop ceilings fam... 
Hit the wall drop ceiling fans 
Listen boar, man I show you how to fill a van... 
Up with killers man 
And line the trunk 
Keep a stash box for the nine and the pump 
The coach walk you through and he grind you up 
What-chu want the dope or the weed? 
How you want it packaged? In the cap or the bag? 
How you want me packin'? Wit' the mac or the mag? 
Yeah that Bent get back, but listen scrap...act real fast 
And keep a wack that'll gag ya back 
Block style from ya swagger, ya swacks 
It's the Broad Street Bully b**** 
I bully n****z on the broadest streets 
I house n****z on the narrowest BLOCK! 
Know my rules when the barrel get hot 
When the gun blows...and the shots fall...and the smoke clear... 
Man I be hearin' you murder (you ain't here!) 
Nobody hit up in the cross 'cause I'm observin' (you ain't here!) 
Nobody be missin' your loss 'cause you deserved it 
South Philly n****z kill at will, I keep my mac-milli CHILLY CHILL 
On the really-real, 'fore I make you n****z feel this steel... 

[Cam'ron] 
(Killa! Killa!) 

Go 'head stupid n****z go f*** wit' them chicks 
I'm the third little piggy, I'm-a f*** wit' them bricks 
Better yet the bakery I got pies and cakes 
N**** think doublin' is turnin' 5 to 8 
I turn 8 to 20, 20 to 100, 100 to 1000 
That to 100,000, in front-a housin' 
Closed 'em all down dog, no one's allowed in 
I'm coppin' everything I'm done wit' browsin' 
It's the top don, glock palm, dot com 
Get your s*** rocked ma like Haseem Rahman 
And I'm extra scary 
CEOs all the frontin' ain't necessary, I f*** wit' secretaries 
All for information...it ain't necessary 
They in love like the 14th of February 
Play 'em like April 1st right before I slide off 
It could be March 2nd, sound like July 4th 
Halloween or Memorial Day 
At your memorial be one year from today 
All why'all think it's peace and peachy 
I leave you reesy piecy, all my b****es rock... 
Christian Dior, BCBG...'round phony n****z get the heeby jeebies 
Hungry hoes say "Killa feed me feed me..." 
Calm down ma, easy easy 
Talk greasy, please me, get my man Weezy 
Still rock Ellesses, to squeeze appease me 
He ain't no tease but measly 
Not Doggy's Angels...KILLA...please believe me...
