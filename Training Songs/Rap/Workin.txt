Yea/
 Yea, eh eh
 Yea
 They're trying to get me out of my lane
 Asylum flow my s**t is insane
 Keep my name out your mouth don't say it in vein
 I smoke just to ease up the pain
 You and I ain't one in the same
 I do it no practice I peep most of y'all are hustling backwards
 My eye on the atlas
 Like look at the clients
 I got in my pocket I do this for profit
 Speak for my people who ain't never had s**t
 But hope and a dream
 The will of machines
 Ambitions to get out of hardships
 I'm talking the projects
 The bottom my n****a right out of the marsh pit
 Where life is the hardest
 Winters the coldest
 Learn how to live with two options
 To give up or try
 Try to survive
 F**k the stakes and just roll up the dice
 Shake the haters and wave em goodbye
 Keep chasing dreams so while I'm alive
 I'm out here workin'
 Workin'
 Man, you're out here lurking
 Hurting
 Man I'm out here
 Workin'
 Workin' Aye
 F**k the fame
 I'm ain't paying the price
 True to the game while you're living a lie
 I'm out here workin'
 Workin'
 Man, you're out here lurking
 Hurting
 Man I'm out here workin'
 Workin'
 Aye/
 F**k the fame, I'm ain't paying the price
 True to the game while you're living a lie
 Every day
 I pray for better days
 Trying to shine like the sun rays
 Stayed away from the block for the bread
 Even though we all know that crime pays
 I got kids I ain't trying to catch a case
 Pumping tracks call it pushing base
 Shout out if you never kept the faith
 When it's over at least I did it my way
 Never been one to just seat back and watch
 Had to go get it regardless the odds
 Of making it big or making it far
 Had to be NASA to see I'm a star
 Flew by the doubters who gave no support
 Asked me to change paid em' no mind at all
 Stuck in my ways
 I’m just caught in my zone
 No Jay or Ye but I'm Watching the Throne
 Skinny n****a ain't seen a gym yet
 It's funny how I'm raising the bar
 These other n****s here pose no threat
 They're finished as soon as I'm on
 You f**king right
 I am always keep my mind set
 Usually right when they tell you you're wrong
 So I'm going to go ahead and keep minding my own
 Stuck to the code till the day that
 I'm gone
 I'm out here workin'
 Workin'
 Man, you're out here lurking
 Hurting
 Man I'm out here workin'
 Workin'
 Aye F**k the fame, I'm ain't paying the price
 True to the game while you're living a lie
 I'm out here workin'
 Workin' Man, you're out here lurking
 Hurting
 Man I'm out here workin'
 Workin' Aye F**k the fame, I'm ain’t paying the price
 True to the game while you're living a lie
 Living a lie
 Living a lie
