Uh-huh, huh, uh-huh
Ahh-haa, ahh-haa, see..
When why'all heard that, all I'm doin is laughin at all why'all {niggaz}
That's been frontin on my mans and them man
These {niggaz} started this {shit} man

[Run]
When it comes to the shows that I rock and the flows that I drop
Y'all know Run killed the mic
Can't forget about the O's that I got, and the Rolls in the spot
Y'all know I'm still here right?
How you gonna take a old song, been around so long
So So Def, but made it tight
Then went from a deejay to an emcee
To the are-E-V like overnight
Everybody lookin, players get shook when
Rev. Run walk up in the spot
Even all the crooks that been livin outta Brooklyn
Just can't help but point a lot
Everywhere I go now, people say "Oh wow!"
Cause they know how I get it
It don't matter if it's Notown, all the way to yo' town
You can't slow down my hit

[J.D.]
Can't slow it down man; think about this
From 1983, to 2000, it's two-thousand and one
And these {niggaz} still on the run?
Why'all {niggaz} just crazy, why'all out here tryin to front, like
They ain't the reason, you went and bought a pair of shelltoe
The {f*ck} is wrong witch'all?

[Run]
People want to hurt Rev. Run, say cause I got dough
That I must be a type of fraud
But you know the thing that's funny, if God made money
Then how we'd tip the Lord?
Went and got J.D., made me crazy
Play me up in the club
Got a brand new Mercedes, for my lady
But seem me I'm on dubs
In a Bentley (?) that come out the garage
On the side of a grand prestigious home
Y'all ask if I'm blessed by God, player what you thought?
What Rev. you seen on chrome?
Gotta make these dollars, comin out of Hollis
Got my collar on too
I got the rhyme and the beat and the vibe from the street
And now the rest is on you

[J.D.]
The rest is on me man
Let me let y'all know somethin
The first rap group to get on MTV, hard and heavey ya heard me?
And then, they gon' turn around, and resurrect Aerosmith like
Y'knahmean bring them back, knahmsayin?
If it wasn't for these cats man
Y'all wouldn't know nothin about no LL Cool J
Or Beastie Boys y'knahmean? And this comin from me
I'm lookin at it man
Since I been 13 years old man I've been watchin these cats man
I ain't no ho, but I know, ya heard me, why'knahmsayin?
So stop all that frontin, STOP ALL YOUR FRONTIN, YA HEARD ME? YEAH!!

[Run]
Forget the hits that I made or the gig that I played
If you had love back in the day
Just raised in my kicks and it changed what I spit
And return it to Run why'all love today
I pick the mic back up, came right back up
To the top where I'm 'posed to be
And when the track light up, y'all can back right up
Y'all players too close to me

[J.D.]
You know what I used to like?
The way my man used to come on stage and grab the mic
And just throw the damn stand across the stage man
Then he used to tell his man like, "Yo D
Come right here in the middle of the stage, grab yo' {shit}
And say what you gotta say" - and you know what D used to say?
He used to say..
"Party people! Your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get out your seats, and let's get ill
That's right why'all, we're not just rough, we more than tough
And when it comes to {shit} like this, ha, we got enough!"
Y'knahmean? You know who the {f*ck} I am
You know my name, you know my game
It's So So Def, Run-D.M.C.
