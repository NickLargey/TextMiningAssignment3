Let's do it doggs  ring ding dong 
Bitch (aha  aha)  bitch (yeah what what what what what?) 
Beeitch (set up  set up  set up)  beeitch (it's a set up) 
What they're doing? They're trying to... 

They're trying to set me up  they're trying to set me up 
They want to set me up  they want to set me up 
They're trying to set me up  they're trying to set me up 
They're trying to set me up  but check it out 

This is it  call it how you want to call it 
Brawling, call in the headhunter, start headhunting 
How do you want it? I said we could spread arms 
Bust and stare, you want to snatch a life, is that right? 
Want to-get-rich ass nigga, snitch ass nigga 
Fake switch bitch ass nigga, up-in-to-get-lynched ass nigga 
Ain't nothing to it, raw doggs doing the lynching, master assassins 
Henchmen, the whole world's against me (f*ck 'em) 
It's a million to one, Kurupt with one gun 
And a whole backyard of ammo 
Dump these lumps in nigga's backs like a camel 
Get torn and worn just like sandals, now his Willy came to an end 
You see that nigga he ride with, do him in 
This nigga's so sweet, he got my girl to set me 
Got her with the tech to tack me and disconnect me 
There's no (?) when you're playing Russian roulette 
They're trying to catch me, lay me down and sketch me 
Young Gotti, (???) 

Bringing the whole fucking entourage of murderous minds 

I don't know who rides with a mental dome, who will and who won't 

Trust me, they all want to bust me, it's a set up 


Chorus: 

I don't give a f*ck who you bring to the table 

And I don't give a f*ck who you got with you 

You played me, you're Kane and I'm Abel 

Now the ammo drops, watch 'fore the glock hits you (it's a set up) 

Don't you know? You f*ck around with death sentinel 

If you didn't learn you'd better start learning (it's a set up nigga) 

Aiming, bust and hit your left and you're cold 

That's how motherfuckers get murdered 


Hit the (???), f*ck a sun roof, this car is dirty 

Dirty dirty buster, dirty motherfuckers 

Holler at the big homie Slop (what up Slop? what's up y'all?) 

Hit me on the hip, hit it quick on the dick 

Get this rap slapped in the clip 

You see this black nigga, you'd better duck him 

Thorough, in every neighborhood and borough, like motherfuck 'em 

Yeah you know me, oh you want to show me a thang or two 

how y'all do, nigga show me, creep through slowly 

Friction, I can feel it all around me, my intuition 

LA gangbang mentality got me on a violent spree, violently 

Busting, dusting niggaz off silently 

I ain't even trying to be what I can be or could handle 

But niggaz trying to make me an example 

Go over to the West (to the West), niggaz want to feud 

Go back to the East (to the East), niggaz want to feud 

I'm 'bout to go to the North and South to see, what, 

are y'all niggaz on that same fucking bullshit, 'cause? (I don't know) 


Chorus 


It's a set up motherfucker, what, it's a set up 

I'm tired of these bitch ass niggaz, it's a set up nigga 


Can't help it, hoes come through 

Me set, I know 'em, they're out to set me 

They want to get me, get the homies 

The rainstorm's coming and every motherfucker's trying to wet me 

Yo it's unforgettable, no you can't touch me 

Clutch me like a mic, and do just what you like? 

Hell no nigga, even though you dislike me 

You want to be just like me, niggaz they despite me 

See all the homies, I make loot like Spike Lee 

Dozens, rolling through with me, my homies and my cousins 

I give a f*ck nigga, I could stay busting 

And still rock it right, and hit the spotlight 

Shine bright, these fake ass niggaz, snake ass niggaz 

Earthquake ass niggaz, I shake these niggaz 

Shake ass niggaz, thinking you can come through all the time 

want to f*ck with Kurupt, I just sit, prepare the rhyme 

Now I'm all about the cash nigga 

Thinking you could come through 

You got your heater cocking on busts you just flashed nigga 


Chorus (2x) 


Murdered... 

What? Attack assassins, huh 

Just ask the homie D, he rides with me 

Just ask the homie Snoop, S-N-double O-P, he rides with me 

Just ask my big homeboy, my big homie, he rides with me 

Huh, ask 'em all, they ride with me 

Top doggs, D-O-double G's, they ride with me 

Ask my homie Big (???), he rides with me 

Ask the big homeboy be	, he rides with me 

And the homie D, Slop, what? they ride with me 

Big see, he rides with me 

Big Tray D rides with me 

Big Sean D rides with me 

Big Breez, he rides with me 

K-you-are-you-P-T, beeitch!
