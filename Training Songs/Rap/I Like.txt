[Chorus:]
I like the way that you move 
I like the things that you do 
My love for you is so strong 
I'll never leave you alone 
So don't take your love away from me 

Baby, when I need some peace of mind I go to you 
Because you always find the time 
To make me feel brand new 
What I feel for you's so strong 
That you're all I need and all I want 
All day and all night long 
I like the way... 

[Chorus] 
 
See my baby, when I'm hungry for your love, you satisfy me 
And the smile that's in your heart tells me that you need me 
I would never do you wrong 
It's gotta be me for you and you for me 
You got it goin' on 
I like the way... 

[Chorus x 2] 
 
Baby I like the way 
Promise me that you'll stay with me 
Listen to my song 
Never leave you alone, no, no, no 
Don't take your love away from me, 
I'll never do you wrong 

[Chorus x 2]
