S-P-I-R-I-T, it's great to see
We got it, the spirit
Hey, hey, let's hear it

Ain't nobody stopping us
What we have is dangerous
Left they opinions in the dust
Said can't nobody f*ck with us
They'll never find a way to make us fade away
Our love won't fade away (no)
They'll never find a way to make us fade away
Our love won't fade away

Warm days, cold nights
Late October
Separated, people saying what we have is over
But the hate only made us get closer (close)
And closer (yah, yah, yah)

Said we couldn't go the distance, yeah
Look at us, we're going the distance
They just wanna be us
They don't wanna see us
Going the distance (yeah)
For life, for life, la di da
Said we couldn't go the distance
For life, for life, la di da
Look at us, we're going the distance
The distance, oh

It was no good
Having hands up
Tried to diminish me
Always stayed out
Camping out crowds
In spite of them difficulties
But they can't, but they can't, but they can't
Take away them precious memories (yeah)
And I won't, and I won't, and I won't
Let 'em come between you and me (woo)

We're too strong (too strong)
We're too silent (ooh yeah)
They can't stop it now
We in Prada now (ooh)

You with it, I'm with it
