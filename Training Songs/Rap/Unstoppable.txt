I put the motherfuckin gangsta in the game
Destory you like cancer of the brain
I can't be stopped
I'm faster than the plane that crashed into the trade center
Brain bending pain enter ya nervous system and make you want to turn the other way
Stick yo fuckin head in the dirt, don't even look in my direction
You define trash, I personify perfection
High beemin on the highway driving benzes
Crime scene lookin like a homicide convention
You walk around with a dick in ya mouth
don't ever let the kid joe take a shit in ya house
Trust my judgement, I make bitches lie to there husbands
At my crib on the cell phone crying they love them
Nobodys fault, its all good as long as nobodys caught
Jealousy, put bodys in morgues
Hungry for money and coke, put hotties in porn
won't stop till I put uncle howie in forbes

No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now

I've had my, ups and downs, dealt with cunts and clowns
Major label deals I've been fucked around
Spent years money dangling in front of my face
Instead of blowin the spot, bill was runnin the place
Payed mad dues, shows, made hundreds of tapes
Sold drugs studio time my gun in ya face
Look at me now, Non-Phixion running the game
Kings of the underground and we loving it man
Yea Ill punch you in your face when I'm out on tour
When we was with the beatnuts, I could count about four
Different occasions I had to lace a kid, cold duffed em
One dude bought me a drink after I snuffed em
Promoters talk out the side of they mouth
Till they spitten they own teeth out the side of they mouth
Even the bouncers was scared of us, Callin for peace
While the fagget that got his head cracked, called the police
Ill Bill be the mother fuckin future, its easy to tell
F*ck wit me, Ima see you in hell
So don't f*ck wit a bull, achieve the impossible
Cause there ain't no stoppen the unstoppable

No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now

I found your lack of faith disturbing, now my aquisitions are merging
Streets are your, executions are murders, these goons will worship
Like methological gods, beating impossible odds
Comparable in the hood to killing thousands of cops
Pass the good in the bag, take it straight to the ugly
Made in New York, it spread now we raping the country
Stay with the vest, triple x pistols and sex
Money and murderers connect, equals instant success
Ripple effect, we invest, legitimate businessmen
Court rooms to ball rooms expanding the bussiness plan
Listen man, I'm old fashioned
F*ck taking over answer, kidnapp the family and hold em for ransom
We gettin dough yawll, its the jump off
Eather you get with us or f*ck off
An unstoppable fource on a rough course
Big success, f*ck with me you fuckin wit the best
F*ck who's on top, cause I'm a lot hungrier than them

No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
