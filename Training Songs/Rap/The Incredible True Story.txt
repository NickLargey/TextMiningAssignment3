Living life on the east coast
Way back in the day trying to beat most
Anybody that wanna do what I do
Well let me keep it one hunna with you
It ain’t about that
Ain’t about Hip Hop
Ain’t about Rap
Think a minute, hold up, use your cap
Chicago, know I’mma snap
Gotta say, no basic rapping

So they wonder who am I, so high
I said they wonder who am I, so high

Back again, never outside so I’m acting in
I laugh again when they don’t understand what I mean, bias
Everybody seen by us
Everybody wanna live a life like this
Man f*ck that, do what’s good for your family
Make music like there’s no Grammy
For that last line they might ban me
I don’t give a f*ck though
Cause I am me
From Beijing to Miami
I’mma just do what I do with my crew
Ain’t no telling what I’m finna do
But I promise that I’mma keep riding for you
And I know what to do
Everything righter for you
Only for you, depending on what you gonna do

It’s all for you
It’s all for you
Who am I, so high
I said they wonder who am I, so high

I do what I love
Came from below when there was no one above
Created a world no one has been to
Everything that I’m into
Everything that I’ve been through
Bring it back like, let it shine like a bad light
Reminisce ain’t know that night
Gotta take flight
Everybody probably wonder what I’m living like
In the middle of the night I might write
Despite what they say is right and wrong
Despite they wonder, wonder

Who am I, so high
I said they wonder who am I, so high
