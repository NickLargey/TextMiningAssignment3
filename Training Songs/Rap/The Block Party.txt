Uh, uh, shake, uh, shake it down now
Uh, uh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah one time
Two times, shake it down now

Remember way back in the day (hey hey)
When the kids from around the way
Used to come out and play
And the double dutch bus
Had you bumping on down the street
Trying to move your feet
While you shake your little booty
To the groove of the beat (uh)
To the beat
To the beat (beat)
You hit the corner and you stopped
Hey y'all there's a party on the other block
We hit the jackpot
Jackpot (what what)
And it's only 12 oÂ´clock
And the sun is hot
Free soda pop
We about to rock rock rock rock

What's your name
Lisa
And where you from
9th street
Where you goin'
To the party
Can I come
Uh huh
Oh, they're playin' hop scotch

Come on
Come on hop with me
Come on
Oh, them boys is pop locking
Come on
Come on bounce with me

[Chorus: x2]
We were dancing all night long
We were dancing all night long
Music pumping and we're jumping
And they played our favorite songs

I'm a big city girl
From all over the world
And I do what I want to do
Right foot left shoe
Then you take it on down
Then you shake it around
Bring it up
Clap your hands
Then you turn it all around

[Chorus]

Remember when we did the wop (pop pop)
And you used to make that head bop (bop)
Like it would never stop (stop)
And them other grown folks
Gettin' busy with the gigolo
Drinkin' Michelob
It was 6am before they hit the road (uh)
Hit the road hit the road (road)
Them fat gold chains and high top banks (hey)
Run DMC was all you ever played (yeah)
Shell toe Adidas
No strings
There's somethin' cookin' in the pop
About to hit the spot
Boom box
Play me some of that hip hop (hip hop)
Hip hop hip hop hip hop

What's your name
Lisa
And where you from
9th street
Where you goin'
To the party
Can I come
Uh huh
Oh, they 'bout to get it on

Come on
Come on bounce with me
Come on
Oh, they on the dance floor
Come on
Come on rock with me

[Chorus]

Come on
Come on bounce with me
Come on
Come on groove with me
Come on
Come on rock with me
Come on
Come on hop with me

[Chorus]

I'm a big city girl
From all over the world
And I do what I want to do
Right foot left shoe
Then you take it on down
Then you shake it around
Bring it up
Clap your hands
Then you turn it all around

[Chorus: x2]
