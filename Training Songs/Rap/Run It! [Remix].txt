Little mini skirt and she lookin' good 
Got different color weaves 
Man she so hood 
I like dem thick in tha waist 
All tan in the face 
And girls come to us 
We don't chase 
She move her booty like a low rider 
Up...down 
Then she like the way how I put shit down 
It ain't nothing to a G
