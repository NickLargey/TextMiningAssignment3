Hoppin' out foreign cars, forty deep
Hundred thou' blowin' that in AOD
And that's why I'm the best, f*ck with me
'Cause a nigga flip flop like he standin' on the beach
Hoppin' up stage, got my diamonds, dirty dancin'
You know I work dirty, got 'em higher than a parasail
Tell my other bitch I'm on my other bitch, yeah
I just do that shit to make my other bitch jealous
Forty in the kitchen and then he whippin' up the dressin'
Every time you call, I be like, look, hold on, don't stress me
You know I talk the 9, like a motherfuckin' ferris wheel
You want it? You can get it if you wanna learn your lesson

Became friends with a dope head (dope head)
To be inside the mind of a dope head
How many crimes in a dope head?
I got that one time for the dope heads
The people love the streets vs. the feds, yeah
Countin' 'til your thumb numb, hell yeah
Printin' like a money presser, hell yeah
You can smell the Franklins in the air, yeah
Put you in the loop, I make my own laws
Last six summers, we had no falls
And we still stashin' hundreds in the brick walls
Paid my dog commissary almost no cost
