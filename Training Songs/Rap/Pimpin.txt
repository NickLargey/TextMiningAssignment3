I don't love hoes, I'm sharin' them, I ain't lovin' them
Or handcuffin' them 'cause baby, I'm pimpin
You love hoes, you chasin' them, you be lacin' them
While I'm replacin' them 'cause baby, I'm pimpin

I lay my pimp game down when it comes to these bitches
They do what I say an' obey all my wishes
Wash all my clothes an' clean dirty dishes
I turn a sweet bitch to a switchblade sister

While you shop on Melrose, buyin' hoes shoes
I'm in Mickey D's buyin' Number Twos
Now get yo' ass on the track an' get the dough for me
I'm the number 1 pimp', so she chosen me

An' my hoes, where the ballers an' bros be?
They collect them G's an' they give 'em to me
I'm pimpin, no perm, just gators
Pimpin, show you how to stunt on them haters

Pimpin, flossin' in that new Cadillac
Pimpin, chinchil' with the fur hat
Pimpin, I show you how to school a hoe
An' when you chasin' them bitches, I'm chasin' the dough

I don't love hoes, I'm sharin' them, I ain't lovin' them
Or handcuffin' them 'cause baby, I'm pimpin
You love hoes, you chasin' them, you be lacin' them
While I'm replacin' them 'cause baby, I'm pimpin

Freakin', I ain't speakin', girl, I ain'tcha hubby
Ma, back that thing up, girl, time is money
You ain't freakin', I ain't speakin', girl, I ain't no dummy
An' we can play the Marriott, ball, pop some bubbly

That said if 50 can't get none, I ain't speakin'
Girl' I ain't speakin', girl' I ain't speakin'
I said if Banks can't get none, I ain't speakin'
Girl, I ain't speakin', girl, I ain't speakin'

Yeah, Lisa an' Kim, they 'Straight Outta Ca$hville'
I met 'em with Buck, in his mansion in Nashville
My bitch from the D used to live on Marshall block
I put a foot to her ass like martial arts

I got a stable of hoes in the see P T
Ask my nigga, Snoop an' the D are E
Girl, fix your lipstick, your hair is a mess
An' I know your feet hurt in them damn Payless

I don't love hoes, I'm sharin' them, I ain't lovin' them
Or handcuffin' them 'cause baby, I'm pimpin
You love hoes, you chasin' them, you be lacin' them
While I'm replacin' them 'cause baby, I'm pimpin
