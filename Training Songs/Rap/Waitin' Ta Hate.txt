(Ain't no 'California Love') (Love) (Love)
I see them niggas
You see them niggas?
I see them niggas

Look at them niggas just waitin' to hate (wait)
Waitin' to hate, waitin' to hate (look at them niggas)
Look at them bitches just waitin' to hate (wait)
Waitin' to hate (wait) waitin' to hate

Get your ride on, ride on
This ain't the day for you to die on, die on
I'm a nigga that they lie on, lie on
See these shoes you want to try on, try on
Yo, we can go to war with the enemy
All we need is A.K.s and Hennessy
This ain't back in the days of Tennessee
Pull the trigger and release the energy [shots]
See motherfuckers run till they catch one
In the back, and it might cause a cardiac
Bitch act like he died and we brought him back
Him screamin' for his mama and his sister pack
Flat line
These niggas want to act like
They ain't never had a full can of act-right
Make me pull out my gat, right
And smoke his motherfuckin' ass like a crack pipe

So what you sayin', motherfucker?
We ain't playin', motherfucker
A.K.'in motherfuckers
So what you sayin', motherfucker?
We ain't playin', motherfucker
A.K.'in muthafuckas

Look at them niggas just waitin' to hate (wait)
Waitin' to hate, waitin' to hate (look at them niggas)
Look at them bitches just waitin' to hate (hate)
Waitin' to hate (hate) waitin' to hate

Get your smoke on, smoke on
Here's another verse to choke on, choke on
To all my niggas in the pen, get your yoke on
To all my thugs in the house, get your loc on
We can really give a f*ck about a broke home
All we care about is bitches we can poke on
Nigga, what's that bullshit that you spoke on?
Better roll on 'fore we split your whole dome
Cause you're fuckin' with Ice Cube the Terrible
F*ck around, I make your life unbearable
Make you live all scary and careful
Come through my neighborhood, you better tip-toe
Cause if you loud, then you might get chased down
Westside Connection catch a case now
Po-po's find your monkey ass face down
Tell your mama that you in a better place now

So what you sayin', motherfucker?
We ain't playin', motherfucker
A.K.'in motherfuckers
So what you sayin', motherfucker?
We ain't playin', motherfucker
A.K.'in motherfuckers

Look at them niggas just waitin' to hate (wait)
Waitin' to hate (hate) waitin' to hate (look at them niggas)
Look at them bitches just waitin' to hate (wait)
Waitin' to hate (hate) waitin' to hate (look at them bitches)

(Ain't no 'California Love') (Love) (Love)
'You can hate me now'
(Ain't no 'California Love') Ah-ah (Love) (Love)

To all my niggas with the lleyo
They rock it up like Play-Doh
They cook it up like Waco
Better do what I say so
Better lay low, cause you fuckin' with a halo
Death to the niggas with the big mouth
And death to you devils from the Old South
And death to you hoes turnin' tricks out
And death everyone that go the bitch route
Check it
If you infected by this record
Bow down butt-naked
And pray to God
Ice Cube won't spare the rod
Westside Connection here to mob, nigga, rob
We can take it to the streets
We can take it to the concrete
You niggas know where the Don be
You bitches ain't tryin to find me
All you haters need to shut the f*ck up and get behind me

Look at them niggas just waitin' to hate (look at em)
Waitin' to hate (look) waitin' to hate (look at them niggas)
Look at them bitches just waitin' to hate (ugh)
Waitin' to hate (ugh) waitin' to hate

So what you sayin', motherfucker?
We ain't playin', motherfucker
A.K.'in motherfuckers
So what you sayin', motherfucker?
We ain't playin', motherfucker
A.K.'in motherfucker

This is dedicated 
To them haters
Who ain't goin' kill nothin'
And who ain't goin' let nothin' die
You know em
You know em
When you see Ice Cube you better holla
And pop a collar
When you see Ice Cube you better holla
And pop a collar
