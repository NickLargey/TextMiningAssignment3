Hey, hey

There's nothing in this world
There's not another girl that could satisfy my needs
There's nothing in this world
There's not another boy that could make me feel so sweet
Cos me love life's so right 
When she hold me so tight, how she kiss me goodnight
Cos he fills up my life
Like the Sun, he shines bright
Boy, come with me now

The first night me meet her
Yes me senorita me never want to leave her no
Because the gal look sweet and treat
And me really want to take her home

Cos she look nice and is a one of a kind 
When me look up in her eyes then she got me mesmerized
Picture perfect like a Kodak moment
When she kiss me goodnight and she feeling up on me

We been there from the jump, never front, never stunt
Never done what a average girl done
And I can tell by her body language
She feels my emotions

And got me anxious
