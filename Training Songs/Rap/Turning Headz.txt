I use to struggle now your boy be out here burnin' bread,
Use to get turned down, now your boy be turnin' heads,
We know who use diss, now the start to smile
They see me comin' and they wanna hang around a while
They see me lookin' good, candy apple All of wood
I'm stackin' bread, turnin' heads in my neighborhood
I turn heads when I step outside, turn heads when I'm in my ride.
I make a person look twice (cause they see my money ride)
I said I turn heads when I step outside, turn heads when I'm in my ride

I went from riding bus, to big trophy tucks.
I'm turnin' heads and breakin' necks when I'm rollin' lubs.
They think everyone else was runnin' now they see me comin',
Just start jumpin' on the gutter just see who really want me.
They see me riding fours they see me stackin' dough,
They see the black on black phanton' on them 24's.
They see me riding fours they see me stackin' dough,
They see the black on black phantom' on them 24's.
I keep 84's in the parking lot,
Diamonds to shine if it's dark or not and doin' 8 times (club ice age in on the spot)
