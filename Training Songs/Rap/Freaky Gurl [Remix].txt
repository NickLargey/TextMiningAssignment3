She's a very freaky gurl
Don't bring her to mama
First you get her name
Then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
She's a very freaky gurl
She get it from her momma
First you get her name
Then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

Gucci can't ding a ling bet I make your back hurt
Bet I make your cat squirt, Bet I make your neck jerk
Call Lil' Kim told her better wear a tight skirt
Bet I know your tight work, bet I make ya cum first

Flood it on the internet, put it on my myspace
Gucci got a big stick, make ya sing my ad libs, yeah
But you gotta be a queen bitch, Gucci
So icy trap star, f*ck her like a porn star
First my H2 then I fucked her in her own car
Face down, ass up, I'm a make her love me
Probably don't love me but let her suck and f*ck me
Gucci wanna sex ya, tell me is ya itched it
Probably coulda hit it dog, I ain't even hit it yet
F*ck the 20 minutes dog, I ain't even nutted yet
Now she braggin' on me dog, I ain't even stuntin' it

[Chorus]
She's a very freaky gurl

Then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

Coochie overflowin' like somebody let the faucet run
Bust one nut, I ain't done

I'll lick you like a lollipop
Once you taste my honeybun

You know pain is pleasure

Smack my ass, grab my neck

And he wanna introduce me
Takin' me on shoppin' sprees

On the back of his Suzuki
And I ain't even sex 'em
All I did was let him eat my,

I got sum brain n the front seat of the hummer
And if you can make it rain then ludacris can make it thunder
I ain't messin' with these lames but it seem I make them wonder
How I came and took the game 4 the past 7 summers
Now yo woman wanna get it from the front from the back
And if she with it I'm a hit it from the side
Give her what she want in the lac cause she a freak gurl and I can see it in her eyes
She can go tit for tat it's so good that I made her wanna cry
A little bit of this little that 4 2 piece, biscuit and sum fries
Straight from churches ya boyfriends worthless
Cause luda go deep while he barely scratch the surface
She itching for a scratch like she D-J J-C
If you looking fo ya match Bitch come and find me
I be in the A town I ain't that hard to find
Put ya legs up in the air and see the DTP sign
If ya wanna meet my mama that's a thing I won't do
You say muthafuck me nah muthafuck you kno' why

[Chorus]
