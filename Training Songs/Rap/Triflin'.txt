Ice gleam when you walk through
Stopped in my tracks, like daddy what I need
But I'm a play the back
Got a whole lot of chicks want to say they touch your stacks
And I see you're playin' Santa Claus
Got 'em all on your lap
But they givin' you whatever you want
Not me though, stallion; ride rough
Plus I'm trying to see dough
Enough to make you fiend
Coko like cane
What you need?
Challenge make it nothing
Let me see if you can handle me

[Coko]
Sexy, tempting
Caught my attention
Knew that he had me in a daze
Oh, fly ways, teasing me
Enchanted, the way he
Stopped and stared me in the face

[Coko]
But as soon he said a word
The same old line that I already heard
Disappointed me right away
'Cause of the things he had to say were...

[Coko]
Triflin', ghetto
Sorry, oh no
Tired, gaming
That's such a shame
Triflin', ghetto
Sorry, oh no
Fine as hell though
And that's so pitiful

[Coko]
His lips, enticing
So inviting
Smile could melt your heart away, oh
I started to imagine
Just what could happen
If he should come and talk to me

[Coko]
But as soon he said a word
The same old line that I already heard
Disappointed me right away
'Cause of the things he had to say were...

[Coko]
Triflin', ghetto
Sorry, oh no
Tired, gaming
That's such a shame
Triflin', ghetto
Sorry, oh no
Fine as hell though
And that's so pitiful

[Coko]
Oh, I like what I see
Oh, shorty come and talk to me
Oh, you spoke your first word
Oh, I can't believe the shit I heard

[Eve]
Huh?  What you mean you want to touch at my house?
You'll never see me bent over my couch
Think I'm a chicken; watch me thug it out?
Matter of fact, I'm a forget that I met you
Now, why you gonna make me get ghetto and disrespect you?
Had to be a clown, and I'm a laugh at your silly ass
Pass on your petty cash
Never should have thought I was weak
Can't believe you had the nerve to speak
Player, you know who I am?
You must of thought I was some type of freak

[Coko]
Triflin', ghetto
Sorry, oh no
Tired, gaming
That's such a shame
Triflin', ghetto
Sorry, oh no
Fine as hell though
And that's so pitiful
