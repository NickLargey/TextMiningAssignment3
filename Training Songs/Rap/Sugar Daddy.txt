(Uhhh baby...heyyy....)
(Uh ohhh...)
Yeah yeah I'ma be a player for life (ummmmm yeahhh)
Cuban link, clk, yeah I'ma be (baby) a player for life,

Yo it's plain to see, you can't (cuban) change me,
'Cause I'ma be a player for life,(what you got for me)
Yo it's plain to see (so come and get with me),you can't change me
'Cause I'm be a player for life (cause I want you to be my sugar daddy)

Ah-yo excuse me miss, how do you do, you're probably used to this,
'Cause mami chula you're the bomb and your fuse is lit,
Me-I'm coola than the farms, cause I'm smooth and swift,
The type to pull up in to your prom in a brand new 6,

I'm old school, I use the charm to seduce the chicks,
You'll introduce me to ya moms as your future pick,
Your like benita applebalm, or some exclusive shit,
Waiting for you to put me on cause I refuse to quit,

And the truth is- you make a nigga lose his grip,
'Cause I just can't resist the way you move them hips,
The way you walk and you talk with them beautiful lips,
Got a New York train of thought, so you think you the shit,

A suitable fit, you even keep your cuticles ?clipped?,
Fully equipped, heavy duty boo, you truly a gift,
You a cuty with a mind, not a groupie or trick,
Rich in beauty cause you shine without jewelry and chips

[Chorus]
Papi, please be my sugar daddy,
I want you to rule my world,
Dry kisses that taste like candy,
Can I be your sugar girl,
Just put some ice on my pinky ring,
And fly me around the world,
I owe it to papi, I need my sugar daddy,
And I'll be your sugar girl

Yeah yo yo,
Mami you sweet like licorice, deep and articulate,
Baby you look delicious from your feet to your fingertips,
Unique and conspicuous, plus your body's ridiculous,

Make me want to lick my lips and lick you where you ticklish,
Picture this- Lamborghini's, mansions and yachts, 
Trips to Tahiti instead of standing on the block,
Baby I can be your genie man and grant you them rocks,

Ice up your watch, and freeze the hands on your glock,
We can dance till we drop, in the sands of the trops,
Romance is so hot-you'll catch a tan on the spot,
Anxious to shop, I just hand you a knot,

And make you say (ain't no nigga like the one I got)

[Chorus]

Yo, now baby I'm a thug, plus a player by blood,
But we can lay in the tub, play with the bubbles while I'm rubbing ya butt,
Hugging you tight, like I'm cuffing the mic, loving you right,
So light up the candlelights, because we crushing tonight,

It's such a sight- touch you where you like it, hush and feel the tight grip,
'Cause I'm the type of private dancer that'll work the nightshift,
This kid will make you scream my name out, to let the pain out,
Once I hopped in the train I never came out,

The same wild individual from the playhouse,
Who stayed out all day at the bar, till' they said â??get outâ??,
I'm straight out the player's club,
Rocking gators with leather gloves,

Tailor-made tux showing the ladies love,
I'm way above average, I know you love Paris,
But we can ride our horse and carriage through the bronx traffic,
24 Karats Cuban Link, I do my thing, (I want you to be my sugar daddy)
You can bring it if you think you can hang, I bang bang baby

[Chorus]

Yeah yeah I'm a be a player for life, (ohhh)
Cuban Link, click, yeah I'ma be a player for life, (player for life)
Yo it's plain to see, you can't change me,
'Cause I'm a be a player for life, (player for life)

Ah-yo it's plain to see, you can't change me,
Baby, I'm a be a player for life(player for life)
(I'll be your sugar girl)
Babe (cause I'm a be a player for life, I'll be your sugar girl) 

CLK, It's that girl Mya, oh holla,
('Cause I'ma be a player for life) Come on (I'll be your sugar girl)
M.O.B. records (cause I'm a be a player for life) woo
(I'll be your sugar girl) I'll be your Sugar Daddy

[Repeat: x3]
('Cause I'm a be a player for life) I'll be your sugar daddy
