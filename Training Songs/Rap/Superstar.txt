We made love in a mad embrace
Now you say you don't know my face
Superstar
You know just who you are

You tell the world, you don't even know me
A contradiction to the love you show
Superstar
You know just who you are

(Chorus):
I'm billie jean and I'm mad as hell
I'm a woman with a story to tell
Superstar
You know just who you are
(Who you are, who you are, who you are)

You can't love a woman and push her aside
'Cause she got feelings, just like you do
A woman's got her pride 
I don't want nothing from you
It's not what I'm about
But you've been lying, there's no denying
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]

Late one night, you rang my phone
You called to make sure that I was all alone
You said you were feeling down
And couldn't be seen around
One thing led to another
You became my lover, you said
"Let's keep it secret, let's not spread it around"
You send me flowers and diamonds
And said that you were in love
You said you never met a girl
That you thought so much of

Superstar
You know just who you are
(Who you are, who you are, who you are)

And then all of a sudden
You just stopped coming by
You never called on the phone
And I didn't know why
Too many fellas nowadays
Push their girl aside
First they get what they want
Then they run off and hide
But baby, time went by
I was not upset
And then much to my surprise
One day to my regret
Well the doctor said that
There will soon be two
And there's a little one coming
There's a man in you

I was in shock
I thought I'd faint
And I was petrified
First I laughed 'cause I was happy
Then I started to cry
And when the baby was born
I sent you a telegram
But it came back saying
You don't know who I am

Superstar
You know just who you are
(Who you are, who you are, who you are)

I saw you in a club one night
And I did not intend to start a fight
But when you said who am I
You don't know my face
I went off, I made a scene
I really wrecked the place
And I know you might be a big superstar
And the whole wide world knows who you are
But the next time we meet
If you don't want a scene
Tip your hat with respect
'Cause I am billie jean

Superstar
You know just who you are
(Who you are, who you are, who you are)

[Chorus]

I'm billie jean, I'm mad as hell
I'm billie jean, I'm mad as hell
