Sad to say I'm only in town for the night ya see
I got like eight hours left before my flight look here
Hey yo I'm tryin' to stay respectful and polite
Now you can tell me 'go to hell' if ya like

Now I ain't one of them niggas that wanna trip
Get mad 'cause you ain't interested, he yellin' f*ck you bitch
Now don't get it twisted, yeah I'ma look when you pass
But I ain't the one to pull on your arm or grab your ass

Ya see it's the swagger, it won't allow me lookin' thirst
And I ain't attackin' unless I get a signal first
And I ain't the one that's gon' be payin' to do the do
Before it's over you gon' say, 'Shit, I should pay you'
Please believe it

And he can't get the mental and physical part right

You playin' wit ya toys but ya toys don't bite
See they don't talk shit and they don't hit it how you like
See I just want the first right of refusal when you catch the mood
Just call and I come through and sock it to you, promise you booboo
