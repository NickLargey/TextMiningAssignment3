They gotta war for oil, a war for gold
A war for money and a war for souls
A war on terror, a war on drugs
A war on kindness and a war on hugs
A war on birds and a war on bees

They gotta a war on hippies tryin' save the trees
A war with jets and a war with missiles
A war with high seated, government official
Wall street war, on high finance

A war on people who just love to dance
A war on music, a war on speech
A war on teachers and the things they teach
A war for the last 500 years

War's just messin' up the atmosphere
A war on Muslims, a war on Jews
A war on Christians and Hindus
A whole lotta people just sayin' kill them all

They gotta a war on Mumia Abu Jamal
The war on pot, is a war that?s failed
A war that's fillin' up the nations jails
World war one, two, three and four

Chemical weapons, biological war
Bush war 1, and Bush war 2
They gotta a war for me, they gotta a war for you!

[Chorus]
We can't stop it when the beat just drops!
(And we don't stop)
We can't stop it when the rebel rock!
(And we don't stop)
We can't stop until we hit those heights!
(And we don't stop)
We can't stop because we love this life!
(And we don't stop)

Dance to the new day
Sing to the new day, Rhyme to the new day
Transform hell into heaven God lives through,
Grab hold of today

Yesterday is over, tomorrow may be too late
Everything is one but the one is off balance
Music made for the dollar like soul and talent
Really ain't it all about a feeling you was havin'

As a child runnin' wild
Before the mind programmin' set in
Threatenin' your establishment
Get in this energy, lay back and sit

The next men wreckin', to the master's lips
Head spin breathren, get to askin' if
Where, when, Mr. President, "What do you know?"
It's evident settin' in slow, "How does it go?"

An unprecedented event is about to unfold
The devil can't stop, won't stop blockin' the globe
Fall in a cell here
Freedom come knockin' at the door

They try lockin' it though, but we about to explode
We got the firefly, tiger eye apocalypse flow
So deep in the bottom of your bottomless soul
Send mind darts flyin' out, without a pistol

Redesign lost minds got outta the cold
Bring order to a world that is outta control
"Truth" you say, I say, "How do I know?"

[Chorus]

I wanna rock with punks because I love punk rock
I wanna rock with heads because I love hip hop
I wanna rock my beats all around the block
If I was in Baghdad then I would rock Iraq

I wanna rock with punks because I love punk rock
I wanna rock with heads because I love hip hop
I wanna rock my beats all around the block
There is just one love so the planet we rock

New world days and new world nights
New world wrongs and new world rights
Putting new world funds in the new world banks
With the new world guns on the new world tanks

New world devils and new world gods
New world jails see the new worlds hard
New world names sing the new world songs
New world planes are the new world bombs
New world's flying, the new world's dying

The new world's crying and the new world's trying
New world sons and new world daughters
They are already selling us the new world water
New world beats for the new world to bang

New world streets for the new world to hang
New world president, new world drugs
New world resident, new world thugs
New world players for new world sports

New world trials for the new world courts
New world lawyers and new world laws
New world prisons and new world bars
New world fight the new world's fists

The new world lighting up the new world spliffs
New world smoke in the new world lungs
New world's choking, the new world's done

[Chorus: x 2]

We don't stop.. (repeat to fade)
