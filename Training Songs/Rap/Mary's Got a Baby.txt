Mary's got a baby pretty little baby
What am I supposed to do
I try my best to help her, show her that I care
But brothers got their problem too

Hot man fi get a hot woman ya
Rastaman fi get a ras woman ya
A lioness fi get a lion right right

Hot man fi get a hot woman ya
Rastaman fi get a ras woman ya
A lioness fi get a lion right right

Too much drama and commotion that's surrounding me
It's a sticky situation and I can't break free
Lord I wish that sweet sweet Mary could be my cherie
But my Mary's got a baby and it's not for me

Mary's got a baby pretty little baby
What am I supposed to do

And any were that wi go a we a rock di nation

Every morning that I wake it's only bills I see
It's so hard just for a man to build a family
All the stress and strife of life has got a hold on me
When I hear the baby cry it breaks a part of me oh well

But brothers got their problem too

Cause every girl weh fi step in a mi crip yes
All now mi nuh see di next three yet
