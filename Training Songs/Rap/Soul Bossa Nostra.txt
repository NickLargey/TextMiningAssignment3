Yes sir, 
See what we are about to do right now
I play Tribute to a livin' ledge
So I brought Naturally 7 to do it with me, 
And I brought this, Rudy Currence
And me, I go by the name of Ludacris, right
And it's a lot of people out there claim that their voices
Let me know the truth, Bossa is back,
Let's go!

[Chorus]
It's the black soul Bossa nostra, is back on
The truth so bossa is over
I hope you've taken notice
Because the truth, truth girl, is back on 
It's always the new, it's always to the
Soul Bossa Nostra, is back on
The true Soul Bossa is over 
I hope you've taken notice
Because the truth, truth girl, 
It's always, it's always to the soul Bossa Nostra.
