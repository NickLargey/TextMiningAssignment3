There's always one of them in the bunch
Socializing and sticking lies in
Acting like nobody got a clue to the scenario
When the truth comes out they're scrambling
To dodge the ball
All of this none of it for any reason
You know who I'm taking about
They try to stick their keys into your brain,
But I think we kinda had it
Type of life that ends up tragic

Do you want to live, or do you want to die?
Talk a lotta shit is kinda like a suicide 

You could spot them from miles and miles
Got their hand in your pocket and face with a smile
I could recollect a sucker trying to play me out
Putting words in my mouth
So he would get someone to dis me for what I'm about
But you know and I know if I got beef I shout
I'm getting sick of muthafuckers and their stupid habits
Type of life that ends up tragic, tragic
