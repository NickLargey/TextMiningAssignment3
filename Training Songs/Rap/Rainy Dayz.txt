It's a mystery inside
Of how I'm gonna get mine
I'm thinking 'bout so many ways
Of how to conquer these rainy days

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

The war is on, yo
On rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich son, show and prove, ask my bitch
Stood up late nights, build with my a-alikes
We can pull a heist, snatch ice, or rock mics
But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch
How it goes Leon, pesos made from scratch
But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy
Heavy on the wrist, Polo mock socks and rugbies
Old flicks remind me of Gucci's
Back in Union Square when little Mack's milk, blast the year
That was Bill Bill, fast forward, ninety-four
Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more
Bless me out of state, howdy Jake's, Starks is back
Niggas want work, now I pull back off a G-Pack
Coke rocks flood the co-ops living gossip
Them big lip niggas singing to cops need to box it
Stop it, the projects overflooded with slow leaks
The fiends get, new faces get wrapped in sheets
I gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese blind
Sipping on fine wine, the power of the blacks refined
(Raining) Divine
Waiting on these royalties takes too long
It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay these
But that's ungodly, so yo God, pardon me
I need it real quick, the dope flow like penmanship
Meat heads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit
So now talk shit nigga, what??

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

What brings rain hail snow and earthquakes
The beat breaks, cause all my niggas to break son
Styles is similar to criminals locked up
With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up
I live once though, the mind stays infinite
Traveling to touch nine planets, in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu son, and maintain
It's all real, starving individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects, infested with rats cats and crack homes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake half real freedom-ville
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keeping my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, laying in mountains counting
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill dun, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up
Pay attention to 1010 WINS, Wu blends
Now I'm steering you to truth, buckle up
Now who's a legend?

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

Word up dun
Peace to Philly, VA, these days
Word up y'all, word up
The sun moon and stars fly cars, word up y'all

No sunlight, more gun fights
I've lost him to the street life, street life
No cash flow, no more dough
He's someone I don't even know, someone I don't know
Rainy Dayz, getting through those rainy dayz
I lost him to the street life, the street life, whoa
