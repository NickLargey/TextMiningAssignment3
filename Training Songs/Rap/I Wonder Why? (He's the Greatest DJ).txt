Oh yeah yeah
Uh-huh, ooh
Oh Antonio
Yeah yeah
Uh-huh

Tonight out in Brooklyn
Where it's always off the hook
And I was cruising with my favorite gang
We stepped up inside this night spot
Cause we heard it was tight HOT
We was groovin' doin' okay
(Whoop! Whoop!)
We were standing at the sideline
And the place started wilin'
When this one guy took control of the crowd
(What'd he do girl?)
That fella rocked the party
Like you ain't heard nobody
It was one man and he turned it out

[Chorus]
I wonder why
He's the greatest DJ
I wonder why
But you'll never hear
I wonder why
He's the greatest DJ
I wonder why

The champion of sound
My man he loves to put it down
And he never leaves the disco alone
I can dance then I can see
Makes the jam so complete
La crem de la crem
Please take me home
He rocks the hottest joint
And his mixes be on point
Ooh and the kid gots a flow
(What's the name girl?)
Tony Toca, me tiene loca
You got me actin' ill
I can stop and stand still

[Chorus]

[Tony Touch](Total)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Uh, yeah what? OH!
Check it out girl
Yeah uh check it out world
Uh say what? Say what? Yo!
There ain't a problem that I can't fix
Why not?
Cause I do it in the mix
And if your man gets in trouble
He'll bounce on the double
And come to the spot girlfriend so we can bubble
Me and you one on one with the music
Play the hot shit that makes ya just lose it
On the dance floor you start buggin'
Actin' all silly with the big willies
For really's, that's what this here be all about
Uh forget the drama I'ma get you out
Yo see my techniques nothin' sweet
It gets ugly girl so let's creep
Come on

[Repeat: x4]
Hey Mr. DJ play that song
Keep doin' it, doin' it
All night long

Hey Mr. DJ play that song
Keep me dancin'
DJ!
Play that funky music mister DJ
Come on, come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah ooh

[Chorus]

I wonder why
He's the greatest DJ

Tony Toca 
Did you like that one Tony?
I can put you in my little Antonia
I'm outta here
Fine!
