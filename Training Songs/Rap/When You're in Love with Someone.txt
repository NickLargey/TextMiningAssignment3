Oh.. When you're in love with someone yeah,

Oh... you...

See, the heart that you helped to mend
Was broken by a friend
Your kind, kind words
I'm sorry but they're hurting me
Love letters that I've never sent
Hidden from your eyes again
You never seem to notice
But to others it's so plain to see
Now it's time to tell the truth
I wish I could, baby, say that I love you

Chorus:
When you're in love with someone
Dreaming of a tender touch
Yeah, I love you so much 
To be friends is not enough
When you're in love with someone
(When you're in love with someone)
I don't know what to do 
Describe that someone...
Is you
( I hope you don't, hope you don't change a thing)
( I hope you don't, hope you don't change a thing)

My emotions cover me
Like a ship lost at sea
I'm waiting for the one who will fill my destiny
In my mind you undress
I touch you with tenderness
I open up my eyes, I can't believe you're right in front of me
I can feel that you see my pain
Then you say with a smile
That you feel the same 

Chorus

Ooooh...

When you're in love with someone
Dreaming of a tender touch
Yeah, I love you so much 
To be friends is not enough
When you're in love with someone
I don't know what to do 
Cause that someone is you

I hope it don't change a thing
