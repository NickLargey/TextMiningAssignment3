Ridin' in the 'Bach with the seat way back
This white on white Maybach, I call it payback
Yeah you know I f*ck with Zaytoven, we go way back
I'd rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track
Catch me flushin' down the street with the top way back
I had to give these bad bitches somethin' to wave at
Man y'all know I f*ck with Mike Will, we go way back
Now let's bring the trap back nigga, Gucci Mane back nigga

I'm the bestest, I'm the freshest ever stepped on the scene
I mean what I say, I say what I mean
Keep a rocket in my pocket like my name was Hakeem
Somebody had the picture, she thought it was a dream
A college chick dream big man on campus
All these folks impersonate me like Elvis
Too much sauce and I'm not selfish
I rule with a nine bitch wrapped in Velvet
The seat way back and the top laid back
Her waist real small but that ass real fat
She get turnt up and you can't turn back
She make my dick stand up, I push them legs way back

Now let's bring the trap back nigga, Gucci Mane back nigga

I'm the slickest, I'm the richest ever rapped on the track
In the S six hundred with the seat way back
Ten seventeen mob boss, I don't play that
Might get your whole head knocked off if you say that
I had a long nosed point thrity-eight way way back
I sent a nigga to the pearly gates way way back
They thought that Gucci Mane was soft now they don't think that
Please get that devilish juice away from me, I don't drink that
My own clothing line Delantic man, yeah I read that
You heard Atlantic dropped Gucci? Why would they do that?
I lost 200k in Vegas, yeah man I blew racks
Man get these broke ass niggas away from me, they ain't worth two stacks
It's Gucci
