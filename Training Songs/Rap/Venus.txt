[Verse 1]
This is Zion I commanding this ship
Planet Earth, we'll be landing on venus
Landing on venus

Yo yo sometimes she shake her thing
Sometimes she want to chill
But otherwise she searchin' for that dog gone dollar bill
Yo she setting up a kill from the moment that it starts
Praying on the weakness that be lurkin' in their hearts
Seen it a million times i'm sure a million more
'cause venus she be working through the powers of amore
Mon cher ri mon cher ri I adore
That's what they be say thinkin' the heart is pure
But lets explore the reasons for the seasons
Why this sister want to to committ all these treasons
Like a sequence hit rewind cat
Now find the meaning to the scheming when we come back

[Chorus]
She wants money stacks
Fat cadillacs
Spend all her time dining out with big macs
Think a little green give her something to feel
But the best thing she can do is just chill

She wants money stacks
Superstars and cars
want to own a house a palace and casbahs
Thinkin' that the green give her something to feel
But the best thing she can do is just chill

[Verse 2]
Of the nubians
She's queen of illu-sion
Got a sub of box
Of mens thoughts
Tell me how you create all midnight skies
'cause when i'm standing by you all my time flies
that's how the web get weaved
You join in its spin and you start to believe
Even though your sixth sense
Tell you that you're already slipping sense
She's takin' all your cents
That's when the drama commence to start boomin'
Man, woman we both only human
That's just assuming that you still in the chase
Sister running holding karats right in front of your face

[Chorus]
She wants money stacks
Fat cadillacs
Spend all her time dining out with big macs
Think a little green give her something to feel
But the best thing she can do is just chill

She wants money stacks
Superstars and cars
want to own a house a palace and casbahs
Thinkin' that the green give her something to feel
But the best thing she can do is just chill

[Verse 3]
Purity and soul untouched virgin snow
Follow me into my deep cerebral
Money ain't for nothing it come and then it go
So why do we allow it to cause so much woe
I don't know but neither does he
Who be chasin' round sisters for a nominal fee
I can see why it may be like that
Brothers want to react to what they think they lack
I can see here she comin'then she's gone
Brothers just a pawn
Can not last very long

[Chrous]
She wants money stacks
Fat cadillacs
Spend all her time dining out with big macs
Think a little green give her something to feel
But the best thing she can do is just chill

She wants money stacks
Superstars and cars
want to own a house a palace and casbahs
Thinkin' that the green give her something to feel
But the best thing she can do is just chill
