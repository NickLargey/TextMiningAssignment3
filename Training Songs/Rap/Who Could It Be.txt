[Intro: ]
I told my baby not to wake me 
Not even for a cup of tea 

[Chorus ]
Who could it be now 
Who could it be now 
Who could it be now 
Knocking on the rastaman's door 

[Verse 1 ]
I've got to get myself away 
And find me a place where I'll be free 
City life is getting me down 
Even when I sleep I'm wearing a frown 
It couldn't be the landlord 
Could it be my baby? 
I told her not to wake me 
Not even for a cup of tea 

[Repeat Chorus (2x)] 
[Verse 2] 
I'm in deep meditation 
Trying to find myself 
Don't need no provocation 
It's a minute after twelve 
Now who dares to disturb 
My tranquility 
When I'm meditating on the Almighty 

[Repeat Chorus ]
[Repeat Verse 1]
