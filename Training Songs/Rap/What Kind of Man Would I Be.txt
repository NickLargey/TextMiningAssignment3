(Lawrence El)
Intro: 
You know 
We can't do this 
We just can't 
Listen 
Verse: 
You say you feel disenchanted 
Cause lately he takes you for granted 
Still faithful and true you've remain to hurt so have I 
You pour out your heart and I listen 
And we catch a vibe reminising 
Temptation so strong not to meantion the yearning inside 
Chorus: 
But what kind of man would I be 
If I lived unfaithfully 
And what kind of girl would you be 
If you did the same 
Cause I don't want to see her cry 
And you don't need a reason to lie 
Cause if we lay down tonight 
It won't justify through a lover's sigh 
Verse:
The feeling is strong and we know it 
But we gotta see past the moment 
There's too much to lose if we blow it 
This is no lie 
Still here we are both together 
With promises made that we'd never 
Yet feeling it now more than ever 
I can't deny 
Chorus 
Guitar solo 
Bridge: 
Here we are 
All alone 
But somehow we got to be strong 
Chorus 
Adlib 
Makes me want to say oh-oh 
Just gotta say oh-oh 
Makes me want to say oh-oh 
Just gotta say oh-oh 
What kind of man could I be 
Oh can't be unfaithful 
Sorry baby
