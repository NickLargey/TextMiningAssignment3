(No more games.)
(Hey yo.)
(No more games, 'cause game over!)

[Rock of Heltah Skeltah]
On the count of three transform, bezet mack DJ's,
Where through any hood, even Eddie Murphy DJ's
If we ever see ya we beat up the ruff to take his earf
Yo somebody must have sent them the word, ya heard

[Ruck of Heltah Skeltah]
Murkey today, decept purple decray, fill the burst from the tray
See the urban decay, never f*ck with you cowards 'cause your worthless and gay
Take your hat and coat niggaz leave you shirtless and hey

[Skoob of Das EFX]
Yo, Yo, Yo, Life's a bitch I'm trying be twice as rich
Ice to wrist, trying cop priceless shit
Things ain't changed, still terrorize the game, bring the pain
Still living my thundom range
Ready to ball, don you ain't steady you fall
On the down low your found low in the ground yo
Come around yo, mad sex and drugs
Puff a haze in the custom made nex on dove

[Chorus]
Game over, lets see if you can play with the best
Game over, who next, step up and get wrecked
Game over, and we only play with respect
Game over, its over soldier, told ya
Game over, rewind if you want to play again
Game over, that's fine but you still can't win
Game over, with the joy-stick or the pin
Game over, its over soldier, told ya

[Glaze NY]
Yo, I got chips in the stash, schemes to get cash
Tits I could flash, and a thong in my ass
Bitch go against me, I better think fast
How your bodyguards and your bulletproof glass
For ya!

[P Dap]
Push the six Walara Shagan with a shotgun, give a f*ck if the cops come
The type of cat who come hom your face, invading space,
Daper daddy dealing with your case

[Substantial]
Rappers get inches daddy sticky stains on my fende-a
Niggas drop, had the biggest drug by us in the block
You ever waist the sperm, or taught like I was scern
Fucking germ how you want this a lava or luvagurn

[Hakim]
See I ain't got no rocking your cife to prove that I'm nice
I ask niggas they tell you I ain't new with the mic
But every now and then, niggas want to test the chen
I came in piece but that's what I leave 'em restening

[Chorus]

[Agallah]
Hey yo, pass me the potion,
All of you flash into a corvotion
I'm the one holds and spits this shit with emotion
As soon as I'll closing, all of you stop the commotion
Agallah bitch I'll open
The name is self spoken

[Loose]
We run NYC with the pounds to get high
Serve niggas from head state queens to bed stop
Lime green weely niggas with red eyes
Nigga hot green go with the force like jedis

[Tuffy]
Niggaz roll the dust to this shit, 'cause my words like herb
This track's getting blazed and the seas getting surfed
You know the size we don't want to wake up?
And take more L's to the chest than levurn 

[Masta Ace]
A lot of niggaz switch and transform into a bitch
Once they get the green light mitch and become rich
Your cute song ain't hot nigga, its nuke warm
And what I'm on is hip hop in its true form

[Chorus]

[Misery]
Enter me two things that maintain my verbal A.K
Misery spray, in any emcee in his way
No doubt about it, I Bart it, Bart it then brought about it
Ya want to start it, I'm leaving motherfuckers dearly departed

Ya sore losers pressing the restart button
When we roll up, you say nothing
Party crashers with permanent hang overs
Shut the f*ck up, pass the mic, game over
Sore losers pressing the restart button
When we roll up, you say nothing
Party crashers with permanent hang overs
Shut the f*ck up pass the mic, game over
