[Chorus]
I be a Live MC, a Live MC
Comin straight from Jersey, Jersey y'all
You want to be in this industry, you wannabe in this
You think it's easy as A-be	-see, nah nah nah nah nah
I be a Live MC, a Live MC
Comin straight from Jersey, Jersey y'all
You want to be in this industry, what?
You think it's easy as 1-2-3, hah

[Verse 2: Heather B]
Ask me and I tell ya, I'm a tryer not a failure
Inspired by the likes of Mya and Mehalya
Some records they hail ya, some records they nail ya
Sell out to sell records now the masses understand ya
Who I got to proof to only me can I loose to
He's happy to have a bail check like so these A & are is used to
But man I got heart like Rosa Parks
And I stay makin records with true MC's like Freddie Foxxx
Send comitees send somebody to tell me I won't tell
Cause I ain't got silicones, too much fire up in me
So future like izelja got my X got my backs
And I don't want to be a player no more say the fakers
Much hate us, now congratulate us, most hayas, now prayers
But you know is all that dough
Just pay her pay me a +Slayer+ like +Buffy+
I'm a artist a MC and regardless I be
Maskerin mine crazy not for the swift
But for those that endure us all the time
I rhyme I rip I spit I do collabo's when I kick
And all due to the fact that I been'm blessed with the gift

[Chorus]
I be a Live MC, a Live MC
Comin straight from Jersey, Jersey y'all
You want to be in this industry, you wannabe in this
You think it's easy as A-be	-see, nah nah nah nah nah
I be a Live MC, a Live MC
Comin straight from Jersey, Jersey y'all
You want to be in this industry, what?
You think it's easy as 1-2-3, hah
