There's so much drama in the NYC 
I'm trying to make this dollar but only got 15 
Where the grass don't grow and birds don't sing 
Where the police be hollering bout my crew 
Is that about this little life of mine you see, 
Have me sitting on 20's 'fore I turn 16. 
Wouldn't trade it in for anything 
And I got nothing but love

[Chorus:]
I got love for these streets and the street got love for me
Gotta keep it gangsta every day 
Can't change what's inside a me so baby can take me out 
The streets but can't take the streets outa me 
I'm gon' still be gangsta (Gangsta) 'cause the streets go right for me.

It's like everywhere I go, everywhere that I be, 
The streets biggin' me up from west to east
Down to the dirty-dirty and overseas they be showin' love to all my people, 
Throw it up we gon' always shine you see, 
Cause any time I needed you you was there for me. 
My heart my sole your why I sing and I got nothin' but love.

[Chorus]

In the morning when I cry, 
You are always on my mind 
When I go to bed at night, 
You will still be by my side you never let me down 
So I'll never let ya go this is dedicated to the streets
You got my heart (my heart)

[Chorus: x2]

This is for my streets go 'head wit ya gangsta self
This is for the streets so go 'head wit ya gangsta self 
I see you I see you OK OK this if for my streets wit ya gangsta self

[Chorus: x3]
