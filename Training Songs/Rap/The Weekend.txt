Ay
It's goin' down every weekend, yeah
Malibu, top gone, everything for the weekend
Yeehaw, ay
Summertime, bathin' suit, jump in the pool for the weekend
Ay, yeehaw
I can make any bitch leave her man, just for the weekend
She don't really know it's goin' down tonight (down tonight)
Up in the city goin' down tonight
All lights, our mission, they gone tonight
She like, "Shit, it's goin' down"
Tonight, I'm in my P1, doors up, I'm goin' places
She know that I'm goin' places (goin' places)
Seein' different faces
Blue hundreds, big faces
Tonight (tonight), yeehaw

Got it crackin' out in California
What I'm blowin' on strong, bottle of ammonia
"Keep your fuckin' phone on" what I tell my bitch
She don't answer, my mentality is hit a dancer
F*ck it, shit
I got no time for the f*ck shit, I'm gettin' money or die
Get the f*ck on with distractions, I'm way too dope not to have it
Rather say "bye" and stay fly than stay apart and me die
Some shit it just ain't no sheeshin', either you with it or not
If you gon' measure my bad more than you measure my good
Just think it could've been worse, I could be dead in the hood
Instead I'm out here with Swift, poppin' bottles and shit
Tell me how we gettin' it, it feels like the '90s again, damn

That Bentley truck'll get your dick sucked
I know you want that, but first you gotta run your chips up, ooh
I let lil' mama slurp on dick until her hiccups (slurp)
Told her, "Keep that Rollie on" until her fuckin' wrist cut (ay, keep that Rollie on)
Ay, okie pokie, woah (okie pokie)
I think my gators got a scoliosis, woah
Made it out the hood, ain't win no trophy, but I got gold
The obstacle is get this money up and, and go
Or you gon' end up stuck 'round here, drinkin' beer
Listen to my music, I can put somethin' in your ear
Pussy nigga play I bop-brrrat-bop-bop their beard
Your mama seen you get bop-brrrat-bop-bopped, then she teared
I pulled up to the party and walked in like, ay
I don't want no problems, I just wanna say

When you see a Friday (yeah, yeah)
You paid for that ride out the driveway (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When you see a Saturday (yeah, yeah)
Lookin' like we never seen a bad day
When you see a Sunday
Dressed like we fresh off the front page (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Catch us every weekend (weekend)
And we gon' do more ballin' than sleepin'
We gon' be stayin' up, drinking all night
Gotcha pourin' shots out the bottle, getting high with a model
Ain't no body die, we'll be alright
Nigga, f*ck the drugs and the liquor, we get high on the lifestyle
I said f*ck the drugs and the liquor, we get high on the lifestyle

The Dime Trap
Plainly put, it's like a TED talk for hustlers
The evolution of Trap Muzik
Now, Trap Muzik is, you know, a dope boy's philosophy
A former trap nigga's experiences and adventures
Said to music
But not just, when he cracking a key or when he 
Cooking the work or when he sell it and get busted
We know all that
What happen when he go on vacation, you know
How is that
What happen when he fall in love?
Or have his first child
All we want to cover all those bases because dope boys go through many, many things
Just because it's trap music, don't mean it got to be one dimensional
Diversified vibes
