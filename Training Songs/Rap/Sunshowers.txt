I bongo with my lingo
Beat it like a wing yo
From congo to columbo
Can't stereo-type my thing yo

I salt and pepper my mangos
Shoot, spit out the window
Bingo I gotta em in the thing yo
Now what? I'm doing my thing yo

Quit bending all my fingo
Quit beatin me like your ringo
You want to go you want to win a war
Like p.l.o we don't surrendo

Sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'cause I'm watching you my baby

I bongo with my lingo
Beat it like a wing yo
From congo to columbo
Can't stereo-type my thing yo

I checked that mouth on him
Fucking check that gas on him
I had him cornered him
Fucking shut that gate on him

Why would you listen to him
He had his way I'm bored of him
I'm tired of him
I don't want to be as bad as him

It's a bomb yo
So run yo
Put away your stupid gun yo
'cause see though like a protocol call
Which is why they blow it up fore they go

Sun showers that fall on my troubles
Are over you my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'cause I'm watching you my baby

Semi-9 and snipered him
On that wall they posted him
They cornered him
And then just murdered him

He told them he didn't know them
He wasn't there they didn't know him
They show'd him a picture then
Ain't that you with the Muslims

He got Colgate on his teeth
And Reebok classics on his feet
At a factory he does Nike
And then helps the family

Beat heart beat
He's made it to the newsweek
Sweetheart seen it
He's doing it for the peeps peace

Sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'cause I'm watching you my baby

The accompanying video was shot in the South Indian jungle and directed by the acclaimed Rajesh Touchriver. Rajesh shot to fame last year with his directorial debut, the award winning Ã¢??In The Name of Buddha'. Set in Sri Lanka, it portrayed the three-way struggles between the Tamils, Sinhalese and Indian 'peacekeepers' and was willing court controversy in order to tell a realistic story.
