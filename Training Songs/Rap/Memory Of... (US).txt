And it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of (I remember your face, I remember your ways)

I remember you now
Part of my existence
I remember your face
You came here and got me
All in a day
Yeah, all in a day
I remember your lips
Do you remember the taste
Remember family names
Your child, my child, our child
Whitley and Dwayne
Different turn my world now
Remember the waist
You gripped my hips so tight now
Slow at the pace, made me erase
Don't remember my waist

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of (I remember your face, I remember your ways)

How could I forget
A ballad was born upon a demo of a fly love song
Didn't take long before the archer with the wings heard it
Shot us in the heart with a contract, he knew we were a hit
The right amount of soul with a parallell amount of grit
But the archer couldn't see the target of depature
Gave you a pink slip and called it quits
It's understood you would
Label me the mate who wronged you, cause I kept wanting a feature
With them other females on they songs too
The words spoken in mono for monogomy
Telling me I have to go because I chose stereo for stereo 
Typical male biology
And now I'm left setting traps for you to fall in
For me again but with haste you tell me
To slow up the pace, make me erase
Don't remember my waste

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of

Our last trip to Vegas had me feeling like we had a chance
But chance showed up at the wedding
I guess I didn't read the heading
Forgiven on a race to bitter past, but I ain't up for kissing ass
I bought you everything your pretty feet could fit in
Put you behind the finest steering wheels 
Fearing you would drive a nigga crazy
Told you grow up, but shit you was my baby
Bits and pieces never made nothing decent
When I accommodated you, you played me like a stranger
I remember you now
Accountability is major
A part of what I did then
Remember your face
Just don't let me trip over memory lane
'Cause time can't be replaced

Mmm and I don't want to stay
Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of

I remember your ways, De La featuring Estelle
