If you really dig me, and you think I'm jiggy 
Come on shorty let me know 
We can get together, we can do whatever 
But you cant get no dough 

Yo, since the Mona video you been trackin' me down 
tryin' to figure out how I lookin'perso-nal, Baby 
forget looks tell me can you roll with crooks 
the three hot niggas rising in the Billboard books, nigga 
we look at things through the big lens, big picture 
big Benz we try and make CEO ends, 
the thick chicks love us, big dick style niggas 
Cristal niggas, ya'll finesse this quick style niggas 
you didn't love me when my name was Sean 
Now you should see how bitches act when the Benjamins come on 
but I ain't hatin' em, you gotta love the ways females play 
Quickly use a neglige to getta get-away 
Five stars where the willies stay, and Sheek pay for nothing 
but thats what ya'll herbs get for frontin' 
I spend wild chips gettin' drunk up in the China 
Club, while you up in Skate Key wit a minor 

I know she wit it, I betta brick I could hit it 
Black tie affair I gotta fresh pair of British 
Ice Berg shirts with Ice along with it 
turquoise, 9-11 Porsche and it's tinted 
but honey got alot of jazz, You gotta philly 
You gotta bag, then she went inside the Prada bag 
Blew two and she said it was choice, like my voice 
my thug style made her cat moist 
that's the realest shit I heard, that's my word 
Regardless who she fucked, I'm the nigga she deserves 
I put her on the hole in Jerz, rockin' furs 
different ways to speak without using words 
And even though she proper I still gotta drop her 
Cuz Sheek dont like her, had a dream that he shot her 
I cant buy you ascotta, you get nada 
I'm the bounce with a chick that look a little bit hotter 

If you really dig me, and you think I'm jiggy 
Come on shorty let me know 
We can get together, we can do whatever 
But you cant get no dough 

They was never mine for me to dump em 
its just like checkers, after they make a move then I jump em 
It's like this girlfriend I'm a keep it real, 
every nigga with a deal ain't able to peel 
I'm a Bad Boy so I'm caked up with whips 
And guess what, I got more nuts than chips 
And they gon' melt right in your mouth 
not in your hand, You know that you aint my girl 
I'm not your man 
But do you still wanna lick me? 
or is cause I'm a six figgy niggy, and I know Biggie 
and I dont mess with no fat ladies 
but if you pay like you weigh then you can stay baby 
PJ slide to tha mo like that 
with this honey named trout cuz she blow like that 
and when we finish dont look at me like I owe nothin' 
cuz if you really dig then let me know something 

If you really dig me, and you think I'm jiggy

We can get together, we can do whatever 
But you cant get no dough
