Aye, aye, aye, ya
Tot' 'em up, light it up, nigga
Birdman, motherfucker

Clipse, VA, NO, nigga, what you smelt?
Coke'll leave plastic, boy
[Incomprehensible] border motherfucker
Come on little'n handle your business for me boy

What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
He was talking shit
We put a clap into that boy

What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
He was talking shit
We put a clap into that boy

I heard he snitchin' on a player, man, say it ain't so
Even as a young'n they consigned me to blow
Witches claims why I'm worth my weight in gold
While they was taking baby steps from an 8th to an O

Word in the streets that can envy as me
Enough ice on that watch to make a nigga lose sleep
Magnified face help the bitch see clearly
9 on the waist hit the bitch up severely

I'm known for the flip of that Coke I ener
I'm heavy in the street like the 7 series Bimma
Man, hit 'em with the Nina man
Or that 4/5th guaranteed to lean ya, man

Oh, I'm the reason that your block is vacant
Malicious will hit ya just to make a statement, bitch
Clipse and Cash Money, who ain't rich?
Don't compare me to you, nigga, you ain't this, woh

What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
He was talking shit
We put a clap into that boy

What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
He was talking shit
We put a clap into that boy

Stunna and Patty Cake, the worldwide Pusha
Birdman, nigga, leave the guns in the busher
Been shittin' up bricks unload 'em to Gucci
Boss of the ghetto, with the round shape cookie

Shit one, Dro one, nigga, flood the block
If I don't go to jail, niggas, birds gone flop
Nigga sittin' on the toilet, bitch, get off the pot
The bird just landed so the hood gon' rot

New whips, big chips, the Prada, Gucci shit
But, mami, you fly Benz, the wide skinny lips
She takes my flight, she holds my weight
While the po-po staked out from state to state

It ain't nuttin' to a baller baby
Pay the cars, big money, heavy weight, Birdman, hood boss
Baby steppin' on my line, I'll show a little somethin'
They callin' you don't come out then the black crow'll touch ya

What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
He was talking shit
We put a clap into that boy

What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
He was talking shit
We put a clap into that boy

Another soul lost, had to make a shirt
Match my ox blood colored Porsche
The rims match of course
Blood hit his Timbs, it reminded me of them

Glistenin' wrist on chiller
Gun in the same palm of gorgeous killer
I put this on my Lord
My niece was 4 when she felt chinchilla

I past the shore for that shit that made fiends
Rise from the dead like Thriller
Gangster, hustler
At night, still found time to kiss my mother

Live like I'm dreamin', kick my feet up
Gun pulled my waist remind me of my demon
So quite ya yappin' fore I get to clappin'
And have your body parts mix and matching fella

What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
He was talking shit
We put a clap into that boy

What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
He was talking shit
We put a clap into that boy

Aye, aye, aye, aye
There it is, nigga, there you have it
Birdman, Clipse you under-smelt, VA you know?
Uptown, nigga, we go anywhere with this bullshit
We flip bricks you under-smell

Aye nigga, put this puzzle together
Aye Pharrell, you did this year
1000 pieces puzzles, 100, you know?
Let's get this money

Hey nigga, I smell somethin'
Coke'll leave plastic, bitch, you know?
Get money, motherfucker
However you want, it you can get it, pimp
From gangster to blood

Nigga, take it how you want it, nigga
We did it how we live
Ain't nothin' but the thug thing, nigga
Money thing, mother
