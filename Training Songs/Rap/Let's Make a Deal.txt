Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I...
If I didn't have a dime
Tell me would you spend the time
All I hear is buy me things
Baby girl what's on your mind?
You say money isn't a thing to you
But all that shopping you do
I can't keep a dime in the safe
I'm not try-na pull your weight
Let's make a deal

Baby let's make a deal
If you do what I say
You can get what you want
We can have everything
As long as you learn how to give and take

Baby let's make a deal
If you do what I say
You can get what you want
We can have everything
As long as you learn how to give and take

Tell me why the house ain't clean?
Why my son ain't in school?
Why the phone bill so high?
Girl you must think I'm a fool
All you do is run around all day
I come home you got something to say
Talking 'bout what a man don't do
That's why I wrote this song 'bout you

So baby tell me can you cook a meal?
I'm getting hungry
Can you wash a load?
Wash the clothes
Baby take this house
Turn it and make it home

Baby let's make a deal
If you do what I say
You can get what you want
We can have everything
As long as you learn how to give and take

Fellas if you're in your jeeps 
(One time)
Or if you're in your Bentleys
(Two times)
Won't you turn it up for me
(Three times)
Turn it up for me
Ladies hope you're feeling the song
Staying home all alone
It's time for me to set it straight
Sit back and let it marinate
