Diggin In The Crates 9 9 
Yeah yeah  
Still Diggin y'all 
Yeah yeah  yo yo 
There's only one way for me to explain  the key to this game 
Is longev  keep it the same 
The seeds'll remain  only if they bringin the pain 
Hip hop don't stop like the heat in my vein 
The streets know my name  Don Carta bomb harder 
My persona is honored in the Bronx as my alma matter 
I'm smarter than the average Joe, packin a flow 
That's stackin the dough, let's bring the chips in the bag and let's go 
It's Fat Joe, I'ma set it straight 
If you do your hist I exist through Diggin In The Crates 
I'm bringin in the ace, had to stay up late 
Playin the corners but never seen a day upstate 
Until the day I escape or see Tone at the pearly gates 
I continue to runch it even after the computer breaks 
You know the rates, fifty-thou for every verse that's foul 
And I bring rhymes to life like the birth of a child 

"Verbal assualt" 
"Blow out your tweeters"

Check it, my whole crew holdin 
We all got cars wit extra features 
It's a bunch of y'all, one got dough, the rest is leeches 
You probably mad 'cause I be sexin divas 
I should pull this pistol out and make you touch your sneakers 
I'm on some cool out shit, but I will pull this tool out quick 
And put some holes in your new outfit 
You frontin hard 'cause your whip a Range 
But it's a 4.0, you nerd nigga, you heard Jigga now get your change 
You ain't a willy you a small solider, give it up son it's all over 
And you never sold a, pound a cane 
You a clown wit fame, goin down the drain 
All yo' shit sound the same 
I'ma shine pop-o, 'cause when you got dough your rocks glow 
L got a hot flow that rap coppo 
I'm Uptown smoothest, first album left you clowns clueless 
Sayin I'm wack, you niggas sound foolish 
Niggas hate to see L bubble, they'd rather see L struggle 
'Cause what they sell, I'ma sell double 
You want to see rocks, then look at L's wrist 
If you see me in the club drinkin Mo' that means they don't see Cris, what
