And now they tell me I'm a bad boy
All the time they look at me and mad boy
I just like put my hands up in the air
I want a bad girl dancing over there

Looking look up on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves God I want more
Keep it going girl cause you're the best star
I gotta stay
Go little bad girl little bad girl 
Go little bad girl little bad girl 
Go little bad girl little bad girl 

Tell me I'm a bad boy
All the time you look at me and mad boy
I just like put my hands up in the air
I want a bad girl dancing over there

Looking hot ass from the left to the right
Moving in dance every time all night
I wanna see you move to the left all night
You can do it there if you want it alright
