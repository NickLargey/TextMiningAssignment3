[Chorus Cuts: DJ Babu:]
Just too hot to touch
Just too hot to touch I got what you want

[Madchild:]
Although I plan to go out with a bang not a whimper
I still gotta watch my temper
Watch over both shoulders cause of what I'm into
Sometimes I get emotional cause of what I've been through
It goes..
Anger, anger, that's one of my hangups
You don't wanna rock and roll kid, your head gets banged up
Feel tension, blood starts pumpin
My friends always win in the fights, I still jump in
And I don't have a drinking problem
I drink, talk shit, fall down no problem
When I drink its a problem, cause I cause problems
Cold hearted, man I'm so robotic
Not like you forgot but I'm slightly psychotic
I'm here to terrorize the world
And f*ck the minds up of you boys and girls

[Chorus Cuts]

[Prevail:]
Complete sweep like a cluster bomb
Cold as death, hold your breath till the dust is gone
>From the lost angel city to the gotham skyline
We're still public access but watch us go primetime
I'm Cannonball Crush, not Cane or Able
I reign like Charlamain and just as fatal
Even worse, I'm not vain or narcissistic
Preach like an arch bishop from the darkest district
In the killing field planting seeds of dissent
Fast fascinating demons flashing dreams of contempt
Come on, self contained I'm my own metropolis
Go against the grain for the throne of the populace
Kingdoms I want em, hand em over, relinquish
Or I'll douse them in flames that you'll never extinguish
My right hand writes in sequential order
Eventually I'll make you lifespan potentially shorter

[Chorus Cuts]

[Madchild:]
I'm Fuckin with em....
Did so much dirt can't rinse the filth
Wealthy but concerned with my mental health
Hope to got to heaven but I've been through hell
Think I'm going crazy man please don't tell
Cops hate me they want to throw me in jail
Hate to think if they got me alone in a cell
I'm pretty sure it wouldn't go so well
Cause ain't nobody coming when you yell for help

[Prevail:]
We're the fast and elite
What else, the young and the vigorous
You should probably keep your distance
Cause my hunger is hideous
Tell affiliates and friends there's no need to defend
When the warriors descend is where the story will end
Were ageless and timeless, your faceless and spineless
So let us lead the way while they follow in blindness

[Chorus Cuts]
