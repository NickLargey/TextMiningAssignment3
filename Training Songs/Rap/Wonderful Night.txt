You know the music search engine need a tuneup 
Soon as they out the gate they all a want to hear da corner, uh-huh 
Well that was cool but now but then I heard a rumor, uh-huh 
Your crew was ridin' for the White Cliffs of Dover

Uh let me tell ya how we do it in California 
We'll have you on the run just like a puma 
If it don't move us 
Ain't paid ya dues and it ain't gonna get our roosers 
We gonna lose ya to the consumer solution c'mon

Your body's like a narcotic 
The thought is auto-erotic 

Come on and break it on down

I guess your brick-house I'll bet it 
Take it as far as you'll let it 

Come on and break it on down 

That the spot will get hot 
That its ready to pop 
Don't even look at the clock 
All of your problems forgotten 
It's time to rock till you drop 
Feel the force and just flock 
To the epicenter of the party's bass drummers c'mon

Everybody's high 
Eyes just like a child 
Everything feels right 

Once you've seen the light 
You're gonna move all night 
Feel your soul ignite 
Everything feels right, right, riggggggggghht 

We live the masterful life that's mythical 
Feel its chords and its vibes atypical 
Do what you want 
It's alright this mystical time you've got 
That's a lot of this principle 

If you stay in this moments so critical 
Let the music change your brain stem's chemicals 
Make you feel like your spirit's invincible 
Force centrifugal reaching up to your pinnacle now 

It's a wonderful night 
You've gotta take it from me

We rock like Colorado 
You're at it throwin' bottles 
We give a f*ck about who your status 
Who you are tomorrow 
Whether you beg or borrow 
Or hit the super lotto 
Whether your girl look like a minga or a supermodel 

Feel the connectedness, energy, disprojected the weighted 
The whole collective consciousness 
Arise like helium oh 
Groovin' out of the question 
Won't disrespect him, but 
Our styles fuckin' pouch like Dave Beckham c'mon 

It's a wonderful night 
You've gotta take it from me

The truth I'm at ‘em and rough ‘em 
As hard as the granite get 
Never hesitant upon a mic strike, quick 
Like an avalanche 
Hijack ya like a Comanche 
I'm a man on a mission 
Rhyme vigilante 
Keep all the jealous and the envious antsy 
Love to do the club though with the party people dancin' uh-huh 
And set the mood for all the plottin' and romancin' 

It's a wonderful night 
We've got the answer c'mon 
It's a wonderful night 

Come on and break it on down 

It's a wonderful night 
You've gotta shake it
