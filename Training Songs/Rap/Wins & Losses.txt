You have to eat the dream, you have to sleep the dream, you have to dream the dream
You gotta touch, you have to see it when nobody else sees it
You have to feel it when it's not tangible
You have to believe it when you cannot see it
You gotta be possessed with the dream

Yeah
Any weapon formed against us shall not prosper
Young nigga started with oodles and noodles, now we eating lobster

Uh, as I walk through the valley with my ladder in flex
I'm the realest nigga in it, I just happen to rap
When they all thought we was finished, they was laughing at that
So I went and bought me a don and flipped that hat to the back
F*ck 'em

New jewelry, new whips on the way now
Brr, brr, that's yo bitch on the way now
Mama told me if you fall, never stay down
Stand up nigga, I can never lay down
Wins and the losses, it come with being bosses
Shoot a pussy nigga in his head if he cross us
Take that shit to trial if the feds making offers
Five hundred thou, Louis said we lookin' awesome
Swap that Patek for them cups, take them off us
Lil' bitch, call me lil' fish
Niggas tryna turn my lights out, I'm still lit
Streets calling and they said they was some real shit
Young bull looking like he hit a real lick

I got too many foreigns, man this shit getting borin'
Half a milli last week, you would've thought I was touring
Niggas tried to kill me, I guess they thought I was normal
They ain't know I was different
I'm like lord be my witness 'cause we was fucking up them dishes in my grandmama kitchen
Killed a pigeon thought the vision, break it down on my niggas
F*ck their opinions, why would I listen, they ain't see the vision, 
When I had foreign, I mentioned no, I ain't see them bitches 
So I'mma ball on 'em, Magic City, let it fall on 'em
And all my niggas staying down with me
Know I be there if they call on me
Yeah, my nigga bad for Milli he made it home in a week
Even my momma know how I'm rocking, I go on them streets
Glock .40, keep it on me, we rolling 32 deep
Bulletproof everything, just let me know if it's peak
We bring the war, I just wanna shine like my rollie
Put in all this time that they owe me
Made it to a nine and we litty
Dropping sixty-twos like we Kobe, oh
Pushing the foreigns, drive through the trenches
Top of the food chain, head of comission
We breaking niggas without permission
Never was personal, it was business
Brrr, settle down, let it settle down
Couldn't tell me shit when I was broke, f*ck they gon' tell me now?
I'm running round, got a gun that hold a hundred rounds
If it was f*ck them niggas then it's f*ck them niggas now
F*ck 'em! Never change on my real dawgs
'Bout that 'caine, been them thangs like we old dawgs
Walk up in a dealer and I pull that Rolls out
These niggas said I wouldn't make it like I told y'all, ahh
