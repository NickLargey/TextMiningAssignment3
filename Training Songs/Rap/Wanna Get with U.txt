I wanna get with you
'Cause you got a lot
You're sure enough kicking
You're looking hot
I wanna get with you

If you got the time
Baby, we can swing it
But you gotta make up your mind
Gotta get with you

Wanna make you sweat
I can't wait just to make you wet
And if I get with you
Can't forget the crew

So you can get your girlfriends
And I wanna get you
I'm gonna get you

I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you

Yo, I wanna get with you
Tell me is that much to ask for
Nothing more than a spare minute
I got time if you wanna get with it

Whatever you want I'll get it
I got cash now help me spend it
Don't worry if your broke I'll fix it
Like a flat then blow you up wicked

Got the ingredients you need me to mix it
So baby let me go to work
I'll show you how I go to work
Have the whole thing sewed up like a shirt

Give me a chance to just show you
Spend some time I need time to know you
After that were in like the New Jack Swing
Until it's through, I wanna get with you

I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you

I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you

Yo Aaron, take 'em to the bridge

You got what I want
Your so fine, I cannot front
On my knees begging you, please
I'll do anything in the world to get with you

I wanna freak you freak you, girl
If you think you can rock my world
Bring all the girls to the men with clout
Then we'll see who can bust who out

If I had the chance to get with you
There's nothing in the world that I can't do
Say we get together tomorrow at 2
I wanna get with you, hmm

I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you

I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you

I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you

I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you

I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
I wanna get with you
