The sky is sunny side up year round
Hella palm trees growing out the ground
Mountains stacked for miles and miles
Living life in the domesticated wild
Before I got here, I was a child
Now I’m here and tryna figure it out
On the path to see what life’s about
Pioneer shit, I pave my own route
All the way across the country, tryna make something
Outta myself while you sit at home wondering
What it could be, what it coulda been
Imma document my life with this paper and pen
The beginning, I don’t know how this ends
I don’t have my shit together, there’s no need to pretend
My pockets hella empty there’s no money to spend
Dreamlike reality cause everything just blends when you’re

Lost en Los Angeles
I'm Lost en Los Angeles
Lost en Los Angeles
I'm Lost en Los Angeles
Lost en Los Angeles
I'm Lost en Los Angeles
Lost en Los Angeles
I'm Lost en Los Angeles

Not a cloud in the sky, but the smog real thick
If we hit the highway now, we can beat the traffic
Turn this shit on, head bobs automatic
Thought you heard this before cause it feels like a classic
Things looks new behind these vintage sunglasses
Roll up the tree, spark that shit, then pass it
Pop a top, pop a stem, and let your face melt
I think I lost my mind thought I left it on the shelf
Now I'm tryna find myself all by myself
I gotta play the game cause the cards been dealt
Wanting something in return, don’t want your help
The realest shit I ever wrote, the realest shit i ever felt
Man, I'm from the South, I ain’t used to West Coastin
But I do appreciate these views of the ocean
Chillin' so hard that I move in slow motion
Hit the 101, you can picture me rollin' cause

Lost en Los Angeles
I'm Lost en Los Angeles
Lost en Los Angeles
I'm Lost en Los Angeles
Lost en Los Angeles
I'm Lost en Los Angeles
Lost en Los Angeles
I'm Lost en Los Angeles

You can play this at the function
Don’t lie, you know this shit bumping
You can play this at the function
Don’t lie, you know this shit bumping
You can play this at the function
Don’t lie, you know this shit bumping
You can play this at the function
Don’t lie, you know this shit bumping
