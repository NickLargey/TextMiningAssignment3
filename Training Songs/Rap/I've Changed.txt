I'm not whilin out like I used to
I don't do the things I used to no more
(I've changed for you)
Lookin' back I thought I would never
Love like this broke so many hearts before
I changed for you

I don't do the things that I used to do no more
Everything that you do I adore
No more lies, no more games, everything I say I mean (aye)
And all the love you give me baby,
It means so much to me
So don't take you love away
No one compares to what you do for me
And every time that you see me baby
You take me in your arms, hold me
Trust me baby I wont ever leave you

Believe me, I'm yours forever
You need me 'cause I'm down whatever
(Damn I've changed)

I'm not whilin out like I used to
I don't do the things that I used to no more
(I've changed for you)
Lookin' back I thought I would never
Love like this broke so many hearts before
I changed for you

Pull out the fine wine glasses
Dinner in bed (went and took some culinary classes)
Gotta stay sexy for you baby
Tighten up my body, workin' on my ghetto pilates
I'm not goin' out tonight (tonight)
We can hit the sofa,
Cuddle up, satellite service
Ohh baby whatever, let me accommodate ya
Is there anything you like for me to change
I can cut my plats (my plats) but I cant cover up my tats (Ohh no)
I did some things that I can't take back
But baby it's true,
I would change it all for you
Believe me (you gotta believe me baby), I'm yours forever
Completely (completely in love) I'm down for whatever
(Baby can change)

I'm not whilin out like I used to
I don't do the things that I used to no more
(I've changed for you)
Lookin' back I thought I would never
Love like this broke so many hearts before
I changed for you

New and improved, bringin out the best of me
Because the old me was lonely,
Searchin' for my one and only
So happy that I found you

Saw the potential
And you made it so simple,
To be loved
And I'll never be the same

Baby for you I've changed

I'm not whilin out like I used to
I don't do the things I used to no more (no more)
(I've changed for you)
Lookin' back I thought I would never (thought I would never)
Love like this broke so many hearts before {love like this, so many hearts before}
(I changed for you) I changed for you

I'm not whilin out like I used to
I don't do the things I used to no more
(I've changed for you)
Lookin' back I thought I would never
Love like this broke so many hearts before
I've changed for you
