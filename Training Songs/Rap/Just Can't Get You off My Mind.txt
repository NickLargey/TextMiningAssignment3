Woke up in the morning for work, 'bout 5 or 6
Nothing seemed unusual, another day same ____
I never even gave one second thought about it
That this could be the one day that changed my life
Ohhhhâ?¦
(shoodoop)
It was like out of a movie, so unusual
This one particular girl, see, she passed my way
She was so damn beautiful, like she walked right out of the screen
Right then and there I knew I had to have her for my queen
(shoodoop)

So niceâ?¦

So niceâ?¦(the way she walked)â?¦So rightâ?¦ So damn fine,
I just can't get you outta my mind
So niceâ?¦(she was so nice)â?¦So rightâ?¦ So damn fine,
I just can't get you outta my mind

(shoodoop)

I'm know she's probably used to guys with fancy cars or lots of money
And I wonder why she could be interested in a guy like me
I ain't no visions man, I'm no politician,
But I make my living honestly
(shoodoop)
Now I know, I know I'm just a regular old type of guy
But I deserve someone special in my life
And I do, I do, I'd do anything for you baby
If you were my woman, I swear I'd make everything just right

So niceâ?¦so rightâ?¦so damn fine
I just can't get you outta my mind
So niceâ?¦so right (so riiight)â?¦so damn fine
I just can't get you outta my mind
(uhh huhhhâ?¦babyyyy)
So niceâ?¦so rightâ?¦so damn fine
I just can't get you outta my mind
(I don't give a damn who knows about it baby)

You are so niceâ?¦(so nice), so right (so right)
So right, that I just can't get you outta my mind

So niceâ?¦so rightâ?¦so damn fine
I just can't get you outta my mind
So niceâ?¦so rightâ?¦so damn fine
I just can't get you outta my mind
