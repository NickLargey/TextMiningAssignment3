I prolly shouldn't say it but since I'm being honest
Can't nobody do you like I do (I've)
Been down for you since day one but never said a word
'Cause I'm playin’ my position gotta mission

See I want your attention, I want your affection
Whatever love ya given out
Girl it's mission, I need your permission
To get my ass up out the friend zone

The friend zone, the friend zone
Let me be the friend ya callin’ when you need love
The friend zone, the friend zone
Let me be the friend you need when you feel alone
Girl I been working on you slowly like I'm tryna get to know ya
You're so fine I'll wait in line like I'm waitin’ on my time
The friend zone, the friend zone
Long as I'm the one you callin’ when you feel alone

Girl I'm tryna told ya, long as I done know ya
I been workin’ tryna get promoted
Now everybody see it, I know you see it too
'Cause you keep that little smile off the little things I do

See I want your attention, I want your affection
Whatever love ya given out
Girl it's mission, I need your permission
To get my ass up out the friend zone

The friend zone, the friend zone
Let me be the friend ya callin’ when you need love
The friend zone, the friend zone
Let me be the friend you need when you feel alone
Girl I been working on you slowly like I'm tryna get to know ya
You're so fine I'll wait in line like I'm waitin’ on my time
The friend zone, the friend zone
Long as I'm the one you callin’ when you feel alone

Can we still be friends, if I say I want your body
Can we still be fiends, if I say I want your body
Can we still be friends, if I say I want your body
Girl, I want your body girl
Now can we still be friends, if I say I want your body
Can we still be friends, if I say I want your body
Can we still be friends, 'cause you know I want your body girl
I want your body (gotta get it up out the friend zone)

The friend zone, the friend zone
Let me be the friend ya callin’ when you need love
The friend zone, the friend zone
Let me be the friend you need when you feel alone
Girl I been working on you slowly like I'm tryna get to know ya
You're so fine I'll wait in line like I'm waitin’ on my time
The friend zone, the friend zone
Long as I'm the one you callin’ when you feel alone
