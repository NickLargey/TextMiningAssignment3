You're so beautiful, divine
Everything 'bout you so fine
And with the love like yours
There is no pain in this world that I can't endure
So beautiful, so wonderful
And as we float on the floor
I hear the music of love
Chorus
This is our song
This is the song we'll remember forever and ever
It means to you what it means to me
So from this moment on, we know
This is our song
Our song
Anytime I feel alone
I put on our favorite song
And like the music and words
We merge into one
And play on and on
Love's so beautiful, unconditional
Can't find the words to explain
This is our song and our song says it all
Chorus
When my skies are grey
Make them clear again
When I'm weak you are strong
I need to hear the sound, you need to hear the words
This is how it all began
Chorus
This is the song we'll remember forever and ever
That it means to you, what it means to me
So from this moment on
This is our song
This is our song
So forever and ever
With just so you know
Just so
We know
We know
We both know
This is our song
