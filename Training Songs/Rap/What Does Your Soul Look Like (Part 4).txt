Come talk to me 
Come on triggy man 
Come on, the camera's rolling 
Get that fucking bad thing 
Lose that 
Talk to me 
Who are you? 

Come on chopper male, chopper male sucker!
Got the gusto?, Come on!
In Vietnam! 

And 
And yet, I've just got to do something 
Because, I  I see I'm god, or something 
God 

I am superior to that 
Everyone is dead, or should I call in for the central right now?
And stand naked, with a hurt expression
Until it burns me up!

S.O.S
S.O.S

Away, come away, come away
