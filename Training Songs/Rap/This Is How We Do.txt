1, 2, Harlem World, Jamaica Queens thing
You know what I'm sayin'
Herb McGruff, Mr. Cheeks
We gon' do this like this

Yes, yes, y'all, Gruff stay fresh y'all
Puffin' bless y'all, in the Lex' to the mall
So-called bad chick, sexin' you all
Give Gruff a call, let me flex in them walls
Twirl ya backbone, get my mack on
Give your Reebok money, send ya ass home
Is Gruff a playa?  Nigga, ask Pretty Tone
Flooded rollie lit, smooth goldy shit
If I ever die, your Joe's gon' have a fit
Herb be phat, linen down derby hat
Gators bitin', minks and fur on me back
Live talk shows, pop corks off a Mo's
My money grows, while fiends snort up they nose
Private jet, nigga, whole life is set
Life like begets, mega ice on the neck

Yeah, this is how we do, just make ya boo-ga-lu
Harlem World, baby, and the LB crew
Now we do, party 'til the sky turn blue
Partyin', yeah, that's what we gon' do

I'm creepin' Uptown, and my mans ride wit 'em
He got two Dutches in the ash tray, and Sal wit' 'em
He gettin' blunted, so he wanted me to slide 'em
To meet two chicks, so we can get wild wit' him
We on FDR Drive, doing ninety-five
Smokin' trees, on the way, Saturday Night Live
Said they butters, plus they muthafuckin' pad is hot
Smoke the weed, drink the liquor, so I said why not
Peep it, ring the bell, as soon as we hit the spot
Shorty open the door wit' the short in the knot
Wit' the belly button showin', the L that's lit
Yo, I smell that shit, yo, I can tell that shit
Soon as my man creep wit' shorty inside the room
I con', I continue to spark up my moon, 'cause

Yeah, this is how we do, just make ya boo-ga-lu
Harlem World, baby, and the LB crew
Now we do, party 'til the sky turn blue
Partyin', yeah, that's what we gon' do

Ayo, Gruff holdin', keep the bar rollin'
Check me in VIP, gettin' love open
The fellow wit' cream, gon' sell her a dream
Gas up, just to get the hell in between
Know what I mean? Kick game, puff la green
Everywhere Gruff go, shine like high beam
Word up, y'all know be Iceberg'd up
Give me one minute, have your wife skirt up
And all playa haters get they life hurt up
Undertaker might have to dig some dirt up
Chocolate mack nigga, push a Ac vig'
Call it Don peace, then go relax wit' her

Yeah, this is how we do, just make ya boo-ga-lu
Harlem World, baby, and the LB crew
Now we do, party 'til the sky turn blue
Partyin', yeah, that's what we gon' do

Yeah, this is how we do, just make ya boo-ga-lu
Harlem World, baby, and the LB crew
Now we do, party 'till the sky turn blue
Partyin', yeah, that's what we gon' do
