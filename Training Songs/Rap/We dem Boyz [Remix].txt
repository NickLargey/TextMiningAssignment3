Yeah hol' up, hol' up we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Now I've been in this game for a long time, and I'm still gettin' money oh
Hol' up, hol' up we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise

Paranoid as a child, blessed to be a dreamer
Bitch we dem boyz, nigga we the Beatles
1-8-7 No appeal, get it how you live
Before I go broke accountants jump off a bridge
First round draft pick, hittas stay in the field
On that poor side of town, grinding to pay our bills
They hate to see you flourish, so I draw the curtains
I'm so high up in the sky that my I won't get no service
Democracy be the dope, community in the choke
Lil' woadie just caught his case, he was looking forward to vote
Nigga count your blessings, lighters on the dresser
I scoped it, a whole body, so yes I'm well invested

From Fig row to the airport to them Iceland hoes
Head to London then to Paris, double sold out shows
Then I fell asleep in my Saint-Laurent and woke up to stunt more
And just recent nigga, my teeth is nickel, got disco-ball glow
Niggas throwin' shots but I dodge 'em all, you can't touch this
Don't believe if my name involved in some punk shit
Half a mill' a week, crib by the beach, got bank roll
Got a bitch who got booty-cheeks, good neck though
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, this game we play, you can't control us
Hol' up, hol' up, they knew us cause the way we pulled up
Hol' up, hol' up, my bitch her shape like Coca-Cola
Hol' up, hol' up, Wiz on joints, my woods be rolled up

Hol' up, hol' up we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Now I've been in this game for a long time, and I'm still gettin' money oh
Hol' up, hol' up we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise

I never give a rat a pass, it's the fattest ass that attracts me
How do I define Nasty? Ghastly
Explain Esco
Plain and simple, with a redbone in the Benz'o sippin' XO
From the Don to God's Son, the Project Prophet, the live one
The father of Destiny, Knight’s pops, Will’s man
Jungle's brother
Girl, I house you like the Jungle Brothers, understand
I shine before ya'll time
I been outside when T La Rock invented rhymes
When dinner time and BBS’s on tinted Saab’s was getting robbed
I'm 20 in, still outside, don't ask for it
That parched up from here on, that half moon is that Nas cut
We been 'em niggas that's been them niggas, ask any nigga
Mass Appeal, history, Henny sippers, let's get it nigga

Hol' up, hol' up we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, we dem boyz

Keys to my estate, put the cheese inside a safe
Drinkin' by the case, that be the reason why they hate
Fresh up outta cell to the seats of private planes
Roll at least an ounce a day, smokin' weed is my escape
Peddle to the floor, make sure my niggas straight
Every city-state, I'm tryna break the piggie bank
Some niggas get put on, some niggas get played
Take another selfie, watch my lawyer beat the case
We dem boyz

Hol' up, hol' up we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Now I've been in this game for a long time, and I'm still gettin' money oh
Hol' up, hol' up we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
