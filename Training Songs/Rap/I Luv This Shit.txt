[Intro: August Alsina & Trey Songz]
Ay (ohh) ay (ohh)
Ay (ohh) uh-huh (whoa-ohh)
Ay (ohh) ay (ohh)

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
A nigga back with this motherfuckin' remix (remix), and we about to kill this shit
See I went and got a little help to get the whole club poppin' like Freaknik
Cause I got Rozay, a little Bombay, a little peach Ciroc and we faded
Soon as we step in, we got your chick, and yo' chick, and yo' chick
And I know you hate it
Cause we lining up the shots, yungin' got the heat to make em' pop
Soon as we hit the parking lot, then we see all the panties drop
Girl, ain't no bitch nigga, no rich nigga, no snitch nigga
Yo' bitch choosin' on a real nigga, let her chill nigga
That's real, cause I'm so fucked up, now I'm talking my shit
I'm way to high to be trippin' like this
Niggas hatin' hard, bitches all on my dick
This is what you want, I'mma put it like this; lay it down to the Aug, Trey and Chris remix

[Hook:]
Say you luv it (ay), you luv it girl (ay)
You luv it (ay), you luv it girl (uh-huh)
You luv it (ay), say you luv it girl (ay)
You luv it (ay), better make you luv it girl (uh-huh)
The way I f*ck her, you would think I luv this bitch
I tell her keep on suckin', girl get all this dick
And I'mma keep grinding, nigga try'na get rich
She tell me keep fuckin', cause she luv this shit

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
(God damn it, I love it)
She said she just got her some titties
(She said she just got her some titties)
Can't wait till' I come to her city
(Can't wait till' I come to her city)
I smoke till I choke and I'm dizzy
The liquors invading my kidneys; been chillin' and I feel like killin' you niggas
Bitches been missing me lately (ohh), they love it when I talk to em' crazy (ohh)
Suck a nigga dick, do it with alot of spit, let it drip, yeah catch my babies
Ohhh-whoooa, that's my baby, just do it like you care
Girl don't worry bout' your, hairs f*ck up
Cause I'm pullin' it like this
Your man's fucked up, he don't do you like this
Feels so good that a nigga might kiss
If you ask her she gon' tell you like this

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
She said make luv, just make luv, just make luv to me
Right now (just do it), and she want to try some new shit (just do it)
She said when I kiss it, go and sing to her (how?)
Like this: Laa-laa laa-laa laa (Laa-laa laa-laa laa)
Don't need full conversation
All we doin' is licking, and fucking, and touching, your booty be speaking another language (Ohh yeahhh)
This real life to his fake shit
Bottles in the air, I'm faded, drinking
I'm so fucked up, now I'm talking my shit
I'm so bossed up, I be talking like Rich
Niggas hatin hard, bitches all on my dick
Baby when we play, put this song on replay, she like "Ooh, that's my shit"

[Hook:]

[Outro: August Alsina]
And I luv it
