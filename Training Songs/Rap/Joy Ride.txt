Thank you
I just wanna say thank you

Sittin’ here thinkin’ about everything
My momma told me
That I would always make it this far
I can’t make sense of everything (everything)
But I know one thing
I gave it all of my heart
The road got lonely
Sometimes I was afraid (was afraid)
But luckily I had you
To ride the wave

Thank you for stayin’ by my side
Hope you all enjoy the ride

Ride, ride
With me
Come on, let's go
Enjoy the ride
Ride, with me
I’ma take it way back
I’ma take it back down memory lane tonight

I remember just like it was yesterday (yesterday)
I was just dreamin’
Prayin’ my whole life would change
You are the support you gave to me
You made me who I am today
Made me who I am today
The road got lonely
Sometimes I was afraid
But luckily I had you
To ride the wave (to ride the wave)

Thank you for stayin’ by my side
Hope you all enjoy the ride

Ride, ride
With me
Come on, let's go
Enjoy the ride
Ride, with me
I’ma take it way back
I’ma take it back down memory lane tonight

You know I can’t forget ya
I ain’t never left you
I accept you, I respect you
Together we can get through
I’m here to spread the message
I really hope you get this
I love you, I love you
Come joyride

Thank you for stayin’ by my side
Hope you all enjoy the ride

Ride, ride 
With me
Come on, let's go
Enjoy the ride
Ride, ride
With me
I’ma take it way back
I’ma take it back down memory lane tonight
