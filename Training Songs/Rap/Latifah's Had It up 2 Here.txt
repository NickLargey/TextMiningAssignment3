The Queen is hyped up 
The Queen is hyped up 
The Queen is hyped up 
The Queen is hyped up 

Ayo Manda
What's up La
Yo people have been trying to get fierce on me, 
I think it's time I tell them about themselves
Yo just give it to them safari style

Well, well, well it's L.A
The T.I
The F.A.H
You'll see why
Q.U
Double E.
N
Is the reason I must be myself
What else?
Well fame hasn't got me
Souped up
Selling out
Sloppy or poppy
There so much live for
There for
Here's more from a woman
All woman
Keep the rumors
To Your
Self
The over blown
Home grown
Not known
Fools who never shown
Proof let alone own
A lot of props
Or hip hip pop chart
Notch on your clock is my spot
Now who got the marks?
I do
Why you little played out Achew
(Bless You)
I'm allergic to wack crews
The La
The Ti
The Fah
The Queen is up
Throwing salt that you never seen before
How dare
Those who talk
We can't have them
Some make me wanna go out with the bat and a magnum
But a wise
Civilized
Growing higher
Judgment's from the queen
Punish is the fire
I here to make these fools out of liars
You must learn step and respect the sire
Face the fire
Latifah had it up to here the frauds felling fear (fear)
The sound is playing like a Q-tip digging your ear (ear)
Mama Zula stands for positivity, knowledge, and grace
I never run my piece damn I'll take it to your face
Open why you hoping
None stutter
Stop 'em
Maybe choke (choke)
Because it's very hard to breathe
While La got you in a yolk
I'll cut your throat
I'll cut it short
No one ever getting near
Latifah's had it up to here

[Chorus]
Give it to 'em Queen (Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Give it to 'em Queen (I got it)
Give it to 'em Queen (Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Give it to 'em Queen (I got it)
Give it to 'em Queen (Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Give it to 'em Queen (I got it)
Give it to 'em Queen (Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Queen L.A.T.I.F.A.H in command

Some of these commercial entertainers
Are commercially a pain to mind and my behind
Try to dis Dana
Bumping me off
Because the Queen has reached a certain plateau
All I do is boo and say "is that so?"
Talk is cheap
And if talk got any cheaper (huh)
They'll be selling Nike tongues instead of sneakers
Kay sa rah sa rah
Blazay blah
Etcetera
This is a scene from the Queen La La
Lovely and lyrically loose
But lady like
I'm too slick to slip up or get tricked by the shady type
Chomps y'all talk and still wonder how loose I got
When I'm in town I give the boosters booster shots
Breaks
Breaks
Face
Face
Never
Never
Waste
Waste
Your mind on a rhyme
That will get thrown in your fronting face
I'll cut your throat
I'll cut it short
No one ever getting near
Latifah's had it up to here

[Chorus]

Royal and loyal
Face the fire
Boy
You wouldn't get the time of the day
So make way
Hey
Silence I say
Lay low and have a cold one
Cause the whipping I'm dishing is an old one
I through some soul into my morning bowl
Then I rolled
I took your gold and stopped your singled
Cause it ever never sold
Matter of fact it never even got the time to sprout
So you could never give me body or come in my house
The Flavor Unit is doing back again this year
How many flavors of the flavor can you love to hear
Feel the force of my holocaust
I'm staring at ya
Put in a bid on who will fall
I'm sure to match ya
Snatch ya
Stature
Your broken looks more like a fracture
Catch that rapper
Latifah will be back to crush ya
Go buy a heart
Cause from the start I told ya no one getting near
Latifah's had it up to here
