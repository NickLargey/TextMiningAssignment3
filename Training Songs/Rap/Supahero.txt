Supahero
Baby I'm your star, but you looking for a super hero
And Superman don't fly no more cause he ain't one with the people
He ain't nowhere to be found, when he should be fighting evil

You make me whole It's not the movies, but it fake the role
I try to take control for the sake of soul
But the only thing I get to do is scrape the bowl
When God made me, said â??break the moldâ??
I put foot to the concrete and shake the road
I don't have powers like a caped crusader
But I do have powers like an Ace invader
Back in the days he had so much flavor
He was so major to get you out of danger
Now you can't find him, and he's just a stranger
And if you did he'd probably give you the finger
Your hit channel's evil on your channel changer
And your hero with a lifesaver threw you an anchor

I really don't know what you thinking of
I can't make it wet from underneath my glove
I can't see through walls but I can see through you
You dress up the ball but that's all you do
You fell for him, he didn't fall for you
And just me is what I got to offer you
I don't save the day, I just pave the way
In the city of Gotham where every day's a day
I know it pays to play, but I ain't playing
I ain't laying my coat down; know what I'm saying?
You want lots of muscles and lots of green
But my hustle and bustle is my only thing
It ended all bad as my last song seems
You need a star in your life and not in your dreams
