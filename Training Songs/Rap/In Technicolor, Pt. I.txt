Get a job, pay the rent
Wash, rinse, repeat, do it again
We all live in a black and white world
But let's face it, while time's wasting
We're all here with the same motivation
Tryna find that someone who sees your worth

(Technicolor)
Waiting for that technicolor
Searching for that technicolor
Waiting for that technicolor

When I'll find her, game over
My future, uncovered
The good, the bad, the in-between
Perfect insanity, oh
She'll hate me when I love her
And we'll fight like this forever
But she's a dream and she's mine
A spectrum of beauty and light

(Technicolor)
All I see is (technicolor)
She's loving me (technicolor)
Now I see (technicolor)
