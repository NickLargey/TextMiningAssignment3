{Juicy J} 
you know the time is tickin short, now I'm reachin for the vault 
grab them clothes that match the night, and them things they call they aunt 
yes a nigga know I'm quiet, if you don't talk they think your soft 
but I be quick to pull and blast and leave your body full of chalk 
never talk cause when you talk these hoes be all up in your biz 
bring the word up where you livin, all the shit a nigga did 
hoe I ain't dentin a fuckin dinner roll, your bodies in the trunk 
cause shit some keys over seas, may the flour mix with funk 
I call the police 911 "Their's been a murder on my set." 
and when they pull up on my set, we pop them things and then we jet 
on the low is how I keep it, if you want your blood to spill, 
run your mouth off in the street, and pull your gun to shoot to kill 
if you real if you realer than a motherfuckin gang 
on the block is where you hang, throw them motherfuckin thangs 
nigga drivin up the K. slangin rocks or pushin weight 
ghetto nigga from the south, ain't no law that we can't break
