Trumpets please
I wanna welcome everybody to
Killa season

Dip, dip, dip
Come and f*ck with the set
Dip, dip, dip
Come and f*ck with the set

They tried to play us
But they can't fade us
A bunch of haters
But we the greatest

That mighty dip
Fuckin' set
Show a G respect, my weed connect
Got it growing like Chia Pets

So, come and deal wit the kids
We ballin', big baby

You know I'm strapped for the drama
Afghan to Harlem, clap his Mama
Homeboy, don't ask for the ganja
No way, hey, I relax in a sauna

Lay back, lay back, where the cake at?
ASAP, ASAP, I replay that
They wack, he not, we hot
We got 3 glocks, right where they lay at

Got what's left to twist
Diamonds surround my wrist
Y'all all fiends, Spalding couldn't bounce like this

Yo yo, don't f*ck with the po-po
Oh, no, I'm 'bout that dough doe
Juelz, he f*ck with the cocoa
Niggaz going loco, that's a no-no

Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, it's dipest
Oh no, row boats, coke float sand hit decks

So, come and deal wit the kids
We ballin', big baby

Flashin' bras
The world is ours
Them classic cars plus girls, cash and cars
Cash and cars, girls, cash and cars
Girls, cash, cars, girls, cash and cars, cash and cars, cars

So, come and deal wit the kids
We ballin', big baby

y'all really wanna get this started?
We all can act retarded
Ya heart has been darted
Bombarded, departed

Ma, ya pussy stink
It been underseas
Here's a Douche bag
Hot rag, summers eve

Yes, a hot bath, run, run, run it, please
You hummin' G's?
Through ya dungarees
Don't maneuver there
Here's a souvenir

Washing set, kit
Bitch, for ya pubic hairs
Beat it, ain't no losers here
Ma, tryna move up here

Send my dick down there
That's with scuba gear
And she eat out
While she takin' deep cock

Eaves drop, need not, cam walker needs not
And my game's so tight
And my aim's so right
In a range all white
Entertain more dykes
All they say all night is

But 'cha brain, maayne
Will be like my chain on ice
But my chain, maaayne
It look like a rainbow sight

So, come and deal wit the kids
We ballin', big baby

Flashin' bras
The world is ours
Them classic cars plus girls, cash and cars
Cash and cars, girls, cash and cars
Girls, cash, cars, girls, cash and cars, cash and cars, cars

So, come and deal wit the kids
We ballin', big baby

Dip, dip, dip
Come and f*ck with the set
Dip, dip, dip
Come and f*ck with the set

Dip, dip, dip
Come and f*ck with the set
Dip, dip, dip
Come and f*ck with the set

So, come and deal wit the kids
We ballin', big baby
