Bitch I'm 'bout to pull up, unlock the door
Lil' bitch, how you know that robe was gon' turn me on?
Earlier why kept blowin' up my phone
When you know I got a bitch, hoe don't do that shit no more
Ay, want you to throw it back I'ma hit record
Let me find out you do that shit like how you see on porn
Why you rock this D good like it's yours?
If you got paid for your head you would probably be on Forbes
Hold up
What you a pro at? Don't tell me, show it
My bitch find out she gon' be so mad, she gon' beat your ass
Matter of fact I might not go back, on God
I'm stalkin' you, I think I rode pass your job

Only time she call my phone and it say unknown
But I know who it is and what they callin' for
If I'm around my bitch I answer like, "What's up lil' bro?"
Gotta turn my volume down so she can't hear her, it's a hoe
She find out, she gon' be like "I want you both?"
All the couples that we know they say we ghosts (say we ghosts)
Last time we fucked, her sister was at home
But she was in there screamin' like we was alone
Ay, came a long way from a DM
Play the role like I wanted to be friends
Found out you wet enough to make me swim
Keep it lowkey bitch, we a secret
