You want it you need it, I got it, you want you need it, I got it

They call me mr. negativity, call it how I see yes I'm back in the vicinity
Bringing what you need plus all of the...
Know what you can say... running the mail, running the drill, none of it's real, celebrity
I... any other getting me, I am more mystery mentally of physically,
Yeah I've seen the bright lights ever so vividly
Party with the star types and make them with the industry
But geez, we don't need another hero, I relay to real people, not these self centered weirdo's
Flame boiling wannabe, o so flashy, if you ask me that really isn't classy
You never see me with my sunglasses on in the club dancing on the tables to my old song, getting...
And you never see me with a couple bottles of Chris trying to pick up on a chick
Like bitch you want this? That ain't classy

The radio's playing my song, and I got a record that put me on,
But I still stay classy, still stay classy, still stay classy, I'm a do what I gotta do...
If you're not believing this song enough to hate them, don't care what they're saying, I ain't changing
That ain't classy, that ain't classy, that ain't classy, that ain't classy

Oh, hey yo, my daily insecurities caught me locked down like I'm sitting in security
Getting locked down and it never did occurred to me, it presented perfectly verbally
My certainties could turn into my currencies, you never see my shirt wide open
With the chest hair blowing in the wind I know it
You never see me loose it trying to justify my music
At award shows cause I didn't win I know it
I won't become extravagant cause you're my management
And the guys are with they havening
I'm just an average man who happen to have a plan
That might have the fun of who I am to attract the fan
And don't be mad cause I never pop bottles
I don't waste for money I save my money return and pop bottles
Don't hate, wait, I ain't trying to say, I'm trying to get pay
I'm trying to work money I make, that's classy

The radio's playing my song, and I got a record that put me on,
But I still stay classy, still stay classy, still stay classy, I'm a do what I gotta do...
If you're not believing this song enough to hate them, don't care what they're saying, I ain't changing
That ain't classy, that ain't classy, that ain't classy, that ain't classy

You want it you need it, I got it, you want you need it, I got it

Yeah, now I'm the one making many beats, pumping in the trunk
I'm the one smoking many trees, smoking in the club
I'm the one getting loose, Friday night, having fun
Spilling drinks on the wifey when I'm a little drunk
That's classy, I guess some made them, I'm often hating cause they're all relating
And I don't feel offended, everyone can say them piece
I just really hate pretending so all you get is me, that's classy

The radio's playing my song, and I got a record that put me on,
But I still stay classy, still stay classy, still stay classy, I'm a do what I gotta do
If you're not believing this song enough to hate them, don't care what they're saying, I ain't changing
That ain't classy, that ain't classy, that ain't classy, that ain't classy

You want it you need it, I got it, you want you need it, I got it.
