Hold up on the double, these boys want trouble
They call me Flintstone and my homie's born Rubble
Rebel, Devil, chase em' through the ghetto
Break these motherfuckers off with just one dedo
Metal bracelets, facin' worse incarceration
Aim for the dome gotta keep my concentration
Since elementary, it was destined for me,
To see the penitentiary
Late Friday, or was it Early Saturday?
I hit him with the shotty that I bought from the academy
Duck for cover, you marked motherfucking
Didn't Mama say not to play with niggas from the gutta?
I smell undercovers, I die with my brothers
And when I'm on the mic I represent all colors
Last summer, I escaped from an asylum,
You know the three digits, BITCH you better dial 'em

No matter where you at, do you represent your city?
(Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy)
Do you take fools out like the homie Frank Nitty?
(Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy)
Did your crib get raided by this little piggy?
(Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy)
Have you ever whooped a nigga til' he really look silly?
(Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy)

I suck the blood like mosquito, facin' Judge Ito,
Joint in my mouth, lookin' big as a burrito
Turnin' ten into twenty, twenty into forty
Forty into eighty, everything is gravy
Why don't you play me in your deck-uh
Microphone Checker
Quick to grab a chicken head and clutch by the neck-uh
Double decker, hoes on my Woody Woodpecker
Niggas call me Grind say that I'm a home wrecker
Berreta under my Raider sweater
F*ck a fine loca by the name of Jueta
Stackin' mo chedda, then speedy Gonzales,
Smoother than the head of Mister Telly Sevalas
Tu sabes haciendo jales, movin' llaves
Order two tacos with the beans and nopales
Dont blame us, just because I'm famous
And got my middle finger up your Baby Mama anus, BITCH!

Do you raise Ben Davis or do you sag Dickies?
(Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy)
Does your bitch got your name tattooed on her titty?
(Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy)
Do you bump Tupac or do you bump Biggie?
(Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy)
Do you sleep with your wife or with a nine milli?
(Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy)

I got sacks for sale in the land of Hell,
My enemies don't even get a chance to yell
In the black seville, with my man Miguel
Little beings wanna put my fuckin' ass in jail
Stack my mail, where the bastards dwell
Puffin' on Jane cause that's my girl
Never brag or tell, but I blast'em well,
I shoot more shots than Sam Cassell
Well, pick the chosen and form an alliance
Move in silence we got the loyal clients
Corporate giants, with street science
Cookin' dope on a kitchen appliance
Don't try it, if you can't keep quiet
I put seventeen bullets in your diet
Layin' in a puddle cause you hoes wanna rumble,
Spm like Tarzan, King of the jungle
