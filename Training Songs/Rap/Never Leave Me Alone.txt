Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone

They tell me that temptation
Ooh, is very hard to resist
You tell me that you want me
I try to hide my feelings
D-O-G's ain't supposed to feel like this
You can call it what you want to
But I don't even know what this is
You got me singin' in the mornin'
You bring me breakfast in my bed
And when it hurts, you rub my head
I'll ask you one time only, baby
Could you be there when it's hectic
When I don't have a hit record? (Never leave me alone)

(Never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone

I've traveled so many places
I've seen so many faces
And there were times I didn't think I'd make it through
(Alone)
I went through so many phases
That got me so many cases
Three strikes, you're gone
Then what you gonna do? (Ooh)
I guess I'll call my lady
And tell her to kiss my baby
They tell me that crime is all I know how to do
(Never leave me alone)
Tell him his daddy's sorry (alone)
Let him know all about me
There's one more thing I really want you to do

Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone

Man, somebody was naughty when they snitched on me
And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century (uh)
I'm mobbin' through the county mainline
Back in 9500 just tryna handle mine
Spittin' game at the homies about the good old days
As we try to pass time waitin' for the chain to Chino
I see no reason to cry
But I miss my baby boo and my nigga Spanky too (damn, damn)
It's true that the dirt I did (uh-huh)
From a OG to a snotty-nosed kid
Got me caught up in the rapture like Mase, days gone by
And real G's gon' cry
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
And hope my baby boo ain't fuckin' niggas on the outside
But what's the chance it ain't crackin'
If I was out and she was in, I'd probably be mackin'
I can't lie, so I say I would
Now my girl in a world of playerhood
A player should show a nigga love and look out
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out
So keep away (keep away), better yet, stay away (stay away)
And hope I get out one day, (okay) okay
But if I don't, I guess this is home
My girl is trippin' she got a block on the phone (never leave me alone)
