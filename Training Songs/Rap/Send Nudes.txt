Yeah
You're mine
He said naw
He said naw

Yeah baby I'm a loner
I really need your love
Baby I’m a stoner, yeah he said naw
I really need your drugs
When I come around (when I come around)
And you leave the door ajar
And I lay you down (And I lay you down)
But tonight I’m way too far
I know you’re paranoid of me
You’re rare rare I act accordingly
Your ass magical to me
Still get fatter probably
Wednesday night ya going out and
Drinking doubles somewhere crowded
They text me to talk about them
You’re so loud
Shake your rings and your chains when you come
And you’ve got the blood spitting straight from my heart
When I’m doing work faraway from your love
And you send me photos that straight f*ck me up

When you send nudes
When you send nudes
My name tattooed on your boob
And I’ll do what you do

Baby it's your summer, oh woah
You spend everyday outside
To get a lil' color (yeah color color color)
Eating fruit drinking white wine
And then you come over (then you come over)
Yeah but you can't come over tonight
Let's turn our lil' folder
Into a whole hard drive
That's me I’m a fuckin' problem
Hatch me I come a crawlin'
Let's order a double coffin
For when we have trouble walking
Couldn't make it in a second without ya
People way too depressed around here
Bathroom in a party 
Texting me sexy pictures, I’m fuckin wicha

Shake your rings and your chains when you come
And you’ve the blood spitting straight from my heart
When I’m doing work faraway from your love
And you send me photos that straight f*ck me up

When you send nudes
When you send nudes
My name tattooed on your boob
And I’ll do what you do
When you send nudes (oh when you send nudes)
When you send nudes (oh when you send nudes)
My name tattooed on your boob
And I’ll do what you do

Cause' you can't come through tonight
