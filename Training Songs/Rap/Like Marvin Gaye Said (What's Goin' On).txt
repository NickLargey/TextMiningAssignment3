I open my shades to my window
I see crime, crime of the mind
I don't understand why
So a prayer for guidance I try
Lord please give me strength to find what is right
What's right in these times?
I need to be strong to know what's going on
To know what's going on

I got to stay real strong 
To know what's going on
What's going on? (x15)

Yea, la, la, la, la, laâ€¦

I try to figure out where I fit in
But I know I got to keep myself for now
These days I try to fly, fly real high
But I know that wings aren't easy to earn 
So I must yearn
Must try for my wisdom from my stride
From my stride
From my stride
I grab ?? too long
I choose from right and wrong
???

What's going on? (30x)

Oh what's going on

What's going on?

Girl what's going on?
What's going on?
What's, what's going on?
