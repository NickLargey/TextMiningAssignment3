[N'Dea] 
I wanna trust you baby 
I wanna trust you baby 
Wanna trust you baby (trust me I love you) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me I need you) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me I want you) 
Wanna trust you babe (trust me) 
Trust me I love you 
Trust me I need you 
Trust me I want you 
Trust me.. 

[Guru] 
Baby why don'tcha honey why won'tcha 
accept the fact that it's not just the knack 
that I care, so please let me share 
special moments, moments so rare 
Check it out, if I could give you the world, you know I'd do it 
Everything at your feet - ain't nothin to it 
But it's hard sweetheart, and it's rough out here 
but I doubt there, is anybody else for me 

[N'Dea] 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 

[Guru] 
Mmm the things I feel, they are for real 
I'm past the point of dwellin, on the sex appeal 
Mad chicks sweat me, but I desire your womanness 
Dude sweats you, but I'm the best 
Listen, we could build a future together 
No doll and I would never soup you ever, never 
I'm buggin out, over the thought of you leavin 
Tried to step to you, but now you're retreatin 

[N'Dea] 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 

I do believe you do care 
To tell you the truth, I am scared 
Some freaky people out there 
You know? 

Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 

[Guru] 
I sent you flowers and, I sat for hours and 
contemplated, the state of our affairs and I find there 
is no way out I'm in a love lock 
The funny thing about it I don't wanna even stop, so 

[N'Dea] 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 

[Guru] 
So now you know the flavor 
It's not about the stuff I gave ya 
and my behavior is based on strong 
feelings I have, of you and me, it's like a bond 
A treasure, not to be corny but word 
I wanna give you all the joy that you deserve 
I know we argue, sometimes I start to annoy you 
But we should never ever, try to destroy two 
hearts joined, intertwined with a passion 
Give me a chance love, that's all I'm askin 
and furthermore, you can be sure that I'll do 
every little thing you need, yes it's true 
I'm not desperate, but I'm the one for you 

[N'Dea] 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 

Love is so risky y'know 
I want you to do and show 
me all of you openly 
Honestly.. 

I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I love you) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I need you) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I want you) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I love you) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I need you) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I want you) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I love you) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I need you) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I want you) 
Wanna trust you babe (trust me) 
I wanna trust you baby 
I wanna trust you baby 
I wanna trust you baby
