[Yami Bolo]
It´s been so long We´ve been in captivity
People wishing one day to be free

[Snow]
Waiting to see the day when freedom will come
Mama working hard in the burning sun
I wish the world were truly happy living as one living as one
Wish the word they call freedom one day would come
I may bee just a foolish dreamer
But I don´t care

[Yami Bolo]
Freedom rushes freely trough the air

[Chorus]
Freedom more freedom don´t turn them down don´t turn them down
Freedom more freedom don´t turn us down don´t turn us down

[Snow]
Although they´ve no love for Humanity 

[Yami Bolo]
How could you ever sell your brother man in slavery

[Snow]
In word of injustice crimes and poverty
Organize and set your lives in one I-nity was meant to be

[Yami Bolo]
Overcome material gain petty prejudice system
Too long poor people have been the victim
I wish that one day when freedom comes
For each and every man to see the morning sun

[Chorus]
