Guess what

Aha, take a trip with the narcoleptic
Suffered insomnia, but this time it was only seconds
I see thermometers boil as you lay in the desert
Of eternal fire hate ya then deny yourself of a blessin'
Meanwhile I'm on a new cloud chunking the deuce uh
Renewed vows with sinners, homies, enemies too uh
Gold towel under my feet clicking the fluke
With a thousand troops, Crip and Piru, nigga, woop, woop uh
Love I depend on, white dubs I depend on
They flying through this endzone that meant on to vent on
So listen, homie, you miss me with that bullshit
I keep my distance, homie, I am on a higher pulprit
You cannot visit, homie
I mean the beauty of heaven is far for me not to exit
It's like an anti-depressant, you see the vision, homie?
I mean this godly advice, fucking right
Even if you pinch me twice, yes I, keep dreaming

Lovely lullabies
I don't see another thing but starry skies
And loads of clouds beneath my wings and in the skies
As far as hazy as can see the sun will rise
And illuminate this life, this life
Oh why (oh why)
Do I (do I)
Have to return to reality?
Oh why, this time (this time) I'll try (I'll try)
I'll try not to wake up from this dream

(Street dreamin' if I keep on believin')
I won’t wake up from this dream (Street dreamin' if I keep on believin')
I can’t wake up from this dream (Street dreamin' if I keep on believin')
I won’t wake up from this dream (Street dreamin' if I keep on believin')
Street dreamin' street dreamin'

I will not forget
Fixating the part of faith I've never met
Explaining away the reasons as I slept
So beautiful in here I wish I never left
I never know which one's a lie, this life
Oh why (oh why)
Do I (do I)
Have to return to reality?
Oh why, this time (this time) I'll try (I'll try)
I'll try not to wake up from this dream

(Street dreamin' if I keep on believin')
Heys I won’t wake up from this dream (Street dreamin' if I keep on believin')
Nos I can’t wake up from this dream (Street dreamin' if I keep on believin')
No no no no I won’t wake up from this dream (Street dreamin' if I keep on believin')n believing)
Street dreamin' street dreamin'

I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them, I'll keep them (shut shut)

(Street dreamin' if I keep on believin')
No to wake up from this dream (Street dreamin' if I keep on believin')
Said I won’t wake up from this dream
