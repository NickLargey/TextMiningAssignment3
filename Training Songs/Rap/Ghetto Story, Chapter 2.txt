Here's my, ghetto story (Story) 
Been in hell through the fire, now, gonna take it higher (This a survival story, true ghetto story) 
Here's my, ghetto story (Story) 
So many reasons to sing now, plus now we got the keys to the kingdom (This is my story, real ghetto story, hey) 

I remember those days when Hell was my home 
When Me and Mama bed was a big piece a foam 
An mi never like bathe and my hair never comb 
When Mama gone a work me go street go roam 
I remember when Danny dem tek me snow cone 
An mek him likkle bredda dem kick up Jerome 
I remember when we visit dem wid pure big stone 
An the boy Danny pop out something weh full chrome 
I remember when we run, Fatta get him knee blown 
An mi best friend Richie get, two inna him dome 
I remember so the avenue tun inna warzone 
And, Mickey madda fly him out, cau she get a loan 
But, Mickey go to foreign and go tun Al Capone 
Mek whole heap a money and sen in our own 
Now a we a lock the city and, that is well known 
Yesterday Mickey call me pan mi phone 
Mi say Mickey

[Chorus: Cham] 
We get di ting dem 
Dem outta luck now 
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now 
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruk now 
Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah 

[Alicia Keys] 
We got the kingdom so we have to make way 
We take it from the bottom to the top baby 
And now the whole community can live greatly 
(Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah) 

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys] 
I remember those days when, we was dead broke 
And, I could barely find a, dollar for a token 
Hop in the train just to get where I'm goin 
Po Po's after me I'm runnin like I'm smokin 
Remember those days when I went to bed hungry 
All I ever ate was white rice and honey 
Big dreams in my head empty my tummy 
Might crack a smile but ain't nothin funny 
I remember playin over needles in the street 
Everywhere I go and there was some part of me
Thirteen thirteen was, hookers and hoes 
On 11th avenue sellin bodies for dope (Whoa) 
Remember cryin sayin that will never be me 
Gonna make it someday gotta be somebody 
Say, mommy don't worry it's just you and me 
But, one day we will get out of this misery (Hey!) 

[Chorus:] 
We get di ting dem 
Dem outta luck now 
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now 
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruk now 
Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah 

[Alicia Keys] 
We got the kingdom so we have to make way 
We take it from the bottom to the top baby 
And now the whole community can live greatly 
(Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah)
