Yeah, yeah, Eightball, the Fat Mack in the house
You know what I'm talking about
Space Age representing
You know what I'm talking about

Big Pun up in here, you know what I'm talking about
Heavy D, Fat Mack, we gonna do this
You know what I'm talking about
Sure, poor, blower, this how we do, Heavy D, set it up

Big Gentlemen, asshole full of Benjamins
New millennium, new Bentley then a sort addition
Gorgeous women, swimming in 'em
Cinnamon with denim, diva pigeons, peep the glissin'
Y'all don't listen, see, what you missin'

Diggy, double shot a Henny
All about the ammo N E why, bubble like no any
Diamond lipped, crucifix, seducing chicks
Selective whips, consecutive hits

I break sun with Pun, crew hall with Ball
Screw all of y'all, we the big shots
Heavy rotation, every location
Smoke stogies with roadies
On the corner in front of Bodega's

World famous, you gon' love us or hate us
You the type that'd scuff up my gators
Because of my papers been about my glitter
So you killin' my jaw
Damn, can't a nigga live, homeboy?

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

You on point, Heavy
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

Days and days, blazing green shades of sticky haze
Remember Eightball from doin' it the player way
Turn it up and we gon' rock it 'till the track stops
Make the club seem hotter than a crack spot

Players pushin' poetry like it's a kilo
Keep my jewelry froze like my name's Sub Zero
Pimp 'till I'm gone, thug, living ain't new to me
Love me a ghetto girl and everything she do to me

Presidential suites and Bezo's turn 'em out
Pass 'em through the clique until everybody burn 'em out
How you lovin' that icin' on the cake right
Miami girls hit that white and shake it all night

Slab riders, chrome twinkies smokin' sticky, iced pinky
With some styles flipping with me
Memphis, let me break it down for you, pal
Makin' easy money pimping hoes in style

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

You on point, Heavy
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

It's me, BP
From the middle of Little Italy
With Eightball and Heavy
Diddly diddly diddly dee

It's no surprise how we pulverize
All you smaller guys
Fronting that you live but we oversize

Holding knives to you neck
All my nines and my techs
Shine on but get strive for the best

Take time to perfect every rhyme that I kick
I should get a sign on my dick
No time for them chicks
They be tryin' to resist, every time I insist
They submit, bitch, don't be lying on my prick

I'm too quick for your lies and deception
Would you rise in my direction?
If you strive for perfection
And just watch the pro but it's like a chore

You gotta cap and go feelin' for more
Catch me next time, I gotta rock a show
Gots to go, I'll be back and some other fat chick
Peace to the Bronx, a mother in this rap shit

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

You on point, Hev
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

You on point, Heavy
I'm on point, Pun
You on point, Ball
I'm on point what?

I'm on point, Pun
I'm on point what?
I'm on point, Pun
I'm on point what?
I'm on point, Pun
I'm on point what?

I'm on point what?
I'm on point what?
I'm on point what?
I'm on point what?
