And we don't stop no more
What's the problem?
Always complaining when there's children starving
What type of game is this?
I used to support you
I thought you'd appreciate some of these things that I bought you
Shoes from Milan, Louis Vuitton
Animals on back and jewels on your arm
Mami, it's nothing to make moves with a Don
Loon, the Big Fish, leave them fools in the pond

Just when I made up my mind
I thought, but you would allow
You're hard to trust; you owe me
What makes you wanna call now

Can you try to tell me
What made you choose her as your friend?
(Choose you as a friend, baby)
Just when I think you've given up
It's you again

All I can say
Take away my lonely one
Nothing else can be done
(So hit the freeway)
I don't ever wanna see you again
You didn't do me right, so
So long, goodbye, goodbye (so hit the freeway)
Maybe in some other life I'll see you again

I would have bet the Dow Jones
If men compared to out of the fun, yeah
Imagine how crush it was
When you say I was not the one 
(Wait a minute, girl
I'm sorry 'bout that}

My friends say I was in denial
Defendin' you as a perfect friend
Now how new is your love?
I'll ask you again

Now all I can say
Take away my lonely one (take away)
Nothing else can be done (so hit the freeway)
I don't ever wanna see you again (sing it, girl)
You didn't do me right, so
So long, goodbye, goodbye (so hit the freeway)
Maybe in some other life I'll see you again

Now that you've left me
Crazy you upset me
You only could have kept me
But, baby, you didn't get me home
To finally discover
Exploring covers
World as we know it
But you had to go and blow it

Damn, it's been so long
Since I heard your voice last summer
To be honest it made me smile
When I seen you not with her (hey, baby, you know I miss you)

Will you tell me what I should feel
Instead of being your regret (you know)?
Maybe some day in your dreams, my love
You could say, "Damn, it's you again"

Now all I can say
Take away my lonely one (take away)
Nothing else can be done {so hit the freeway}
I don't ever wanna see you again
(Don't wanna see you again)
You didn't do me right so (do me right, baby)
So long, goodbye (bye, bye) (so hit the freeway)
Maybe in some other life I'll see you again
