To just act like we never were
To come around and not show hurt
How dare we greet by shaking hands
Just months ago  I was your man (was your man)

Verbally we'd agreed it was over
And we were though

I'm to compose myself but I just
Can't get over you  girl (oh oh oh)

We can't be friends
(yeah oh no)
We can't be friends
(Deborah, you know I can't go on being just your friend, yeah)
Cause I'm still in love with you

I went by mother's, saw your car there
To her you still family, and it don't seem fair
For everyone to just go on
I've tried and I can't do it
Cause I'm still torn

I tried to think of you as just another love
(in my past) in my past that didn't last
But it's not that simple, baby we

We can't be friends
(oh no no no no no) we
We can't be friends
(if we) if we can't be lovers
(we we we)
We can't be friends
Cause I'm still in love

You may see me staring
Or catch me in a daze
You may see me hang my head
When yo come me way
Don't get to close to me
And expect to behave(behave)

I might just steal a kiss

If you come near my face
What I'm trying to say (say)

We can't be friends
(yeah oh no)
We can't be friends
(Deborah, you know I can't go on being just your friend, yeah)
Cause I'm still in love with you

We can't be friends

Can you look me in the eyes
And honestly say you don't love me?

All that I know

I'll never ever find another love like you, oh no

I love you too much baby

I love you much oh

We can't be friends, I'm still in love

With you

With you

I am

Still in love

Still in love

You didn't have to leave

With you
