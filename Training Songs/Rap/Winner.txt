T.I.P
Hey Jamie, J-T
(Ooh)
It 'bout time to get back hot again man,
You know I'm fresh out this thing
Lets go

You know you looking at a winner (winner, winner)
I'm so up there and so out there
Your so not here
You see we so up there and so out there
(Let me get it right here first)

I'm wakin'
Up in the morning
Hustlin' to the stage and fuckin' performin'
Bustlin' in through the hate and bustin' the door in
Lately nothin' misses I must have been scorin'
Speakin' of the misses
I'm watchin' 'em pourin'
Just like a drink that I'm enjoyin'
And don't mean bottles you welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin'
Feelin' like Jordan

(Aah ah) hold up I ain't finished yet
On top but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut
I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands
Lemme say it again
(aah ah) you ain't heard I'm the shit
On top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at winner, winner, winner
'cause I'm a winner
Yeah I'm a winner

I'm stepping out in the evenin'
Keep women screamin'
He gotta be cheatin'
But I'm so breezy
I make this look easy
No fakin' I'm seasoned
You gotta believe me
I went from TV's
To screens to D-V-D's
To C-D's,
To M-P-3's overseas
I got no time to talkin' its borin'
Just look at me soarin'
Feelin' like Jordan

(aah ah) hold up I ain't finished yet
On top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut
I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands
Lemme say it again
(aah ah) you ain't heard I'm the shit
On top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at winner, winner, winner
'cause I'm a winner
Yeah I'm a winner

That's right,
You see the Porsche Panamera
Got em in hysteria
The turbo super fast and that McLaren even scarier
Hear me turning corners burning rubber in your area
I'm hard to follow once I pop the clutch and hit the throttle
I'm recession proof
I don't run the money, money run to me
In this economy guess I'm considered an anomaly
Bugatti's, Maserati, new Ferrari's I've got one of each
My future bright tight like picture guy in front of me
Turn pain to progression in every studio session
Passion into perfection to failure I'm an exception
F*ck, if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessin'
You couldn't die in the hands of a better man
I ran from the bottom to the best no auto-tune
Been in the lead, say you seen King follow whom?
Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that
King back money long as an old Cadillac
Ha ha

I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball (its the King bitch!)
You know you looking at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at winner, winner, winner
'cause I'm a winner
Yeah I'm a winner

Hey man you thought a little vacation could hold me back homeboy,
Man I'm back man
Brighter than ever, you understand that,
If you didn't like me then (ha) you gon' hate me now nigga
