Were havin' a party, were havin' a session 
Come on and join the redemption 

[Chorus:]
Say steedly steedly woa 
Say steedly steedly woa 
Say steedly steedly steedly steedly steedly woa 

Them want I, them want I 
To perform as them general 
Them claim say, them claim say 
We have the credential 

Come in a from the cold 
Me warm ya body and soul 
Me have the girls upon remote control 
Me never did act shy 
The girls do give me reply 
So after hours I go meet I go fly 
Nuff are gonna be good nuff a gwan bad 
The stand me have to give them 
Is the stand me have to have 
Man they have nuff girls 
Man nuff not to brag 
Girls a love the man a when me kill them with the .. shag 

[Chorus:]
 
I`ve been feelin' like I want to go dancin' 
With someone else cause I'm tired of dancin' with myself 
I love a dem girls them screamin' 
There givin' me sexual healin' 
Now I feel fine so jack it up one time 

[Chorus:]
 
Them want I them want I 
To perform as them general 
Them claim say them claim say 
We have the credential 

Now I'm feelin' like my skin is peelin' 
The girls are fine I want to see them one more time 
They got my body burning 
Baby I'm yearning for you to be mine 
Oh well so jack it up one last time 

[Chorus:]
