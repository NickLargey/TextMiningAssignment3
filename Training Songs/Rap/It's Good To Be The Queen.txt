Ahh, ooh, ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh
I'm Sylvia, that's the name
Rappin Queen's my claim to fame
Gonna tell you a story you didn't know
Get ready get set, cause here I go
I knew the land, of Rappersville
Castle on a mount called Sugar Hill
Like Diana Ross said loud and clear:
"This is my house, I live here!"
We have a King, I must confess 
We share everything cause we love the best
We have money and friends of every kind
Friends are his, money's mine
My every wish, is his command
Furs everyday at the wave of my hand
I consider myself a fortunate lady
Sporting my Rolls, and grey Mercedes
Ahhhh, ha ha ha!	

[Chorus]
Ohh yes it's good to be the Queen, ohh la la
Gee but it's good to be the Queen
(Sing it girls, what it is, is what is is, sing it girls, sing it girls, well)
You can be sure about one thing, ohh la la
Ma oui, oh yes! Ma oui, oh yes! Ma oui it's good to be the Queen

The Queen of Sugar Hill, ah
We partied all day in the castle all night
All the VIP's of the world was in sight
Drinks were free so was the fun
There was more than enough for everyone
So Sammy and Frankie, mingle in the crowd
Heard Stevie and Michael, singin' out loud
They were hippin' and hoppin' all over the place
Bangin' the boogie right in my face
I got on the mic and I started to rap
Feet start slappin', hands began to clap
They were cuttin up records, faster and faster
But no one did it like our Grandmaster
The fun I had, I could not measure
This rappin', is a sho nuff treasure
The people all stood and began to scream
As somebody yelled, "Long live the Queen"

[Chorus]
It's good to be the Queen!
Badi mbatu badi mbatu badi mbatu badi mbat
Badi mbatu BADI MBATU badi mbatu badi mbatu

It started back, in seventy-nine
My whole darn future, was on the line
I created, a brand, new sensation
Through my mind and the whole darn nation
With the Big Bank Hank, the Wonder Mike
And this kid called Master G (that's me)
Well would you believe their Rapper's Delight
Went down in history, hahaha!

[Chorus]
I'll never forget, the King of Kings
Break it on down
Funk

Badi mbatu badi mbatu badi mbatu badi mbat
Badi mbatu BADI MBATU badi mbatu badi mbatu

Mmm Sugar Hill, funk
Your fantasy, is my reality

[Chorus]
[Chorus]

It's good, so good, good, mmmmm
It's good, so good, good, hahahaha, mmmmm
I like it
