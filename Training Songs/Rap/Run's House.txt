A whole lot of superstars, on this stage her tonight
But I want y'all to know one thing-this is.... My House
And when I say who's house, y'all know what time it is.
Who's house?
Runs house!

Ah, once again my friend
Not a trend for then
They said, rap was crap
But never had this band
Till the ruler came
With a cooler name
Make ya dance and prance and draw the fans to stage
Name is Run my son
Number one for fun
Not a gun that's done and get done by none
The others act in fact ya just wack I kill
why?
because its fun my son and Run heads the bill!

Who's house?
Run's house!

Who's house?
Run's house!

I'm in the house y'all
I'm in the house y'all
And this is how Run DMC will turn it out y'all
I'm in the house y'all
I'm in the house y'all
And this is what Run DMC be about y'all
Will my name is DMC,
The all-time great
I buts the most rhymes in New York state
Reporters claw
Producers die
They want to be down with the king!
The wanted man from the wanted clan
Wanted by every fan from across the land
Not a G.A.N.G from off the street
R. and U.N. D.M.C complete!

Who's house?
Run's house!

get on the mic and (emcee)

Another time I take
For the rhyme I make
Make me mad and sad because the fad is fake
See I do this thing so come pressure this king
One mind I rhyme so all you just break
Cus I'm the best I'm def
Ask the rest they left
That's my name my game and we don't need the rep
So keep the booze you loose and suckas cool your mouth
I set a trap for rap that's crap
Its Run's house!

Who's house?
Run's house!

Some underestimate
And miscalculate
My intent to create what I call the great
Till I make a song that I prove em wrong
See my song so strong it'll make 'em come along
Come in the door
Get on the floor
Hard rock hard hitting hip hop hard-core
Causing casualties and catastrophes
And tragedies for the suck emcees
Use a strategy to get the best of me
You dirty rat emcees
Whoever you may be
You need to go down south
You need to shut your mouth
Its all about no doubt just shout cus we turn it out!

Who's house?
Run's house!
