Here's my ghetto story (story)
Been in hell through the fire
Now we, gonna take it higher
Here's my survival story (story)
So many reasons to sing this 
Now we got the keys to the kingdom

I remember those days when hell was my home
When Me and Mama bed was a big piece a foam
An mi never like bathe and my hair never comb
When Mama gone a work me go street go roam
I remember when Danny dem take me snow cone
An make him likkle bredda dem kick up Jerome
I remember when we visit dem wid pure big stone
An the boy Danny pop out something weh full chrome 
I remember when we run Fatta get him knee blown
An mi best friend Richie get, two inna him dome
I remember so the avenue tun inna war zone
An Mikey madda fly him out, cause she get a loan
But, Mikey go to foreign and go tun Al Capone
Mek whole heap a money and sen in our own
Now a we a lock the city and, that is well known
Yesterday Mikey call me pan mi phone
Mi say Mikey

We get di ting dem dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruke no
Rah, rah, rah, rah

We got the kingdom so we got to make way
We take it from the bottom to the top baby
And now the whole community can live greatly
Rah, rah, rah, rah

I remember those days when we was dead broke an
I could barely find a dolla for a token
Hop in the train to just get where I'm going
Hobos after me, runnin' like I'm smokin'
Remember those days when I went to bed hungry
All I ever ate was white rice and honey
Big dreams in my head empty my tummy
Might crack a smile but ain't nothin' funny

I remember playin' over needles in the streets
Everywhere I go a man want some part of me
Dirty Dirty hookas and hoes on 11th avenue
Sellin' bodies for doh
Remember cryin' sayin' that will never be me
Gonna make it someday gonna be somebody
Say mommy donÃ¢??t worry cause its just u and me 
One day we will get out of this misery (hey!)

We get di ting dem, dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruk no
Rah, rah, rah, rah

We got the kingdom so we got to make way
We take it from the bottom to the top baby
And now the whole community can live greatly
Rah, rah, rah, rah
