Oh I'll make it last all night
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow (yeah, what?)
Oh, oh oh oh I got the remedy

My life's enough for anyone
to get gassed up and get Bungalow
Eight in, I been back
And still get a quick lash

Table looking like November the fifth
I won't remember anything, memory's a myth
I'm a piss artist, it's an art to me
Last seen partying with Charlie Sheen

True it's half ten and I'm looking in the mirror at me
So how I come I can see two and a half men?
I sell it by the bottle (I ship it by the crate)
Oh I'll make it last all night (While I'm wide awake)
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow (I got the energy)
Oh, oh oh oh I got the remedy

Oh, we let it go
So won't you come sit next to me
I got the remedy

Oh, you never know
Oh I could give you what you need
I got the remedy
She got me in her eyes, no can't see it?
I'm in a vibe on a hype, I could go all night
No re-est flow b-est, no t-est
Got chicks brain training with no DS

Jeli' cos I brang my buzz Between my thigh
My balls and back of my ???
Man am I drunk, and high
Won't somebody-body send Kate Nash my love?

In a state of confusion
So this is a problem I solve by way of solution
I'm gonna start a revolution with my recipe
Put it in a bottle, call it the remedy

Anybody said they're gonna better me in rap
You know I got the remedy for that, are ya mad?
You need medicine, therapy in fact
And you know I got the remedy for that, are you mad, blud?
I sell it by the bottle
Oh I'll make it last all night
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh oh oh I got the remedy
