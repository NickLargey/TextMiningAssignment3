My team is whom I work with, we must stay alert kid
'Cause nowadays niggas glorify how they be massin'

Out in the game, what's the reason why you came?
To have these bitches be like askin' you a season in your brain
Flashin' jewels, talkin' blastin' if he pack the tools
I got a Glock to cock back to knock 'em, flat out your shoes

And get charged, to rip shows in half, word to God
With clientele like a crack spot, me and my man dwell
"Fat blocks and rain sail from in jail to Ascott"
So yo, focus your mind on this
Nobody move and nobody get they wig twist

Let them motherfuckers all bo bo bo bo bo!
Yo I set shit, come correct with, fat raps that
Rapidly fire like a infra tech spit
I'm trying to make it happen, no time for wishin
To tax at least a million is my lifetime mission so
In God we trust, Firing Squad we bust
Plus we must roll with the rough, Home team
Teflon, Billy, and Fame, mad Swingas to bring
That South 9 triple beam dream you been lookin' for
Firing Squad blowin' it up
And if you ain't tight on the mic
You ain't right shut the f*ck up
Now, we represent in some of the illest situations
And some of the illest places, what happens up "in demonstrations"
Stayin' down, so you can't see who we are
Yo, everyday trigger nigga nucca f*ck a rap star

Brothers from Brooklyn to my rocket launcher packin' Bronx niggas
