I stay alone, skipped a stone, from the known to the unknown
Feeding fires, spinning tires, getting even
And for a while, I made you smile, saw the voodoo in you child
Girl, you know you are the reason
It's been a wild season
It's been a wild season
It's been a wild season
And the hunting never stops
'Till everybody drops

I used to drink Old English and speak broken English
The kiki this Venus said she is in love with my penis
Every evening she was living to see them, until I see them
Yeah, men are from Mars, and girls are from Venus
Life's no games - I used to drink until my brain blanked
Insane for kane talking faster than a man'd think
I spent millions on friends who didn't love me
The image in my mirror of life appeared ugly
Self-entropy drove me cold like a winter breeze
Fear as a winter tree, yeah I wasted centuries
Running wild, then the birth of my child struck me
Realisation, I learnt how to smile, wow
What I know now, I wish I knew then
I may have had a clue of what to do then
I may have gotten out of these bad situations
Running around town with no destination

I stay alone, skipped a stone, from the known to the unknown
Feeding fires, spinning tyres, getting even
And for a while, I made you smile, saw the voodoo in you child
Girl, you know you are the reason
It's been a wild season

Seems I made it this far
(It's been a wild season)
Seems I made it this far
(It's been a wild season)

You asked me how did I get home
Where'd you get those bruises from?
You left your shoes, can't find your phone
You didn't sleep here on your own
What did you do? Where did you go?
Truth is I don't really know
Oh, is this love? It's not enough
Just one sip and I can't stop
I’m too far out, too far to reach
From below you call to me
Don’t get too close, I’m flying high
I feel too beautiful to die
Let me tear, oh I don't care
See the horror in your stare
Watch me spin, oh watch me run
Watch me burn up in the sun

It's been a wild season

I stay alone, skipped a stone, from the known to the unknown
Feeding fires, spinning tyres, getting even
And for a while, I made you smile, saw the voodoo in you child
Girl, you know you are the reason
It's been a wild season

I know the reasons not to break your heart
It's been a wild season
I know the reasons still I stray too far
It's been a wild season
Made me realise
It's been a wild season
Made me realise
It's been a wild season
Seems I made it this far (Yeah, still got that wolf in me)
It's been a wild season (2016)
And the hunting never stops (and we still on the prowl)
'Till everybody drops
