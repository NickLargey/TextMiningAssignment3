Golden days, life was play 
Pain was all a world away 
We went to school we learned the rules 
We trusted all they had to say 
Then life took a turn 
We had to learn 
And we can't go back again 

And my heart is breaking, just for you, just for you 
And my arms are open, just for you just for you 
Just for you

God was god, dreams were dreams
Life was all cake and ice cream
Truths were true and lies were lies
We thought love would never die
But the world moved on 
My illusions gone 
And I don't know who to blame 

And my heart is breaking, just for you just for you 
And my arms are openâ?¦just for you just for you 
And these tears I'm crying are just for you just for you 
Just forâ?¦ you

I'm looking for protection 
Give me shelter from the storm
I just hope this light inside me keeps me strong

And my heart is breakingâ?¦Just for you just for you 
And my arms are open, just for you just for you 
And these tears I'm crying are for you just for you 
Just for you
Just for you

Oh my heart is breaking (my heart is breaking)
And my arms are open (And my arms are open)
Oh these tears I'm crying (these tears I'm crying) 
There just for you (Are just for u)
Oh yeah
