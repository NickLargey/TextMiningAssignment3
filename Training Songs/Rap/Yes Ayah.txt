Who's that comin' in wavin' the revolution rag
A brutal cat screamin' where's the solution at
'Cause m.i.c. so who is stoppin' me?
I see what I see tell that cop stop mocking me
Don't give a f*ck about me, but fortunately
I feel the same about you, so does my crew
With tracks like these get authorities' backs twisted
So now the troop is black listed
Keep your distance cus the more you try
To shut us up, to shut us down the more fire we apply
The more you make us run the more haters we bun
Tired of being second when the rat race is done
Taste this lazer gun, blazin' hot
A fatal shot let you know we ain't afraid of cops
Time for the awakening start listening
'Cause when your palace is burning my people sing...

When I'm feelin' the beat I'm spillin' the beans
I'm givin' the fiends what they really could need
I'm settin' em free from all misery
And all slavery they brought upon them selves
Bought upon the shelves of capitalism
I'm rappin' to piss 'em off and I'm... 
Showin' no mercy for mercenaries
Showin' no mercy for dirty Harrys
Some are to thirsty for virgin Marys
And some are too thirsty for bloody marys hey hey
I beg no friends and no pardons
Turn your luxury apartment into a park bench
So the sergeants got their targets on lock on me
Police be clockin' me, and when they're knockin' me
That's all she wrote, but I'm a keep writin'
I'm a keep spittin' in the after life in a
Cypher with Big L, Biggie, Big Pun
Tupac and Freaky Tah and I'm ready fi bun...

Everything you say can and will be used against you
Everything I say can and will be used against you
Low lifes and police on Babywrong service
Serve the wrong purpose them people gone perverts
Nervous cus we found a way out
Of the business circus they be clowning no doubt
They can frisk and search us but ain't no use
It's David versus Goliath old news
The kings will be victorious it was all written
If they want to bring warriors it's war we spittin'
They got a thing for quiet crowds with no questions
We got a thing for riot squads, no question
Teach kids: don't believe their words of wisdom
Teach kids: don't believe the world wide system
Teach kids: just because they're white and christian
Hear this: don't mean they're on a righteous mission
