(This bout is for the heavyweight championship of the world
I give you the one and only Cypress Hill)

Esse, get down with us
You'll smoke a pound with us
Shoot another round with us
Welcome to bounce with us

[Chorus]
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now

Straight up, we raise up
Been around for a while, we still blaze up
You haters pay up or lay up in the cemetery
Bow down, son, it's customary
We show up and blow up
Take over the whole show, it's over
You know it feels good throwin' bones and such
So let me burn this track so I can light your blunts
East Coast, West Coast, we mash up
Down south, overseas, we cash up
In your whip we bump; homie, stand up
We back on the block; get your hands up
Your dazed up and baked up
One little hit from the kush, you're spaced out and fade out
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now
All the people in the back comin' up now

Esse, get down with us
You'll smoke a pound with us
Shoot another round with us
Welcome to bounce with us

[Chorus]

Take notes; we make notes
We livin' that real shit, boy--no fake hos
You know we frank though till we're in the fuckin' coffin
No stoppin', so take precaution
You're high-strung and die young
But I'll calm you down with what's in my lungs
Scared to try some
Put you in the state of bliss
Need some, homie, I'll give you a hit
Gangstas, hustlas, we play rough
Everybody wanna talk; we don't say much
We roll so thick that you hate us
We plan an attack on the paper
One grind, it's all calm
And never givin' in 'cause we ride the hard-line
Watch the stars shine
We bring the whole house down
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now

Esse, get down with us
You'll smoke a pound with us
Shoot another round with us
Welcome to bounce with us

[Chorus]

(In the green corner, undefeated as a professional
Is the one and only Sen Dog)

Think rappers spit nice
Goin' hard in the paint, you just get by
See me get high
Puffer-light Mr. Molly
Hittin' switches in the low-low will bruise a Harley
We hang out and bang out
All of y'all scatter when I pull the thang out; it rang out
You don't know me, I'll shout my name out
Test me, boy, I'll blow your brains out
East Side, West Side, we get 'em up
Any enemies, ask who set 'em up
You a friend of me? Guess who let 'em up
Take my stack; see who wet him up
Tango mi fiero 
Noto o vide soy pistolero decemo
And we smoke all ya ashes up
Roll 'em up, light 'em up, smoke 'em up, get 'em up now

Esse, get down with us
You'll smoke a pound with us
Shoot another round with us
Welcome to bounce with us

[Chorus]

(The winner by knockout, the seventeen time world champion
The veterans of the stage, the one and only
The kushed-out, the hashed-out Cypress Hill
