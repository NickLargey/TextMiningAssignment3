You've been workin' out lookin' so right
So it's only right
Yeah you know how we get
It's growin' up, I know you down to ride
You know it's on tonight
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine

You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine

You know when I'm up inside of you it drives me so fuckin' crazy
Got my head between your legs
Kissin' on your favorite places
Girl you make a mess
How you got me makin' sticky faces
You like to get gone off that liq
One more shot, one more sip, you get so into it, girl
I bet the neighbors, bet they know us
Pussy bomb when you cum, girl you blow up
Them other niggas can't do nothin' for ya
I'm glad you're mine, you know you keep me focused
Said them other niggas stop wasting their time
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine

It's growin' up, I know you down to ride
You know it's on tonight
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine

Dress it up and make it real for me
Then tell me you gone kill for me
Then tell me you gone steal for me
Then tell me you gone steal for me
I just said walk in the mall
Like I'm Puffy, then I say gimme the total
I went to Harlem and get me a Spanish bitch
She dress like a mannequin
I went to Baltimore, got me a ghetto bitch
'Cause I've been livin' so lavishly
She fuckin' me good, she roll up my blunt
She even hang around all my savages
I put the time in, got the Rollie hangin' off her like I'm gon' marry her
I know it's love, I know it's love
'Cause she hang around all my shooters
I walked in the club, I walked in the club
I told that bitch hold on the Ruger
Even them gangster niggas love ya like Larry Hoover
I just sent her off to shop and throwed her in the Uber
She know the shit that I told her was some of the realest shit ever been told
