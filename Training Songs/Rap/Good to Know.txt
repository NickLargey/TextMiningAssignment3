Eine Million aktivierte Klon-Top-Killer
Jagen uns um die Erde wie Godzilla
Denn wir bedrohen jede Religion noch schlimmer als Fernsehn –
Denn unser Sound schockt immer
In Berlin hört jede Queen Seeed
Aber Frau Müller weiß,
In New York sind wir dicker als Jigga,
Seeed in Paris, in New Orleans und Manila,
Wegen Seeed sagte Kennedy "Ich bin ein Berliner"

Come around, and touch your ghost
Load it down and toast the frost
We got pearls for your girls
