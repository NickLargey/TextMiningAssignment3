I'm in my zone I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz quit killing it
So buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch (we still in this, we still in this bitch, we still in this)
Turn this shit up loud
And buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch

I pull up, pull up, pull up, in that automatic cook up
B. Rich pull up in that rooster til we wake the fuckin' hood up
Got all these pounds of ganja, I work out I'm doin kush-ups
Bobby Bands is in the building, pop that pussy, throw a foot up
In the air, one time for a nigga like me, with a squad like this
Where the team so strong, and the flow so cold,
Ain't nothin but some bad bitches in my clique
Wassup Eastside?
We in this bitch
They think they seein' me, but they ain't seen shit
Girls on the pole, yeah they make me rich
Girls at my shows, wanna take my pic
Yeah, we can do this here all night, can't tell me nothin' can't tell me shit
All in my zone, all on my own
Open that pack, rollin' that strong
And we still up in this, won't turn down, won't go home, yeah

I'm in my zone I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz quit killing it

You catch me swervin' all over your side of town bumpin' bitch don't kill my vibe
Don't blow my hide just blow my guy

Your baby daddy disrespect me black his eye, that's no lie

Ima boss and you a worker, listen here boy don't make me hurt you
You want trouble, I got plenty

Juicy J stay in the club, me and all my niggas
All these bad bitches, all this free liquor
Surrounded by so many women one of these hoes might be your wife
She lookin' for a nigga that's ballin' so tonight might be her night
You know me

Flip money fast Lil Sonny Rich nigga I speak Ebonics
Gotta new car I paid cash
Gotta new crib with a weed lab
Crisp bills I need that
F*ck your team where the freaks at
Hundred deep in VIP niggas always hatin'
I came in with a bunch of goons and I'm leavin' out with this lady
I got your boo in my Bugatti she bout to swallow my babies
