First, first time I looked into your eyes.  I saw heaven in your eyes.  Everything I did before you wasn't worth my while.  It shoulda been you, you all the time.  I'd do anything and everything to please you.  You know how much I need you.  You're always, always on my mind.

You're more than wonderful.  More than amazing.  The irreplacable, love of my life.  You're so incredible, here in these arms tonight.  The irreplacable, love of my life.

Always, seems like a reality.  Forever, don't seem so far away.  All I want to do, all I want to feel, all I want to be is close to you.  Everyday is my lucky day.  All I want to do is love you.  I place no one above you.  I'll tell you why...

You're more than wonderful.  More than amazing.  The irreplacable, love of my life.  You're so incredible, here in these arms tonight.  The irreplacable, love of my life.

Baby you know, you know you're my one and only.  All I want to do is be together.
Sugar you know I will never leave you lonely.  In your eyes I see forever.
