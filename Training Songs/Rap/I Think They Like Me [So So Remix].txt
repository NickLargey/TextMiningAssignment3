Yup!

As it is plan to see
I go by the name of Jermaine Dupri
Dope man fresh in the place to be
And uh

[Chorus]
Oh, I think they like me
Oh I think they like me

Oh, I think they like me

So its only right that I hit you wit another one
Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you wit another one

Yeah these niggas like me
Hatas' wanna fight me
Yeah these nigga's mad cuz I came up ova night B
Yeah I switched it up
I got a 9 cuffed tightly
So u better do the right thing like Spike Lee
Yeah I'm super clean, rock jeans wit a white tee
Nigga's round here soft, but my nigga can bite me
If you had 6 figures you'd be jus like me
Yeah these nigga's mad cause I'm shinin' like a light B
Nigga's talkin' bout yup, in they mutha fuckin' throwbacks
It ain't real you know dat
Muhammeds were they sold dat
We steppin' on these nigga's like a mutha fuckin' do' mat
When I hit the scene they that pictures call me Kodak
These bitches goin' crazy
I think they need some Prozac
We the hottest thang in the market and you know that
Yo b**ch chose us, and she don't wanna go back
We stackin big faces cuz we still spedin' throwbacks

See when I do it, its sumthin' like trilla in manilla man
Known as a killa man
Fresh from the dealer man
So-So nigga's, ain't no crew illa then
10 acrs of land, and I got about a million
Dollars worth of cars in my front yard
I'm from the place in A-T-L were y'all nigga's stomp hard
Ooh, I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit u wit another one
Remix, we gets, busy ova here
No sleep, nigga's stay up on they grizzy ova here
We young (young)
We fly (fly)
And we gon' stay flashy till the day that we die

[Chorus]

They don't wanna fight me
I'm snatchin' ya ass up
First nigga act up
First nigga get bust
Majestic, gettin' shreeded while I'm twirlin' and switchin' swords
T-shirt stravaganza (Franchize dem white tee boys)
Self-made, self-paid
We lounge around in our white tee
Ashy black shirt, will get down to ya brown tee
Muhammad throwback, who sport a jersey by Ali
And if he made one (Hell naw they don't excite me)
I'm all about my cash ridin' around wit a nice piece
Ear piece,ice piece, they straight up like me
You heard pimpin' playa (they shine so brightly)
Don't stand so close
Vision blurs wit' ice blings
Respect my whole squad 
Know u can't even touch us cause
Role out the red capert
High-fives to show love
Carry barretta's, count chedda, we trend setta's
I'm a franchize nigga
Have a mil or betta'

6-0-6-4-4-6-9-4
Blo' dro', wit' the the windows up on deuce 4's
Purple, candy paint
Brand new think I ain't
Same chick, same clique
Mo' bricks in the bank
Know now, no hoe round, throw down like Brat
It ain't no showdown fa no crown
I'm holdin' dat
Face all on V-H
Paid great till this day
Been in love wit the mic since Run D-M-C "Walk this way, Talk this Way"
Cause I'm gangsta 
A Chi-town legend 
I'm not ordinary people, its a star in your presence
That's right, so icy that my earlobes hurt
But whats its worth
Don't test me
I the the 4. 5th under the skirt
I'm thick in the thighs
Can't tuck that
Stay on my grind
I buss back
If I must act
And empty a stuck
Its B to the R-A-T
Trus' that I'm crazy JD pays me 
I'm stuck actin' lady

I'm Bow Weezy
Prince of the O-town
Jus' got the wheels clean
So I'm ridin' slow now
I'm in a fast car 
Somethin' like a Nascar
If you wanna know hope much it cost u should ask Pa
As far as the watch and change 
I drop some change
Its easy for me ta cope them things
And I don' stop, I got rocks in rings
You know, the same size as a boxing ring
Swimming pool in the front and the the backyard
I ain't gotta act hard
I'm under 21 wit a black card
And yeah I know, that was kind of a low blow
But the the doe for the So-So don't come slow

[Chorus]

Oh, I think they like me when they heard me on the otha' one
So its only right that I hit you wit' another one 
So its only right that I hit you wit' another one
