As the reality of the times take hold
We come to terms with the sadness we bear
Missing the times we never get to share
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa 
Just a few words because we care
Still I got all the memories
Who-who-who-whoa, whoa-whoa

Say, when me look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul, I hold the key
Said it's never gonna be the same
Throughout life and beyond all eternity
Yo, we keep burnin' up the flame

Wish I could rewind all the hands of time 
And bring back Daddigon, a great bredrin of mine, I
Sit and remember all the things that we spoke of
All of the serious reasonings, all di tings we make jokes of
Still cannot believe them took your life away
But those who pull the trigger cannot take away
The covenant the righteous have with Jah Jah
So I know I'll see you again, my brother
Well me think

Say, when me look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul, I hold the key
Said it's never gonna be the same
Throughout life and beyond all eternity
Yo, we keep burnin' up the flame

Fi all the friends and families that have past on
Leaving impressions and memories that will last on
Giving thanks fi all the time that we know them
Reminisce them legacy, that is what we owe them
Because they helped to make us who we are
So let us never forget and talk it near and far
Bless up Grandpa Lee and Aunt Chris-I
Can't forget you if I try
So when me go suh

When me look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul, I hold the key
Said it's never gonna be the same
Throughout life and beyond all eternity
Yo, we keep burnin' up the flame

Father Bogle (keep burnin' up all the flame, the flame)
Simpleton (never gonna ever gonna be the same, the same)
Peter Cargill (keep burnin' up all the flame, burnin' the flame)
Shorty Malcolm (got memories inna mi brain, mi brain)
Nicole Wynter (keep burnin' up all the flame, the flame)
All friends and families (never gonna forget mi friend, mi friend)
We'll never forget you all (keep burnin' up all the flame, the flame)
('Til Jah Jah link we again)

When me look up inna mi life it's plain to see
That it's never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep inna mi brain, inna mi soul, I hold the key
Said it's never gonna be the same
Throughout life and beyond all eternity
Yo, we keep burnin' up the flame

For all the friends that have passed on before
We pray that you rest in peace
And Jah keep you safe until we meet again
