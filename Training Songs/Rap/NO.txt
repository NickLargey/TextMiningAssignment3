On the road, lots of shows and meetings
Temptations grow, keeping me uneven
Asking myself 
Could I’ll live without you (Without you)
At times I feel, thinking bout you cheating
Baby, let’s be real, you’re the only one I’m meeting
If you wanna know
If I’ll live without you
Baby, the answer is

No
See I don’t wanna
Go
Baby I just need you
Oh
Can I live without you, without you?
The answer is
No
See I don’t wanna
Go
Baby I just need you
Oh
Can I live without you, without you? Ay

Like a song without a hook, no meaning
Like the world without the chance of dreaming
That’s how I feel (That’s how I feel)
When I’m without you (Without you)
I need you here, in my arms forever
Sounding sealed into the twelve but never
You need to know
Can I live without you?
Baby, the answer is

No
See I don’t wanna
Go
Baby I just need you
Oh
Can I live without you, without you?
The answer is
No
See I don’t wanna
Go
Baby I just need you
Oh
Can I live without you, without you? Yeah

See all that I am waitin' for, baby it's you
Nothing could take away what we have  
? I swear
So if we ever fall 
You’ll always be in my heart ouh

The answer is no 
No
Baby I don’t wanna
Go
Girl I just need you
Oh
Can I live without you, without you?
The answer is
No
Ay I don’t wanna
Go
Baby I just need you
Oh
Can I live without you, without you? 
The answer is

No
I don’t wanna go
Go
All I need is 
Oh
Can I live without you, without you?
The answer is
No
I don’t wanna
Go
Baby I just need you more
(Oh)
Can I live without you,(Ooh) without you?
