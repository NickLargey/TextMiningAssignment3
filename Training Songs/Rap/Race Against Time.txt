Everybody over here, get on up
Everybody right there, get into it
Everybody over there, get involved
Everybody just, get involved

Microphone check, microphone check
Can I get a check up from the neck up?
Can I kick a rhyme while I'm checkin' my time?
Can I get a cure 'cause you did da crime?

For sure, you're probably killin' me
With these shots, tell me what I got
An' I'm gone, pandemic, who did it?
Right, who did it, that's who did it

Who, world health organized
Murderized, came to the aid, got paid
Doctor, doctor in a lab concocted a germ warfare
To the booty, I rocked it

A hundred and five million goin' down in da ground
Most in da black an' da brown
How did I catch this riddle?
If I didn't crossover like a Hardaway dribble

They blamed it on some green African monkey
Now ain't that funky?
While da clock is doin' da tickin' an' tock
I didn't know dat da guns aimed an' cocked

On us, on us, on us, on us
On us, on us, on us

We're runnin' outta
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time

Testin' one, two, testin' one, two
Can I get a blood check? Testin' one, two
Can I get a witness? 
Yes, you can
Can I get a witness? 
Yes, you can

Then check it

I'm checkin' records an' facts about da battle
To da Indian, Japanese, the whites an' the blacks
Germs, they spread it, warfare, I read it
Quote me on this, yes, again an' I said it

A bigger damage than the trigger an' glocks
A mass murder in mass from a blanket full o' smallpox
No guarantees, gettin' lesser fees
Tuskegee had us go out with disease

Please check da time, c'mon, check da rhyme
Tribe o' mine, killed by da swine
Who crossed da line? Who did da crime?
The mind of a world, destroyin' kind

We're runnin' outta
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time

A lil' piece of my mind while we runnin' outta time
People of color goin' out like no other kind
Mad drama, genetic gettin' wreck
Protect ya' neck, check the epidemic

Drug use, addiction an' murder, I heard a pregnancy
Infant mortality, rest in poverty not peace
Disease 'til deceased, sterilized, realized
That beast, so here's a word to the wise

They got us runnin' outta
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time

Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time

Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time

Boy, you need to check that alarm clock
And wake up, my brother
