Who's that girl from the shisha spot?
Body like, "Woah", made my heart want stop
Is what they say 'cause you look so hot
And I picked you, girl, 'cause of what you got
Every time you apply lip gloss
Have to come near and take it all off
Two glass of wine and off comes the watch
When I get you home it's a whine and cotch
Dress cool, cool, but your hot like coals
I'm tryna bubble and vibe real low
Girl you're a baddie and the whole place knows
Let me lock you down 'for I leave touch road

Met her at the shisha spot
Golden locks and a Laker top
Pretty face, eyes, and smile to match
Didn't wanna rush or go too fast
Sat back and just kicked it
Steady flow conversation for a couple minutes
I smiled, she laughed

And I'm like

Let me tell you somethin', baby girl, you frontin'
A girl who talks about it but you never really done it
You're lost in the moment from the moment that you spun it
A spiders web for the men to just come and get stuck in
We are just friends and friends just stay friendly
A flirtatious mind but, girl, don't tempt me
Uh, I'm a man at the end of the day
So let's just keep it cool 'cause rules I like to break
I ain't breaking any if you keeping it calm
Last chance for you to dance and get up in my arms
Our arms are linked but not tied at the heart
It's hard 'cause your heart just wants to be charmed, oh my

I'm feeling you
So what we gonna do?

So what we gonna do, yeah?

I'm feeling, I'm feeling
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
