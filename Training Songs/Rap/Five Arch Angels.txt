Yeah... 
Give it to me now... 
Uhh! Yeah... 
Bring it on..nuh 
(Yeah) Uhh! 
Neh...yuh! 
Give it to me uhh! (Give it to me) 
Make way for the war path 
The psychopath on the astro blast 
Killin' something off I ?breaka had a bat? 
The improbable on ya way down scream "Geronimo" 
From Qu'rans it go my mission imposs-eezible 
Leavin' lyrics in tha hospit-able 
?Then it drops 'em? F*ck the bill, tongued, double-edged 
Slice to kill! ? 
Chop they heads, ?we pickin' cases at the Feds? 
On the D/L, what the hell dead ?
Screamin' "Hell" with the angel's death still bodies trail 
City wants the killas be killas 
But though, I'm the deaf villain 
Whose contracts I don't fill-a.
Body-bags by the millions 
But that keeps me illin'? 
Plus I need a ? to cap one off 
My killa raises ? before the calm--Deadly 
In arms! Call the Desert Storm and swing a blast of mega-bombs 
Keep 'em ?sane off the champagne an gat-claps? 
Man, that's from breakin' through the fatal camp 
Perimeter, of the angel's death, *nyeh!* 
That's, the way to leave the lyrics in a total wreck 

This is a journey, through the halls of Hell! 
A journey, that'll burn he, and all, who dwell 
The wicked, are afflicted, condemned, and convicted 
Imprisoned, in darkness, where men, are heartless 
Absolving artists, through ya fire and sparklers 
Drag him down, in the tabernacle by his Adam's apple! 
And suddenly, the angels, of death will hang you! 
The power, whippings, by matters, of degrees 
Calcium absorbed, by evil dead babies! 
You get rabies, from the bat bites 
Dirty germs, and scabies, from the rat bites! 
Your skin, decays, as you choke, and gasp 
With the fumes, that consume, the poison of the asp! 
As ya body releases solid liquids and gases 
Thirsty worms suck the fluid--Ya life flashes! 
You lay down in the dust, body bubblin' with hot pus 
He lay naked, and unsacred 
Blasphemed the Sunz of Man but didn't make it, make it 

Started off at Jesus' left 
Nevertheless, death, not restin' in peace, ?sweet leap? 
Express, across my mental, cut the beef, had it, every week 
Potential, every day I release bombs, deep like thunder 
From the bottom, of a well, of an attack of spells since my eyes 
Opened up in Hell, my mind, think faster 
And it passes by, but ?one convinced? 
It makes no sense, cross ya heart, don't hope to die 
You can climb into the sky, life is only ?high nuclei? in ya mind 
Lost senator, it takes one to survive 
There's too many ways different for the world to just stop! 
We lost ya common
The doctor said, "Forgot 'cha brain was in ya head" 
So I hell-raised and said to reality, "Look inside of me" 
For the battery, the result, is tragedy 
Through the minds, of my enemies, my horror, is ? 
The Devil's lies, are chokin' me 
Hopefully, I'm gettin' to open the minds, that's supposed to be 
Died, ?

As it begins I, to ?, and I recite a homicidal action 
What's happenin' is now 
The future brings the answer 
A crack fiend--the Devil don't want to dance 
So I leveled, God bless me! 'cause I ain't gonna wait for YOU to do it 
Your brain must got a hole the way I just ran through it! 

So as, we travel, through, the mists 
Of the Bible, the renowned, six deadly snakes 
Look, and they perish, right before us 
Bring the wicked before me and slay them before my feet... 

I contain the science, to make an angel bleed through his vision 
More land and places trapped behind the walls of mental prison 
The limitation a nation of my creation 
Mass confusion ?babies rollin' dead in isolation? 
Inhale the pollution, release the chemicals, my psychological 
Analogy, burns, a hole through reality 
Eruptin' mad levels, devils committin' sin 
But who will ? will we face then in the fuckin' end? 

I raise pain, separation to ya whole frame 
My mic is changed, when I rap and make ya ?framed? 
A chief chancellor, when I rap I leave no answers 
I go into the crypts and give a nigga bone cancer 
When I deliver, I give 'em shivers 
You wicked souls, meet your creator, the Darth Vader 
I send that evil ass back to the incubator 
F*ck with me, ya better off eatin' pork on the grounds of Mecca 
The Killah Priest! The lethal rap injecta! 
I'm full of fury, and anger
Which is my slogan, ya pops shoulda BUST you in the Trojan! 
You want to battle? Here's ya teethin' ring, and ya fuckin' rattle 
And ya horsey and ya saddle, and ya fuckin' pacifier 
I'm gonna baptize you, then BLAST ya ass to FIRE! 
You better check my rendezvous, before you have me sittin' on a panel 
On fuckin' Donahue 
I'm fuckin' sick! 
You better check my past life, I'm Killah Priest! 
You better fuckin' ask Christ! 
And when I'm finished, ya ass'll be a Jehovah Witness 
Or Richard Simmons, searchin' for a fuckin' fitness 
I don't give a f*ck if you exercise, do you expect to try? 
You be the next, to die! The Killah Priest! 
Hear me testify! 

The testimony, of the five arch angels 
The Sixty-Second Assass, the Holy Psychiatrist 
Hell Razah, Prodigal Sunn, the Killah Priest... 
And so it is written, the four ran to the four corners of the earth 
And the fifth ran into the sun, with a book, that read 
"Your asss is miiiiiine"
