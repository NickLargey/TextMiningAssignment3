Knocked up nine months ago
And what she's fittin' to have she don't know
She wants neo soul cause hip hop is old
She don't want no rock 'n roll
She want platinum, ice and gold
She want a whole lot of somethin' to fold
If you're an obstacle she'll just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary's bad 
In these streets she done ran
E'ry since when the heat began
I told the girl look here
Calm down I'm gonna hold your hand
To enable you to keep the plan
Because you're quick to learn
And we can make money to burn
If you allow me the latest game
I don't ask for much but enough to room to spread my wings
And a world fittin' to know my name, just listen to me

I don't ask, for much these days
And I don't bitch and whine if I don't get my way
I only want to fertilize another behind my lover's back 
I sit and watch it grow standin' where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lovers behind my lovers back 
And I'm keeping my secrets mine
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary dropped my baby girl tonight I would name her rock 'n roll

Cadillac needs space to roam
Where we headin' for she don't know
We in the city where the pro shake rattle 'n roll
And I'm a god dang rollin' stone
I don't beg I can hold my own
I don't break I can hold a chrome
And it's weighin' a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is the only one
And Black Thought is bad
These streets he done ran ever since when the game began
I never played the fool
Matter of fact I've been keeping it cool
Since money been changin' hands
And I'm left to shine, the legacy I leave behind be the seed that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread these wings
And a world fittin' to know my name, now listen to me

I don't beg from a rich man
And I don't scream and kick when his shit don't fall in my hands man
Cause I know how to still
Fertilize another against my lovers will
I lick the opposition cause she don't take no pill
Oh you know the deal you'll be keeping my legend alive
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight I would name her rock 'n roll.

Oh break it down, down for me
I push my seed somewhere deep in her chest
I push it naked cause I've takin' my test
Deliverin' Mary it don't matter the sex 
I'm gonna name it rock 'n roll.

I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her rock 'n roll
I would name her rock 'n roll
I would name her rock 'n roll
I would name it rock 'n roll
