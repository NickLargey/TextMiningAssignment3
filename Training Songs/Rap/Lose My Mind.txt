Lets get it shawty!
Oh this that shit right here nigga
What's up? What's up?
103 yo, nigga 103, yo!
When this shit drop in the club nigga
Yeah, it go, it go

Why y'all trip, I'm just fine
Twelve forty five, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind
This shit cray, way too bad
Rosé baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

I'm hearin' voices in my head think I'm schizophrenic
Swear they sayin' lets get it from another planet
Thirty six, a thousand times I'm doin' somersaults
Do it right and you can live ya whole summer raw
I'm out my mind, yeah a nigga seein' double y'all
Tell me what's the chance of Jizzle fuckin' both of y'all
She said as long as we can do it with your ice on
If that's the case we might as well leave the lights on
I'm out my mind, just blew a thousand swisher sweets
In my black and orange charger, call it trick or treat
It ain't nothin' to a boss, my goons got goons
House stupid dumb big, my rooms got rooms (yeah!)

Why y'all trip, I'm just fine
Twelve forty five, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind
This shit cray, way too bad
Rosé baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

Guess what my momma told me, she hate my partners
Guess why she hate 'em though,
'Cause all of 'em robbin'
F*ck the police, 'cause all of 'em problems
White girls fun, 'cause all of 'em swallow
Why I ain't f*ck her at the house, 'cause the bitch holla
And where the pill man at, he need a blue dolphin
Old broke ass nigga, stop cock blockin'
Security, I need help 'cause the bitch stalkin'
A half fuckin' mill, that's what the whip cost me
One-hundred dollars, that's what the pussy cost me
And when the nigga start hatin', that's when the nigga lost me
Fantastico, that's what the hoes call me

Why y'all trip, I'm just fine
Twelve forty five, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind
This shit cray, way too bad
Rosé baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

Drop the top, no bra, got tha titties out
Mention my name and bring the whole city out
Doin' what I do best, d-boy stuntin'
New car, old money, d-boy stuntin'
Step in cleaner then a new glock-40
My nickname in the A, strapped up shorty
You know my nerves bad, trigger like a toothpick
Line wrapped around the corner, boy too big
G-O, black shades and my black chains
But if you wouldn't understand, it's a black thing
You know we drink that Rozay 'til we black out
Wake up, drink some more, pass back out

Why y'all trip, I'm just fine
Twelve forty five, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind
This shit cray, way too bad
Rosé baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind
