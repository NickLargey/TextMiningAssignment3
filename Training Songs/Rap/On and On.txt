One.. two.. one, two, three
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
Non-stop rappin to the break of dawn
I'm the Biz Mark, and I'm a sure shot
All of a sudden, you you you you..

Charlie got a wife by the name of Dolly
Dolly and Charlie got a son named Wally
And Wally got a girl by the name of Polly
Polly got a sister by the name of Molly
Molly and Polly got a mother named Holly
Father named Arthur, we call him Artie
You don't understand and I'm very very sorry
Cousin named Freida, Uncle named Skeeter

who is the leader, of the merry cheaters
So, I don't greet ehr cause my Uncle don't need her
Grandma Joyce, drives a Rolls Royce

My girl Eleanor, went to the drugstore
to get deoderant, I figure for sure
Cause the one she used before made her underarms sore
And that's why Eleanor, don't use it no more
Her girl named Betty, who used to go with Freddie
asked me was I ready, for us to go steady
I told Betty, I wasn't ready
to go steady, cause it would hurt Freddie
A girl named Glen, she's my best friend
Known her ever since who knows when
And do you comprehend, the message that I send
of family and friends of Grandpa Ben
Like this like that like that like this
