Every day I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress free point of view
Pick you up after school

Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke

Without you I'm misery
Blue without my green
All the songs sound better when you're next to me
Yeah, 'cause you come naturally

Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love, love, love (Mister Magic)
I see you through the smoke

Laying on my bed
I reach over for you
And you so fresh you even make the standards new
Burn the tip to get you through

Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke
 
Mister Magic
Mister Magic
Mister Magic, waiting for the smoke to clear
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear
