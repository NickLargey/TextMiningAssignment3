Gangsta!
Heard they think they gangstas
Got a couple sing alongs

Get their Jim Carrey on
Hollywood actors

You're fucking with some hundreds

F*ck it then
Let me get my boasting on
They play my tracks in daytime
We hear your shit when Logans on
Own my own clothing line, record labels, Cloud 9
Publishing company and the list goes along
Whole of them twittering
Gassing bout the shows and the towns they be visiting
Yuck, ill, sickening
Busy I'm re-scheduling
Meetings with president
Half-a-mill deals on the table
I really hope you're listening
(Hold up, hold up)

Really hope you're listening 
Whole of them are twittering
Busy re-scheduling
Me I'm having meeting with the president
Meetings with the president

(Uh) Ishi distort that bass,
Man grew up on a raw estate,
Now every time I draw my dates,
They're like how the f*ck d'you afford this place?
First place, first place, first place,
Try and act up dem man will address that,
Call it, put a fuckin' man in his place,
Bitch I'm great, for goodness sake,
I ain't got a queue cause they know my face,
Glance at my watch tryin' to wind up on me,
I was like I ain't got time to waste,
Get it,
I ain't got time to waste
Get it,
Try and get hype in my face,
Regret it,
Got a big pitbull and I don't remember the last time I fed it, 
So don't upset it

Na-na-na-na-na-na-niiiiii

They better let me go, Let me loose
I'm frozen cold, My veins are blue
Hell to home, but its Satan proof
Good as gold, My angels flew
Yo, they can't knock down mine
Cuffs on flows I lock down lines
I am not human, real life mutant
Ask Mick Foley, I'm not mankind
Yeah, look under my eyelids
All red, I bleed through the iris
Like I've been toking on weed, highest
Now my brain's on freeze, minus
Yeah I ain't letting it melt
I'm stark, haze, I'm letting it fill
Sideline this now separate that
I'm stayin' here I ain't letting it gel ill
