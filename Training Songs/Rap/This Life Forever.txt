Uh huh 
Blackhand Entertainment 
Roc a Fella Records 
In association with the streets 
The Black Gangster 
In conjunction 
With everything official 
Yeah 

I ride through the ghetto windows down halfway 
Halfway out of my mind music on 9 blasting Donny Hathaway 
Me and my niggas spending half the day 
Plotting how we gon get this math with out getting blast away 
I wake up to the same problems after today 
Life is harsh, niggas gotta ? 
Right from the start they place me in the ghetto tender age of nine 
My tender mind had to surrender to crime 
Wouldn't wish this on nobody like the end of like mine 
Ever since I was quite young a nigga been in divine 
Had to scratch for every plaque, even rap ain't even all its cracked up to be 
Niggas don't stack up to me 
Had to hustle in a world of trouble 
Trapped in, claustrophobic the only way out was rapping 
America don't understand it, the demographics I tapped in 
I'm the truest nigga to do this nigga and anything else is foolish 
Like those who stay high, under God's grey skies 
My lyrics is like Bible, made to save lives 
In the midst of all your misery nigga, stay fly 
Never let em see you frown, even smile when you down 
Shit, I floss on my off-days f*ck what they all say 
Niggas can't stop me with rumors, I'm too strong 
All-day 
Socks explode and sweatpants pockets is bulging 
Holding it down on the corner with my glock holding 
My spot is golden, drop the price on the coke and 
Drove the competition out and let the dough flow in 
The cops is closing in, I can do the time 
But what's really on my mind, is there's no hoes in the pen 
I play the low and try and make it hard to find me 
Feds still tryna build a case since '93 
I told them, I'm retired but they like whatever 
You know them pigs don't want to see you get your life together 

[Chorus] 
I'm stuck in this life forever 
The more things change the more they stay the same 
Who am I to change the game? 
You gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine 
The blocks hotter than its ever been 

Once again 
Hold the gun at eye level, I ain't afraid of conflict 
I let the nine rip, nigga say "hi" to the devil 
I blind with the bezel, I'm in line with the ghetto 
What y'all niggas afraid of my mind or the metal 
Niggas tryna subtract my life, my mathematics is precise 
I carry the nine, so fucking with me just ain't the answer 
I just can't lose when I was young I was like Fresh 
Poppa raised me to chess moves 
And though your gone I'm not bitter you left me prepared 
We got divided by the years, but I got it from here 
Don't sweat that, sounds bump from Marcy to Lefrak 
To that project in DC where my man caught his death at 
Over my years I've seen Rooks get tooken by the Knight 
Lose they Crown by tryna defend a Queen 
Checkmate, in 4 moves the Bobby Fischer of rap 
With raw moves in a time where we all move 
Lets face it either your dough chasin, or basing 
Lacing, cranks got your face sprung like mason 
Careful, any infultration I'm leaving niggas 
Leaving more than just information 

[Chorus] 

Uh
