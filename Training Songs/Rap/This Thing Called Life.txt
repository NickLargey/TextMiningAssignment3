I don't really know
I mean shit, that's usually my everyday
Why am I always thinking?
What am I, this thing called life is just a bitch
Sometimes I talk to myself, talk to myself a little too much
Who is God, a nigga just be trying to figure it out
I'm always thinking my brain always gone in a blank, is God my friend or does God love me?
I got to do better
Niggas say when you come up, I got to do more, money changes everything
No f*ck that, no it don't
More money more mother fucking problems, who put me here?
What's with this shit about we supposed to survive, right?
Where do I go next, what's next, that's something to think about
What's this shit really about, how did I even get here?
Why you don't wanna see a nigga eat?

(Bah-bah!) is that the police?
I be damned if a nigga kill me, you win some you lose some
Who is policing the police? (I heard this saying)
What mark am I going to leave here on this earth?
Why are you mad, can you answer?
What the f*ck you mad
What is life, what is this?
Do you know?
What is this thing called life?
