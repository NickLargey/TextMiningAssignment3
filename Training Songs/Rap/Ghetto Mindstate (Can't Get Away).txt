[Lil' Flip]
Who!

[Lyfe Jennings]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
(Talk to 'em, Lyfe) 
Uh, uh, uh, uh  
(Talk to 'em, Lyfe)
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Chorus x 2]
I just can't go
I just can't stay
I just can't
You just won't
I just can't get away

[Lil' Flip]
Ghetto mind state!
At fifteen, I was making moves
Drinking beer, shooting dice at school
When most niggas had a nine to five shit
On the block, we making nine to five grand
Each day, yeah, we got cheap yay (holla)
My niggas on lock, they called me on three way
The hood hot like a crock pot
Dope fiends cutting yards for a twenty piece of crack rock
Around my way, ain't nobody watching Matlock
We tryin' to hot wire cars and break pad locks
Turn soft to hard, drop it in Glad locks
And drive flashy cars, and get mad props
And still I won't change
Last week they caught my partner with a block of 'caine
And can't no amount of money stop the pain
They gave him thirty-five years 
His momma went insane

[Chorus x 2]

[Lil' Flip]
Ghetto mind state!
Coming up with no father figure
I guess that made me a harder nigga (Why?)
'Cause I don't like to ask for shit
When I came in the game with a half a brick (Yes!)
But I ain't telling lil' kids to go that route
But is on TV everyday, like they don't know that route
And lil' girls being fast
Being grown, tryin' to flirt
Leaving home wearing pants
Then change into a skirt
Huh!
I live in the ghetto 
I stay in the ghetto (Yeah!)
Run up grown, I'm spraying that metal
'Cause ain't shit sweet around my way
All I know is one thing: how to get paid (Yeah!)
With Lyfe on the hook, I know we got another hit
This motivational music
I know you feeling this (Hey!)
And I was raised in a church
But where I'm from, you gotta do that work

[Chorus x 2]

[Lil' Flip]
Why everybody tryin' to bring me down?
Because of me they respect H-town
Look, I was here when y'all wasn't around
The first week you did alright
But then that shit went down
Why everybody tryin' to bring me down?
Because of me they respect H-town
Look, I was here when y'all wasn't around
The first week you did alright
But then that shit went down!

[Lyfe Jennings]
They tell you you were born to die
Yo' mama - she was born to cry
Yo' woman - she was born to lie
Hold you down so you can't rely
I tell you that it's all a lie
Young nigga, you just gotta try
Keep your eyes up on the sky
Don't let your dreams pass you by
'Cause somebody said
