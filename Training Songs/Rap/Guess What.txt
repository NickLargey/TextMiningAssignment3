Listen, baby 

I don't see no rings on these fingers 
So I'm not gonna deal with your drama 
Long as you're with me, you got to show respect 
Get out and get a job and bring home a check 

See, I will love you till the day I die 
But never love you enough that I'mma live a lie 
So three snaps up, three snaps down 
Want to be treated like a king you better wear the crown 

Want to play the boss (Guess what) 
You got to pay the cost (Sho' ‘nuff) 
You want to wear the pants (Guess what) 
You got to be a man (Sho' ‘nuff) 

Hangin' out with your friends (Guess what) 
Don't ask what time you come in (Sho' ‘nuff) 
Don't want to pay the bills (Guess what) 
I know somebody who will (Sho' ‘nuff), listen 

Now we've been shackin' up since '93 
I ain't gettin' no younger, I need some guarantee 
The best years of my life is what I've given you 
Argue, fuss and fight, seems that's all you do 

And us goin' to church always in your plans 
But come Sunday mornin' you play sick in bed 
See, I will love you till the day I die 
But never love you enough to live a lie 
So three snaps up, three snaps down 
If you want to be treated like a king you better wear 
The crown 

Want to play the boss (Guess what) 
You got to pay the cost, baby (Sho' ‘nuff) 
You want to wear the pants (Guess what) 
You got to be a man (Sho' ‘nuff) 

Hangin' out with your friends (Guess what) 
Never watch what time you come in (Sho' ‘nuff) 
Don't want to pay the bills (Guess what) 
I know somebody who will (Sho' ‘nuff)

We need to address ‘em, baby, yeah
