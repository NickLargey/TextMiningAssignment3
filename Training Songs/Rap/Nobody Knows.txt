Another song plays on and on, a cross the radio, 
Reminding me of days that feels so long ago
When I was young I had no one to play the part of me, 
I learned the hard way how to find myself thats why, im here alone.

Its been so long since i´ve been home I lost a part of me
I had to find myself thats why im here alone, nobody knows
Its taking a life time, for me to see, there´s no one to blame 
Nobody but me

Nobody knows, nobody knows whats life in front of me
I have to face the world and live my life alone
Nobody knows, nobody knows whats life in front of me
Thats why I find myself alone, nobody knows

Nobody knows, nobody knows
