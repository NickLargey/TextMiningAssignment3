Yeah, my girl get in at 1:15 am
The guitar's crying right now
Just a couple things going on in my life, you know

Brim leaning, cup tilted, blunt flicking
Get money, f*** b****es
Young Weezy, young pimping, she love it
I keep going, she keep cumin, what you know 'bout it
So 'bout it, like Master P,  but no coward
No I am no Howard the duck, duck
Lead showers, black flowers
Black dresses, two hours, closed casket
Ma dough tactics is so crafty
No laughter, I do that after I get the dough bastards
I get the dough faster, what if I flowed faster
Like, oh Nancy the flows plastic, automatic, I'm
More drastic, ain't no names compared to me
Who are you, where are ya, I can't see, ya air to me
Ya not there to me, I ain't f***ing with you b**** n****s
I'm f***ing ya sis' n****, it's Weezy

[Chorus]
If you gon' call him Weezy
Then you must say the baby
If you don't say the baby
Then just don't say it at all

I'm, slick as an old mac, I'm, sick as a Prozac
And, the Carter one was the, dick for you hoes trapped
And, this is Tha Carter two and, this is the bozack
Digging you hoes back, quick if I blow back
Got it, gone Rabbit
Fast ma daddy's Rabbit at home
What up pa (what up), what up Pac (what up), what up Pun (what up)
What up Big (what up), what up Solja
As the streets get colder I get chillier
What up Left Eye (what up), what up Aaliyah (what up)
Teck 9 close by touch 'em up
I shoot n****s in the mouth boy pucker up
Sweet sucker tash gee golly what the f***
Where the hell all these new p**** rappers come from
I chew 'em up like bubble gum, yum yum
Young Weezy so troublesome, what what

[Chorus]

I ain't talking fast you just listening too slow
I'm, getting them Benjamin's
Can serve like the Wimbledon
If I'm in any predicament, nervous never that
Got a gat to knock whoever back, back, very flat
Chest, caved in, mess on the pavement
Splat, cherry wax, rah, bury that
Rats, scary cat, rat carry that
Hollygrove trigga man guns in a knapsack
Area code five zero four, I ain't Nino f***ing Brown
And, this is Tha Carter hoe, this is a quarter stick
This in ya garter ho, leave out the back and go straight to the corner store
Return with the cake, come wit all ma dough
And if not they find you in a lake in the morning ho
Weezy Baby please say the baby
If not, don't ya motherf***ing say it at all, b****

[Chorus]

Its real pimpin'
Its real pimpin 'goin' on like b****
You can be my b****
Its real pimpin'
Real n****
