Funkin' wuith you, funkin' with you, I'm funking
Tune in close because I wanna tell ya something
Ice MC can keep a riddim steady pumin'
I'm no MC who rhyms like a pumpin'
Long ago when I was a teenager
I leved a live, I leved a life of danger
Robbin' and ting 'cause the society made ya
Me to a job was like meeting a stranger
I'm funkin' with you
F.u.n.k.i.n. I'm funkin' with you, funkin' with you
Ater a year of this special training
The ice was set free but I was still complaining
The situations worse oh yes it's worse the situation
Would've been better off with a different education
My mother and my father they were born in Jamaica
I haven't been there yet I hope to visit there later
Know where I'm coming from and
Know where I'm going
I'm a britaican as I grow it is showing
I'm funkin' with you
F.u.n.k.i.n. I'm funkin' with you, funkin' with you
Eventually finally I got it together
And I won't stop rocking no way no dubt
So this is a shout goin' out for all the louses
Who don't know what rap music is about
I didn't get a chance to say exactly what I wanted
Long ago so now it is my chance just tune in close
'cause now I'm getting paid and laid don't be afraid
I'm getting paid for my lyrics take a double dose
'cause wasn't before now things have changed and I'm
Jumpin' like Jack Flash but with you I am funkin'
Time after time after rhyme after rhyme
Ya try to put me down 'cause I'm gettin' mine
I wan't pay you no mind I just call back on my
Blackness protected by a wall man you cannot
Attack this
But I attack and my piece will go boom
Nah I'm just funkin' with you
