Guess who's bizzack No it ain't hypno
L.A. Dodger fitted cap with the brim low
Blowin' on endo Roll down yo window
Matter fact let the top back and watch the wind blow
Black on black Lamborghini with the dizzor
Up in the air with the pedal on the flizzor
Bandanna tied around the rear view mirror
Red bandanna got 'em bangin' new era
Something on my waist niggas can't get near us
Bitches 'round me shakin' ass like Shakira
Niggas poppin' Chrystal every time they hear us
I stay on niggas mind like a new era

G to the A to the M to the E to the D to the O to the N 
To the T to the S to the T to the O to the motherfuckin' P

Doing my two step Red strings on my louis
I don't know how to dance so don't step on my louis
Bitches on the dance floor bouncin' like a pornstar
Legs in the air like the doors on a foreign car
Post it up the bar everybody strizzap
Double GAME chains hanging down to my lizzap
Every nigga in my click stay iced out
Reach for a chain,red beam, turn your lights out
Shut the club down, The Game don't stop

In the parking lot, lemon lime patron shots
Looking for Ciara heard about the goodies 
Hurricanes in a Black Wall Street Hoodie

G to the A to the M to the E to the D to the O to the N 
To the T to the S to the T to the O to the motherfuckin' P
That means I'm chillin'
I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm chillin'
I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm chillin'
I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm chillin'
I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm chillin'
I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm chillin'
I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm chillin'
I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm chillin'
I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm chillin'

Everybody know when The Game in the clizzub
20 impalas outside on the dizzubs
Everything chrome from the rims to the strizzads
Panties gettin' wet every time they see 'em lift ups
So hop in the back seat if you're a freak
Three wheel motion got 'em sliddin' on they seat
8 0 8 drums got 'em griddin' to the beat
Turn high beams on bring the club to the streets
If you jump off niggas know what I'm about
Million dollar man bring the drama to yo house
Hommies outside, Wearing that ass out
I'm gettin' a lap dance, Smoking chronic on your couch
