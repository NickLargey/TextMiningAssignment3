If you wanna leave
If you wanna go
Baby don't leave
Why don't we go somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere
Why don't we go somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere

Would you like to go to paradise?
'Cause I'm not tryna go alone
Run away with me to paradise
If you wanna leave, then we can go
'Cause the real world told me lies
The realest lies ever told
So let's run away and find paradise
Paradise
And soon paradise will be home

If you wanna leave
If you wanna go
Baby don't leave yet

Take my hand, shut your eyes and imagine
Wouldn't it be nice?
Just to have an escape, a distraction
Far away from this life?
I tried to be cool but this world was too cruel
For me to sit around and simply drown in fear
So I'm asking you, what would you do
If we could get out of here?

Would you like to go to paradise?

'Cause the real world told me lies
The realest lies ever told
So let's run away and find paradise
Paradise
And soon paradise will be home

If you wanna leave
If you wanna go (don't leave yet)
Baby don't leave yet

Your love's like a fantasy
Nothing like what I saw on the news yesterday
Another man down, blood on the ground
Makes me wanna just run away
Where every run is a mystery
Ignorance is bliss to me
'Cause whenever I turn on my TV it's just misery

I tried to be cool but this world's too cruel
For me to sit around and simply drown in fear
So I'm asking you, what would you do
If we could get out of here

(Because I want to go) would you like to go to paradise (paradise)?
'Cause I'm not tryna go alone
Run away with me to paradise
If you wanna leave, then we can go
'Cause the real world told me lies
The realest lies ever told
So let's run away and find paradise
Paradise
And soon paradise will be home

Home
Home
Home
Paradise is in my mind baby
Paradise is in my mind baby
It won't take to long to find baby
Paradise is in my mind baby
In paradise we're free
To do what we wanna do
(In paradise) we're free baby

You can't run away forever
