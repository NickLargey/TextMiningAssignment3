It's a revolution
Hmm, yea, hmm, yea
Hmm, yea, yea, yea, yea

Ay, ay
Ay, ay

Now I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave

Tonight is electrical
I done told y'all, this the cinema
I am on my Kubrick horn
Like a Spielberg Close Encounter form
Feelin' awesome to be black, and I'm murkin' all competition
Makin' what I want and that's a flex
Can't do what you want, now ain't that a bitch?
Slow up for no one when the show come
Magical feel in my palms
Rhythm go dumb with them hums
Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm

Now I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave

The industry is so full of shit
Welcome y'all to the enema
Nah man, no subliminal
'Cause they insecure, they know who they are
Feelin' awesome to be black, and I'm murkin' all competition
Everything that I do is a flex
If you don't get me, not my issue, bitch
Slow up for no one, the shogun
Got the magic in my palms
Rhythm go dumb with them hums
Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm

Now I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave

Ay, ay
Ay, ay

Now I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy makin' my own waves, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave

Ay, ay
Ay, ay
