This is DJ security reaching out for Bomfunk MC's
DJ Gismo and be	-O-W
They've been spotted at F-K, I repeat
Surround the area, code ten five, code ten five
Surround the area now

Other MC's can't swing with us
Cause we are the groove that's rocking non-stop
We shake you off like electric shock
Cause we are the groove that's rocking non-stop
And we got a funky song, so come on baby, sing along

Keeping it real, never coming out cheap
Lock the door down just like cool Keith
God mad bull, got the highest feat
But the media bowl it's just we can swing
Rock with the honeys and roll with the creeps
Only sucker punks get treated like leech
Down with the Bomfunk you have to guarantee
That we rock the crowd so viciously

Other MC's can't swing with us
Cause we are the groove that's rocking non-stop
We shake you off like electric shock
Cause we are the groove that's rocking non-stop
And we got a funky song, so come on baby, sing along
Other MC's can't swing with us
Cause we are the groove that's rocking non-stop

Gis is the Wiz behind the dopest beats
Chuckin' while I'm rockin' to all you party peeps
Up flying all the time but breaks that we need
So once again have you been booming in your jeeps
Balling, calling for all your freaky freaks
Like it or not, this is how we proceed
Roll the rizla, got some left over leaves
Light it up, huff and puff and just ease
Take a ride and watch the honeys
Ain't it good, melicious therapy
Got what it takes, yeah, I got the necessary
Ingredients to track the house, very
Unique with the style, skills and technique
Not just momentarily but week after week
Down with the Bomfunk you have to guarantee
That we rock the crowd so viciously

Rock the crowd (rock, rock, rock)
Rock the crowd (rock, rock, are-rock)
Rock the crowd so viciously
I'm the sure shot master of the ceremony
Yeah we rock the crowd (rock, rock, rock)

I'm the sure shot master of the ceremony
