[Timbo King]
United We Slam, here comes the people with the rough shit
The tough shit, yeah we got enough shit
Rugged and real real rhymes, wrecking the rap scene
No playing or joking we got you open like a crack fiend
Here's the scripture, rhymes built to get ya
Put up ya knucks, we don't give a f*ck who's with ya
Knock it off, hear the 45 pop it off
Time time for all you punks to crackin' soft
Hoody massacre, fasten your seat belt
Can't handle the mic tonight 'cause you might need help
Nasty Mac, matter of fact McNasty, classical classy
Oh the sound of jazzy
Rough raw the rowdy rapper with an attitude
Spark tracks are all that ya shit is radical
Mic slayer, upon the stage it's war time
Ever since birth I took turf, I was born to rhym
Tap tap check the sounds of blackness
Sit back relax, gonna show you what rap is

[Chorus]
Slam
United we fall, United we slam
United we fall, United we slam
United we fall, United we slam
United we fall

[Timbo King]
United we slam
Jams are getting better and better, doing shows out in Baruda
You get played like a sax to a tuba
Who's next to flex let 'em speak up
We at the peoples charged we living large
Life a 54 D Cup basket case, flow at faster pace
Call me, 'cause I'mma slash ya face
Wild wrecking from the Wild Wild West
We credit from the 'ems who the best, we the best yes
Stack the dough up time for us to blow up
Comp get stomped ya rap crew didn't show up
'cause we stalk New York to walk when you see us coming
The phatter the track, the badder the wack the steady stunnin'
Tap tap soc check the sounds of the blackness
Sit back relax we gonna show you what rap is

[Chorus]

[Timbo King]
United we slam, you can't stop the power of the peoples
Kill the silly willy 'cause we firing and a phillie equals
Lyrical mania, nobody could come off better
Never say never, 'cause we slammin' all together
Mouth to mic madness, it's time to let the light glow
Musical masterpiece, release the hype flow
Buckwild we living foul, like Rikers Isle
Pass through 12th sleds word to mother you know the style
Cold blooded rap assassin terrorist
Leave it up to us, only us, we taking care of this
I got the skills when it comes to a mic device
You say it twice, mic device, get it, I'm nice
Tap tap so check the sounds of blackness
Sit back relax we gonna show you what rap is

[Chorus]
