[Chilli & Left Eye]
Sunny days
Birds singin' sweet soundin' songs of love
(That's so pretty girl)
As we walk hand in hand
Just kickin' up sand
As the ocean lands at our feet (ooh)
I'm in your arms
And all of your charms are for me
(Not for me)
Check it

[T-Boz]
I need a crunk tight nigga
Makes seven figgas
Laced with a platinum
Not the silver shit nigga
X to L stigga
Ten inch or bigga
Know how to lick it and stick it
Wha wha

T-Boz:
Now don't get me wrong cause I'm not a ho
But I know what I got you can't handle though
Cause only real niggas (wha)
You don't know
So what you gon' do
What you gonna do
(wha wha wha)

[Chorus: T-Boz]
Nigga you must be crazy
What you gonna do with a bitch like me
I'm so good at being bad
I'm the best you never had
I epitomize the word sexy
Nigga you must be crazy
What you gonna do with a bitch like me
You're in my shh... so tight
Make you cum all night
And you can't handle me
Baby

[T-Boz]
Sorry I turned you out (you out)
I guess I didn't know
That a man could be so soft (hmm)
Well I guess I have to give you back
The flowers, the candy (what?)
The diamonds (Oh no, not the diamonds)
Oh, hell no, wait a minute
I'ma keep that (Better keep it girl)
Hope that you don't mind
I'm not the mushy kind
(The mushy kind)
Never real, never will
Unh, check it

[Chorus]

I love to love ya baby
I love to love ya baby
I (yeah) love to love ya baby
Oh love to love ya baby

[T-Boz]
When I'm all alone I touch myself
And I always dreamed about someone else
Who was so much more than
La la la la la
A good man is so hard to find
Well, actually, a hard man is so good to find
Yo, yeah baby!

[Left Eye]
I understand you want a tour of what's inside
Brief my safety guide before I take you on this ride
Straight into the center
You enter my dimension
The question is protection
Selected in my session
I'm on a quest I will not rest till I break it
But if it's naked
I'll take it with the batteries and fake it
Cause I gotta get mine and you gotta get yours
But never endin' it by sendin' it through shakin' door
You must be crazy to think
That you can hang with me
I try to escape the imprisonment of those defiant to me
The epitome of your every dream it seems to me
For intangible fantasy
You know what I mean

[Chorus: x2]

I love to love ya baby
I love to love ya baby
I (yeah) love to love ya baby
Oh love to love ya baby

[T-Boz]
Ha ha ha ha ha
That's right
Watch out there now
You can't hear me
Huh huh
So what you gonna do
What you gonna do wit a bitch
A bitch like me nigga (huh)
A bitch like me nigga (what)
A bitch like me
A bitch like moi!

Dats a rap baby!
