Could there be this much darkness
In one night so long?
Could there be enough love
To combat this night stretching on?

I will dig my trench in hope
It won't be my grave
My spirit is more than
My flesh is brave

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

I will light my candle
And burn it bright in an endless night
I can handle
I can burn it bright in an endless night

Come join me brothers, sisters
Bring your children too
We will stand together
Our faith will bring us through

If this is the beginning
Of the end of time
How much longer have we
Got to sing this rhyme

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

I will light my candle
And burn it bright in an endless night
I can handle
I can burn it bright in an endless night

Tonight, tonight
I will light my candle
And burn it bright in an endless night

I see the light of a new day
I hold my breath and I pray
That we'll be stronger
That we'll be stronger

I'll reach out and take your hand
Our love will give us strength to stand
And we'll be wiser
We'll be wiser

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

I will light my candle
And burn it bright in an endless night
I can handle
I can burn it bright in an endless night

Tonight, tonight
I will light my candle
And burn it bright in an endless night

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
