Y'all know what this is
D-Block
Oh yeah by the way
This is the remix
Who!

You can kiss your ass good-bye
D-Block D-Block D-Block D-Block
La da da da da da

Ayo the flow is here, the dough is here
They gon' call this the hardest remix of the year
The wrist is sickled, the nine is nickled
The inside tanned, the outer pickled
The dutch is rolled, the yak is poured
You runnin' your mouth, I'm gettin' you jawed
I'm wavin' the blade, I'm tellin' you back up
You empty your pockets, I'm pickin' your pack up
You can act stupid if you wanna
Like you don't know what block I'm in front of
I'm out in New York or down in the south
I'm out in the trap with gold in my mouth
They booked me for the clubs in the hood
Where niggas scared to go but Sheek Louch good
Its loaded when I get out the car like la da da da da

You can kiss your ass good-bye
D-Block D-Block D-Block D-Block
La da da da da da

Yeah D-Block
They say hate spread faster than love
So the Bentley is black, same color as the mask and the gloves
With me, I'ma send a bastard the bub
Before he give a police to first and last gov'
These dickhead niggas, you shoot 'em they bleed cum
And two pussies they with, just make it a threesome
They growin' up quick, you gotta buy your seed guns
Matic spray magazines before they could read one
My glass jaws had a hell of a we run
La da da da da da as we proceed son
And I know, every hood got a street flame if not they need one
I'm thinkin' short range, give me a Sport Range
And when it get warmer, I'm jumpin' in the stormer
Duck when I'm passin' by
Put your head between your legs, kiss your ass good-bye, braaa

You can kiss your ass good-bye
D-Block D-Block D-Block D-Block
La da da da da da

You niggas lost y'all game, I'm throwin' a rock down
Just to put y'all D, I'm back on the block now
Runnin' your mouth, 'fore I shit all in it
All y'all ass and I'm about to dig all in it
I birthed you niggas, I fed and I burped you niggas
Quick as that, I will earth you niggas
Clothed you niggas, wiped the snot from the nose of you niggas
Want not to expose you niggas, fist knife or razor fight
I got a year and a day, still played it like they gave me life
Can't walk through the jail without shackles and two cops
Throwin' shit on the warden outta the food slop
Got connects with pop, he boofin' the weed plants
Get my khakis washed, I'm pressed for the food stamps
Respect in the jail, a check in the mail
I stay on the phone, I don't put collect on the bill

You can kiss your ass good-bye
D-Block D-Block D-Block D-Block
La da da da da da

Ay, you better know I'm going all-out, whatever the cost
So f*ck whoever hate that I'm the king of the South
You gon' forever see me flossed, Spyder with the top off
Third gear I got lost to the million dollar law
J.G. with a fleet of bitches take your tops off
I'm a seven-figure nigga, paid the cost to be the boss
On the streets or behind the wall
Lift weights, get straight, 'til it's time to ball
Even if I never sell a million times at all
Dope boy trap niggas, I'll grind for y'all
Pimp Squad, D-Block I'll ride for y'all
A-Town to Y.O, see the Chevy ride slow
With the light turned down and the beat down low
.40 cal's and K's out the window
You better do like Lil' Jon told you "Get Low"
'Cause you can cancel Christmas, when the chopper-missle hit you
I ain't waiting for permission, I'ma flip it 'til it gets you

You can kiss your ass good-bye
D-Block D-Block D-Block D-Block
La da da da da da
