Dip, dip, dive, to the socialized
Issued rhythms that are on the rise
Step right up, with an opened circuit
Get this current, don't you know it's worth it?
Presented with tribe's intricacy
Compared, don't you know?  Vibe electricity
Strong like a bomb, quick like a comet
Can I get whatever from Mr. Muhammad?

If Muhammad has the breaks, who will have the backs?
Bodies set it up all flow to rhythm stack
Okay, I see my brother, (huh,) you know what we can do?
Cruise with the rhythms, Shaheed will lead us too
Posin' with the hotties, (huh) harder than the hard
Still, Muhammad plays with a full deck of cards
The tribe's stuff is present, (yeah,) established with the beat
We roll around on wheels, (huh) or utilise the feet
Go and keep progressin', (huh) egos of the tribe
If we have to swing it, we won't take a dive
Comprende my compadre?  (Yeah)  Kid you want some more?
Muhammad push the button, (huh) sample sing the score

Brothers try to pose, up with the tribesmen
Rhythm on your toes, yes, it's the funk again
Appreciate the flow, denounce the circuit breakers
Do it with the best, the movers and the shakers
Bustin' out your heap, my vehicle
Burnin' up the felts rhythm's up to me
It will be strong like a bomb, quick like a comet
Can I get a whatever from Mr. Muhammad?

Sitting on the dock, (huh) fin' to make a wish
Muhammad, oh Muhammad, (huh) damn you're quite a dish
Fondling the groove, (groove) with the mystic sense
Honies, won't you try?  (Huh)  They push you in the tents
But I don't give a damn, (word) rhythms make you swing
If you don't like it, (no) you can pucker up
You listenin', Mr. Quayle?  (Yeah)  If you're hiding, just give up
I'm a rhythm monster, (wild) who's out on a prowl
Muhammad gives a hoot, (hoot) like Woodsy the owl
Comprende my compadre? (uh huh)  Kid you want some more?
Muhammad, push the button sample sing the score
