[Diddy]
Close your eyes
Relax your mind
Fantasize
Come with me

[Donnie]
If you want to go far, far
Let me take you to the stars, the stars
(I'm goin' take you there)
We don't even need a car, a car
If you want to go to Mars, to Mars
(I'm goin' take you there)
Have you ever seen the clouds up close?
Take a deep breath, baby lets go
(I'm goin' take you there)
What's your desire
I'm your supplier
I'll get you higher

When you're ready to go
(Baby let me know cause girl I promise I can take you there)
(I'll take you there)
When you're ready to go
(Baby let me know cause girl I promise I can take you there)
(I'll take you there)
(I'm goin' take you there)

Baby
You can play Lois Lane
When you need me I can be your Superman
(Be your superman)
Lazy lovers love will let you spread your wings
While you're sleepin' you'll be calling out my name

[Donnie]
If you want to go far, far
Let me take you to the stars, the stars
We don't even need a car, a car
If you want to go to Mars, to Mars

[Chorus]
When you're ready to go?
(Baby let me know cause girl I promise I can take you there)
(I'll take you there)
When you're ready to go
(Baby let me know cause girl I promise I can take you there)
(I'll take you there)
When you're ready to go

I can picture you and me
Makin' love above the breeze
We'll be lying on the clouds
We don't plan on coming down
It's the place where we were low
Even though the stars are gone
Let's go, lets go, lets go

[Diddy]
Excuse me lady, how you doin'
Have my baby?
I'm just screwin' around and crazy
Baby girl I'm night and dayin'
Appreciate you girl, don't stop you're lovin'
Every time you stop the frontin'
I'll pop your oven
You should in fact stay
Could be that way
Good in that way
Hood in that way
I'll be your lover, your favorite color
We outer spacing, we breathe each other
Your inner tension
I got the answer
I'll push you back up, its hard to stand up
I'm yours this song, yes baby girl you're fucking with Sean
Ride wit a don, foreign languages, lets play Pong
Take off your outfit and lets be gone

[Donnie]
Girl I got you in the zone, in the zone
So far girl I swear your mind is blown, mind is blown
Did your heart just skip a beat, skip a beat
So high up I know it's hard to breath

[Chorus]

(I'll take you there, don't you be scared, I'm goin' take you there)
When you're ready to go
Just close your eyes, you're in for a ride
(I'm goin' take you there, I'm goin take you there, b-a-b-y)
