Yo, yo
My flows remarkable
Doc walk like Caine from Kung Fu 'round the globe
Throw obstacles I'll hurdle them
Herb and whack MC's,
Drum racks to the rims, to the caps
Yo Meth, Tical, and D
I'm ASAP, I'm crack of dawn chicken hunting at KFC
In '83 I was that scrub TLC talking 'bout
Now I rock the house
Chalk 'em out

Yeah, no doubt
Who got the biggest ass in the house?
Young miss, fillet-of-fish
Salt water trout, pretty young thing
Got a tongue ring and dirty mouth
And she whispering them sweet nothings
I hear it out
Baby you got me like Joanie had Chachi
Until she got high and went and fucked Potsie
Lady Godiva
From day one a dick rider
Liar, liar set your pussy on fire

I see you dancing right now
I don't need to tell you that you know how
Baby you do
I say you belong
And if you dream to be free
I can take you there
Just follow me
Baby I won't
I won't steer you wrong
And it seems like to me,
You want someone to treat you like their queen
Baby I do
So what'cha want?
Smack your ass, pull your hair
And I even kiss you way down there
You know I will
Think I won't?

That's the way we do it
Left and right
Keep it moving
Up and down

And up and down (All day, how we do it?)

I hear you calling my world
Make you feel like a pearl
I'll rub your back and fulfill your needs,
So why don't we just get undressed?
Fingertips touching and you're caress
That's what I want
Why don't you give it to me?
I will have you believe
There's no reason for you to leave
Stay right here (stay right here)
In my arms (in my arms)
Bring you fears stay secure
Here with me you can be sure
There's no faking
You turn me on

And up and down (Yo, this is how we do it)

Why don't you know,
The sexy little things you do?
Oh, oh why don't you know,
The sexy little things you do?

Yo Doc be off the wall
With Keith and Mally G
Pulling a Harley D with a jar of grease
Come 1-5-1, straight endo, the spot
I f*ck brown sugar behind the fiber glass window
Its Doc not guns don't sling weight
The only thing I sling is condoms for spring break
(F*ck 'em) How we do it?
(Leave 'em) How we do it?
(Get the money) The pussy
(The weed) Now do it!

Now take your coat off and stay a while
Now honey child if you're gon' be acting funny style
Then I don't need ya
It's Saturday, this night fever
Shit is popping, Cheeba, my mouth cotton
'Tis the season for draws dropping
And heavy breathing
You ain't skeezing,
You dick teasing?
I'm leavin'
Acting rotten, I got no time for games
I'm no joke
Drop that ass when I'm finished
And watch it smoke
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
