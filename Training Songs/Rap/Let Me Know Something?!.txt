You think you hot, girl?
You walk around with your hair and nails done
Your friends try to talk to you
You treat them like you just don't care

It all about what you need
'Cause I know how you live from day to day
So let's sit and talk about it
'Cause you desired a break today

Let me know something
Let me know something, girl
Let me know something
What's on your mind?

Let me know something
Just let me know something, girl
Let me know something
What's on your mind?

Girl, you don't response when I speak to you
Girl, happiest when I speak to you
