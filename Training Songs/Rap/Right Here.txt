Aiyyo uptown (what?) the bridonx (What?)
Long isle (what?) stridong (What?)
Yo Brooklyn

We can face the f*ck off like hockey or face off like Travolta
Face off like car radios with the mind of Minolta
Face off like treach if you're fuckin with Vin Rock
You still pop shit? I face off like fembots
And I'm the six million motherfuckin' dollar man
With a six million muh'fuckin dollar plan
For thug niggaz and pimp players and drug niggas
Your technique, I sweep under the rug niggas
Out of queens, shit I serve with the fiends and bug niggas
I'm above niggaz, but all in all, I love niggas
Like my man benny rat (uh) showed me the rap game
Told me never to act sane on a record or rap plain
Now the name reign supreme, seen major cream
Rhymes, sicker than lyme disease and gangrene
I'm the most obligated, nigga creatin' havoc
Check the meaning for monch, the meaning becomes tragic
Raw, if you want it
Raw, yeah we got it indeed
Yo actually I'm just tryin' to eat
For sure, if you need it on tour
Yeah we ready to bleed
I'm sayin' God I'm just tryin' to eat

Basically y'all could get eight twice like Lynn Swann plus get ate like pussy
Get ate like Mickey D's after the hydro when you push me
Get ate like cannibalism and sliced surgical
In any extremity y'all get infinity vertical
Every line to word of mine will be verbally placed to murder you
The master, flippin' convertible flows irreversible
Unobtainable to the brain it's unexplainable what the verse'll do
Pharoahe's the sperm your mind's the eggs I'm burstin' through
Y'all heard of me, I pack Macs and crack vertebraes
Leave niggas with third degree burns and back surgery
Mics guns knives, pick declare which object, flip
Have niggas runnin like the Blair Witch Project
Raw, if you want it
Raw, yeah we got it indeed
Yo actually I'm just tryin' to eat
For sure, if you need it on tour
Yeah we ready to bleed
I'm sayin' God I'm just tryin' to eat
