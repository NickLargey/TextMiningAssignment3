What will we do to become famous and dandy

It's quite a spectacle to see us land
In waste receptacles as if we've planned it
We're never skeptical when we get branded
Then disrespectful 'cause we feel abandoned

The height of mediocrity is the challenge
Crawling through the entrails of imbalance
We learn to like to be the heroes
We learn to lie to the brand name Negroes

We learn to laugh to avoid being angry
We learn to kill and learn to go hungry
We learn not to feel, for protection
And we learn to flaunt when we get an erection

What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos and Andy

We're born believing we're greater than circumstance
Infinitely stronger than chance as our first breath is handed
We taste the double standard, the need to wear the mask
And with society's nurturing, the psychic plastic surgery

Begins to take effect as our souls watch astound
Our characters flounder, duplicitous identity
Diction and contradiction have become the skills of assimilation
Razor honed to perfection from the moment of creation

It's gone from identity crisis to survival slingshot to rifle
Sin to revival, try to get looked at but not poked in the eyeball
Warned of our impurities, afraid of insecurities
Real life experts of the artificial, athletes and entertainers
Have become the minstrels on commercials

What will we do to become famous and dandy

On screen or off we can be rented to perform any feat
And we reflect the images presented by the media's elite
Positive or negative attention is viewed as success
U.S.D.A. African American Beef is seen as progress

We never ask ourselves too many questions
Too much truth in introspection
Maintain the regimentation and avoid self-degradation
We act out all the stereo types, try to use them as decoy

And we become shining examples
Of the system we set out to destroy
'Cause even in the most radical groups you will find
That when you stray from the doctrine, you'll see hard times

What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos and Andy

Being kicked in the mouth or smiling with no teeth
They're both choices, yes, but it's impossible to eat
Uneducated, underdeveloped, undisciplined but mostly unaware
We join the flavor of the month club

We swallow the flavor of the month
Well, holding our crotch was the flavor of the month
Bitch this bitch that was the flavor of the month
Being a thug was the flavor of the month

Then no to drugs was the flavor of the month
Kangol was the flavor of the month
Rope gold was the flavor of the month
Adidas shoes was the flavor of the month

Then bashing Jews was the flavor of the month
Gentrification was the flavor of the month
Isolation was the flavor of the month

My pockets are so empty, I can feel my testicles
'Cause I spent all my money on some plastic African necklaces
And I still don't know what the colors mean
Red, black and green

What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos and Andy
What will we do to become famous and dandy
