You always said you loved me 
Though my mind's right now not sure 
You've always been there for me 
Though my heart never feels secure 
Why can't you take a further step 
To let me know you really care 
'Cause now I'm feeling driven 
Into a love that's not right there 

Why do you make me feel this way 
Feeling betrayed, feeling pushed away 
Why do you make me feel so bad 
Feeling so hurt, feeling so sad 
What have I done to make you turn 
I'm feeling so lost, I'm feeling so burned 
If you really cared you'd make a change 
So I could feel the pleasure and not the pain 

After all I've said 
You still have it set in your head 
That you don't really care about me 
Why can't you seem to believe 
That I'm the only one for you 
I gave all my love to you 
And after all I've done for you 
You never say that you love me 
The way that I love you 

Why do you make me feel this way 
Feeling betrayed, feeling pushed away 
Why do you make me feel so bad 
Feeling so hurt, feeling so sad 
What have I done to make you turn 
I'm feeling so lost, I'm feeling so burned 
If you really cared you'd make a change 
So I could feel the pleasure and not the pain 

I feel all the pain, hurt so bad, feel so sad 
It hurts so bad, it hurts so bad 
I just can't take no more baby 
Girl make a change 
So I can feel the pleasure and not the pain 

Why do you make me feel this way 
Feeling betrayed, feeling pushed away 
Why do you make me feel so bad 
Feeling so hurt, feeling so sad 
What have I done to make you turn 
I'm feeling so lost, I'm feeling so burned 
If you really cared you'd make a change 
So I could feel the pleasure and not the pain
