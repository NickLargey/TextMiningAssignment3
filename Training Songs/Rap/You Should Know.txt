Don't try to tell me you don't know what I feel
When all I do is try to please you
Do what I can to show my love is for real,
Still you just push me away
Come on girl give me wutcha know I deserve
I only want what is right
Don't leave me hanging with my heart on the verge,
Of breaking down every night

[Chorus]
Cause you should know by now, without any question
I live and die for the love of you
When the sun don't shine
I'll still be by your side
So baby you should know, that I love you

And everything you do in my mind
But now I need it for real, from you baby
I know inside ya that there's someone that's kind,
But I dunno how long I can deal with it.
Oh, 
Come on and give me what you know I deserve,
I only want what is right
Don't leave me hanging with my heart on the verge,
Of breaking down every night

[Chorus]

Cause no other man will know you like I do,
And no other man will treat you like I do,
Only a man who really loves you, 
Would stand the test, that you've put me through
For your heart

[Chorus]

Cause you should know by now, w/o any question.
I live and die for the love of you
When the sun don't shine, I'll still be by your side
So baby, you should know, that I love you
I love you, I love you (You should know)

When the sun don't shine, still be mine

So baby you should know
