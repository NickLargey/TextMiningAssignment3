If you're tellin' me you want me
Hold me close all through the night
I know, deep inside you need me
No one else can make it right

Don't you try to hide the secrets
I can see it in your eyes
You said the words without speaking
And I'm gonna make you mine

Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life

The time of your life
Ohhhh
Give you the time of your life
Oh baby yeah

Love and passion make me crazy
Your existence makes me wild
Want to loosen up your feelings
To see what's hiding inside

Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life

The time of your life
Ohhhh oh yeah
Oh baby

Ay, que rico
Oh, how good
Me pone loca
You make me crazy
Como te mueve
How you move
Como me toca
How you touch me
Tu movimiento
Your movement
Tu sentimiento
Your feeling
Si, yo te quiero
Yes, I want you
Te doy la noche
I'll give you the night
Toda la noche
All night long
Ay, vamos!
Let's go!

Give me just one night, just one night baby
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, just one night oh baby
I'll give you the time of your life
(give you the time of your life)
Give me just one night

Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
(a moment to be by your side)
Give me just one night, una noche oh yeah
I'll give you the time of your life

Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side

Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life
