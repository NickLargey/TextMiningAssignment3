Roll deep alive, live

I'm just sitting here, I ain't saying much I just think
And my eyes don't move left or right they just blink
I think too deep, and I think too long
Plus I think I'm getting weak 'cause my thoughts are too strong
I'm just sitting here, I ain't saying much I just gaze
I'm looking in to space while my CD plays
I gaze quite a lot, in fact I gaze always
And if I blaze, then I just gaze always my days

'Cause it's the same old story, shutters, runners, cats and money stacks
And it's the same old story, ninja bikes, gun fights and scary nights
And it's the same old story, window tints and gloves for finger prints
Yeah it's the same old story, police investigate around the area
'Cause it was only yesterday we was playing football in the streets
It was only yesterday none of us could ever come to harm
It was only yesterday life was a touch more sweet
Now I'm sitting here thinking wagwan. (Get me wagwan)

I'm just sitting here, I'm just sitting here, yo
I'm just sitting here, yeah I'm just sitting here, yeah

I'm just sitting here, I ain't saying much I just watch
I really don't feel like moving so I cotch
I watch all around, I watch every detail
I watch so hard I'm scared my eyes might fail
I'm just sitting here, I ain't saying much I just smile
It's funny 'cause I haven't bust a smile for a while
I'll smile for a minute, and I'm smiling for an hour
I'm scared 'cause it's sweet, but it could turn sour

'Cause it's the same old story, chung intelligent yaps in hospie flats
And it's the same old story, benefit claims and cheques in false names
And it's the same old story, students truent, learn the streets fluent
Yeah it's the same old story, strange, there's no sign of positive change
'Cause it was only yesterday, we was standing firmly on our feet
It was only yesterday, girls were innocent they kept us calm
It was only yesterday, there was less bobbies on the beat
Now I'm sitting here thinking wagwan. (Wagwan, wagwan)

I'm just sitting here, I'm just sitting here, yo
I'm just sitting here, yeah I'm just sitting here, yeah

I'm just sitting here I ain't saying much I'm just vex (shame)
I seen a lot of bullshit, wondering what's next
I'm vex at humanity, vex at the earth
I keep getting vex, till I think what's the worth?
I'm just sitting here, I ain't saying much I feel to cry
I'm sitting here depressed and I don't know why
I try to pull myself together, tell myself fix up
And I keep myself from bawling but my eyes they erupt

'Cause it's the same old story, crazy boys keep getting on my nerves
And it's the same old story, police don't give me no peace
Yeah, it's the same old story, friends slowly drifting from the ends
Yeah, it's the same old story, I've sussed, there's nobody I can trust
'Cause it was only yesterday after school we'd come outside and meet
It was only yesterday, it was all love back then
It was only yesterday, every sunny day was a treat
Now I'm sitting here thinking wagwan. (wagwan wagwan)

I'm just sitting here, I'm just sitting here, yo
I'm just sitting here, yeah I'm just sitting here, yeah,
I'm just sitting here.
