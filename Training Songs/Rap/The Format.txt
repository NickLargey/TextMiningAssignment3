A.Z
I'm ready

You know the chronicles the shit that if momma knew
The stress the drama dude the techs phenomenal
Rapid fire, pecks through the abdominal
You bastard liars, it's me who's the honorable

Bathed and clothed up, shaved and close cut
Restraint from temptation was drained from both nuts
Ha... now the physical form verbalized 
Through the scriptures I was Biblically born

It's I-ya Jeremiah, conceived through the blunt fire
On Kawasaki's could wheelie up on one tire
Well respected, gel connected, 
Got the method for the woody females perfected

For sure, very few flaws, heavy chevy 2 doors
Candy painted to give a nigga the blue balls
Course, this the life I chose
The bid, the 360, the cyphers closed come on

The format is real sickening, contagious
Here I come, AZ
Still, I dont have to run no games I've done those thangs

Young and gifted my tongues prolific
In the beached bungalow is how I brung in Christmas
From the streets ima flow from the hungriest districts
Switch kicks, crisp when I come to them picnics

Play it slow, paper chase, stack, and lay low
Range rov, tinted all black the same old
Psychic mind, writes his rhymes
Still turn the new leaf on my life of crime

No concerns with new beef whos as nice as I'm
Its confirmed from feet I'm still a sniper blind
Built my fame, spilt my pain
Politicking daily still tryin' to milk the game

It's obvious that I'm real rap skills remain
I took some change and I'm still the same..

The format is real sickening, contagious
Here I come, AZ
Still, I dont have to run no games I've done those thangs

Learned the system
Burned some ism
Jotted my jewels down like journalism
How I'm a move now it emerged through wisdom
A pilgrim, prophisizing puttin' words to rhythm

Relatin', an Adam Clayton in manifestation
Patient, meditatin' with them animals waitin'
Pacin', like an M-8 that sealed it's fate
Let some years escape but I'm still in shape

I'm Chillin'...
Deeply rooted, a beast with music
From best out to the east im too at peace to lose it
But love it, I still does it
Breathin off a Trump budget
Fresh outa Bloomies with the Louie luggage

The format is real sickening, contagious
Here I come, AZ
