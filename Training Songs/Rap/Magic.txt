Good evening baby (oh) 
And welcome to the charlie show, 
Tonight I'm gonna be showing you things 
That you've never seen before (oh oh oh yeah), 
So just sit back and relax, 
Because tonight I'm going to be doing some 
Things no man has ever done (no man, no man, 
No man, no man) 
Alright listen. 

Abra cadabra form of a bedroom (h) 
Now add a little candle light
And the scent of your sweet perfume girl. 
Hocus pocus now your in that cute little dress that I like (i like) 
Now don't lose focus on what I'm 'bout to show you tonight. 

[Chorus]
I can do magic 
One snap of you finger girl!
I'll perform a trick on you (oh), 
Any thing you want me to do, 
Cause I can do magic (yeah) 
All you gotta do is dim the lights 
And I'll show you a trick or two (ooh babe) 
Because I can do magic, I can do magic. 

Now I ain't no psychic but I can see what you mean girl, 
And you don't have to write it cause looking at your body I can read girl, 
Your giving me the eye 
And its making me want you bad girl, 
Turn around and can you guess whats in my pants?

[Chorus]

I'll make our friends disappear, 
And out of know where a hotel room will appear, 
Then suddenly, 
Next thing you know its you and me, 
I'll touch you babe, 
Girl I no I lose but please believe (and witness) 
To what I'm about to do (turn the lights off) 
And make all your wishes come true (wave my hand), 
Way by my eyes there goes your clothes, 
There something I want you to know (yeah), 

I can do magic, 
One snap from your finger girl, 
I'll perform a trick on you (i'll perform a trick on you), 
Any thing you want me to do cause I can do magic 
(right in front of your very eyes) 
All you got to do is say the word and I'll show you a trick or two
 (and I'll show you a trick or two) 
Cause I can do magic, I can do magic. 

Call me Houdini or David Copperfield, 
I'll perform a trick on you, 
Girl I am your ginie, 
Baby this love for you is real, 
Cause I can do magic (and girl what we have is magic ooh) 
And I vow to never let it go, 
I show you a trick or two (abra cadabra and hocus pocus) 
I can do,
Now we are married, ever more, 
I can do magic 

Kelly you bad, no Charlie you Bad!
