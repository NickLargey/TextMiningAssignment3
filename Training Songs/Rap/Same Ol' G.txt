The only time I drink a 40 is when I want to drink a 40
And usually when I wear a suit
I leave with not one but two
I'm not trying to hurt nobody
You only live once they told me
You can't be mad at me, I can just be G

Even though I got my own CD maybe even on t.v.
There ain't no changing me I can only be me me me
Even though I might be on t.v. 'cause I got my own CD
All you will ever see (that) same ol' G

I used to be the main one clubbing
But now I choose to stay at home
Most of my friends still thugging
This time the Gs full grown
I'm thinking 'bout my future lately
Whatever that may be
But now it's clear to me
I can just be G

Even though I got my own CD maybe even on t.v.
There ain't no changing me I can only be me me me
Even though I might be on t.v. 'cause I got my own CD
All you will ever see (that) same ol' G

Hello y'all, yeah this that Timbaland coming to ya one mo 'gain
You see, people say that we're changing
But really it's the people around us that are changing
You see, we ain't tryin' to hurt nobody
People tryin' to hurt us
But you know what
I'ma keep being me
That's all I can do in this life time (check it)

Day after day, I continue to be
Me oh me, That's all I can be
Oh day after day, I continue to be me oh me (that) same ol' G

Even though I got my own CD maybe even on t.v.
There ain't no changing me I can only be me me me
Even though I might be on t.v. 'cause I got my own CD
All you will ever see (that) same ol' G

Even though I got my own CD maybe even on t.v.
There ain't no changing me I can only be me me me
Even though I might be on t.v. 'cause I got my own CD
All you will ever see (that) same ol' G

Same ol' G, same ol' G, even though I got my own CD maybe even on TV
