Before I lay my head down ta rest 
I roll up a nickel sack of cess ta relieve the stress 
The herb and the Calisthenics do a nigga justice 
They fake cause I'm a snake and cant be trusted 
I put up with none of them punks who front shit 
Even though some I used ta run wit and smoke blunts wit 
F*ck the foreplay lets do shit the raw way 
Kill the he say she say check what we say 

I'm dwellin' in the cellar wit my niggas Heltah Skeltah 
Loadin' up the clips wit lyrics punks run for shelter 
Smif-N-Wessun's on the loose with a noose for yo neck 
You let info slip out so its dead ya get 
Here's the Black Moon we creepin' up in ya room 
Death fills the air along with the scent of boom 
Open ya eyes motherfuckers and greet ya fears 
Off with the head of a snitch then we outta here 

[Chorus: x2]
Won rhyme for the snitch droppin' dime 
Wontime 
Won rhyme for the heads doin' time 
Wontime 
Won rhyme for the crooks commitin' crime 
Wontime 
Wontime for ya muthafuckin' mind 

Sittin' in the pens with my back against the gate 
Hot as a f*ck cant wait ta get that bus headin' upstate 
New plates same faces from the last joint 
Got my banger so when danger come Ill be on point 
In the parallel cell mad niggas flip 
Cause some think they're doin' dip just got his ass ripped 
Juveniles buck wild in this vicinity 
Keep an open eye cause now I sleep with the enemy 
(Watch ya back shorty!) 
Ready ta thump wit any chump without theirs 
Nobody move nobody gets blown from here ta rear 

Thinkin' of a way ta get even wit my P.O. 
Cause I knew the bitch dicked a nigga on the D-Lo 
Now behind bars where scars come in pairs 
Troopin' wit' my blowers in case these niggas wanna bring it here 
Flippin' on the bitch ass, got cash and commissary 
Cause I ain't goin' home ta never worry 
Another straight up "No" comin' from the board 
Keep my anger hidden til I'm back up in the ward 
Niggas know whats the word cause the grill is blank 
Once again its on sucka-type grab yo shank 

[Chorus]

Well I was taught two wrongs don't make a right 
But me and Ripper been real tight for awhile an everything's aight 
I got one in store for hardcore fanatics 
Bangin' from basement ta attic put static if ya got dramatics 
Who's the next up for heads, when my leads used up 
I'll use my baseball bats and you'll get bruised up 

Word Life my semi-automatic 
And static smokin' lyes more than a habit 
And our victims die tragic 
We stalk around like the beast out for prey 
Back in the island pullin' more jooks by the day 
Takin' loot wit my crimeys on the run from the coppers 
Boot Camp's on the map and ain't no way that you can stop us 

Get out my way nigga, I'm comin' through deep 
And my fleet packs heat 
Ain't nothin' sweet we play for keeps 
I got money on my mind and my hand on my nine 
Got ta get mine cause my life's on the line 
I roll with the Ripper and the Ripper rolls with me 
And my Brethren D to the O-G 

See we be hittin' up Boom spots a lot 
In the cipher gettin' high with the hoods on the block 
If you don't know me don't even come in my circle 
F*ck around and get me vexed then I'ma hurt you 
Bumba claat rude bwoy lick off ya nine 
As I hit you one time for ya fuckin' mind 

[Chorus]
