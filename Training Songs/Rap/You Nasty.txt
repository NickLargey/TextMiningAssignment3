Biatch!
You nasty, you nasty bitch
That's what I said bitch (you nasty)
I said you nasty (you nasty)
F*ck that shit, f*ck you hoes (you nasty) 
F*ck all y'all, man

I used to get straight A's, read my books in Catholic school,
Now I find myself in the men's bathroom
With a top-notch, goin' wild in the stall,
She ain't even trippin' 'cause she's havin' a ball
I used to play with my toys in the back yard,
But now I just walk around and act hard
A lot of women like to be called a bitch,
I'll break it down so you understand all of it
I always thought I was an educator,
I might not love her, but I never hate her
She's the kind of girl to make your toes pop,
Keep ya wide open, never need nose drops
Now y'all want to get mad at me,
For talkin' about another young, nasty freak
Its life, its not a major catastrophe,
You ain't a ho 'cause you givin' up the ass for free, you nasty

I know why y'all mad at me, I ain't break your heart girl (you nasty)
Man, these bitches trippin' (you nasty)

Too many tight lil' dresses with no panties on,
Too many females tryin' to take a man home
Where your mommy and your daddy at?
Just because a player got a Cadillac
You want to lay in the back, with your face in his lap,
All you gotta do is taste that
You get to ride, get used all the time,
I ain't made the situation I just made the rhyme
Adapt to my surroundings, look around
Nothin' but pimps, tricks, and hookers found
In the Town, if you ain't one you the other,
I ain't fooled, what you gonna do to a brother
Lookin' at me, like you want to eat me,
Didn't even have to use words to meet me
Now we havin' sex and I forgot your name,
You just a hot thing, nothin' can't stop your game, 'cause you nasty

I already fucked you (you nasty)
I don't know why you trippin' (you nasty)
I told y'all I was gonna call you (you nasty)
After awhile

I understand where your anger comes from,
'cause I've been talkin' bad on the mic since day one
Never took the time to explain myself,
But keepin' it real is somethin' I can't help
I know some real women, I know some real hoes,
And male-bashing songs, I don't feel those
But I'm glad you bi-sexual women came out,
Don't tell em what we did and keep my name out your mouth
If it wasn't for the groupies or for the oral sex they gave me,
I'd treat you all like ladies
I'm just a victim of society,
Look me in my eyes and don't lie to me
You ever had a one-night stand and go to church the next day?
A full night of play, wake up and pray
Wishin' you could stay, but you can't
Oh you a good girl today? You ain't no saint, you nasty

Oh yeah I know I fucked you too (you nasty)
You know what I'm talkin' bout?
You need to take this motherfuckin' opportunity 
And have some big fun (you nasty)
I got some drinkin' in the kitchen baby (you nasty)
My niggas comin' through (you nasty)
Oh, its cool girl (you nasty)
We gon' work this shit out, biatch!
I ain't mad at y'all
I ain't mad at you
Shit, I ain't mad
'cause you nasty
