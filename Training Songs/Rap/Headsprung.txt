They call me Big L'why, Big Silly 
Big Money, Big Billy 
When I'm sliding in them all can ya hear me? 
I be sexing wit these bars so ya feel me 
Let me grip it up for 'cause in the back 
Let me grip it get a buzz in ya hat 
I'm a tell ya how to cause an attack 
Timbaland, Ladies Love on the track 
Lovely get the ice, pop champagne 
Don't forget I used to ride on the train 
When I bump it right, call my name 
Go crazy in the mall wit James 
Dump that, not ill like me 
Bring the women in to chill for free 
Let me tell ya girl, don't try me 
You better have I.D.! 

[Chorus: x2]
When we be up in the club 
We be posting the back 
When we be in the club 
Girl always come to the back 
And we bout to get our head sprung 
And we bout to get our head sprung 
And we bout to get our head sprung 
And we bout to get our head sprung 

Lord have mercy! If the broad is thirsty 
I'll have her man reimburse me 
The part that hurts me, is when they try to work me 
But I could never let ya jerk me 
Steady sticking to the wall, give it up 
Sneaking through the back door live it up 
Got the champagne, pour me a cup 
Got the girls looking raw in the front 
Got a call your man's in town 
Tell the bar, another round 
Got all my mans holding me down 
Kinda thick ma, let's get down, so get wit it 
I'm saying what time wanna dip wit it? 
Got players on the grind, wanna skip wit it 
Backstage you mine, I'm a spit wit it, hey! 

[Chorus] 

Hey ladies! (Yeah!) no need to get your hair done 
I said yo ladies! (Yeah!) no need to get your hair done 
I'm a get your head sprung, I'm a get your head sprung 
I'm a get your head sprung, I'm a get your head sprung 
I said yo fellas {Yo!} no need to throw them ones 
I said yo fellas {Yo!} no need to throw them ones 
I'm a get your head sprung, I'm a get your head sprung 
I'm a get your head sprung, I'm a get your head sprung (Hey!) 

[Chorus] 

Yeah! Keep chillin' with 'em, yeah
