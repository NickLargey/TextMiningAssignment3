I don’t wanna to be your leader
I don’t wanna let you down
And I don’t really need to see you
Turn your life around, oh

Are you running away
‘Cause someone told you ‘never’?
That you’re always gonna tread the wrong road

Are you running away?
Could my love do you better?
‘Cause there’s something that I need to let you know

If you’re looking for a place to hide.
It’s alright
I will always try and look the other way
And if you’re ever caught between the lines
Wrong or right
We are one and I will always keep you safe.

Back into the habit
See it in your eyes
Oh
Gone through all the motions
It’s hard to recognise

That you’re running away
You can’t escape forever
From the memories you tried to leave behind

Could’ve found a way
We could’ve been in it together
So I’m reaching out and here’s the reason why.

If you’re looking for a place to hide.
It’s alright
I will always try and look the other way
And if you’re ever caught between the lines
Wrong or right
We are one and I will always keep you safe.

If you’re looking for a place to hide.
It’s alright, it’s alright
I will always try and look the other way (It’s alright, it’s alright)
And if you’re ever caught between the lines
Wrong or right
We are one and I will always keep you safe.

If you’re looking for a place to hide.
It’s alright
I will always try and look the other way
And if you’re ever caught between the lines
Wrong or right
We are one and I will always keep you safe.
