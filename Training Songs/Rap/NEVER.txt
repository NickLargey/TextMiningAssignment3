Ok, never been shit, never had shit, never knew shit, never out never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist, 
Never had shit, never take, never asking give me this, 
Give me that shit, give me everything nigga, 
Give me everything nigga
(Again)
Never been shit, never had shit, never knew shit, 
Never out never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits
Never been a bitch, never had a Bezel on the wrist, 
Never had shit, never take, never asking give me this, 
Give me that, give me everything nigga, 
Give me everything nigga, give me everything

Never had a real dollar to my name, bruh
Shit been lame, bruh
I ain't even in this shit for the fame, bruh, it's the pain bruh
Most of the niggas I came up with, haven't came up
And doing the same stuff, but I haven't came up
This really ain't nothing, niggas thinking they fucking with JID
Ya'll got the game fucked up
Tremendously, can't f*ck with the mind of a mental fiend 
Who dig deep in the depths when he in too deep
I crept on the steps where the demons leap
And yell well show the Lord what He means to me
Oh my God, don't be mean to me
We arrived with a bean or three
And it's not what it seems to be
I can die, I can fly, I can try very easily
I'm a guy need a giant, she a vibrant thing, I probably won't buy it
Bird bitch take flight, no pilot
Serve dick, curve bitch, no bias
Back up, back up, chick bad timing
I got to get on stage, you better get on page
I have you looking out the window pane and in the rain and in the thing, 
But in the way
If I say this is what it is forget the lip
Now what's my point, now I forget (now this bitch)
Got me fucking up my script, f*ck this shit, I got this shit
Getting to the point where everybody say they from the block 
And shit with Glocks and shit and poppin', pimpin', trapping, and sipping lean
Ya'll niggas fall for anything, you got the plug in Medell√≠n?
Kingpin, you a pin king (Kingpin, you a pin king)
Bye, bye, niggas in sync
Try I? Nigga risky
Fire, fire from the wrist piece
Niggas shooting like the '60s (again)

Never been shit, never had shit, never knew shit, never out never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist, 
Never had shit, never take, never asking give me this, 
Give me that shit, give me everything, nigga f*ck you

(Let's go)

Alright what you call a chick that don't suck dick? You don't
And if you think you finna come up this, you won't
Down comes the boogie and up jumps the funk
This beat taking a beat and got hand out the lumps
Damn baby, yo ass stand out in pumps
That's outstanding, stand outside until your man come
Or you can leave with the kid, we can plan some
You know I came from the dirt like a sandstorm
Nigga, this a 3 point and-1, and 100, Wilt Chamberlain with the hand dumb
Shawty love JID, let me turn into a hand puppet
She moan sound like German or something
Run game, bitches think I'm Todd Gurley or something
Give me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia
Wheeled yo bitch out my bed in a gurney
You gotta leave lil mama, the clocks turning
I hit it first, Ray J or Ron Jeremy
They bleed like us so them niggas could never scare me
No niggas got more glow than JID
Barely scratching the fucking surface
You need work, you need purpose
Everybody good, everybody trap perfect
Everything cool, don't nobody act nervous
Just ignore the fact that your favorite rap nigga is a sap nigga
We don't dap niggas, get the rrrat from the ratchet
Get the pack out the package
Lil' savage ass, ratchet ass, bastard ass, havin' ass, rapping ass, jacking ass, wait
Finna black, green dot, send in cash, pen and pad, minivan, 
Been in that, been with that bullshit nigga

I don't wake up to the bull like I usually do
Young niggas down the block on the woopty woop
Better pray to God they don't shoot at you
Dreams of cleanin' this dirty money out my cuticles
Then a nigga make the crowd jump like Zoboomafoo
Shit's beautiful (shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful)
Shit's beautiful (shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful)
Shit's beautiful
