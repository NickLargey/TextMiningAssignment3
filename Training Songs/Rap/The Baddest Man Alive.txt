I could take the pitchfork from the devil
Keep a super suit like I’m incredible
From the deep, blue sea to the dark, blue sky
I’m the baddest man alive
I’d grab a crocodile by his tail
Handcuff the judge, and throw the cops in jail
Make the meanest woman break down and cry
I’m the baddest man alive
I’m the baddest man alive
I take no mess, and I take no jive
Sometimes I feel like I can fly
I’m the baddest man alive
I’m the baddest man alive

Not bad meaning bad, but I’m bad meaning good
Say my name three times, and you knock on wood
Candy man walks, I terrorize your hood
Flashing macs on a cop, the way a gangster should
I snatch food from the mouth of a tiger
Take a gasoline bath, and I walk through fire
Bear hug a grizzly, suck milk from her titty
Take the sergeant hat from his head and use it for a Frisbee
Spit in a crocodiles face, have a menage a trois with two female apes
Then sleep in a barrel of butcher knives
I drink honey straight from the beehive
Bungee jumping off the Empire State butt-naked
Rollerblade across the Golden Gate, butt-naked
I’m the baddest man alive, and I don’t ṗlan to die
When the grim reaper come, I look him right in his eye
I bust off in the face of the witch of the East
Tell a great white shark to go and brush his teeth, heh heh heh
I’m the man who stole the golden fleece
And I date rape Beauty right in front of the Beast
The baddest man alive, and I don’t plan to die

I’m the baddest man alive
I take no mess, and I take no jive
Sometimes I feel like I can fly
I’m the baddest man alive
I’m the baddest man alive
