Sarah Connor it's an honor
Wyclef
Bounce
One night stand

Love ya baby, drive me crazy
Let me be your sugar daddy
Looked into my eyes
I was convinced
That he's real

Girlfriend 
Ever had a boyfriend
Looked to be your best friend
Turned out to be a one night stand

He loves me
He loves me not 
He screams my name in bed
Makes me feel so hot 
But once he's out the door
He's already forgot
The promises he made 
At the break of light
To love me
Protect me
Not leave me
Or hurt me

I was so foolish
And so blind to see
That all he wanted to do was to use me

Love ya baby, drive me crazy
Let me be your sugar daddy
Looked into my eyes
I was convinced
That he's real

I love him
I love him not
I still scream his name in my bed at night
But once he's out the door
He's already forgot
The promises he made
At the break of light
He said he's needing me, 
But he's misleading me
Sayin' he loves me,
But he's mistreating me

I was so foolish 
And so blind to see
That all he wanted to do was to use me

Love ya baby, drive me crazy
Let me be your sugar daddy
Looked into my eyes
I was convinced
That he's real

But don't feel sad, bad, mad
'Cause I've too been
Through the rain
And I can feel your pain 

Mama told me 
There'd be days like these
So I'm telling you ladies

Take me to the bridge, Sarah Connor!

Sitting in my room I'm all alone
My friends think I'm crazy
Cause I'm waiting for your call
Was it a dream or reality
When you said you'd be with me
For eternity

Wyclef and Sarah Connor
Holler, lend me your ears
This is the wickedest combination
Since Sonny and Cher
Say here girl,
Take these dozens of roses
And let me part the red sea like I was Moses
Love is love
Two wrongs don't make it right
So let's make love in the dark
Till we break daylight
Then hit the autobahn
You and me in a Ferrari
Fall asleep in Germany,
Then wake up in New York City

Love ya baby, drive me crazy
Let me be your sugar daddy
Looked into my eyes
I was convinced
That he's real

But don't feel sad, bad, mad
'Cause I've too been
Through the rain
And I can feel your pain

Mama told me
There'd be days like these
So I'm telling you ladies
Watch out for the wolves
That be dressed like sheep

Bounce now, wolves bounce now
Like sheep
Watch out for the wolves wolves
That be dressed like sheep

Like sheep
Watch out for the wolves wolves
One night stand

Ladies, if you must have it
Make sure he wears a prophylactic

Wolves bounce now
Like sheep
Watch out for the wolves wolves 
One night stand
