Ughh 
Lately why'know how that sayin' goes 
"Be careful what you ask for in life 
'Cause you just might get it" 
Dependin' on what you ask for 
What you get you might now be able to get out it 
You heard? Ughh 
Niggas might take advantage if you let 'em (ughh) 
Play your cards right and if you f*ck 'em in the same night 
Make sure that he don't snitch must be up to sumpin' 
Or might be lyin' on his dick, shit 
You know how niggas flip from gettin' pussy 
The head, 'til you spit yo bread and blew his dick 
Especially if he trip, shit 
Don't complain, bitch, do your thang 
And cop that range (ughh)

Nothing to lose, and I see right through him

And if he packin' like he yappin',
