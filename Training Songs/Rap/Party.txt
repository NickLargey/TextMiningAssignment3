Yes sir! Faith is in the building!
Ladies and Gentlemen
I just got off work and I'm about to get my party on.
How about you?
Yo Faith! Let's go!

I've been working hard every day
This time is hard and I got bills to pay
I got so much responsibility
And I deserve to dance the night away
Let it go and let the music take you
'Cause we came in through all night until the day
Are you feeling what the beat does to you?
Just let it through you
Send a message to the DJ

'Cause I know that you came to party
So move your body to the floor
Get you back up on the wall
'Cause I know that you came to party
So move your body to the floor
Get you back up on the wall

It's Friday night let the party begin
Leave your stress out at the door
Have no worries on the dance floor
DJ want you please play my favorite song?
Nothing can go wrong

'Cause I know that you came to party
So move your body to the floor
Get you back up on the wall
'Cause I know that you came to party
So move your body to the floor
Get you back up on the wall

One time two times STOP
I came to party
I'm a G male
Tell you female
I just parked up in a hot Ferrari
Look it mummy she likes my style
How's to party how I keep down
Kick your booty then I skip town
Go ridiculous go get drawn
I'm a hot male now
Too hard to handle
Back in the party in a limo
Jimmy shoe tattoo on the sandal
Race on in a bake it's just a gamble
Yeah we're famou' and we get it in
Stand in the mirror acting like skin
Boy when I spin I blow the
'Cause I came to party like

'Cause I know that you came to party
{Just turn your hands up}
So move your body to the floor
Get you back up on the wall
'Cause I know that you came to party
{You came to feel the groove}
So move your body to the floor
{Take it to the floor}
Get you back up on the wall

Get your back up on the wall
You came to party
Just move your body

We ain't stopping in here baby
RedMan in the building
Faith in the building
Light one up if you're feeling this joint in here
'Cause I know I am

Hey! Let us go!
