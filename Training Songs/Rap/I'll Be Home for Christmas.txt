I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

[Chorus]
Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
There'll be snow and mistletoe

[Chorus]

If only in my dreams
