Told you my secrets, you told me your flaws, oh yeah
So when you listened I accepted 'em too
Told me you loved me, put my heart on pause
'Cause as this place I can't keep fighting for you
So why don't you talk to me, talk to me?
Say anything
'Cause I know once you talk to me, talk to me
We'll be OK

So how the f*ck did we get here?
'Cause I can't recognise us no more
Tell me your lovin' still lives here
I'm standing knocking outside your door

Your loving, come give me your loving
Dance on me
You've got that one something
Your loving, come give me your loving
Dance on me
You've got that one something that I'm deep in
That's something I believe in
That's something that I'm needing
That's something that I'm wanting

You got it twisted like it's all my fault, darling
Swallow your lies, now I speak you the truth
If I had a penny for all of your talk
I'd be rich as f*ck and miles from you
Don't need you to say you'd die for me, die for me
Boy, save your breath
'Cause all this time you ain't had time for me, time for me
And now you care

So how the f*ck did we get here?
'Cause I can't recognise us no more
Tell me your lovin' still lives here
I'm standing knocking outside your door

Your loving, come give me your loving
Dance on me
You've got that one something
Your loving, come give me your loving
Dance on me
You've got that one something that I'm deep in
That's something I believe in
That's something that I'm needing
That's something that I'm wanting, yeah

I can't get away from you babe
You're always on my brain
Be done with the mind games
I can't get away from you
I learned this from you
Love's an option you choose

Your loving, come give me your loving
Dance on me
You've got that one something
Your loving, come give me your loving
Dance on me
You've got that one something
Your loving, come give me your loving
Dance on me
You've got that one something that I'm deep in
That's something I believe in
That's something that I'm needing
That's something that I'm wanting, yeah, yeah

Your loving, come give me your loving
