[Intro] 
We are Bonafide, what? 

[Female Rap] 
Look closely bought a unboard, no sho' 
Yo, we got you wide open, I and our crew 
The weekend we roll out, the watches is froze out 
Yo, we came to get it down and like turn you out 

Play the club outside, sittin' high in the expidal 
Switch it up in the XL-5, Prada down 
Tell me, do you like this thug-ass sound 
No Q, definitey about to blaze your town, what? 

[No question] 
Shout outs to my people on the streets 
To the players makin' money with my CD's in they jeans 
Much love to the ladies with jobs 

Who makin' that cream and floss they own phat ride 
And to my people who always keep it real 
They work all week just to pay bills 
Now and then gotta have a little fun 

Go buy something to wear 'cause the weekend's 'bout to come 

[Chorus]
Time to get loud, let the music flow 
Kick off your shoes and just let go 
Have a little party, call a few friends 
It's about to get fucked y'all, this weekend 
Time to get loud, let the music flow 
Kick off your shoes and just let go 
Have a little party, call a few friends 
It's about to get fucked y'all, this weekend 

Jean sets a new pair of cheese 
Gotta get jig for my ladies in the streets 
Call the barber, get my hair laid 
Roll out wit my crew to watch the ladies shake their thing 

All the ladies shop the town 
Get real digs from the neck on down 
Now and then gotta have a little fun 
Go get up wit your dogs 'cause 
The weekend's 'bout to come 

[Chorus]
 
[Female Rap] 
Tougher, no no, what? 
I know the sound hot enough 'cause this track is tough 
I bump that when I'm riding all up in my Benz truck 
I let 'em know, what you got for me 

Is it big bills baby, can you cop for me 
Wack the drop for me or grab a spot for me 
I want to spend those on the mink coats 
Throughout the whole coast, baby 

But on the weekend I'm blazing off 
And if you don't spend dough then I ain't gon call 
Get out there I'll show you how this playette roll 
Nice frames, spit a game that'll make you fold 

Toss it up, lookin' cute in the coup 
At the Meadows', tough with some 'taly in the boots 
Barceletto 
Some types lay down why, don't see me all gracin' 

Only my associates always stay lacin' 
And when my squad come ain't' no replacin 
Quarter head or you know what you praisin' 

[Chorus]
