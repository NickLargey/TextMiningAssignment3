I know I made mistakes before
But girl I never lied, still I apologize
And I know sometimes I made you cry
But now I realize, I need you by my side
When it comes to you, I swallow my pride
'cause you're the reason why I feel so alive
Girl please tell me you'll still be my lady
Without your love in my life, I'll go crazy

I know I made mistakes before
(But I never lied)
Tell me if you're leaving me
(Or staying by my side)

You know that I love you
I want to know what to do
Please don't forget about me

I know I shoulda thought about the things I did before I did 'em
If I could stop your tears...
Oh girl, I can't see a way to stop the pain that you're feelin'
If I could make it right, God knows I will
Please give me a chance to make things right, once again
Before we fell in love, remember we were friends
So don't let it end

I know I made mistakes before
(But I never lied)
Tell me if you're leaving me
(Or staying by my side)

All my life I've been searching for
A love so true
We've been, been together
So girl, everything I have is yours

Baby, you know I made mistakes...

I know I made mistakes before
(But I never lied)
Tell me if you're leaving me
(Or staying by my side)
