Chorus: Drama

Left left left left left right left
Get on up get on up get on up right left
Left left left left left right left
Get on up get on up get on up
FORWARD MARCH!!!

[Drama]
y'all niggas ain't ready
for this 350 my Chevy
24/7 top drop brains ripped out
Disappear like I'm Makaveli
187 Timberland boot disposing of these leather gloves
Ski mask on with a Chinese chopper
And the ammunition to start a war
M-I-M-I-L-I-K about face double time to the rear
Nobody move till I say get ready to ride no need to cry
Hope y'all niggas ain't scared to die
You can die in here we handlin thangs
A-T-L-A-N-T-A G-A that's where I stay 
MARCH!!!

Chorus

[Drama]
On the grind handling mine
On that shit til my dying day
Keeping it real keeping it trill
Never catch me without that steel
Godby Road is where I trap
Putting in work like a 9 to 5
Stay game tight, left on right
All my troops stay tru alright
T-I-G-H-to the-T 2 D-E-F that's me
P-A-P-E-to the-are see-H-A-S-and-E 
and that's until my D-to the-why-I-N-G D-A-why
Now get your gats and get on up and come on join my infantry

Chorus

[Drama]
A-T-L-A-N-T-A G-A that's where I S-T-A-why 
and that's until my D-to the-why-I-N-G D-A-why
back to that
A-T-L-A-N-T-A G-A that's where I S-T-A-why 
and that's until my D-to the-why-I-N-G D-A
to the motherfucking-why
FORWARD MARCH!!!

Chorus

[Drama]
Left keep it in step

Left keep it in step, keep it in step, keep it in step

Left keep it in step

Left keep it in step, keep it in step, keep it in step

1 Army

7 mo' for the busta in the blue suit
8 choppers and they filled with troops
9 seconds 'foe you lose ya life
10 automatic firing weapons
