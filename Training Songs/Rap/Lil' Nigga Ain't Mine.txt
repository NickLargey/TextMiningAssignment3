Back in 99 when everybody thought she was so fine...
The nigga ain't mine
Yo' knock it off bub you're killing me he couldn't be mine
He too yellow and your skin darker than mine
Braided hair too good and both eyes are rough
He ain't got my eyes they ain't brown enough
You playin babyshower stunts while i'm countin the months
So all i'm thinkin is why me and what the f*ck you want
