While he was scheming
I was beamin' in the Beamer, just beamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all

So I went
To Neiman-Marcus on a shopping spree
And on the way I grabbed Soley and Mia
And as the cash box rang I thought everything away

(Oops) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops) There goes the love I had but you cheated on me
And that's worth that now

(Oops) There goes the house we made a home
(Oops) There goes you'll never leave me alone
(Oops) For all the lies you told, this is what you owe

Hey ladies
When your man wanna get buck-wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Put your hands on his cash and spend it to the last dime
For all the hard times

Oh, when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that if he messed up 
You gotta hit 'em up

While he was braggin'
I was coming down the hill and just draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in the bag and
Sold everything else till there was just nothin' left

And I paid
All the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fades away, away

(Oops) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops) There goes the love I had but you cheated on me
And that's worth that now

(Oops) There goes the house we made a home
(Oops) There goes you'll never leave me alone
(Oops) For all the lies you told, this is what you owe

All of the dreams you sold
Left me out in the cold
What happened to the days when
We used to trust each other

And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old
To get 'em back without me
'Cause it might be better then money or sex
