Pops sped off, left mom with a bundle of 
Joy of boys, smack dab in the jungle 
Took tunnel vision, but he would soon become a mogul but 
First he brought that crack back like a yo-yo though 
Don't play with my yo-yo, loco niggas in the hood 
First niggas hating on me, its all good 
I'm buying things like my shit don't stink 
Gucci links and Gucci gooses, watching too many movies 
Bullet proof this,
Had some nerve like pulling toothes 
When you 16, coming through roofless 
Yea ya boy ruthless 
Like ice cube was 
Turn the whole city on I'm the new plug 
So if this is ya first time hearing this 
You about to experience 
Someone so cold 
A journey, seldom seamed the american dream 
From the bottom to the top of the globe 
They call me hov 

[Chorus]
They coming for me, wanna see me fall 
They know my story, I been through it all 
Nights I felt like dying, but I ain't crying 
What didn't kill me, made me strong as I am 
I am, I am
Oh my god, hov

Now I'm knee deep in the concrete 
Like the streets made a quicksand that?s beyond deep 
I got a chemical romance, two left feet 
So now I dance with the devil please G.O.D. 
Save me from the black parade, release me 
My life like grand theft auto PSP 
I'm in the Volvo, puffin on the lala 
Ducking from the popo 
Every time I drive by, say hi to the bad guy 
All my mama friends be like,
Would you just look at him" 
So sorry dear mama for your embarrassment 
But give me a couple years pray ill never sin again 
Got all these rapper dealers, trying to do me in 
And all these little rappers don't know how prepared for them I am (I am) 
I'm feeling like the worlds against me, lord 
Call me crazy but strangely I love the odds 

[Chorus]

Now these baby ballers, toy rappers 
Calling out my name to bring the boy backwards 
Shooting air balls at the basket 
What you call money, I pay more in taxes 
I got crowned king down in Africa 
Out in Niger?, do you have any idea? 
Sold out shows, albums his whole career 
Jo-burg, Dublin, Tanzania 
Lunch with Mandella, dinner with Cavalli 
Still got time to get water out to everybody 
Everybody, fall back 
Y'all rapping, I'm reenacting 
CNN, you see it's accurate 
ESPN, See me in action 
Monday nights, when the half is 
When you 10 years in, holla back then 

[Chorus]
