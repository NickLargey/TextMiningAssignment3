Meet me anywhere, I don't care it don't matter to me
Cause if ya f***in' step, I'ma step in yo vicinity
What, you think I'm a ho n**** please you ain't on my level
Get some rank b**** while I'm diggin' ya grave with a shovel
Time after time I ask myself is it really clever
For you to get with me, b**** n**** you can neva eva
You ain't on my level, I'm pushin' Chevrolet pedal
If you n****s f*** with me I got that chrome, heavy metal
Never settle for less but always strive for the best
Most these n****s playin' chief'll put ya straight to the test

Look at my Navi' and my 'Lac
Get on my level, hell nah neva that
I knew you wasn't real 'cause all ya do is chit-chat
Always slizzle makin' sho' I stay gone
Call us some broad to the Geor-Georgia Dome
Tryin' to get with me is like naps through a comb
They call me Don P AKA Corlio
Up in the club with my Cartier's on
Don't know if I'm high, drunk, or gettin' my roll on
He on the cell "Can ya hear me" hell nah
Get on my level, that's what I'm tryin' to tell y'all for real

B**** n**** you can neva eva, eva eva hang
B**** n**** step the f*** back and if ya think I'm jokin'
Ask some n****s who tried to play us, 
See em' lyin' off in the coffin
Trillville, ATL swangin' swangin' throwin' bows
Got some n****s that be hatin' bustin' slugs at my foes
If ya thinkin' you can f*** with a n**** like me
Nah n**** get rich, Trillville and BME
What the f*** you talkin' about "What you deep" n**** what!
If a hater want to hate then a hater gettin' bust
We ain't hard to find n**** so why ya steadily talkin' s***
I'm fixin' to sick my dogs on 'em
P**** n****, get bit boy 

'Bout cut out ya brains when I spit this verse
I'm a blood suckin' vampire, my venom is worse
Head bustas deal with dangerous thirsts
Shatter ya bones in ya chest and make ya motherf***in' heart burst
Don't worry now, Prince of the South on the map
Knock yo' thoughts out and leave yo brains in ya lap
Don't touch my Kango shorty, what's wrong with you
I might c*** my fist back and knock yo grill through

B**** n**** you can neva eva, eva eva
Eva eva, eva eva eva eva
Get on my level ho (What!)
