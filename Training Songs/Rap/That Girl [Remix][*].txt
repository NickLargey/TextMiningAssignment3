Yo
Can I talk to you for a minute
Look all I did was look
Why you trippin'
Look
Check this out 

Baby look I'm tired of trying 
To convince you that I ain't caught up lying 
When she walk pass me 
I look so what? big deal
I don't understand 
How that can make you feel that my love ain't for real

Everyday I thank the lord above that your with me (your with me)
Tell me why would I throw that away (why would I throw that away)
What can I do to prove that this is where I want to be (yea)
So I may look occasionally 
Your the only one I need

[Chorus]
If I wanted, 
That girl
Then I would be with, 
That girl
But that one ain't for me
She's fine as hell but she'll always be, 
That girl
Nothing more then that girl
No matter what she do she don't compare to you

What you yellin' for
(Why you screamin')
Girl you acting as if you just caught me cheatin'
When you look at other men
And don't act like you don't
I don't trip because I know I'm the guy you come to every night

Everyday I thank the lord above that your with me (your with me)
Tell me why would I throw that away (why would I throw that away)
What can I do to prove that this is where I want to be (yea)
So I may look occasionally 
Your the only one I need

[Chorus] 

I know I need you right here with me 
Oh I know I need you 
No other girl will do
Cause I need you right here with me
Oh I need you 
Whoooa

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

If I wanted 
That girl
I would be with 
That girl
But that one ain't for me 

She's fine as hell but she'll always be 
That girl
Nothing more then
That girl
No matter what she do 
She just can't be you baby
