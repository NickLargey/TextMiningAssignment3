Oh, my god

I know what them boys want
I know what them boys want (they just wanna taste my sugar)
I know what them boys want
I know what them boys want (they just wanna taste my sugar)

Oh, my god, oh, my god, who told you that you was hot?

They’re coming after me
They know my cherry sweet
But they just make me say
Oh, my god

I know what them boys want (I know what them boys want)
I know what them boys want (they just wanna taste my sugar)
I know what them boys want (I know what them boys want)
I know what them boys want (they just wanna taste my sugar)

They don’t know that I’m a pistol
Impossible to control
Get up, get off, get out, get back
'Fore you make me mad

They’re coming after me
They know my cherry sweet
But they just make me say
Oh, my god

I know what them boys want (I know what them boys want)
I know what them boys want (they just wanna taste my sugar)
I know what them boys want (I know what them boys want)
I know what them boys want (they just wanna taste my sugar)

Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar...

Tu veux toucher, toucher, ma boîte de candy?
Tu veux toucher, toucher, ma boîte de candy?
Tu veux toucher, toucher, ma boîte de candy?
Tu veux toucher, toucher?

Et voulez-vous danser, danser? (danser, danser)
Voulez-vous danser, danser? (danser, danser)

Oh, my god
I know what them boys want
I know what them boys want (they just wanna taste my sugar)
I know what them boys want
I know what them boys want (they just wanna taste my sugar)
