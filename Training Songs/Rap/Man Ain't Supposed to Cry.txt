They say that a man ain't supposed to cry
But baby, your tears I'll cry
PA, let's sing

They say a man ain't supposed to cry right
Baby umm hmm
They say a man ain't supposed to cry right
That's what they told me
They say a man ain't supposed to cry right
Do you believe that baby
They say a man ain't supposed to cry right
Umm listen

Reaching out with all my might
'Cause I feel all the pain that you're going through baby
You need a man with sympathy, one like me
Don't mind crying when you're feelin' blue lady
I've got your front when times are good
And your back when they're bad girl, you don't have to worry
Let me work with you, don't have to boo hoo
'Cause I'm the type of man that will cry for you, you for, I will

They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But through my eyes, I'll cry your tears
'Cause I feel the pain that you're going through
And I'm not afraid to say, "Can I help you, baby?"
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But through my eyes, I'll cry your tears
'Cause I feel the pain that you're going through
And I'm not afraid to say, "How can I can help you baby?"

Precious love one of a kind
You're the secret to my heart
It needs for you, it feels for you
What's kind of different is that it bleeds for you
I've gotta let you know that I'm being real to you baby
You see you didn't know that I cry for you baby
I don't worry 'bout what no man is made
You got a strong man that will cry a day after for you

They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But through my eyes, I'll cry your tears
'Cause I feel the pain that you're going through
And I'm not afraid to say, "Can I help you, baby?"
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But through my eyes, I'll cry your tears
'Cause I feel the pain that you're going through
And I'm not afraid to say, "How can I can help you baby?"

When a man can reach down inside
And put his emotions out with no lies
How many women out there understand
Just what goes on inside a real man
Staying true to all his values and principles
He learned long ago
Respecting that of a woman
And let a know you cry a tear too

They say a man, ain't supposed to cry
But through my eyes, I'll cry your tears
'Cause I feel the pain that you're going through
And I'm not afraid to say, "Can I help you, baby?"
They say a man, ain't supposed to cry
But through my eyes, I'll cry your tears
'Cause I feel the pain that you're going through
And I'm not afraid to say, "How can I can help you baby?"

They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But through my eyes, I'll cry your tears
'Cause I feel the pain that you're going through
