Giving you the best of me
You're all that I want
You're all that I need
Giving you the best of me
'Cause you mean the world to me

Everyday of my life
I want to satisfy your every need
Please believe
I'm so in love with you

For once in my life
I know your the one for me
I don't want nobody else
Because you filled an empty space in my life
You made my life complete
That's why

Giving you the best of me
You're all that I want
You're all that I need
Giving you the best of me
'Cause you mean the world to me

Come to me I'll be here
Anything that you want 
Baby, I got your back
Don't ever doubt me
Cause I'm true and there's nothing in this world 
That I wouldn't do for you
