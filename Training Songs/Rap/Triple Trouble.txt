Kicking lyrics right to your brain
When you hear the saying
You'll be right as rain

If you (if you)
Want to know (want to know)
The real deal about the three
Well, let me tell you, we're triple trouble ya'll
We're gonna bring you up to speed, check it out

Cause I'm a specializer, rhyme reviser
Ain't selling out to advertisers
What you get is what you see
And you won't see me out there advertising
See I like to party not drink Bacardi
'Cause I'm not looking to throw up on nobody
Known for my spiel a wheelie one-wheel
This is like having a delicious meal
And well, moving the crowd, well that's a must
I got some words that apply to us and that's
Mesmerizing, tantalizing captivating, we're devastating

So if you (if you)
Want to know (want to know)
The real deal about the three
Well, let us tell you, we're triple trouble ya'll
We got to bring you up to speed, now check it out

Here's one for the bleachers and the upper tier
Versatile all-temp-a-cheer
If you want a drink call Mr. Belvedere
Run this rap game like a brigadier
I got kicks on the one, seven and eleven
Snares on the five and thirteen
Rhymes on time and that's the given
We're hot on the disco scene check-it, check-it
Slow down with I, me, got to stop stingin'
Source of the problem at the origin
You've got lyrics that have got me cringin'
You're like a fish-wife, quit your damn whingin'

If you (if you)
Want to know (want to know)
The real deal about the three
Well, let me tell you, we're triple trouble ya'll
We're gonna bring you up to speed, so check it out

Bam, super-nature god damn
Cerrone on the microphone, I am
Adrock a.k.a sharp cheddar
My rhymes are better
What the Helen of Troy is that?
Did I hear you say my rhymes is wack?
I'm beautiful you can't touch me
If you pick a rose, well you might just bleed

We're originators you can't feign
Ignorance or pass the blame
'Nuff rhymes coming out the brain
'Nuff beats to drive you insane
'Nuff moves to make your neck crane
'Nuff skill to make the rhymes ingrain
'Nuff heat to leave you in flames
'Nuff style that you can't defame
You see I walk like Jabba the Hutt
The style's so new y'all be like what?
Turn the party out like a bon vivant
With the skill at will that I know you want
On a hot day with the iced latte
Devious like Wylie Coyote
Hot to trot or maybe not-e
'Cause little did they know there was a baby in her body

We're mesmerizing, tantalizing, captivating, devastating

If you (if you)
Want to know (want to know)
The real deal about the three
Well, let me tell you, we're triple trouble ya'll
We're gonna bring you up to speed, check it out
