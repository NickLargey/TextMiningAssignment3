Only God can judge me, is that right? 
Only God baby, nobody else, nobody else 
All you other motherf***ers get out my business 

Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back 
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats 
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed 
And hocus-pocus try to focus but I can't see 

And in my mind I'm a blind man doing time 
Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me 
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine? 

Everybody's dying tell me what's the use of trying 
I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed 
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse 
And they say it's the white man I should fear 

But, it's my own kind doing all the killing here 
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side 
Jealousy inside, make em wish I died 
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm living for 
Everybody's dropping got me knocking on heaven's door 

And all my memories, of seeing brothers bleed 
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees 
Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix 
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks 
Only God can judge me 
 
'Only God can judge me' 
That's right baby, yeah baby 
'Only God' 
Only God can judge me, only God can judge 
'me, only God' 
Only God can judge me 
'Only God can judge me' 
And only God can 
'Only God can judge me, only God '
Only God can judge me 
'Only God can judge me' 
Only God can judge me 
'Only God can judge me, only God' 
Only God can judge me 
'Only God can judge me now' 

Flat line! 

I hear the doctor standing over me 
Screaming I can make it 
Got a body full of bullet holes laying here naked 
Still I, can't breathe, somethings evil in my IV 
Cause every time I breathe, I think they killing me

I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantasies 
I wake up strangling, dangling my bed sheets 
I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce 
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss 

Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here 
Cause even Thugs cry, but do the Lord care? 
Try to remember, but it hurts 
I'm walking through the cemetery talking to the, dirt 

I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward 
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, Black Power 
Is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state 
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate 

Dear Mama, can you save me? And f*** peace 
Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat 
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped 
And they wonder why we suicidal running round strapped 
Mister, Police, please try to see that it's 
A million motherf***ers stressing just like me 

Only God can judge me 
 
'Only God can judge me' 
That's right baby, yeah baby 
'Only God' 
Only God can judge me, only God can judge 
'me, only God' 
Only God can judge me 
'Only God can judge me' 
And only God can 
'Only God can judge me, only God '
Only God can judge me 
'Only God can judge me' 
Only God can judge me 
'Only God can judge me, only God' 
Only God can judge me 
'Only God can judge me now' 

That which does not kill me can only make me stronger 
And I don't see why everybody feel as though 
That they gotta tell me how to live my life 
Let me live baby, let me live 
 
Pac I feel ya, keep serving it on the reala 
For instance say a player hating mark is out to kill ya 
Would you be wrong, for bucking a n**** to the pavement? 
He goin' get me first, if I don't get him fool start praying 

Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law 
So judge us when we get to where we're going wearing a cross, that's real 
Got him, lurked him, crept the f*** up on him 
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want him 

After talking behind my back like a b**** would 
Telling them n****s, "You can fade him," punk I wish you would 
It be them same motherf***ers in your face that'll rush up in your place 
To get your safe, knowin' you on that paper chase 

Gra**, gla**, big screen and leather couch 
My new s*** is so fetti already sold a key of ounce 
B****, remember Tupac and 4-Tay 
Them same two brothers dodgin' bullets representin' the Bay 

Pac when you was locked down, that's when I'll be around 
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown 
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin' sellin' lies 
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know you all in disguise 

Guess you figure you know me cause I'm a Thug 
That love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz 
Been living lavish like a player all day 
Now I'm bout to floss em off, player s*** with 4-Tay 

Only God can judge me

Ha ha ha ha ha ha 
F*** everybody else, ya know what I'm saying?
