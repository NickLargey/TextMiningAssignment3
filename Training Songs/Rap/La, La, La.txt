La la la la la la la la
(break it down)

Can't even hang out with friends
Wit' out ya blowin' up my phone
Why you all in my ear
Like where am I and when am I coming home
Why you listening to your friends?
They don't wanna see us be.

Boy you better take it slow
Or I'll be history
You've got to give me my space
So quick to calling my name
Boy you better recognize
My love is one of a kind
You drive me up to the ceiling
Boy there's no need for the screaming
You know that you are my world
But I'm sick and tired of the

La la la la la la la
That's all I hear you saying
La la la la la la la
Tired of the complaining
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
So why you up in my ear? (break it down)

So I went out to club
I just wanna have some fun
I guess someone told you
I was with some other boy
Cause when I got back home
Put my foot through the door
All the lights came on
Then came the la la la la

You've got to give me my space
So quick to calling my name
Boy you better recognize
My love is one of a kind
You drive me up to the ceiling
Boy there's no need for the screaming
You know that you are my world
But I'm sick and tired of the

La la la la la la la la
That's all I hear you saying
La la la la la la la la
Tired of the complaining
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
So why you up in my ear? (break it down)

Lets go
Why you up in my ear?
Why you up in my ear?
Why you up in my ear? ooh.
Why you up in my ear?
Why you up in my ear?
Why you up in my ear? (break it down)

La la la la la la la la
That's all I hear you saying
La la la la la la la la
Tired of the complaining
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
So why you up in my ear? (break it down)
