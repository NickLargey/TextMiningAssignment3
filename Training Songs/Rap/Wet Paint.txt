This is a painting
And whatever's put on
This consciousness canvas
It never stays the same
Wet paint forever
Cold paint is blue
Scratch paint is sniff paint
Two dimensional glue
Everything is flat
And we're by the frame
Kind of like a movie
Except we are the screen

I am a painting

This is a painting
The paint always moves
This stands at the edge of what is
Looking out beyond ourselves
We shut our eyes
And see everything
