She's my everything, like a morning girl
She's my angel, up above my world
She's the only one who understands me
That's why I call her my new fan league

She's the only one that I want by my side
She's the only one that I believe can save my life
She makes me want to be a better man, oh why
She's higher than the sky, the suns and the moon

She's like a star, like a star, like a star
She's like a star, like a star, like a star
She's like a star, like a star, like a star
She's like a star, like a star, like a star

Well, you inspired me to chase my wildest dreams
You mesmerized my world, I'll be your favorite girl
Like a melody, you release me
Just like the greatest song, you are my number one

He's the only one I want by my side
He's the only one I want by my side
He's the only one that I believe can save my life
He makes me want to be a better girl or wife
Hey, she higher than the sky the suns and the moon

She's like a star, like a star, like a star
Oh baby, he's like a star
Ooh baby, she's like a star
Oh baby, he's like a star
