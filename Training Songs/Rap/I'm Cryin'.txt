Puttin' on my coat, wanna break out from these walls
Catch a bus and take a walk downtown
Maybe run into a friend, I just know I got to get out

But everywhere I go, I see lovers hand in hand
Reminds me of the way it used to be
Reminds me of the way it used to be boy, baby it felt so right
When you were walkin' with me, don't you see?

I'm cryin' how could you leave me all alone
I'm cryin' just can't make it on my own
I dream of you the whole day through
But when the night time falls, I'm all alone
Cryin' all alone

When I close my eyes, I can feel your lips on mine
Nobody ever touched me like you did
Nobody ever touched me like you did boy
There ain't a thing I wouldn't give
Baby, for just one more kiss, don't you see?

I'm cryin' how could you leave me all alone
I'm cryin' just can't make it on my own
I dream of you the whole day through
But when the night time falls, I'm all alone
Cryin' all alone

My friends say I'll love again, I wanna believe but why pretend
Tell me why, why pretend baby, I'm always gonna feel the same
No one will ever take your place, no nothing can compare
With the love that we shared, baby, don't you see?
