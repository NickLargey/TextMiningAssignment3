I'm fallin for you
Boy the things that you do 
Make me feel like I'm one with the world
I'm falling for you

Boy my heart will be true
Just as long as I'll be your girl
Remember lying awake 
Praying for a man like you

Wishing my fantasies could somehow someday come true
I wanted someone who would appreciate the things I do
I finally found my baby 
I'm fallin for you

Boy the things that you do 
Make me feel like I'm one with the world
I'm falling for you
Boy my heart will be true

Just as long as I'll be your girl
Do you even know that I think about you constantly baby 
Realize I'm all the woman that you'll ever need 
Let me show you just how cool I think our thing can be

All I want is your good lovin'
I'm fallin for you
Boy the things that you do 
Make me feel like I'm one with the world

I'm falling for you
Boy my heart will be true
Just as long as I'll be your girl
