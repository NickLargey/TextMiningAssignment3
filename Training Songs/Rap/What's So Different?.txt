What's so different?
What's so different?
If you cheated on him,
how do i know you're not gonna cheat on me
I need to tell you something, check this out

You say you love me
But at one time you loved him so what's so different
Tell me if you were in my shoes
What would you do or think of me would you trust me
But your feeding me
all this rap about
how its different but its not mentioned what you're doing is wicked
Now I'm having second thoughts about
you and me 'cause this is not how I want it or it should be

You say you want my trust and told me you were leavin'
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
Your tellin' me its different but what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me
Your creepin' on him for me but you say just trust me
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
Your telling me its different but what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me

Like saying goes you reep what you sow
And what goes around
comes back around to you five times harder and I'm pretty sure
that he's thinking, that you're totally his
but you're here in my rimmed up drop top with me all hugged up
And all over me kissin' all of me
Is that to get me where you want me to be I don't want this to happen to me
So I'll drop you off go back to your man 'cause really this ain't me

You say you want my trust and told me you were leavin'
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
Your tellin' me its different but what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me
Your creepin' on him for me but you say just trust me
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
Your telling me its different but what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me

Baby tell me one thing how could you do it
What did he do to you does he know he blew it
Or is it just that you wanna get even
baby if that's not it please tell me the reason
I just don't wanna get caught up in drama
If you don't want him just tell him don't cheat on him
If you don't tell him me and you can't be
'Cause tell me how I'll know you won't do that shit to me

You say you want my trust and told me you were leavin'
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
Your tellin' me its different but what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me
Your creepin' on him for me but you say just trust me
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
Your telling me its different but what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me

You say you want my trust and told me you were leavin'
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
Your tellin' me its different but what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me
Your creepin' on him for me but you say just trust me
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
Your telling me its different but what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me
