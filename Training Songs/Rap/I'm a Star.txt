I've seen it, done it, ran it, run it
Been to the bottom then I came back from it
That'll be the pain in the pit of my stomach
Don't regret a thing just keep it hundred
I been the drama and the bad news 
I been the struggle and the damn blues
Shed tears over silliness
I seen a lot but know what
Its as real as it really gets

Rain starts pouring and it don't stop
Let myself drown no I will not
Smile on my pretty mug
I get right back on my horse and I giddy up
I'm in the sky and I wont drop
Have a piece of my pie no you will not
But if you feel like me and it is what it is
Then whats it gone be tonight

Tell him baby I'm a star tonight
I'm up in the sky tonight
For the world to see 
I ain't thinkin' bout you 
Baby I'ma do me tonight
Said baby I'm a star tonight 
I'm up in the sky tonight
So give me one more dream 
Cause I'm shining shining shining

I've seen it, done it, gave my all to it
No fight did how you wanted to do it
Under the weather love fell like a fluid through it
You blew it and I'm feeling brand new
Its over, look in the mirror and see me
Tell me exactly who I wanna be
So tonight's a celebration 
Raising a toast to me being happy

Rain starts pouring and it don't stop
Let myself drown no I will not
Smile on my pretty mug
I get right back on my horse and I giddy up
I'm in the sky and I wont drop
Have a piece of my pie no you will not
But if you feel like me and it is what it is
Then whats it gone be tonight

Tell him Baby I'm a star tonight
I'm up in the sky tonight
For the world to see 
I ain't thinkin' bout you 
Baby I'ma do me tonight
Baby I'm a star tonight 
I'm up in the sky tonight
So give me one more dream 
Cause I'm shining shining shining

And every Eye is on me now
I'm in the sky can't touch the ground
I cant let nobody bring me down 
So if you feel what I feel right now

Tell him Baby I'm a star tonight
I'm up in the sky tonight
For the world to see 
I ain't thinkin' bout you 
Baby I'ma do me tonight
Baby I'm a star tonight 
I'm up in the sky tonight
So give me one more dream 
Cause I'm shining shining shining 
Cause I'm shining shining shining
