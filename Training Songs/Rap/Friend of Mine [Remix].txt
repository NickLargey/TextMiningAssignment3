Yeah, Kelly.
You there?
Now listen baby I got you message
I'm just confused I don't understand everything, 
But I'm on my way over there to you
Now you stay on the phone 
And tell me everything that went down

See I was the one who picked her up 
When so called friends let her down
Uh-huh

And I was the one who took her in 
When that fool put her out,
A true friend in deed
You see I was there when shit was going down
But she betrayed me
I caught her with him coming in from outta town
Tell me why?

Why?

I wanna know
 Why, baby?

Now I put my trust in him
I can't believe he slept with her behind my back
I went out on a limb
I even covered up to keep his thing in tact
What he had in me was something real 
That's so hard to come about
But he betrayed me
There was a photo and some laundry that I found
Tell me

Why?

I put all my trust in you baby
She was my best friend, oh, yeah,
Oh, yeah, roll with me through thick and thing
My homie, my homie
Sisters to the very end and I can't believe it,
Can't believe it oh no, no,
You were everything to me,
Everything to me baby,
I lock the door
It's history oh
Now you gotta go
You could've had everything,
But I can't believe it, can't believe it

No, no, no, no, no, Kelly P., ummm hmm
Why?
Why?
Yeah, ummmm-hmmm
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Kelly, let me call him up
No, no, no
Oh why
And just talk to him
It's nothing to say, 'cause it's too late

I know it, but it's just the principle of the whole thang,
I'm your godfather and I can't stand 
For no one to hurt you baby,
So just call him up

No, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
No, I don't wanna, I don't wanna

Call him babe
Uh-unngh
Call him
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling

Hello? Who's this?
This is Mister Bigg
How you doing Mister Bigg?
What the hell is going on?
What you mean "What's going wrong"?
Kelly's telling me that you're sleeping wit another woman
Just because she sees me with her doesn't mean I sleeping with her
Well, if you not sleeping with her what the hell you doing with her?
Damn, I could be just talking to her
Or you could be just sleeping with her. 
Now son, man to man, we both know the game
Yeah, but what's that?

Wait a minute, now you know all about heartache and pain.
This is my god daughter 
And I'm just trying to protect 
Her heart (don't waste your time).
You may have been a moon to her, 
But to me she's a star (why, why, why).
Kelly, take this phone

She was my best friend.
You were my husband.
Oh, but I don't want you no, no, no more
Said I don't want you no, no, no, no more

Why?
