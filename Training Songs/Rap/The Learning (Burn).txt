[Havoc]
It be a buck-fifty, your chance of runnin is infinte
Slugs that leave n****s drugged like a chick slip the Mickey
I'm so on the low it'd take a Navy SEAL to get me, when I surface
If not chips to Benz is the purpose

On your team I'll pull the curtain, a beautiful hurtin
'Til my eyes see the blood, that mean the creep start workin
N****s never learnin that they eyes keep lurkin
Have ya janitor pumpin your X5 merkin

Skid marks the street, your heart skips a beat
Beef? N**** overcook that meat
Get no sleep, only rest is in between the blink
My life story was written in blood, permanent ink

Killer instinct, R.I.P. 'em
Gotta think like that cuz forever I be needin 'em
Plan flawless, mistakes never repeatin 'em
Some love, some hate me, b****es in the head beatin 'em (So)

N****s wanna ride by the crib all slow (Oh)
We clap motherf***er, want a real rap show?
Fiends are rushin when the mack blow, dead in my castle
And in the blink watch how quick life pa** you

[Chorus: x 2]
What's wrong with motherf***ers,
When will the ever learn
Keep playin with that fire,
And that a** is gettin burned
F***in with semi-autos,
One foot is in the grave
We givin all of y'all,
Somethin to be afraid of

[Big Noyd]
Lemme tell you how it's goin down, it's on now
N****s used to love me, now they wanna hate me now
I'm that same n**** with the tech, holdin the spot down
Except I'm pushin a Lex, lettin the top down

But wait, you don't think I live a pop life now
That's hate, you could get popped right now
Me don't play, I keep a gun around my way
'Cause I'm a f***in drama king like my n**** Kayslay

Sex, drugs, money, and murder all day
It's rules, guidlines, and codes, we obey
Don't even trip, IMD it's that I claim
Infamous Mobb Deep n****, ready to bang

N**** don't think s*** stink, then s*** hit the fans
So I don't slip, I'ma s*** with my gun in my hand
It's a thug thing y'all n****s wouldn't understand and
Y'all keep guns we keep our s*** bangin

[Chorus]

[Prodigy]
You a b****-a** n****, I had you kill't
All they had was your picture at the funeral
No casket, you bas-tards be missin
My jewels, my whip, my rims we b****in

My guns be the heat that'll make you blister
My mens, my Timbs'll stomp you n****s
No s***, no clip, don't F*** with us
It's no problem, I bring it to the best of them

From the old to the new, and the rest of them
No love, just slugs for ya body dunn
Just pain, just sufferin, and worst then that
You let me get my hands on you so I'm takin advantage

And that s*** that you pulled ain't do me no damage
You don't know me, but we bout to change that s***
Wrap that n**** up like a package
F*** all them n****, buck all them faggots

[Chorus: x 2]

[Vita talking]
Yeah, QB (Yeah)
Mobb Deep, dola
It's goin down, we're takin over
Vita, gettin this dough

We don't call it Murder for nothin (Murda!)
(Murda, Murda!)
I'll send you on
Prodigy, Big Noyd, Havoc

Yeah, y'all see us
It ain't a game..Yeah
Oh..Come on..Yeah..You see us...
