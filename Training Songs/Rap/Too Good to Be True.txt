You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true

The way that you move
You take me to heaven
The things that you do
You got me confessin' (got me confessin')
You fell from the sky
Type of perfection
Is this real life? (Is this real life?)
There's something about you

You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
Oh, oh
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
Oh, oh

Oh, no baby don't lie
When you say that you'll be mine
I can't look in your eyes
'Cause I fall a thousand times
And all I want is you to testify, oh
Oh, so baby don't lie
When you say that you'll be mine

You're way too good to be true

You're way too good to be true

I don't go to church
So be my religion
I'm hung on your words
Give me something to believe in

You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
Oh, oh

Oh, no baby don't lie
When you say that you'll be mine
I can't look in your eyes (in your eyes)
'Cause I fall a thousand times
And all I want is you to testify (all I want is you)
Oh, so baby don't lie
When you say that you'll be mine

You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true

You're way too good to be true 

You're way too good to be true

Gunner
I shut down for you
I go in, I dove in and drown you
They should be crowning you, 'cause
You're way to good to be true
Hold up, hold up, ay
Please don't hesitate
Take me while there's still something left to take
Baby you're all that I crave
Tell me how many days do I have to chase you
Do I have to chase
Before I taste you
Before I can say
I can escape you
I cannot escape
Baby you are way too good to be true

You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
You're way too good to be true
