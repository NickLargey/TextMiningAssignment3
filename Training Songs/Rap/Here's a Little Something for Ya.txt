Yes yes yes I'll out the gate I set it off
I suppose you're exposed so get lost
And break north cut all connections
Join the sucker MC witness protections
Mm Mike D
Step off the launch in the place to be 
Always on time so I never botch
The tick to the tock of the Mike D watch
Here's a something for ya
I'm a drive a little and stall ya
Don't lost your balance and fall ya
And if you're feeling chilly I'll fetch you a shawl

Is not done yet (done yet done yet)

Honest Mike what?
Honest Mike D
Don't really care if the press likes me
I just speak my conscience just speak my mind
I don't trip or flip and then I start to find
Queens up front, Brooklyn's in the back
Flack from the flack guns, riot squads smokin' crack
The odds are stacked for those who lack
I been a lucky motherfucker when it comes to that
I slow roast I'm steady tappin' 
Oh yeas I guess I'm the toast of the Manhattan
In Miami I'm sleazy with Jonn Salley
Shout to Andre Leon Talley

Dr. Carlton Brassiere AKA Joyce
Dr. Bombay is the ladies choice
Step on stage with the smoke from dry ice
Every time we bring it twice as nice
Now ease up bredren take an Excedrin
Only name check to rhyme is Tippi Hedron
I'm lookin' fine I'm gettin' much finer
Steady lounging in my Lazy Boy recliner
Losing it in traffic amped up on coffee
Like kids going wild after school for Mr. Softee
Like a slice around the corner uh its sneaking up on ya
Breathing down your neck it's creeping up on ya
