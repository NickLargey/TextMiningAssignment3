Yeah,
You know a nigga don't really wanna take his cool off her

Early in the morning
When she's all alone
I'm a take my time
Do it how we want it
Just to set the mood,
Girl I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Yeah (yeah)
She love the way I'm doing it
So good she wont put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name (whats that, whats that, whats that?)
My bitch
Hold up, hol' up, whoa there
Lets capture this moment if I hit than I own it
Marijua'moanin' every mornin'
And Patronin' girl, we grownin'
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on
Street lights on?
You know I got it going til it's

Early in the morning
When she's all alone
I'm a take my time
Do it how we want it
Just to set the mood girl I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play
The long way, the strong way
It's our day, it's our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up,
Talk to the, talk to the, hand
Bitch you talking to a grown ass man
'itch like way way way too much in your pants for us not to make the bed squeak
(There goes the bed sheets)
Everybody rip the swag off
'Fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off, 'cause I'm rappin' my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it, the fucking anthem

Early in the morning
When she's all alone
I'm a take my time
Do it how we want it
Just to set the mood girl I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play
The long way, the strong way
It's our day, it's our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

I don't really wanna uh talk too much
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when ya blazin'
And I swear you turn at least half Asian
And we 'bout to have a liaison
She cool, get head with her shades on
You should just go and throw a cape on
And it's just so amazin'
So amazin'
So amazin'

Take it to the car, bloop, bloop,
That shit look like I'm speed racing
Leave 'em with me, it'll boost your reputation
Westside is where I'm stationed
Spend all night, just champagne tasting
Ain't no rush girl, lets just pace it til its

Early in the morning
When she's all alone
I'ma take my time
Do it how we want it
Just to set the mood girl I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play
The long way, the strong way
It's our day, it's our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
