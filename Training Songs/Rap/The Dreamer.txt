For the world world world
My name is Common, No I.D

Ferrari testers, Armani dressers
Exquisite thick bitches that body bless us
Rest assured, we getting festive in Miami now
Told my nigga 'Ye I'm about to win the Grammys now
Getting Johnny Cash old white folks know me now
Standing close to the mic like I'm Kobe now
We celebrate the (?), they hate because we got love
It's the pop life, a lot of faces pop up
Known to tear the club and the block up
Going through the airport with more lie than an opera
Knew crooks who move books like Harry Potter
Get cleaners to get it cleaner
A legend like John, Lennon, I'm a dreamer
Tried to f*ck the world she only let me finger
Mind trips to Medina to visit the redeemer
A hero, I'll drop out like Hiroshima
Off sangria with two broads at La Esquina
Still opening Rose for (?)
I'm a dreamer

It's for the world world world world world
Dream on

We take, uh, we make, uh, paper
And build skyscrapers
Walking on water, building my faith up
Niggas with no heart, I'm the pace maker
Get the beat from No I, feel the pulse of the Chi
Survival of the fit with hope in they eye
Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding
They notes from the most high, so I gotta land them
Career ain't random, make anthems, streets chant them
Rock roles like a phantom
Mad hoes like they throwing tantrums
I tell them I need space like Richard Branson
Dancing, with (?) and stars getting full at bars
And then pass out like a pamphlet
Never taking Grants for granted
It's Common, I'm high above standard
Fly nigga, keep my feet planted
To rock the planet, I don't stop for panic
Maybe I'm a hopeless hip-hop romantic
I'm a dreamer

It's for the world world world world world
Dream on

He introduced me, I stepped to the podium
Said peace, gave thanks to the holy one
Put my water up, thought about my daughter for a second
The youth, the living resurrection
Reflections of the sun glaring through the window
Now the audience staring at my mental
Feeling like the world, the world is at my fingers
'Bout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers
Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
To be like the king that sang Billie Jean
Now it's gold records, and I'm on silver screens
At the mountaintop, you still gotta dream
To the dreamers

If I dream you're here
And you dream I'm there
We'll be no where near
You should just come here
If I wake you up
Only difference is
You can live the dream
Just believe in it
