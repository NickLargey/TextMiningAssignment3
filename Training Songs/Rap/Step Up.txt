What we be tellin' these cats? 
Yo yo, step up, nigga
Step up 
All them niggaz out there
Tellin' on all them niggaz violatin' step up

Yo, yo from the Himalayas to the pyramids of Egypt
Pace Won flow is dumb as Forest Gump weeded
Lynch Mob's, Hit Squad's then I freak with
More gold diggers than E or PMD did
(Ha!) Word like so many hoochies on my penis
By the time I'm twenty-nine I have more Suns than Phoenix
Watch the man bust, pose for the cameras
And have reporters running/back like Barry Sanders
(Yo!) My habits is spray paint and rap fresh
Pace Won gets more bank than NatWest
Walkin' round thinkin' what face to slap next
Like Latifah my Wrath is Madness
Ho-ha, more smooth than Billy D.
Drinkin' Colt forty-five eyes slant like Philippines
Serve the base heads, my raps kill the fiends
That want to MC but don't know what it means

[Chorus]
People want to act large but can't take charge
I tell 'em step up
Yo yo, kids ask me for advice Pace on how to be nice
I tell 'em step up
Yo yo, if I see your sister cryin' or fallin' behind
I tell her step up
Yo yo, if you don't need your teeth and your crew want beef
Then you can step up

Yo yo, bring 'em all, yo-yo

Since my small days always been real
With raps that's more fat/phat than that ass on Kim Fields
I'm roastin' roaches, poets think I'm Moses
Partin' oceans, people feel me like emotions
A poet and truth, I roll with the jewels
Voice of the youth (uh) one a ya diehard boys that'll shoot
Keep my rep up, rappers want somethin' tell 'em step up

[Chorus]

Yo yo, you look soft, I hook off and kick butt
Attack like Hitler, if your boys weak avoid me like I was thicker
Rollin' with the rich kids
Slick like the mac of the year, I know bitches
They bite you, scratch you, kick you in the groin
A two-headed coin that be makin' people point (look)
And talk soft, but I walked off, I'll remember
Defender of my people, makin' legal tender
Got it made, no more goin' to court now
I'm out doin' the world while my brother hold the fort down
He said, "Pace slit the wrist if the cross you"
When your hands are tied, you're only doin' what your forced to
Don't hate the Pace Won just cause my records sellin'
Find a playa hater and I tell I'm

[Chorus]
