I heard a rumour, nows the start
Somethings changing in your heart
And you been watching me the way that you did
So I flipped, you should of told me
I heard you speaking to a friend
How that feelings back again
How you got my number undercover
So much more than friends

But I always thought someone else you were missing
Girl, he's your man,
Now its me that your wishing
I look in your eyes,
Tell me now what are you gonna do?
I need to know its really true

My, my, my, saw the signs, couldnt pick a better time
I heard a rumour that your feeling me
Let us just rewind, one more time
You said that you want to be mine
I heard a rumour that you're feeling me

Midnight calling to my phone
I hear you breathe and then the tone
So every night you're creepin' while he's slippin'
Come lets get it on

But I always thought someone else you were missing
But you had this plan now you man your deceiving
I look in your eyes,
Tell me now what are you gonna do?
I need to know its really true
