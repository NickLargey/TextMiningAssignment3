How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace young n****, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie, if I told ya that I never thought of death
My n****, we the last ones left
But life goes on

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace young n****, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie, if I told ya that I never thought of death
My n****, we the last ones left
But life goes on

As I bail through tha empty halls
Breath stinkin' in my drawls
Ring, ring, ring, quiet y'all, incoming call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by

It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller, alcohol and booty calls
We used to do them as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, Loc'ed out and blazed the weed
Get on the roof let's get smoked out and blaze with me

Two in the morning and we still high a**ed out
Screamin thug till I die before I pa**ed out
But now that you are gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone but now ya gone

And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them n****s to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessey
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that a** when you pa**ed
'Cause life goes on

Yeah n****, I got the word as hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's getten' old

Plus with the drama we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Taken risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at chill parties

Me and you no true a two
While scheming on hits and gettin' tricks
That maybe we can slide into
But now you burried, rest n**** 'cause I ain't worried

Eyes bluried, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade, I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball till my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace
Thug till I die

Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know from way before
Kiss me from my head to my toe

Give me a paper and pen
So I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin incase I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we outlaws let me ride

Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my n****s from old blocks from old crews
N****s that guided me through back in the old school

Pour out some liquor have a toast for the homies
See we both gotta die but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you are gone
You left your n**** on his own, how long we mourn
Life goes on

Life goes on, homie
Gone on 'cause they pa**ed away
N****s doin' life
N****s doin' 50 and 60 years and s***

I feel ya n****, trust me, I feel ya
You know what I mean
Last year we poured out liquor for you
This year n****, life goes on
We're gonna clock now

Get money, evade b****es, evade tricks
Give players plenty space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Next time you see your n****s

Your gonna be on top n****
They gonna be like, goddamn, them n****s came up
That's right, baby life goes on
And we up out this b****

Hey Kato, Mental
Y'all n****s make sure it's poppin' when we get up there
Don't front
