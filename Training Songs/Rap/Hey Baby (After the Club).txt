And daydreamin' you,

With just me and you,
If you feel it too, then say (oh)

Spinnin' clouds, and usually I would be leanin'
Now I believe everything happens for a reason
'Cause what I feel with you and me got me believing

'Cause when I looked at you

So what are we gonna do
'Cause I'm feelin' like I wanna leave with you, hey
Whatchu wanna do
'cause I wanna leave with you
