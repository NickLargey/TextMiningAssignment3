Ay, ay
Oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
It's like
Oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
We sayin'
Oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
We got some old Jay Zs, couple ODBs
Place 'em up in perfect order 'cause my OCD won't let me keep it

Well let me keep it
I never speak it
Keep it a secret
It'd be peak if any geezer would hear it and then repeat it
So we keep it
Keep it out of reach of all the eejits
If you need it
Best believe it, you won't see it
Locked up in my room
Deep cocoon, like you're digging in crates
Already done with your digging, so your digging is bait
Keeping it straight
Buzzing 'til late
Sample the greats
Then we move onto the groove
Grabbing that sample at eight
Seconds, luke beckons
Smooth like new weapons
If I do step it
True repping with true brethrens
Ruth, Lou's getting too loose
Look whose crepping all
Tunes through Jimi to Zeppelin
Now who reckons, you knew
You're rocking with a master of this
Manoeuvre blasts fast 'cause we're hard to resist
Blitz like it was vital
Recited my recital
One back in the snapple
The snap, the crackle of the vinyl
Sweet onto repeat
Chris is chopping a beat
Flipping these verses like the burgers on the grill at Bodean's
We keep it mean
Pristine, cleaner than clean
Harbour these harmonies
Like we're speaking to Jean
It's like

‘Cause this the rap he brings the pads to the lab
The lab is my pad, we’re using every session to jam
Working on my revolutionary revenue plan
But currently without the green, like a recession in 'Dam
So we scribble on the daily making beats for 'em
Create ancient plastic discs and playlists
That your parents used to play with
Quick and very painless
Stumbled onto rap, always been sick my very name is
Now I’m quick to leave you brainless
You anus
You Ignoramus
Just let me say this
Not the greatest - but gimme space kid, I’m set to make it
So basically we’re bringing it back to basics
Rocking hi-hats and big kicks that are the latest trend
It’s a statement, but when you put this fashion aside
This rap music is a passion of mine, lifeline
'Cause I designed the Illest rhymes
Chillin', time keeps tickin'
But I'm high
Keep spittin' and flippin' rhythms to vibe, like

Oh please, we ain't got no P's

It’s like sixteen bars in sixteen minutes
I kill it
Extinguish all the fire from the liars and the gimmicks
Losing spirit
Bredders putting cheddar over lyrics
Then diminish any vision when they clear it
I hear it, it's happening
Moving like they’re mannequins
Dressed by other brothers
Hiding under covers with mothers be panicking
Rambling
Gassing like they’re Anakin
But red and blue lights are out of sight
On the mic - stop damaging
Your honour and your pride
I, goner from the side
Never dippin' from the rhythm
Flow specific when I rhyme
Sometime tell the flack and back, a slap
To any cracker jack who be slacking his mac
I’m on the track and in my prime
Ease your mind if ya hold it
Time if you chose it
Keep your spine straighter then a blind homophobic
Ease your mind - if you hold it
Time if you chose it
And keep your spine straight tonight (‘night ‘night)
