Troublesome,
Nineteen muthaf***in' 96'
West side, let it be known, n****
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

Menacin' methods label me a lethal weapon
Making n****s die, witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan to be the man in this wicked land
Under handed hits are planned, scams are plotted over grams of rock
Undercover agents die by the random shots, we all die in the end

So revenge, I swore, I was all about my ends, f*** friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my, my heata
Got me a dog, named him Mobb B**** N**** Eata
What could they do to me that little brat? S*** them, n****s

That shot me and still terrified I'll get their a**, how can I show you
How I feel inside? We outlawz motherf***as, can't kill my pride
N****s, talk a lot of s*** but that's after I'm gone 'cause they fear me
In physical form, let it be known, I'm troublesome

All ya n****s die, put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, troublesome, I know what time it is
Call the punk police please, they can't stop us n****s run the streets

Troublesome, gutter ways my mentality is ghetto
We're guerrillas in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor bet on bomb on them first n****s
We came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry bustin' all freely screaming f***

All y'all n****s in Swahili, pistol packin' fresh out of jail
I ain't goin' back, release me to care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like candy man, bet I roll on your a**
Like an avalanche, a soul survivor, learned to get high
And pull drive bys, murder my foes, can't control my nine

Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta a** motherf***as tried to flee, picture me lettin'
This chump survive, redin' up on his a** when I'm doped
He die, 'cause I'm troublesome

All ya n****s, die young, strapped and I don't give a f***
I'm hopeless, I live a thug life loosin' my focus, baby
I'm troublesome, bad boy killa, there is no one realla
What you saw was the rough, rugged and raw, outlaw

Murder, murder my mind states s*** ain't change
Since my last rhyme, the crime rate ain't decline
N****s bustin' shots like they lost their mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed their mind
Tell me young n**** never learned a thang

Dead at thirteen 'cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers but how can I cry
Tried to warn the little n****, either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak, I scream
Afraid to sleep I'm havin' crazy dreams

Vivid pictures of my enemies and family times
God to forgive me 'cause it's wrong but I plan to die
You can take me to heaven and understand I was a G
Did the best I could, raised in insanity or send me to hell
'Cause I ain't beggin' for my life, ain't nothing worse
Than this cursed a** hopeless life, I'm troublesome

All ya n****s die in your wildest dreams
You couldn't picture a n**** like me, I'm troublesome
