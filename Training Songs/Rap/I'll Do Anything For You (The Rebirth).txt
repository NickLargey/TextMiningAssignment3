(Pst, pst, turn up the music)

Nothing in the world that I wont do
I'll give the world to you if you want me to
I'll do anything
Ah nothing in the world that I wont do
I'll give the world to you if you want me to
I'll do anything

I'll do anything for you
I'll give the world to you
If you want me to
I'll do anything for you
I'll give the world to you
If you want me to

They think I'm a fool
'Cause I do so many things (for you)
But they don't know the reason
Why I do all the things I do (for you)
Maybe they'll never see, the things you do for me
The way you make me strong,
Whenever things go wrong
When you stand by my side,
How you relax my mind
And show me what to do
To make my dreams come true.

(I'll do anything)
Anything you want me to
(I'll do anything)
There's nothing in this world that I wont do
(for you)

I'll do anything for you, 
Anything you want me to
I'll give the world to you
If you want me to
I'll do anything for you (Yes I will)
I'll give the world to you
If you want me to

I hope very soon,
You'll see all the love I have (for you)
I've been holding some inside,
'Cause I thought it was too much (for you)
Whatever happens I, I will no longer hide,
Because I trust in you
Stay right by my side,
'Cause you relax my mind,
And show me what to do,
You make my dreams come true

(I'll do anything, I'll do anything)
There's nothing in this world that I won't do (for you)

I'll do anything for you 
Anything you want me to
I'll give the world to you
If you want me to (Yes I will)
I'll do anything for you
I'll give the world to you
If you want me to

I'll do (I'll do anything)
I'll do (I'll do anything)
I'll do do do do do do do do
Anything for you

I'll do (I'll do anything)
