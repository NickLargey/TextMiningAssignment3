Talking Ma
I know the situation is personal
But it's something that has to be told
As I was making this beat
You was all I could think about
You heard my voice...

Verse 1:

Just think just think
What if you could just
Just blink your self away
Just just wait just pause for a second
Let me plead my case
It's the late 70's, huh
You seventeen, huh
And having me that will ruin everything, huh
It's a lot of angels waiting on they wings
You see me in your sleep so you can't kill your dreams
Three hundred dollars that's the price of living, what?
Mommy I don't like this clinic
Hopefully you'll make the right decision
And don't go through with the knife decision
But it's hard to make the right move
When you in high school
How you gotta work all day and take night school
Hopping off the bus when the rain is pouring
What you want:
Morning sickness or the sickness of mourning?

Chorus:

I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul Know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live? Can I live?

I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul Know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live? Can I live?

Verse 2:

I'm a child of the king
Ain't no need to go fear me
And I see them flowing tears so I know that you hear me
When I move in your womb that's me being scary
Cause who knows what my future holds
Yo the truth be told you ain't told a soul
Yo you ain't even showing I'm just 2 months old
Through your clothes try to hide me deny me
Went up 3 sizes
Your pride got you lying saying ain't nothing but a migraine
It ain't surprising you not trying to be in WIC food lines
Your friends will look at you funny but look at you mommy
That's a life inside take a look at your tummy
What is becoming ma I'm Oprah bound
You can tell he's a star from the ultrasound
Our spirits connected doors open now
Nothing but love and respect 
Thanks for holding me down 
She let me live 

(Chorus)

It's uplifting fo'real y'all
I ain't passing no judgement
Ain't making no decisions
I am just telling ya'll my story
I love life
I love my mother for giving me life
We all need to appreciate life
A strong woman that had to make a sacrifice
Thanks for listening
Thanks for listening
Mama thanks for listening
