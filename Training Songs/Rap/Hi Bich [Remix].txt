Oh my God, Ronny

White J’s, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi bitch, hi bitch
Hi bitch, hi bitch
I do not sniff it or roll it “no”
It do not drip when I pour it “no”
I do not run, I reload it
I do not save it, I throw it

White J’s, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi bitch, hi bitch
Hi bitch, hi bitch

Lil’ nigga, got bands in my pocket
You lil’ niggas broke, all that flexing, just stop it
I cop me an Audi, that top, I’ma drop it
I pick up your bitch, now them panties keep dropping
I’ll f*ck a nigga’s bitch on a Sunday
One night, then I pass her back Monday
Lil’ nigga want smoke, then it’s gunplay
Caught him in the field, left him on the runway

We packing, you lacking, you talking, so bitch
Yeah we finna get on that
That pistol be hot, it go in slow motion
That blower, you know it got blow back
I’m sticking you up, bro taking you down
Since you flexing like you got that
We run through the back, get hit with this Mac
We got guns like it’s Baghdad

Ayy, ayy “hi bitch”
She ain’t got FaceTime, I’ma Skype it
Get her head one time, tell her, “Bye, bitch”
Drop an all white Bentley on my right wrist
I might take her on the jet if I like it
Side bitch, Kylie
If I dick her one time, what she gon’ buy me?
Come straight out the sky like I’m E.T
F*ck that, bitch, my pinky ring 3D
Young CEO, I could sign ya
Quarter mil’ on my neck, I’ma blind ya
Cut her off, she ain’t having no purpose
Bitch bad, still buying no purses

White J’s, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi bitch, hi bitch
Hi bitch, hi bitch

Bitches deceased
Smoking on dick, she not better than me
Pop out, lil’ birdie, you speak with a beak
Send your location, then Uber to me
Bitches been hanging diamonds on my face
Kick her to the curb, she ain’t gang anyway
Asian on the beat, then the beat gets slayed
I took it offensive, so watch what you say
Hi bitch, got a .30, don’t try it
Ball out the mall, I’m like Kobe, just buy shit
Sick of these bitches, they lie quick
Clip shoot a movie, now talkers, directors, you dying
Send her ass on a hike
I don’t wanna kick it with her, bitch for the hype
Real pretty, beat her ass in a street fight
You know I’m flyer than these hoes like a pink kite, Doll!

Bitch, you mad, ho
Why you so mad ho?

Ho don’t wanna try me, yeah that’s on my mama’s chromosome
Commas run on 10, since I run it up
Never wanna line up, I don’t do McDonald’s
F*ck, crazy you know I’m breaking necks when I’m pulling up “skrrt”
All my numbers looking outrageous
Now the blogs handing out praises
Got the world using my phrases
Hoes keep my name in their mouth
Hope it tastes like shit when they say it “don’t say my name, bitch”
Barring out, I ain’t got Xans in me, no
Young but I’m balling like a damn CEO
Bentley truck, said don’t give a f*ck
Came from the street, boy and beef shit, they know what’s up
Bitches that hold no position
Come at me, fall in my mentions
Hoes be thirsty for attention
Knock a ho out this dimension
Then continue my ascension “why you so mad?”
How you hoes living with no purpose?
I be putting venom in my verses
Bitch you worthless, you ain’t fucking with my worst shit
Doubted me, now it’s all coming together like cursive “like cursive, bitch”
$50k a show, I’m doing 30 of ’em
5 million by the summer, keep the numbers running
Bitches showing everything, I be understunting “damn”
Understanding your regard, really had nothing “shit”
Shit, but now I’m breaking records and I’m making history “wow”
How can they stop me? I swear it’s a mystery
Parents so sick of me, shouts to their misery
Let your kids listen to me!
How I do me if you was on a slow day
And I ain’t gotta go to school like a snow day
But my, in the stu so it’s okay
Bank account look like a lick
Broke ho, you look like you sick
Slide on the beat like it’s slick
Bitch don’t compare me to Iggy
That old ho is washed and I’m lit
Wouldn’t pay her to wash up my whip
Bye broke bitch, bye ho
