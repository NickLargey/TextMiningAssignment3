The pop wars, temp rising a hot boy
Is the fat boy, skinny ties
Don't empty mine nigga
Tall ceilings, chandeliers, I'm authentic
Gettin' long money, short winded
Lets go and get it nigga
Bang bang, bitch niggas kept drinkin' shades from that double M
Get shot in your finger waves
Twenty chickens watchin' and I still be movin' the base
Gave a job to the children you scared to raise
Chain swangin', name rangin'
Shots fired, same nigga
We movin' weight I'm at a different base
I'm out in Haiti with my lady screamin' La Boule
I'm hard to kill, Dade county, Versace kneel
Fourteen first told what that dollar bill
Only one man got the combination to the safe
Grammy nominated once but I'm still movin' base

See them plaques on a nigga wall
And we still movin' base
Got them records jumpin' out the store
And we still movin' base
Coppas tried to knock us off
And we still movin' base
Haters throwin' shots through a nigga door
And we still movin' base

Fallin' from the sky, the money bag get bigger
Angels tatted all on me, pray for a lord sinner
Rolls Royce Corniche, sweepin' me off my feet
New bitches they by the fleet and we do em' all by the week
Taz' angels just wanna chill, jewelers just wanna meet
Weed man expensive, three trips a week
Misses just wanna freak, feds stay up the street
Know they tellin' this close so we leak what we wanna leak
My marbles chalked with some Farrahkhan
In the house of the lord, my niggas bearin' arms
His eyes wide, nose runny got what he geekin' for
I'm movin' base, we outta state you know my speakers low
Put the pistol to your mouth now show me to the safe
Grammy nominated once, but I'm still movin' base

See them plaques on a nigga wall
And we still movin' base
Got them records jumpin' out the store
And we still movin' base
Coppas tried to knock us off
And we still movin' base
Haters throwin' shots through a nigga door
And we still movin' base

You see the plaques on the wall but the yayo still in the spot
See me cousin off to college, I see that it costs alot
Tallons fillin' the jammy Miami still in my heart
Niggas playin' the corner, guess their playin' their part
Early coppin' the coupes, ladies stay on our feet
Your brother went to the duplex
Smell the =dope from across the street
Hoodies come in all flavors, all black if you think you're sweet
Arab sellin' grenades by the box, you'll get it cheap
Schoolin' the little niggas, kilos all in the campus
A passport is necessary Ibiza with all the rappers
I be's with all the real captains, head shops for some tobacco (Bacco)
PR-80 just a plus don't mention the dust
R-O-C double M kill anything we touch

See them plaques on a nigga wall
And we still movin' base
Got them records jumpin' out the store
And we still movin' base
Coppas tried to knock us off
And we still movin' base
Haters throwin' shots through a nigga door
And we still movin' base
