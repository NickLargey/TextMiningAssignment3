Leave the club about six in the mornin
Fill of hypnotic at six in the mornin
Still got the top down at six in the mornin
On my way to the IHOP with these three red bones
Head out to the suburbs
Big house in the hills
Tonight a pool party
Players in the hills
Girl I got what you want holla back
Holla back
If you got what I need holla back
Holla back
Shaking up bottles of Cris
Spread 'em on chicks
Contest for the nicest shh
Said this party will be the talk for years to come
So lets blow them up you know how we do

[Chorus:]
This is how we do, when we are off up in the club
This is what we drink, when we are off up in the club
This is how we party up in the club, when we are off up in the club
This is what we do when we are off up in the club

[Joe Budden]
Mami, you want to holla
I can spot you out the corner of your eye that tell you want to ride,
You lookin at papi like uhhh
Want to hold hands
No amp, no man, Joe can
But you and your friend can both get rammed like uhh
You's a private dancer
Low riders, when she walk pulling her pants up
Its all good baby
You know where I'm at right
In case you need me to come put it on your backside
Only if you act right
Dammit you doing it
Doing what you're doing
You're doing it to me
I picture you doing it to me like uhh
I only came out because I'm here to find ya
After the bars last call
Be at the nearest dinner
We be Nextel taggin
SL wagon
You grabbin the whip
Just off of that XL magnum
Damn it you're doing it
You and your friend
Next weekend if you're lucky we can do it again
Like uhhh

Up in the club
Where we do things like
Throw our hands up (Oh yeah)
All kinds of drinks are
Off in the cups
All of my thugs (All of my thugs)
Hunnies show me love
DJ playin the cuts (Ladies show me love)
