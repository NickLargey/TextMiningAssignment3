There are lots of signs in life
Some that you may not like
You could be livin this minute â?¦
And next minute you're gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by your worst, you will get paid

True, you can move food on the street
Did a bitta that, got bored of that
Didn't move the brown or the crack
Use to pick up for the fact
I could make more back by breaking down to scores n that
Stack to buy out the stores n that
Didn't give a shit about loads of that
But I did give a shit about getting locked up
Or get boxed up, sentenced you'll get about 4 for that
Crap, you ain't so rich now
I bet you feel like a prick now
Coz where's all your fancy shit now
Where's your whips, chicks and your bits now
Shit, you should have fixed up
F*ck drugs, the mic you should have picked up
And it was all for the big bucks
Now you're sitting in a cell doing sit ups
Look I told you this shit's fucked
The ghetto lifestyle's too much
If I bust, be proud of me
You can't take it out of me
So I'm a bit stuck
But, I got too much to lose now
Love my life, and I don't wanna lose out
I'm still about, I'm home sweet home
In the ends, like I don't wanna move out
I'm too bad

There are lots of signs in life
Some that you may not like
You could be livin this minute â?¦
And next minute you're gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by your worst, you will get paid

Look, you can do moves on the street
Id rather spit bars on the beat
Id rather that than nick cars every week
But jack is when I split scars with the heat
So I'm solo like the guitars and the beat
But this rhyming shit is for me
I live this, drink this, eat this, shit this
And I've even writ bars in my sleep
But I ain't on hype, I've had enough phase
Ghetto's probably inside, hope he bust K's
That undergrounds like roll this, a tough race
You can be living this minute, then gone again like mum you was right
And I was wrong again
But I'm strong again
Still moved on again
Ten more minutes and I writ another song again
If I can do it, you can I'm a true fan
Up and coming MC's big up you man
The doors open but I ain't through man
I'm'a ball through like a cue dan
Watch me, ain't gonna let no-one stop me
UK I'm gonna break you properly
And If you ain't gonna watch me do that, move back
Who's that? K-A â?¦ I knew that
And I know its not easy, and I know what you're feeling
Just believe me

There are lots of signs in life
Some that you may not like
You could be livin this minute â?¦
And next minute you're gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by your worst, you will get paid

There are lots of signs in life
Some that you may not like
You could be living this minute
And next minute you're gone away

I fear my safety, I fear I'm bait, but I can't put my skills to waste
Because if you're living by the gun you surely will get blazed
I still gon' blaze, refuse to smoke my life away
Refuse to die before I try then put the mic away
This life of K, is just one big hype for praise
Right, night, record then start to write okay
But I'm just saying, back on hype of Kane
But only I'm to blame
Today I saw the signs that came, and it's got a good look
But that's life they say, crime pays
And Ill stop crime whenever this grime decides to pay
But grime ain't making me mill's
So I'm picking up a 9 today
And spittin' ain't getting me deals
But this shits just getting real

There are lots of signs in life
Some that you may not like
You could be livin this minute â?¦
The next minute you're gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by your worst, you will get paid

There are lots of sugns in life
Some that you may not like
You could be living this minute
And next minute your gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by worst, you will get paid
