Hello
Hey baby
Hey look
Dinner will be ready at 8
If your not gonna be on time
Call me okay
I know I know
But you know how you sometimes forget to call
Then I be worried

Dinner date
Always late
Didn't get a phone call
I cook 
Clean 
Pay bills
Still I make it home
What's going on boy
Between me and you
We don't talk no more
Kiss no more
Don't know what to do
But

I don't want to fight no more
Stayin up at night no more
This ain't feelin right no more
Let me know, can we work it out? (Can we work it out)
I don't want to hurt no more
This ain't gonna work no more
Want to make love no more (I don't want to make love no more)
Let me know
Can we work it out

We both know that
When we fight no body wins
If I give in 
Will you give in
So we can make amends
There's sometimes when I feel rough
Makes me want to cry
I'm willin to put away my pride
I want to make it right

I don't want to fight no more
Stayin up at night no more
This ain't feelin right no more
Let me know, can we work it out? (Can we work it out)

This ain't gonna work no more
Want to make love no more (I don't want to make love no more)
Let me know
Can we work it out

I don't want to fight no more
Stayin up at night no more
This ain't feelin right no more
Let me know, can we work it out? (Can we work it out)
I don't want to hurt no more
This ain't gonna work no more
Want to make love no more (I don't want to make love no more)
Let me know

I don't want to fight no more
Stayin up at night no more
