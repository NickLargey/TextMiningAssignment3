Time keeps slipping, keeps slipping
Time, time keeps slipping
Time, time keeps slipping
Time, time keeps slipping

Yo, the only thing Major don't waste is time in bed
My time is rare, take time, time to prepare
No time for fear, how many times I said it this year?
At what time ya going to realize that time is near?

Call a time out, Scritti Politti, major climb down
The cracks of the streets waste no time on beats
Mos' Def, most definitely the rap chief
The new release, time to make cream, time to take a piece

And at the same time, time to rebuild, time is rilla
I swear I bring the heat, the tracks to Val Kilmer
You know that time waits for no man, in time you'll see
That you're wasting all you time while you're watching TV

And yo' Scritti, I'm on it like walls to graffiti
From night sticks, to plungers, to NYPD
From Lucille BB King, you've seen me rhyme
You stay away from drama if it's wasting your time

The time tables keep turning from Tinseltown
You've got the both ends burning up to the Boogiedown
(Time, time keeps slipping)
They play for time and work for spaces

The time tables keep turning and clocks are wound
You've got the both ends burning up and worked around
(Time, time keeps slipping)
And in their prime they change their faces

Yeah, from Boogiedown to the Tinseltown I had em' all gettin' down
My baggage claim's got exotic names, I get around
How I'm livin' now, well that's a whole lot different now
From where I'm sitting now, got a whole clearer vision now

I played the tables hard, wild cards I was flipping now
My partners hittin' pounds, somewhere up in prison now
I'm flippin' high, things switch and change so suddenly
The way you act today is tomorrow's where you wanna be

You company shifts when you start livin' comfortably
Spotlights switch and then you dip right from under me
Don't front for me, I want to be perfectly clear
Time is here, I'm keepin' yesterday in the rear

A current affair, Mos' Def and Lee Majors appear
Bout to write this little ditty with the Scritti, you hear
And it's about that time, so if you could be then would you
Sit back and look at who time's bein' good to

The time tables keep turning from Tinseltown
You've got the both ends burning up to the Boogiedown
(Time, time keeps slipping)
They play for time and work for spaces

The time tables keep turning and clocks are wound
You've got the both ends burning up and worked around
(Time, time keeps slipping)
And in their prime they change their faces

At one time I thought I had it all, mass of broads
Flash awards, cash cards, time's a double-edged sword
One day you hear applause, next day when you leave
You catch a L in the see like Christopher Reeves

Do you all believe that these cats threw dirt on my name?
Give 'em time, they couldn't win if I gave 'em point game
At times I used to swerve, now I'm learning my lane
Trapped in time, what a shame with nobody to blame

I waits for no one and fat and slow ones, the rich no funs
The Samurai's and Shoguns, the first stringer no runs
Ayyo gun, you'd better hope to it or you blow, son
This time keeps slipping, make no difference if you don't come

It's bein' well recorded how we advise we
Get on our game and spend these moments wisely
It's time to make chase, give pace, no time to waste
First you on, then you gone so long, you been replaced

The time tables keep turning from Cali High
You've got the both ends burning up to the do or die
(Time, time keeps slipping)
They set their hearts and fix their courses

The time tables keep turning and dreams of dreams
You've got the both ends burning up of how it seems
(Time, time keeps slipping)
They steel themselves, they are resources

The time tables keep turning from Tinseltown
You've got the both ends burning up to the Boogiedown
(Time, time keeps slipping)
They play for time and work for spaces

The time tables keep turning and clocks are wound
You've got the both ends burning up and worked around
(Time, time keeps slipping)
And in their prime they change their faces

The time tables keep turning
You've got the both ends burning up
And all the lies you've been learning
To keep the future on hold

The time tables keep turning
You've got the both ends burning up
And all the lies you've been learning
To keep the future on hold
