Woke up, oh yeah!

Don't speak 'bout no numbers I let the bank tell 'em
Alexander McQueen, a pair of Magalis (Saucey)
An Aventador in white, look like a marshmallow (Saucey)
Drive way stupid, look like a car dealer
High school, six figures, got 'em sick hospital
Broke niggas always calling hoes gold diggers
She hold money and you don't, don't blame the hoe nigga
We be rocking rollies we just got to show niggas
Why you out here stuntin' and you still owe niggas?
And K. Michelle that's my dawg from the city
But on the low, I'm still tryna hit it, Ayune!

I keep a couple racks tucked off in the bag
Label me a villian when it comes to the swag
Louie V luggage, got the towels and rags
And my garage like a zoo, I'm taming horses and jags, uh
Now wipe me off, now wipe down
'Cause I know you hatin bitches don't like me
I'm the one all the gossip stay talking bout
Baddest bitch, biggest whip in the parking lot
And I ain't never going broke 'cause imma chase that money
You might see me in the hood for the corporate honey
Counting cooperate money
Dinner gowns and tuxedos
Eating sheppard bed meals, cashing big burritos
Big dinero, rich money don't sleep
I got to have it every day of the week
Rich Bitch Problems, I don't wanna solve 'em
Ten yachts by each other, yeah Bitch I own all of 'em
'Cause I'm rich

Don't care if you don't like me
'Cause I'm rich
Don't care if you don't like me
