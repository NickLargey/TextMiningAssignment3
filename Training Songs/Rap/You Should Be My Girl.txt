Ladies and gentlemen

You and me girl we could do the thang
You and me girl we could do the thang
You and me girl we could do the thang
We could do the thang
We could do the thang

I know she like me I kinda dig it
So I did my thang for her she joinin' wit me
Now we gettin' groovy hotter than jacuzzi
So shorty want you slow it down
I see them otha fellas and I ain't hatin'
They try to do it like me it ain't the same
Front to back shorty side to side and lean wit it
(You wit a solja now)

Cus you so fly gurl
You should come to my crib
But he gone flip
If he knew you were here
I know I'm trippin' but

[Chorus]
You should be my gurl gurl gurl gurl
(You should be my gurl ) (we could do the thang)
(You and me gurl)(we could do the thang) you should be my gurl gurl gurl gurl
(You should be my gurl)(we could do the thang)
(You and me gurl we could do the thang) you should be my gurl

Its all ova town and we we get into it
If that's the business
We should keep on doin' it
Oooh you so grown wit it you betta gone wit it
I luv the way you break it down
I gotta jones for you
All in my bones for you
Wakin' up three o'clock in the mone for you
I neva sweat you baby
But if you let me baby
Know that Ima put it down

Cus you so fly gurl
You should come to my crib
But he gone flip
If he knew you were here
I know I'm trippin' but

[Chorus]

You and me gurl we could do the thang
Put you in the Chevy let you grip wood grain
Put you in the range wit some apple bottom jeans
House of deron' and some channel frames
Got you on the celly got you callin' Sharmane
Got you ridin good got you poppin' champagne
Got you ridin' dirty got you throwin' up the A
Got ya lil niece callin' semi all day
Chirpin' on my Nextel on my two way
Sendin' cute messages about dat face
Said you was grown told me dat you didn't play
And every since then it's been all like A
You and me girl we could do the thang
Tell them who yo man tell 'em why you bling bling
Tell 'em that your good
Tell 'em that it ain't the same
Tell 'em Sean Paul told you money ain't a thang

Cus you so fly gurl
You should come to my crib
But he gone flip
If he knew you were here
I know I'm trippin' but

[Chorus]
