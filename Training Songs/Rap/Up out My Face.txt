It's not chipped
We're not cracked
Oh, we're shattered
Eh, eh, eh
Oh na, na, na, na

I thought we had something special
We had something good
But I should have had another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walking by you
Boy don't you even speak
Pretend you on the sofa
And I'm on the TV
Might see me on a poster
See me at a show
But you won't see me for free
Boy this ain't no promo

No shame now
Wherever you be laying
You can stay now
Got to board the BBJ
And put the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from your mama's house

When I break I break boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break

You ain't never gonna feel this thing again
You gon' get a lot of calls 'cause I CC-ed all your friends (I break)
I ain't walking around all mopey and sad
Take a look at my bags baby (I break, when I break I break)

So look who's crying now
Boohoo hoo
Talking about your missing your boo
And no you and getting it
I know you ain't hittin' it
No you ain't a rapper so you need to stop spitting it

Ah ha ah ah ah ah
You wondering who I'm messing while you ain't next to me
I'm going bye bye bye
So pay the consequences because you acted all ignorant

So you ashamed now
Wherever you be laying you can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down
On the plane now
And don't keep calling from your mama's house

When I break I break boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break

You ain't never gonna feel this thing again
You gon' get a lot of calls 'cause I CC-ed all your friends (I break)
I ain't walking around all mopey and sad
Take a look at my bags baby (when I break I break I break)

And no super glue can fix this shit
When I break I break I break
Not even a welder and a builder could rebuild this shit
When I break I break I break
Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic
Can fix this when I break, I break
If we were two Lego blocks
Even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010
Couldn't put us back together again

When I break boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break

You ain't never gonna feel this thing again
You gon' get a lot of calls 'cause I CC-ed all your friends (c'mon)
I ain't walking around all mopey and sad
Take a look at my bags baby ('cause when break baby baby I break)

When I break I break boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
