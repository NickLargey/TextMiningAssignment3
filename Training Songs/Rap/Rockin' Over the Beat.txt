Oh oh yeah 
Oh oh yeah 
Oh oh yeah 

Rollin' under the melody 
Rockin' over the beat 
As I'm chanting on the rhythm 
And make the whole sound sweet 
Not like candy 
You taste that say you can be 
Why MC oh you too good to be true 
And you agree 

Over and on and on and on and on and on and 
Over a song and all to all for all and all 

Get into the sound keep rollin' the tune 
Like rockin' on the track 
You just stand only for you 
Get into the sound keep rollin' the tune 
Like rockin' on the track 
You just stand only for you 

Over and on and on and on and on and on and 
Over a song and all to all for all and all 

He's for me and I for y'all
United we stand divided we fall 
One for all and all for one 
United we stand we'll get the job done 
He's for me and I for young 
United we stand divided we fall 
One for all and all for one 
United we stand we'll get the job done 

Oh oh yeah 
Oh oh yeah 
Oh oh yeah 

Rockin' to the beat turn it up 
Rockin' to the beat turn it up 

Rollin' under the melody 
Rockin' over the beat 
Rockin' rollin' under the melody 
And make the whole sound neat and sweet 
Yes from me to you 
You taste they say too good to be true 
All for all and all for one 
And you agree 

Get into the sound keep rollin' the tune 
Like rockin' on the track 
You just stand only for you 
Get into the sound keep rollin' the tune 
Like rockin' on the track 
You just stand only for you 

Rollin' under the melody 
Rockin' over the beat 
As I'm chanting on the rhythm 
And make the whole sound sweet 
Not like candy 
You taste that say you can be 
Why MC oh you too good to be true 
And you agree 

Over and on and on and on and on and on and 
All of your love they're there yeah

Get into the sound keep rollin' the tune 
Like rockin' on the track 
You just stand only for you
