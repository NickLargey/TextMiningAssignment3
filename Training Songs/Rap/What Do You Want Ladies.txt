Yea, what we got right here is a song for the ladies
You really know what you want

One, two, three, four Dream Warriors knockin at your front door

[Chorus]
Now what do you want? (I want a real man)
And what do you need? (I need a real man)
What do you want? (I want a real man)
What do you need? (I need a real man)

Let's get down to the statistics
I'm fantastic, ask any mystik
Mr Joe grind to who we only passed through
A strong man
I need a strong woman
To match a catch on any fishnet on the street
Or even inter-net
Secretary, I be the boss
Hundred dollar dinner's on me
See I can be kind and considerate
But don't even consider takin' advantage of me
I found sensitivity
In the dump, stuff
With the trash
So I grab you by your neck
And give your neck a tongue lash
I need a woman that's compatible with this man
I want a woman who can wear lingerie and keep the light on
And don't quit
And don't sop
'Cause that's the way we like it
Raw, like hip hop

[Chorus]

Well I'm the one
I'm the one who keep the sun shinin'
And sunshine from the back, or from behind
I'm guaranteed, with no flaw
I'm down by law
Close your jaw
Make love to you mind like its never been before
Bedroom floor, or in the hour for an hour
To hot to handle
To sweet to be sour
No exaggeration
I'll flip that wig
Sister, now you call me mister, big
Or you could just call me
If your lucky
Dial that seven digits, make you silly with that (?)
Spontaneous Warrior, go figure
I'll bash your next boyfriend who don't get the picture
Try to call, but I got a lock on the green
But all who diss this
Can kiss this
In their dreams

[Chorus]

So let's get down to the statistics
I'm fantastic, ask any mystik
Mr Joe grind to who we only passed through
A super man
So I need a strong woman
To match a catch for any fishnet on the street
Or even inter-net
Secretary, I be the boss
Hundred dollar dinners on me in the spot
And speakin' 'bout spots girls
I be hittin' these
Long before Luther brought girls to their knees
If you feel wet, we can go to somewhere drier
Turn you round
After the 5th round then retire
And keep it to yourself, but I know you's a lair
'Cause your girlfriend's tellin' me I'm flyer than a flyer

[Chorus]

So how you figure
You can get by a Warrior
We on every corner
Checkin' out the daughter
Never judge a book by its cover
You might get fooled if you come from outta town, honey
My love's sweeter than money, it ain't funny

[Chorus]

It's an MC's outro
It's an MC's outro
It's an MC's outro
The MC

Yea, given the shouts out to my man Darky, always keepin' it black
In the black man river, always keepin' it real, and keepin' the lyrics
Pumpin'
My man Cando, yea, cause he can
Riggs, Small X, keep them deals runnin'
Special vooduism, keep it deep
Q, keep the business rinnin', keep the chain links
My man Luv with the phat beats, like that girl right there
And this is Lu, yea, keepin' it real, and he rhymes a writers life
So ladies, who you want?
