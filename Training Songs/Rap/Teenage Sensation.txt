Lift up the loo and proceed
And get to a crew
To make your wind and bend
The mind is in a different space
Thinking of ways to unite the human race
How?
Move to the swing
When the coppers come I've got to do the whistling
Segregation's it's got to stop
And all ways coz I want to see credit
Because my music's for all
Young and the old
But it's true I want the nation to be wide
Put me on telly
And you'll soon seem fine
The music is a powerful force
Have used a lot of the power
On the teens before it gets worse

Some teenage sensation
Never say nothing in front of a virgin
One credit to the nation
Won't make an exception
Some teenage sensation
Never say nothing in front of a virgin
One credit to the nation
Speak truth and emotion

Now you've got the hook
Listen to the words
Teenage misfits who like a bit of herb
Why?
Because it makes me chilled
Keeps me level headed so my brain won't spill
At this age it probably won't explode
If you were to be flavour of the month Envogue
Not me because it makes me cringe
Wrapping in the ciggies when I start to do my thing
Wrap clear make you clear to the point 
No funny little voice ____
Big deal I smoke ___
And it's not a gimmick for the person making ___

Some teenage sensation
Never say nothing in front of a virgin
One credit to the nation
Won't make an exception
Some teenage sensation
Never say nothing in front of a virgin
One credit to the nation
Speak truth and emotion

Respect to the 
And you t swing Mr G
You've worked hard but we've just been heard
Gotta struggle and spread the word
Some reality not vanity
We all young and it could be insanity for us
Because they might compare
We don't want change though they don't care
You dance keep the movements hard
Dance hard and arriving hard
Creditors stop Clich√© stop
Keep on me top
Never make shirt drop
And join me the concept flow
May divining flow
____?
That we may be young with problems ahead
For my views have just been said

Some teenage sensation
Never say nothing about a virgin
One credit to the nation
