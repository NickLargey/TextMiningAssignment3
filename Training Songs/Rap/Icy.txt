I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm icy 

[Chorus] 
All these girls excited 
Oh ya know they like it 
I'm so icy, so icy 
Girl don't try to fight it 
All yo friends invited 
I'm so icy, so icy 

Got a house around my neck, and my wrist on chill 
Any given time, 250 in ya grill (a quarter million?) 
All I do is talk shit, you can even add a couple grand for my outfit 
You better act like ya know man, in my hood they call me Jeezy the Snowman 
Ya get it? Get it? Jeezy the Snowman 
I'm iced out, plus I got snow, man 
Let it marinate, y'all niggas is slow man (slow man) 
(Man what the f*ck y'all, yo dumb ass) 
I used to get nineteen for a beat 
Call me Ginuwine, the same 'ol G ('ol G) 
I'm the shit biatch, I need toilet paper (damn!) 
And some air freshener nigga, f*ck a hater 
These niggas don't like me 
I'm wit the Gucci Man and I'm so icy 

[Chorus] 

She diggin' my fit, she think I'm the shit 
Is this a chain on my neck, or the watch in my wrist 
Maybe the ice in my ear, or my bracelet 
But she look like the type that could take a dick 
Young Gucci Man, don't kiss me baby you can kiss my chain 
Ya gotta be a dime piece, 
Just to look at the rocks in my time piece 
I come through in a drop top Jag, or Old-School Chevy 
Wit the antique tags 
My pockets so heavy that I can't walk steady 
Niggas coppin' ice we done done it already 
Got a gold grill but it's not from Eddie 
I ride big Chevy's cause a nigga ain't petty 
I'm icy, so motherfuckin' snowed up, lil' kids want to 
Be like Gucci when they grow up 
Me, Jeezy and Boo 
We ain't hatin' pussy nigga 'gon and do what you do 
'cause we icy, so icy, we icy, so icy 

[Chorus] 

I'm hoppin' out the range wit the seats piped out 
You can still see my chain even when the lights out 
'cause that's how monsters do it 
Spit a lil game give 'em that flosser music 
I'm the man from the C.H.I. 
These lames runnin' 'round thinkin' they so fly 
Got a lil' buzz but Boo been too high 
I'm pullin' hoes in the club and I don't even try 
I guess when she glance at my wrist, she want to get my dick 
I tell her holla at Jeezy if ya want to pop Cris 
Get at Gucci Man 'cause he on some lil' shit 
And you know I'm in the cut, grippin' my 4/5 
Like let a nigga trip, naw we ain't runnin'
We just takin' all ya chicks, buyin' drinks gettin' blunted 
Groupies, show you how to do this son 
We throwin' out hundreds while you savin' them ones 

I got so many rocks, on my chain and watch 
I know I'm the shit, my chain hang down to my dick 
I know I'm the bomb, just look at my charms 
I know I'm the shit, my chain hang down to my dick 

[Chorus] 

I'm so icy 
Look at my charms 
My, chain, hang, down, to my dick
