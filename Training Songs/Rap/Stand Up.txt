Now the people on the left let me hear you say
That you're sick of their lies and you're not gonna take
And now the people on the right ain't no time to waste 
Gonna start it off slow bring it on now bring it
Now the people in the crowd let me see those hands up 
Stand up and demand some answers
What! Come on can you hear me in the back
If you can't let 'em know and we'll turn up the track
So come on

(They're addicted to power, and they're addicted to war.
They're addicted to war and they can't break the habit
It should prevail. It could be drugs)

This is a song dedicated to the lost
Triggered by the light and devoured by the holocaust
Well you prayed for daylight and it never came
So you better start praying again
Well as long as it goes and then it's not a relief
And it's nothing that's certain and it's not a belief
It's just a better way to maintain the illusion 
I want a solution 
We want a revolution
Well I'll follow; we'll synchronize
So many confined at one place at one time
And there's so much at hand that I don?t understand
And circumstances demand that we all better take a stand
Give in once, well you're giving in twice
Giving in three times; like you're giving them light
But they can't keep secrets 'cause they know they're wrong
And they can't keep us down 'cause we're too damn strong

Now the people on the left let me hear you say
That you're sick of their lies and you're not gonna take
And now the people on the right ain't no time to waste 
Gonna start it off slow bring it on now bring it
Now the people in the crowd let me see those hands up 
Stand up and demand some answers
What! Come on can you hear me in the back
If you can't let 'em know and we'll turn up the track
So come on

An enemy voice is an enemy mind
And I'm just not sure if I'm wasting your time
If I could see the inertia I'd give it a try
But I gotta project or I gotta deny
Nothing is wrong oh, but something ain't right
I don't feel this; I'm not seeing this
Something ain't coming unless I've got a feeling
Don't make a sound; keep your eyes on the ceiling
It's automatic; I know we used to have it
And I wanted to let it go; I wish it would make it so
Nothing's gonna save me when the chips are down
Nothing's gonna save you if you don't act now
But the current event is like a curdling sound
The event hypothetical is better than now
The action on the trigger's just to stay in your mind
Any action or reaction is just a matter of time

Now the people on the left let me see your faith
I want to start it off slow then we'll pick up the pace
And now the people on the right ain't no time to waste
Been a long time coming gonna hit the ground running
Now the people in the crowd let me see those hands
'Cause it's so far gone I'm not surprised no one understands
What! Turn it up can you hear me in the back
Fly now so we testify so we can never die
Fly now so we testify so we can never die
So we fly

So we all pretend we're oblivious 
Perfectly serious
Tell me that you needed this
Never know what you're gonna find
Never know what you might have left undefined
But I can tell you what it won?t be
Another web of confusions
Of lies and illusions
You can't imagine the half of them
Petrified
Genocide
Masterminds
Worlds that they've undermined
It's a place it's a time it's a lifeline
It's a chance to atone for a lifetime
Reach your hands to the sky when you testify
Put 'em up keep 'em up until you realize
Killing them once is like killing them twice
Killing with something that's a killing device
It's killing them slowly then it's killing them nice
If it's killing your act 
I want a reich

Now the people on the left let me hear you say
That you're sick of their lies and you're not gonna take
And now the people on the right ain't no time to waste 
Gonna start it off slow bring it on now bring it
Now the people in the crowd let me see those hands up 
Stand up and demand some answers
What! Come on can you hear me in the back
If you can't let 'em know and we'll turn up the track
So come on

Now the people on the left let me see your faith
I want to start it off slow then we'll pick up the pace
And now the people on the right ain't no time to waste
Been a long time coming gonna hit the ground running
Now the people in the crowd let me see those hands
'Cause it's so far gone I'm not surprised no one understands
What! Turn it up can you hear me in the back
Fly now so we testify so we can never die
Fly now so we testify so we can never die
So we fly

Fly now so we testify so we can never die
