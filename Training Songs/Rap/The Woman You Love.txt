Bringing the entertainment
Ashanti, we missed you baby
Busta, bus, karma music

But What about my pride
You're never satisfied
You made me feel like I wasn't worth being by your side
Out of sacrifice, all of my damn time
Giving you all mine
You see me dying inside

Trying to see
Trying to find
Trying to be
The woman you love
Tried everything
But it just don't seem like it's enough
Hey baby, tried to believe
But I'm tired of being tired
Trying to love
Trying to fight
And I'm running out of tries
You're just no good

But everything that I think
And all the love that we make
It never should took place
I gave you my heart,
You've been trading I know
I should have let you go
Cause I'm back where I was before, baby

Trying to see
Trying to find
Trying to be
The woman you love
Tried everything
But it just don't seem like it's enough
Hey baby, tried to believe
But I'm tired of being tired
Trying to love
Trying to fight
And I'm running out of tries
You're just no good

I know you're rapping to moves I'll be making, yes
They'll be gone to trivial tribulations, yes
It don't matter how difficult it'll get
I love you regardless the situation
I see you drew a line in the sand
You ain't gotta leave me home, I hand
Every time I get up and I think about that we're feeling, I say is damn
I know at times I really hurt your head
I've been, I've stressed you out
And really get you fed up
I will never ever gonna let up
Unless it makes you happy for me to shut up
But I ain't shutting up, because I really wanna give it to you
I can't replace a feeling when we get up with each other
And I ain't trying to lose you
Now what you expect me to do, let's take a of trip with you to Honolulu
Come on, maybe we can spend some time together
Tried to make a better girl, I choose you
But if you admit it that we really done
I respect it, and baby I'm a go
But once I walk out the door,
I ain't never coming back baby
Hell no

Trying to see
Trying to find
Trying to be
The woman you love
Tried everything
But it just don't seem like it's enough
Hey baby, tried to believe
But I'm tired of being tired
Trying to love
Trying to fight
And I'm running out of tries
You're just no good
