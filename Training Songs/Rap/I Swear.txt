Stand on the couch, baby, I'm wildin' over you
Take everything, bae, I'm a coward over you
Jewelry so wet, you need a towel over you
Take you out your mama house, baby smile
East coast, West coast, goin' shoppin'
Change the way that you dress, Thousand Island
Let you take over, I no longer need an accountant
Lord, you really really be wild
