Bounce rock roll and skatin 
Bounce rock roll and skatin 
Dippin down the street on platinum Daytons 

[Kurupt] 
I been all around the world Japan to Amsterdam 
Hittin like switches 
Dippin hit the switches which is 
One reason why I gotta make mine 
'Cause these fools on the street tryin to take mine 
Wassup ladies 
Times gettin shady 
You gotta lipstick wit it 
That's why I'm sick wit it 
Hard to maintain in this world of pain 
But I'ma serve these rhymes like dimes of Caine (check it out) 
Why can't we just chill and get along, motherfucker? 
But the views you choose to use is wrong, motherfucker 
Relax, me and Baby S got it macked to the tee 
Just ride with me 
Battlecat in the back with a sack on deez 
Ridin' with the young OG's (OG's) 
Dippin down Shaw, f*ck all of y'all 
As I bounce rock skate on threes 

[Chorus:]
We can freak it, freak if you want to, dine if you want to, but, 
'Cause since I came and you know [x2]

[Baby S] 
Let me tell you how I started on the grind for mine 
Livin life in my rear view 
S, nigga hear you 
About to drop the bomb 
Record one and blue calm, and Yukons 
And John hook my shit up bomb 
Who controllin? 
Rollin with my nigga from the Pound 
Put my shit in cruise control with bitches all around 
Make me feel like a G one more 
He once smoked 
For free, now its all about the G's and me 

[Kurupt] 
Oh yeah! 
Blaze up a whole sack to the head 
We wear khakis nigga, F*CK jeans 
I'm sure all the G's know what I mean 
Lil locs, young g's and og's 
We on the smash for cash and that's it 
We hit the stash and dash and that's it 
We don't flash we mash we blast shit 
And we don't give a f*ck about a bitch but uh 

[Chorus]

Give it up nigga, throw it up nigga [x8]
Why you trippin wit me? 
Won't you kick it with me? 
By my glock 
Combinin nots 
I got me somebody mad as shit 
While all the rest of y'all is mad as shit 
I'm dippin down the street in a sky blue Bentley 
Pull up to the curve, then swerve gently 
Ten of the homies made a left 
But they all ride with Kurupt, Cat, and Baby S, so uh 

[Chorus to Fade]
