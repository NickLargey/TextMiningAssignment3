Baby, I seen you with another lady
I just finished having your baby
Why'd you have to go, go and leave me?
Baby, you know I'm about to be swazy
I can't stand my lover being shady
Why'd you have to go, go and leave me?

What about you?
What about me?
What about us?
What we gon' do?
Total help me sing, Total help me sing.

What about you?
What about me?
What about us?
What we gon' do?
Hmm, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Baby, I know that you've been pimpin'
Mister baller, trickin'
Why you have to go, go and leave me?
Baby, I always been your baby
Love make a girl go crazy
I can't understand why you left me uum-hmm

What about me?
What about you?
What about us?
What we gon' do?
Total help me sing

What about me?
What about you?
What about us?
What we gon' do?
What we gon' do?
What we gon' do?

Ridin' through the hood with this little fly somethin'
Ho's wanna buy some, playa haters got high from
Can't go nowhere with my lady
Brothers actin' shady, baby pass me my 380

We chillin' in the precious white sands
Baby here's the plan, chartered plane to Amsterdam
And we can spend a whole bunch of Francs
Hook a little dance, listenin' to Total sang
