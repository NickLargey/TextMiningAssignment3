1-2, 1-2
Yeah
My name is MC Breed
I'm down with DJ Flash Technology, right?
And what we're doing here together as a team, the true-doers
Is what we call
Kicking it
Ah-ha, I said
We kicking it

Back in '86 when I started this
I said, the people told me: "Breed, you're not an artist"
But now it's 1990, I'm serving em well
With the rhymes, rhythms, style and clientele

Concert after concert, one after the other
A man with the plan, plus a hustler undercover
A president, a guy of his own 
Said, I knew I was proper, and I knew I was strong

But all it takes is concentration, rhyme calculation
Enough crew members to carry a nation
To be exact, yo Jack, I rehearsed
The cat wants your tongue, but I'd be catching it first
And I'm kicking it

Said, it's real necessary, not lack of control
To be at the tip-top with nothing but bankroll
To develop an actual skill, son
You gotta be born a natural real one

Not high up on a pedestal, just a born idol
To me it's just a typical man-made title
To remain an architect and stand, in fact
You're startin to sweat, to eject is your best bet

Certified legal, not against the law
I'm not irrelevant, but terribly raw
I got on-the-job knowledge and puttin it on paper
No bun for those who b.s. the baker

That's right, the mack Eric Breed is all that 
It's pretty simple, not to mention a fact
Causing major upsets for you so-called vets 
Who was there in the beginning, now you're sitting in check
I'm kicking it

Yeah, I'm kickin it

[Talking]
Now this beat is so dope
Yo Flash, get busy one time
You know what I'm sayin?

Not once do I think I need to change my mind
Technology's here with me to co-sign
Yeah, for the occasion, Breed's invasion of death force
Sit back, relax, Techno cuts of course

Yo, the b-r double e-d, and it's me
From the city of F-l-i-n-t with Technology
Serving on the wheels of steel and we're real
And if you squeal you're killed, pimp, that's the deal

Big Breed, I'm serving at the top of my mind
But his wax is just like 'jack, so then grind
It's like MC Kicking-It, one time like this and that
Step back, Jack, going black for black

Yeah, not wearing a Kangol, but maybe a cable
Thick shades, now you know, no looking like cool Moe
Yo, the rhyme that I'll be kicking will collect 
D-d-d-all respect, so why should I fess?
And I'm kicking it

Huh, and I'm kickin it
