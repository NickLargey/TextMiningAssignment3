Pass me them swisher sweets let's get it crump 
If a nigga disrespect me I'mma prove my shit and dump 
Blast ryhmes like I pump turn your belly to jelly 
Veteran MC I don't think you rookies is ready 
Three hundred and fifty pounds of pressure to deal wit 
I run with suave always packin' something to kill with 
Feel this bitch, when I get rich I'mma still hustle 
Go down in history, paper taller then Bill Russel 
Kilo flows, I got 'em hid in the basement 
Choppin boys up, on some puttin' it in they face shit 
Eight Ball, F-a-t M-a-see-k, known for layin' it down 
And doin' shit the playa way 
Callabo's of the dough ain't no secret 
Space-age pimpin' means I don't do free shit 
Time waits for no one, it ain't gon' wait for me 
Yours truly, signed Eightball and MJG

Damn nice bitch that's true to this 
Money ain't never been a thing to me 
Always stack my dough, holla back (uh) 
Ass fat, thighs thick, titties perfect 
Inhale the cheese from here to Tel Aviv 
Y'all know it, shit I don't bluff 
And no dough? I don't f*ck 'em 
F*ck I'mma fake for? 
Make mine's, someone take yours 
Cause I'm no nigga like love be	'fore

If a nigga broke, what'd you f*ck him for? 
Waste of time 
It's like we playette minds

Bitches, take it from a real motherfuckin' pro 
Y'all get that dough, we don't trust these niggas 
They gon' pimp if you let them

I'm the pimp motherfucker, baby 
Ice cold, stories so high 
I built the whole village twice 
So tight fold crease right on the President's nose 
Pimp clothes, drinkin straight Henney and Buckstrum 
Touch toed, hoes take the center fold pose
Break a treat, make 'em pay to enter those 
Pros, slam those 
Game tied tight like bows, we never close 
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four 
Hand chose bithces a la mode, gettin' sold 
Bust a load, the killer ass scorin' it, gettin' blowed 
Keep it froze, took up with a tougher wild bow 
Stick of gold, somethin' from the school of the old 
Forever flows, I take it down as deep as it can go 
Burn rolls, braids tight, blazed afros 
We're pushin' hoes 
Tits get erect, lactose, pay the toll 
MJG is in control

There's no repose now, better explode round 
Them jackets be on the lose until the dope is found 
Juvenile's my name, bitch

All you see is digibles and Reeboks 
I dealin' head to the bag, but lets grab two 
Willin' to bust a nigga hands if he had to 
You could feel him sayin' my nigga can use a hot boy 
Plug out, Blug eye Blug her 
Better get up off the blackboard 
Corporate at times, but your mommy a bounce boy 
Cash wasn't a million, never hit the spot boy 
You gon' cry son, who sold you the cows, huh? 
He in a cell block now 'cause you too high now
