[ea-ski]
Its kinda funny niggaz running up
Trying to show me much love
Cause a motherfucker just dropped an album
Now they wanna kiss ass
But hold up bitch all your getting is a luck pass
Trying to gank me for my ducket
I tried to put you down with the ski & cmt you said f*ck it
Only came around when things was kinda cool
But did you really think I'd go out like a fucking fool
Oh hell no, I kept my shit tight
Now the ski & cmt is sitting on something right
Your like a gold digging bitch from the neighborhood
That's why I slide on your ass cause it makes me feel good
All this shit you talk when I'm not around
Get your crown on nigga but you still ain't down
I got something for ya'll
A nin-millimeter that will drop you to the floor bitch
Cause if I trust ya for a minute
You would have had a motherfucking knife in my back then bent it
I gotta get ya first
Cause a nigga like ? is the nigga that will f*ck you the worst
Punk ass nigga kinda jocking now
You ain't down cause I trust nobody

[chorus/master p]
I trust nobody x2

[master p]
One by one in this century
Brothers are dying getting killed
And sent to penitentary's
And your right hand man could have been a snitch
You think like a hoe you go out just like a bitch
So face 'em to the facts bro'
And end up dead like this other nigga I used to know
I guess it's kinda sad g
But it really didn't face me til the funeral car passed me
And what about them tagalongs
Them mother mother fuckers that are driving with the lights on
Could have been the killers
But nobody really cares he died on dope dealers
But that don't mean shit, cause a nigga like me pack a 9 and 3 clips
And I don't trust a soul from them nigga by my house
To them niggaz down by the store
When niggaz say they like me
That's the same motherfuckers in the game that tried to shice me
Mama say boy you have no friends, ha
I should have listened then
Dour niggaz rolled up with the ski-masks
Pointed the tech-nine out the window but they didn't blast
When niggaz said freeze p
I thought to myself, huh, this nigga knows me
But I didn't find it funny
Pulled out my motherfucking 9 when they asked me for my fucking money
But he didn't even shoot
He must have didn't have no bullets in the gun no time to think
I'm steady pullin' I blast for the driver to the passenger
Four niggaz dead in the car I laugh at ya
Now I gotta see, pull of the ski mask of this nigga that was calling me
I guess it's kinda sad, a tear rolled down my eye cause I knew his ass
His name was little peewe
That's the same motherfucking nigga I was trying to help g
Good thing I thinked fast, cause if I think a nigga gonna do me
I'm gonna do his ass, cause a bitch will get you killed
Niggaz like to steal, and ain't no thing is a good dope deal
So I live just like john montgotti, ha
I trust nobody

[chorus]

[master p]
Yeah you know what I'm saying this goes out to all my niggaz out there
In the game you know what I'm saying
You gotta keep your eyes open you know, a lot of niggaz try to get
Niggaz, and the same nigga that you rolling with could be the nigga
Trying to get you, so a nigga like me you know what I'm saying
I trust nobody I hope you nigga catch on to what I'm saying

Peace. I'm outtie.
