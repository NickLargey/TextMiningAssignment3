Let me dance and I'll be okay
Let me drink and I'll be okay
Let me smoke and I'll be okay
'Cause if you don't
I'm about to lose it

Hey
Inhale 'til I'm sky high
People gotta die, why?
So I log on to the wi-fi
And people are crazy, people are crazy
I know, now we're all-stars
Lovin' money, women, cars
But none of this is ours
So we live it up, liquored up, before we leave it

Let me dance and I'll be okay
Let me drink and I'll be okay
Let me smoke and I'll be okay
'Cause if you don't
I'm about to lose it
