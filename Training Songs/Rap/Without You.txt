It's crazy how I'm seeing you
Cause I just told your little cousin the other day
I need to speak to you
Girl how you doing, how you been
Let's get all of that all the way
I got permission to say
I heard you had a baby on me
Is that the truth?
Or is the block just hating on me
And I ain't tripping if you got your self a man
Girl cause I can change that given have a chance

[Chorus]
First let me apologize for anything I did that made you cry
I know you don't wanna hear this song
But I promise I won't take too long
I need for you to hear the rest
At least I got it off my chest
Don't walk away
Cause if you do you'll miss the best part
Of what I gotta say
Baby I want to go back in time
To the first time, get it right
I'm sorry
And my life is nothing without you, baby
My life is nothing without you
My life is nothing without you

I know that it was hard for you
And I know that you were hungry for love
Girl and I was starving you
And it was childish I admit
How I tried to get you back for everything you did
Girl I would have never packed up and bounced
If you ain't feel the need to go sneaking around
And I'm sure you wouldn't have checked my messages
If I would've been honest about where I've been

[Chorus]

Baby I want, to go back in time
To the first time, get it right
To the first time, and get it right
Baby I want, to go back in time
To the first time, get it right
Cause I'm Sorry
And my life is nothing without you
Nothing without you baby [Repeat: x3]
