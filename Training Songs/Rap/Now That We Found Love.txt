Yeah
Now that we found love what are we gonna do (What are we gonna do)
With it (With it)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do (Hey)
With it (Now)

One two, tell me what you got
Let me slip my quarters inside your slot to hit the jackpot
Rev me up rev me up, my little buttercup
We can tug sheets snuggle up and get stuck
Believe it or not here comes the brother with glow
A strugglin', bubblin' overweight lover hurt prone
So what's it gonna be, me or the TV?

Now let me take time to set your mind and your body free
(Now) So why don't you just stretch, stretch for a sec
Played stretch so I could cop a quick rec
Shake me, shake me, baby baby bake me
No need to fake here I am, come on and take me
Wind your body
Baby move your body
I see you slip sliding, come on now do it hottie!
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feeling Hunky Dory 'bout this thing that I found

Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it (Come on Heavy, come on Heavy)

(Now) I like the way you wiggle you don't jiggle once you jiggle
So hand over your love 'cause it's heavier than it'll
Move her like a mover she wanted to groove so I grooved her
Then she wanted to learn so we did school and I schooled her
(Now) Mary had a little lamb, but not like this
We can waltz and turn, rumble tumble and twist
Then you think you gonna give in
Fantasies relivin'
So lay down and relax (Yeah baby, that's it)

(Now) Lover my lady
Lady love of my baby girl
Spread your wings so we can fly around the world
Harmony, charm of me
Your fingertips are callin' me
When you drop me kisses you're so cute you drop the bomb on me

(Now) Stretch it, stretch it, flex it, flex it
Gimme the permission
Okey dokey I'll bless ya
Blessin' like Buddha, Buddha as the bless
You can lay down on the lover, put your head on my chest (Now that we)

Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it (What are we gonna do with it)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it (TR, get em up one time)

(Now) Uh, keep it funky
Yeah (Keep it smooth) like this
(Now) Uh, here we go
(Now) What can we do
What are we gonna do
Roses are red and Violets are blue
Love is good and plenty if you get plenty good lovin'
Kiss you where you're hot to what I got to keep you bubblin'

(Now) Do me right, do me right, my lonesome dove
Tell me one more time what is this thing called love
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feeling Hunky Dory
About this thing that I found (Yeah)

Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it (Teddy Riley in the house)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it (C'mon, c'mon, G Wiz, DJ NF, let's flex)

Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it

Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it (Here we go, keep it funky)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it (Put your hands together, uh)

(Now) All up in money my furnish was decades you hear what I'm sayin'
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Manhattan
The whole New York City
I said I love you to death, and you don't stop, and you don't quit
You got keep it on to the dip dip, do it like this
And you don't stop, and you don't quit
You got keep it on and on and on and on

Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it
