People, your boy Banks is back
And this is a Timbaland track
This is my house bitch I run this
(I'll house you, girl, I'll house you)
This is my house
(I'll house you, you in my house now)

This is my house, you 'goin do what I tell you to do
When your in my house, under my roof, you follow my rules
This is my house
(Put ya hands up, put ya, put ya, put ya, put ya, put ya hands up)
This is my house
(I'll house you, girl, you in my house now)

Hey, your under my roof, so take off your coat, your hat and funny boots
I can't tell you they names, I just know they loose
Prefer mix the Cranberry and the goose
A little Armor and that's at least a hundred proof

Now shorty's eyes wide from the Bentley and the Coupes
She can't stop stealin', so she trippin' off the stoop
And I'm a beware of mine, no tellin' the truth
Let's run a menage trois and hit the booth

I got a big pool and a room full of bathin' suits
See y'all can go swim, while I get in
I'll show you how to make a million dollars with a pen
I drink champagne and pop bottles when I spin

I can't complain a top model's in the Benz
Her wheels is shinnin' like it's diamonds in the rims
Just gimme a day or two, I'm climbin' in her friends
I do what I do 'cause

This is my house, you 'gon do what I tell you to do
When your in my house, under my roof, you follow my rules
This is my house
(Put ya hands up, put ya, put ya, put ya, put ya, put ya hands up)
This is my house
(I'll house you, girl, you in my house now)

Hey, watch how you speak
'Cause I don't slip or squeak I got the heat
If you get outta line, you'll be in the street
Ambulance man tryin' to cover up the leak

And nobody to care if they get you in a week
I rather go there split a swisher with a freak
And get a lap dance while I listen to the beat
She's a beauty and petite, I can lift her off her feet

If she gets in a spur, we don't f*ck in here
I'm iced out, so she don't see nothin' but a blur
Be careful where you rub, don't get nothin' on the fur
You know we got them things, so the drama don't occur

You front 'cause you drunk, yo' ass gettin' jumped
I'm high off the funk, dro, hash and the skunk
Don't make them niggaz dump yo' ass in the trunk
They remembers a black mask and a pump
Them niggaz should have told you

This is my house, you 'gon do what I tell you to do
When your in my house, under my roof, you follow my rules
This is my house
(Put ya hands up, put ya, put ya, put ya, put ya, put ya hands up)
This is my house
(I'll house you, girl, you in my house now)
