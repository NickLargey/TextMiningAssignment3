Yeah
Yeah

They wanna know why we look like a gang
Look so criminal, look like we bang
So I tell them only bangin' that we do it is on the system
We're just doing our thing
They wanna know why we walk like we walk
Talk like we talk, like we own the city
So I tell them like it is
I got it from my mother, that's just the way we?re raised
They wanna know why my pants hang low, 
What It says, who's my T, why I dress like this for
So I tell them F*ck yoo're dress for, Who I'm suppos to pull my pants up
Fo?
They wanna know, keep askin' me questions, 
Askin' me about this, askin me about that
When they don't even know me, so stop your questions homie
 
[Chorus]

Th-Th- they thay wanna know
Who-who-who who wanna know?
You-you-you you wanna know

Yeah
They wanna know why I'm blowing my fuel, 
Losing my temper, losing my cool
So I tell them I just do what I do, 
You don't need to know why I do what I do
They wanna know why I can't take orders, 
Listen to the boss when I work in here
So I tell them: are you fucking with me?
I'm just trying to work in here
They wanna know what we do when we're in the crib

If we tokin', tokin'
So I tell'em: I don't know why you're askin'
Do it look like I've been smokin'?
They wanna know if I know somebody, that know somebody, 
That know some drugs.
So I tell Them how to f*ck with you.
Do I look like I sell drugs? Niggah! 
 
[Chorus]

Th-Th- they thay wanna know
Who-who-who who wanna know?
You-you-you you wanna know
 
Why you wanna know about me huh?
You don't know me why should you care
Stop askin' questions man
What makes you think I'll answer them?
Why you wanna know about me hu?
You don't know me why should you care
Stop askin' questions man
What makes you think I'll answer them?
 
Why you wanna know about me hu?
You don't know me why should you care
Stop askin' questions man

Why you wanna know about me hu?
You don't know me why should you care
Stop askin' questions man
