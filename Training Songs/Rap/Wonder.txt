I can beat the night, I’m not afraid of thunder
I am full of light, I am full of wonder

Whoa, oh I came falling under
Whoa, oh I am full of wonder

Though our feet might ache, the world’s upon our shoulders
No way we goin’ break, ‘cos we are full of wonder

Whoa, oh we came falling under
Whoa, oh we are full of wonder

This light is contagious, go, go tell your neighbors
Just reach out and pass it on
This light is contagious, go, go tell your neighbors
Just reach out and pass it on ooh yeah
This light is contagious, go, go tell your neighbors
Just reach out and pass it on ooh yeah
This light is contagious, go, go tell your neighbors
Just reach out and pass it on yeah

Whoa, oh we came falling under
Whoa, oh we are full of wonder

When everything feels wrong, and darkness falls upon you
Just try sing along, this is a message from Cabana
If your heart turns blue, I want you to remember
This song is for you, and you are full of wonder

Whoa, oh we came falling under
Whoa, oh we are full of wonder
