Hey!
Can I say something to make you understand that
I'm not your typical, ordinary man see
I'm not one to pressure you
That's not how it'll be baby
Cause when it comes down to it
It's not up to me
Knowin' its you

Just friends, lovers, one or the other
It's on you
Stay home, take a ride, you decide
It's on you
To the movies, to the bedroom, what you wanna do
It's on you
Hey!
Anything goes on between us two
Long as you know
It's on you

Hey!
Can I say something to make you, make you see that
You will never find someone that
Wants you more than me baby
I wanna cater to you girl
Make everyday your day
Baby we can do it your way
Just as long as it's me and you

Best friends, lovers, one or the other
It's on you
Stay home, take a ride, you decide
It's on you
To the movies, to the bedroom, what you wanna do
It's on you
Hey!
Anything goes on between us two
Long as you know
It's on you

Tell me what you want and
Tell me how you want it
Anything you ask of me
Baby girl I'm on it
Sugar, I'm for you
Baby, that's for sure
Tell me how you want this to go

Best friends, lovers, one or the other
It's on you
Stay home, take a ride, you decide
It's on you
To the movies, to the bedroom, what you wanna do
It's on you
