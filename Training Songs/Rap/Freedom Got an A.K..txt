A to the K to the 4 to the 7
Little devils don't go to heaven
Da Lench Mob

An A-K talks and bullshit runs
I wish I had time to count all my guns
'Cause a nigga is runnin' out of funds
But H Rap says, "Freedom got a strap"

I wish I was in Dixie
AK, AK
Then shit wouldn't have been bad in the sixties
No way, no way

I, can't see the OG's standin' in big lines
Holdin' big signs, tryin' to get mine
I'll shoot ya ass 17 times
'Cause this week we don't turn the other cheek

Do that shit and get stole on non-violence gotta hold on
Plus we got a roll on, the mayor of the whole fuckin' city
Saw the Lench Mob and his draws got shitty
So get the f*ck out my way when I spray, hey, freedom got a AK

A to the K to the 4 to the 7
Little devils don't go to heaven
A to the K to the 4 to the 7
Little devils don't go to heaven
Freedom is the road seldom traveled by

Either be a book master, buck masta
Or sit back and get fucked fasta
Than a horny assed rabbit
Dagna bit, 'cause I gots to have it

Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, ah yeah
Talkin' like that'll have 'em all scared
Don't come to me with no petition
Fool, come to me with ammunition

'Cause the bang, bang, buck, buck,
Boom, boom, pow, pow, used to be a trick
But bitch, how ya like me now?
'Cause the AK-40 dick hold a 50 clip
And I'll shoot till it's empty bitch

That's how you got filthy rich
I know the game, so I'ma do the same
Don't like when I play the same way
And say hey, freedom got an AK

Got a freedom got an AK
Freedom got an AK
Got freedom got an AK
Freedom got an AK
Freedom is the road seldom traveled by

You better call nine, one, one
The nigga's got a gun, and he's gonna have fun
An A-K 47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfuckin' fool

'Cause I'll have to f*ck around and point
And f*ck around and have to shoot the whole fuckin' joint
A is for apple, K is for killin'
I'm killin', 47 million civilians

So if you wanna jump your ass in, come on
I'm buckin' and blastin'
F*ck with the L to the E to the N to the see
To the H to the M to the O to the be and you'll see

One dead devil
Kick that shit to the level
Get my shovel, 'cause I don't play
Motherfucker, freedom got an A-K

A to the K to the 4 to the 7
Little devils don't got to heaven
A to the K to the 4 to the 7
