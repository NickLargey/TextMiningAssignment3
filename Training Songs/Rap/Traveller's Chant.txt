Last week, I was passenger in a car seat
Thinking of decision that I made within a heart beat!
She used to make my heartbeat but usually alarms me my lungs are over
Working and I (Can't breathe)
Yes I convinced myself I didn't like relationship malarkey,
And she says "wait, you didn't ask me... (How I felt)"
I said I love that your a (nice girl), and I'm sorry
But this really wasn't time well,
And it kinda feels like it may be a blur,
Maybe coffee and telly is what I mainly prefer,
Feel I gotta scratch the surface gotta break it to learn,
And now I multiply the times in which the tables have turned!

I call this the traveler's chant!
Whether you sitting on a train or in the back of a car,
Thinking, maybe it's me, yes I do have places to be
Do I start at the end or do I end at the start,
And in this little bit of time will I get very far?
Maybe it's me, yes I do have places to be!
And I'll be there!
Yes, yeah the other day I was sitting on the train but in another place,
I was on my way home, or maybe some would say,
I was thinking bout the days I wanna run away,
I've only really gotta couple mates, me, myself and I, how cliche,
Looking out the window, feels like I'm in a film,
Director, producer and as it happens I'm the main (character),
Yeah my own little feature, length sound track being
Whatever's in my speakers (then),
I'd rather not be held accountable I bank on peoples feelings
It's no wonder why I'm feeling spent, yeah and in a deeper sense,
Sometimes I need the rain it helps me kinda clean my head,
The suns an easy friend, I'm thinking maybe the duration of my journey
Helped me reconnect my feelings then!

Oh yeah, yeah I'll be there.
I got places to be and yes (I'll be there)
Yeah, uh, yeah I'll be there... Said I'll be there
(I'll be there)
