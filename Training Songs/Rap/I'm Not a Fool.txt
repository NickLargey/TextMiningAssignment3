I'm reminiscing on all the times we shared
I can't seem to forget the times that we spent, and I miss
Your pretty smile just seemed to brighten up my day
I want you here with me, I'm callin' out your name
Hear me, my pretty girl
You're on my mind
I wannna hold in my my my arms
Tonight, let's make it right
Unless we're face to face you can't relate to what I have to say

[Chorus]
I'm not a fool
Please don't break my heart
I'm daydreamin' about you and I need you in my life
I'm not a fool
Please don't break my heart
Please don't break my, don't break my heart

I've been sitting in my window
Watching cars go by
And hoping that one
You will be inside, and I

I want you here with me
No explanation goes
You know the way I feel 
Be there for sure

No no my baby girl
I want to hold you in my arms
Tonight
Let's make it right
Unless we're face to face you can't relate to what I have to say

[Chorus]

I need you in my life
I want you by my side
I need you in my life
I want you by my side
I need you in my life
I want you by my side... Please come back
