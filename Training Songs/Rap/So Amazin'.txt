(feat. Dre)

[Chorus:]
I?mma pull you outta the club ma,
We gon? get to sinnin? tonight,
And when it?s all said and done,
You?ll be begging me to spend the night,
Lemme hear you say,
This is amazin?-mazin?,
That is amazin?-mazin?,
This is amazin?-mazin?,
That is amazin?-mazin?

[Verse 1:]
Sometimes I wanna get up and do it,
Do-do-do do it,
Pursue it,

That shit it makes me high,
So high so high so high,
