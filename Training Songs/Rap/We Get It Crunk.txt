Cool breeze, i heard you was a mothafuckin' fool
Ah yeah, all 'em want to see me hit 'em

Ya heard what i said?
Don't come around here again
Changin' the game, re-arrangin'
I'm changin' my name
Since i shot up the party, i'm 2 shotty young gotti
Like givin' a f*ck, hold 'em up, nigga wha
I'm pressin' it homie, i keep the pistol whisling homie
Stashin' it nigga, cocked back, blastin' it nigga
Be silent, you can hear the falls tricklin' homie
It's ridiculous homie
Why the f*ck you up on me?
That's how mothafuckas lay in caskets nigga

Fool what, we get it crunk
Comin' through your hood with the sawed off pump

[cool breeze]
Hey, i hear you screamin' through your whole house
Mommy, daddy, turn the tv on
Cool breeze done came out
And everytime i wear some new sneakers
They be hatin' on me, all behind my back like some school teachers
And be checkin' for me in the streets
So they can listen to me real good
And go and make a ? that beat
Now everybody want to put it down
You give 'em one little record deal and they think they 'bout to run the town
And when they album start to get a buzz
Everytime you turn around, you see 'em posted all up in a club
I think they smokin' too much ?ever body?
They try to spit one at me, and we end up spittin' one at everybody
It ain't no plan with the hitman
He bust ten bars, bust back with both hands
So keep your dial locked and stay tuned
And when you be down in atlanta, be down with the calhouns

Everybody used to call me "don't drop"
'cause i ain't drop nothin'
One time i walked up and pulled a gun
And laid this dough boy down and made his whole click make buns
Now everytime i make a run
My niggas tell me watch my back
'cause we know they still want some
