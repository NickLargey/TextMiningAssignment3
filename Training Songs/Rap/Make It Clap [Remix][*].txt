Dont need no ticket
Dont need no reservation
I've got my table set for two
Don't bring no money
Just your imagination
for all the things that we can do
I skip my entree
n' stick to table water
I've got my main course for dessert
I dim the lights
the DJ can take a hike
cause we dont need no chaprone tonight

Cause all i want is what you got
All seats taken
And all i dont is what you're not
no mistaking
And all i want is what you got
All seats taken
So dont you bring a crew
I'm all booked up for you

So come on closer
this ain't no business meeting
so you dont need a shirt and tie
and tell your friends
i dont really mean no offense
it's a privet invitation 
this place has got a lock out tonight

Cause all i want is what you got
All seats taken
And all i dont is what you're not
no mistaking
And all i want is what you got
All seats taken
So dont you bring a crew
I'm all booked up for you

All booked up
and nothing's gonna change my mind
cause no one is gonna waste our time
So come and make my dreams come true
I'm all booked up for you
