[Intro]
Hold up (hold up bitch)
Sweet Jones in this bitch
P-I-M-P, representin the trill-ass niggaz
Sweet Jones, cuttin you fucker

[Chorus]
I'm a hog in the game {*3X*}
I got some wet and some round
I'm a hog in the game, I got some wet and some round
I got some white and some syrup, I'm tryin to sew up my town
I'm a..

[Pimp C]
I'm a pig on the streets, I'm a slug in the game
Puttin D on the corner heavies f*ck with my name
They call me Sweet James, keep cocaine
Doin 90 in the Benz switchin lane to lane
I'm a candy-mayne, hot like a flame
Your jewelry look funny, that ain't no byzantine chain
Take that monkey watch off, you a bitch to me
You can use my style but you gon' pay me a fee
Cause ain't shit for free, I'm on a poppin spree
Rap-A-Lot mafia life, ain't no stoppin me
They call me Tony Montana because I'm lettin 'em hang
When you see me recognize I'm a hog in the game

[Chorus]

[Pimp C]
Young hog, vicious dog, keep a bad-ass yellow broad
On the slab, in the nab, Chef Boyardee in the lab
Cook it fat, cut it small, fifteen thousand at the mall
Gucci shop, Bally shop, scratch it off, in the drop
2000 see-5, got 3 million from the Jive
You was trickin with my hoes, I was playin with my nose
Comin down, candy gold, nigga y'all was playin the role
Tellin bitches 'bout my past, you can get hit in yo' hat

[repeat 2X]
I'm a hog in the game, I got some wet and some round
I got some white and some syrup, I'm tryin to sew up my town

[Chorus]

[Pimp C]
Maybe you was in yo' drop, that's when my boys love to pop
Make his fuckin jelly jump, stepdaddy got hit with a pump
Hit with a pump, it's in my lap at all times nigga
And ain't nuttin for that f*ck boy to get hit nigga
Cause y'all niggaz is some motherfuckin hoes
When y'all want your rep I saw your motherfuckin clothes
Your shoes ain't tight and you're phony at your shows
So bend your ass over like a bitch is supposed
I make my fuckin music for the boys with the O's
The old school pros and the strip club hoes
The boys with the hard in the motherfuckin South
Bitch you ain't had a hit since I saw you break 'em out

[repeat 2X]
I'm a hog in the game, I got some wet and some round
I got some white and some syrup, I'm tryin to sew up my town

[Chorus]
