Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go
Somethin' keeps tellin' me that, me that
Everything goin' be alright
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be
You were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work

It was all good at first
Spendin' money, goin' shoppin'
Eatin' at the finest restaurants
And if I'm club hoppin'
She was right there with me bottle poppin', livin' that life
She just didn't understand my lifestyle, and that ain't right
We didn't have a worry in the world, got you diamonds got you pearls
Cut can't help it if Ching-a-ling been attracting all the girls
Baby, I'm a superstar, and that come wit' it
Gotta good nigga on the side, you better run wit' it
Even though I'm on the road doin' shows
I make time for me and her, relationship to grow
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me
Plus, when I'm outta town, always think of her
Might conversate with some chicks, but no one come above her
(Uh) I thought I was your man
Guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here lookin' crazy like
Damn!

Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back

Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be
You were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work

Walkin' to house from hard work, my head hurts
Instead of arguin', can I have dinner with some dessert? (Uh uh)
She talkin' 'bout this phone number she found
Hey, give me time to put my bags down
She's straight up, clowned
Before we end up fightin', let me leave
I'm exhausted and this her, I don't need
Now I'm wit' the fellas, ridin' and drinkin'
She's blowin' my two way up, but I need some time for thinkin'
(Yeah) I wanna go back, but something sayin' naw
Give her some space and the next day I might call
What should I do?
Look, let me ask y'all
Should I stay and talk, or let this relationship fall?
I ain't down on what happened, my feelings crushed
But it happens some time
It's either love it or give it up
I thought I was your man
Guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here lookin' crazy like
Damn!

Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life

All the fellas know you feel me, if you ever had a woman
Good times led to bad times and you ain't see it coming
Try your best to make her happy
But it wasn't enough
'Cause mama told me in relationship to road get tough
And I don't wanna have my head down
Weak and stressed out
As bad as it hurts, I gotta move to the next round
(Uh) I thought I was her man
Guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here lookin' crazy like
Damn!

Every time I try to leave
