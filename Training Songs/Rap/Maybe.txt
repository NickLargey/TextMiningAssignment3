Maybe maybe it's the money
Baby maybe not!
Maybe I fell in love with you on the spot
Never mind, keep it G
I told you different at the top
Maybe never mattered?
Street nigga thuggin' on the block
I ain't hangin' with no thots shawty
Power ball, this your shot shawty
And if they hatin' let 'em talk shawty
And I been drinkin' too much
Got me thinkin' too much
You're in my head

I say boy, yeah you did
Love how you kiss it
Ooh, you can get it
I never felt like that before
Ooh, you're the realest
Yeah, I admit it
All of my feelings

Had to post 'Now wait a minute'
Almost tapped down when you start swimming
A little cocky, I could feel the depth
'Cause you put it on and I need lots of that
Is that your phone? where you at?!
Give me rounds, I need all of that
Don't even have to knock, left the door unlocked
So, now you tryina take it down or not?!
Or not?!

Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song
Don't know what it is,
But you turn me on
Maybe it's the bar
Maybe it's the car (Or not!)
Don't know what it is,
Maybe I'm in love (Or not!)

In the club twisted, ooh reminiscing
Boy, I can vision round 2!
It's me and you in the winning
There's no competition
Boy, you're about to uhm

Who she seeing? Who she fucking on the low?
She kissing him, she kissing her, she one of those
F*ck is you? You TMZ, you Sandra Rose
That's little sis, I'm big bro, so let's go

Maybe it's the way I speak it
Know the spot, and how to reach it
When I meet your man, shake his hand
That's I'll keep our little secret
Wooo, no pillow talk, no kiss and tell
They countin' coins, my pockets deeper than a wishing well
She like ballers, she like Birkin buyers
She got a wild side, she like dope boys with a certain fire
That's me nigga, so that's me nigga
No if, ands, no maybes, so that's we nigga

Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song
Don't know what it is,
But you turn me on
Maybe it's the bar
Maybe it's the car (Or not!)
Don't know what it is
Maybe I'm in love

Maybe Iâ€™m in love
Ooh ooh ooh
Damn
Had to pause nigga wait a minute
