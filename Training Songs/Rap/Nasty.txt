{Monifah}
Ooh you so nasty

[Chorus]
Why you gotta be so nasty girl
(Because you make me horny)
(Why you gotta be so nasty boy)
Because you get up on me
Why you gotta be so nasty girl
(Because you make me horny)
(Why you gotta be so nasty boy)
Because your body's banging

I like the way you
Put it on me girl
(You like that?)
You make me want to ride

(I make you want to ride baby)
The way we're touching
It feels like we're fucking (Ooh)
I want to get up inside yeah

And I can tell your hard
I know cause I can feel it
Up and down my thighs
I know what you're thinking

[Chorus]

I'm not your girl
I'm not your man
But we can dance

I want to wet that pussy
Won't you back it up on me
Come and let me hit that hot spot
(Can you handle it?)
And it really don't matter
That everybody's looking at us
'Cause we'll be bumping till the music stops

And I can tell your hard
I know cause I can feel it
Up and down my thighs
I know what you're thinking

[Chorus]

I'm not your girl
I'm not your man
But we can dance

I didn't mean to turn you on
(Girl I don't mind)
So let me give me what you want
(Girl take you're time)
I want to see you lose control
(We've got all night)
Baby can we get it on

[Chorus; x2]

Baby when you push up on me
I like it, I like it
Baby when you touch my body
I want it, I want it
When you feel the funk coming on
Get on it, get on it
Move slow tonight

[Chorus]
