Huh, uh
Huh, uh, huh, uh
Huh, uh
Huh, uh, huh, uh

You ask me, how I've been doing, well I guess I'm having doubts
'Cause I've been waiting for you to say the words I want out loud
You only say it in the dark when there's no one else around
And after you've had way too much
It's time to sober up

Baby mayn, tell me you're ready
You're ready to be the one to give me your heart
When you wake up it seems like you're ready
You're ready to take back what you said in the dark
So won't you say it when you know it

Every time I think that you're ready
You find a way not to tell me
You wake up and it's over
You're different when you're sober
So prove that I'm not your play thing
Your every other day thing
You want us to be closer
So tell me when you're sober (sober, sober)

I don't mean to be that kinda girl, I just wanna figure out
If you mean all the things you say
'Cause it don't feel that way

Baby mayn, tell me you're ready (ready, you're ready to)
You're ready to be the one to give me your heart (give me your heart, give me your heart)
When you wake up it seems like you're ready (ready, you're ready to)
You're ready to take what you said in the dark
So won't you say it when you know it

Every time I think that you're ready
You find a way not to tell me
You wake up and it's over
You're different when you're sober
So prove that I'm not your play thing
Your every other day thing
You want us to be closer
So tell me when you're sober

Other girls have just got tired
Waiting 'til the time is right
You seem to change your mind
First it's rain, then it's shine
Another time and place
You show a different face
Don't tell me to be patient
I'm tired of waiting

But you, take shots for both of us
Now we laying drunk in love
And you take pools to make you budge
And f*ck all your high hopes up
Look I know this ain't right
Yeah, and I'm always on a hype
You know I left 'cause I couldn't ever make things right
Blinded by your love and now you're without I
And there's no "I" in team and there's no "I" in we
Unless we're speaking in French and we hardly speak
I shouldn't drink and drive, let alone drink and type
Now I'm speeding to your place like it's do or die
Yeah, look, you know I'm on my way
Glass full of reasons to stay
Sitting on the dresser, bottle full of pain
Now you wanna hung over 'cause we drank it all away ('cause we drank it all away)

Every time I think that you're ready
You find a way not to tell me
You wake up and it's over
You're different when you're sober
So prove that I'm not your play thing
Your every other day thing
You want us to be closer
So tell me when you're sober (sober)

Every time I think that you're ready
You find a way not to tell me
You wake up and it's over
You're different when you're sober
So prove that I'm not your play thing
Your every other day thing
You want us to be closer
So tell me when you're sober (sober, sober, sober, mm, yeah)
