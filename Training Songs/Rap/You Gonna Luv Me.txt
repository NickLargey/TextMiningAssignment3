Wussup sho nuff boy

[Big Marc]
I'm comin down with the key to Decatur
East Atlanta slash writer
Heavy grinda for paper
City slicker heavy weight in the game
Froze wish they ear lobes heavy weight in my chain
Hittin the game where you niggaz be slackin'
Got the dro for the lo that what my niggaz be sackin'
My shell toes peddle chevys and boles
White leathers on the cutlass with mahogany flos
I'm riding through oakhurst coated like starburst
Candy paint glisten lookin greasy like bratwurst
The dude on my jersey is greatly deceased
You rested in peace for snitchin to Decatur police
Servin niggaz with a ghetto subpoena
Got that A-Town stompin' back in Phillips Arena
I'm passin hoes like collection plates
And keep a broad on my squad who on section 8 (Oh!)

[Sho'Nuff]
Yeah, ok, yeah, ok
They gon love me after this one
To all my trap niggaz and dro smokers
Keep the strippers stay focus
Pussy poppin and rollin
'cause all I wear is hats wit A's
Shoppin at malls
White tees, Cartiers
Jeans creased up straight out the cleaners
Plus my George Jefferson strut and my southern demeanor
When they see me when I speak my slang
Everybody wanna know my name (Sho 'nuff)
I was born in Atlanta, raised in Decatur
Where we pushin' LeSabres and blow like inhalers
Say he kinda skinny wit a full size jimmy
Ay man I got broads in different cities
Like gimme gimme
They used to treat me like Urkel the nerd
Now they flock when the see my LeBrons on the curb
See my upholstery it got women approachin me
Some look like they too old for me
TVs hangin' appropriately

[Milwaukee Black]
Its major way baby, see I told you was gon luv me

When you see me in the 6 tre drop
And I tell you that the price of the worth just dropped
I let the thing go pop
I caught buddy round there snitchin off to the cops
And the game don't stop (don't stop)
You tried to see my dough
You better see this 4 (get it)
I'm 31 and my rappin is done
I gotta million dollar company to run (bitch)

[Sho'Nuff]
'cause I smoke like you
A min and some blu
I find 'em lick 'em, split 'em, roll 'em just like you (yep!)
In XXL murder dawg ya Source,
I'm vice I'm rollin stones and lay be the wisest homie

[Big Marc]
I'm grand hustlin disturbin the peace
I'm so def puttin organized noise in the street
I'm smokin earth tones chong and cheech
You beat you meat at home
While I bone your freak (oh!)

Oh! I told ya, you gon love me!

Bridge: (2x)
Its Da Back Wudz slammin through ya back hood
We got dem thangs that'll make Shaq act hood
Known we but dem shiny thangs on the lac hood
Known do a lil' dance if they act good

[Outro]
Major Way, D-Decatur, D-Decatur
