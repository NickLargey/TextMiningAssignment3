[T.I.]
A hour train, spit game from the get green.
Hey, T.I.P. been bangin' thick dames since he was fifteen.
The click came ran trains, if her shit clean.
The same broad fronted y'all, like she miss thing.
And damn, how the bitch seem she's a dick fiend.
Although I won't elaborate, I'll say she lick things and get green.
She f*ck wit' me because I got big dreams,
And along wit' a face, she think she seen on the big screen.
I give it to her, since she whine and her back hurt,
Then drive her crazy, since she crying and she act worse.
Yeah, I'm a rapper, I'm a man, but I'm a mac, first.
I need a broad wit' a bank, and a fat purse, and that's first.

[T.I.] 
I'm a P-I-M, ah, M-P, 
Told y'all niggas before, about me.
Plenty Remi, to the H-E, ah, A-D.

[Neptunes]
Somebody buy some more dro', so we can smoke, please?
Now what's yo name?

[T.I.] 
I'm pussy bumper, number one.

[Neptunes] 
Yeah, I said what's yo name?

[T.I.]

[T.I.]
Man, trying to stop pimpin', like shooting a B-B gun at a freight train.
So comparing us is like whine to a grape stain.
My reputation's great, man, I got a great name.
I hate lames, I stay clean, and I break dames.
I like 'em small, or bigger, with a figure-eight frame.
So if she fine I bet she mine, when I find time.
Man, I ain't lying, mine dames I don't wine or dine.
Like clothesline, hos mine, I'm a goldmine.
Hey, I'm the "king of the south," and the throne mine.
I got the chrome in the Chevy, and the broan mine.
Hey man, I'm young but I been doing it for a long time.
That ain't my fault, that bitch grown, she got her own mind,
And, and I'm

I bet some niggas think I cake her when I take her out,
But come that week, just watch me rape her fucking bank account.
Eventually the P$C, hey, we gone take the south,
Then grab the earth by the ankles, and shake the paper out.
Nigga, I'm 'bout my paper route, so I'm gone, make a route.
Anybody blocking my road to riches, man, I'm gone take 'em out.
Keep run yo' mouth, making up you mind, you got's to be's wit' out.
Me, I'ma git a ho, who gone make show my pockets seen about.
P-I-M-P-I-N-G is all I be's about.
I break a ho in, break 'em till they broke, and then I ease 'em out.
They out of pocket, I'm a lock 'em out, and leave 'em out.
And that don't change, man, season in, season out.
Open up The Source, shawty, and see who just you reads about.
If it ain't concerning T.I., a P$C a see ya out.
Ain't nothing even you ain't cuttin', then you don't see the house,
Because you know I got to practice what I preach about.
