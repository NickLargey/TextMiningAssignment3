Better keep him on the leash
Put your man at the suites

I had to ask what are you lookin' at
It must look good to you
To make you loose control
When no no you're supposed
To keep your poppy eyes on me

Why does my man wanna roam all over
Burying bones on every corner
Better keep him on the leash
Teach him how to be sweet
I am just walkin' the dog

I know he's supposed to be a girl's best friend
(Just walkin' the dog)
But he's my dog and I love him

I know he's supposed to be a girl's best friend
(Just walkin' the dog)
But he's my dog, I am just walkin' the dog

Gotta keep him on the leash
Teach him how to be sweet
Gotta keep him on the leash
Teach him how to be sweet

Gotta keep him on the leash
Teach him how to be sweet
Gotta keep him on the leash
Teach him how to be sweet

He never, never fails
He's got's to wag his tail
And I just have to say good boy

But if he breaks his chain
Yet I don't have him trained
Will my doggy dog me out?

Why does my man wanna roam all over
Burying bones on every corner
Better keep him on the leash
Teach him how to be sweet
I am just walkin' the dog

I know he's supposed to be a girl's best friend
(Just walkin' the dog)
He's my dog and I love him
I know he's supposed to be a girl's best friend
(Just walkin' the dog)
But he's my dog, I'm just walkin' the dog

I know he's supposed to be a girl's best friend
(Just walkin' the dog)
But he's my dog, I keep lovin' my dog
I just give it all
(Just walkin' the dog)
I love my dog, I'm just walkin' the dog

Just walkin' the dog
Better keep him on the leash
(Just walkin' the dog, just walkin')

I'm just walkin' my dog
Better keep him on the leash
(Just walkin' the dog)
I'm just walkin' my dog

He's a Rover gettin' over
Don't say a thing 'cause it's good I told ya
Never when you teach a old dog new tricks
He's too slick, get out quick

No runnin' out chasin' the cat
I'm walkin' him, walkin' the dog
No runnin' out chasin' the cat
I'm walkin' the dog, he's my dog

I'm just walkin' my dog
I'm just walkin' my dog
I'm just walkin' the dog

You keep telling me
He's a dog with a capital D
If he gives me what I want and need
He's my doggy dog indeed
