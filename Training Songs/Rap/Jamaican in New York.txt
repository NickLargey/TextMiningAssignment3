Don't drink coffee, I drink roots my dear
And I love my morning ride
You can see it in my motions when I walk
I'm a Jamaican in New York
See me walking down Church Avenue
With my hat leaned to one side
You can see it when I walk

I'm a Jamaican in New York
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York

Roughness makes man, as someone said
He is the rude boy of the day
Takes a man to make a stand, sometimes get wild
Be yourself, no matter what they say

I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York

Niceing up our party, can lead to notoriety
Pretty soon they'll know you as the Don
Because we live so hearty, Babylon don't like we
Still we're gonna party till the sun

And you don't stop, you proceed
And this is the message and rhyme you need
Shinehead's gonna take the lead
All yard man, put up your hand
And let the world know that you have ambition
Well a we, well a we a yardy
A weh we de?
We de a New York City
A weh se come yah fa?
No to make some money
We have to do that to feed we family

Chucking badness does not make a man
And we're not the only ones with guns
Confront your enemies, outsmart them if you can
But if all else fails, you better run
Roughness makes man, as someone said
He is the rude boy of the day
Takes a man to make a stand, sometimes get wild
Be yourself, no matter what they say

I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York
I'm an alien...
I'm a Jamaican in New York
I'm an alien...
I'm a Jamaican Ã¯n New York
