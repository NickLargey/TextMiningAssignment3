Flat soles, kinda roll where them thangs blow
Good wood, not wastin' that payroll
Five hoes, trap boys got breakfast

Car is a Cutlass, pistol is a must bitch
Let a nigga know that his head I will bust quick
Some slum niggas know what I'm talkin' 'bout

Gimme head while I'm bustin' that two track
It was 12, hit the fence, never looked back
Big thug, hit clubs in the big boy
Dollar Boy, let 'em know how to rip folk
If a bitch broke, gotta let her slide, though
