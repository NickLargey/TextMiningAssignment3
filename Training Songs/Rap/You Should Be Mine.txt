Mase and Brian McKnight
Bay Boy we dont' stop, we rock we rock
Yo,I hit you the sound that the world can't take
Came straight out the gig playing two point eight
Near studded, jewel flooded, got to love it
First rap cat with an R&B budget
Everyday on the TV, me and PD
Girls see PD, make their man break the CD
Why ya'll forever rowdy, I'll be outie
Somewhere in Maui, 'til I go back to Cali

Can't understand how he can treat you
The way that he does
Give me the chance to show you baby
You're better off with me
Oh so baby let me try, I wanna make you smile
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
I'll never let you down, I'll always be around
And you should be mine

If he don't love you right, don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should, then you should be mine

Why can't you see you should be happy
And I don't know why
You don't believe a man can love you
For the rest of your life
Oh so, baby let me try, I wanna make you smile
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
I'll never let you down I'll always be around
And you should be mine

If he don't love you right, don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should, then you should be mine

Yo, what the deal honey, insecure, feeling funny
I know you're used to dealing with cats with real money
Also know you like Mase in alot of ways
But it's hard to go on when your lonely on the holidays
When you shop should you shop for two
Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back, treat you like you all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat
You ain't the one out clubbin' all day and all night
Just to save a fight you say what's right
And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in your life
Even though he gave you ice that'll make you his wife
How a man deserve you if he hurt you
How you give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you, you ain't heard that from me
'Cause Mase ain't the player with the PHD

Girl, come into my world
I'll love you the way that you need to be loved
No worries no more, girl open the door
And don't waste your time
'Cause you should be mine

If he don't love you right, don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should, then you should be mine
