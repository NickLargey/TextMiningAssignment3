I hear whispers in the dark
Sayin', "Baby, don't you stop"
Makin' love to you but you're not in my bed

Sexy dreams that stop and start
Voices tearin' me apart
You keep on callin' me, whispers in the dark

You step in the room, close the door
Trail your clothes across the floor, you come to me
Fine as you wanna be, yeah

You slowly turn back the sheets
Slide your body on to me, so sexually
Girl, you don't miss a beat, no

Then when I touch you so sexy, I'll help you get off
I'll make you feel so good, you wanna cry
When I'm deep inside your love

And when you touch me so sexy, my love is like a rock
You say let's get down tonight
But then I awake, I hear whispers in the dark

I hear whispers in the dark
Sayin', "Baby, don't you stop"
Makin' love to you but you're not in my bed

Sexy dreams that stop and start
Voices tearin' me apart
You keep on callin' me, whispers in the dark

Eleven days, my mind replaced
Every word and every move you ever make
Non stop, twenty four play

When I close my eyes, you come to life
Like a vision that just never goes away
Never, never, never baby, I'm goin' crazy

Then when I touch you so sexy, I'll help you get off
I'll make you feel so good, you wanna cry
When I'm deep inside your love

And when you touch me so sexy, my love is like a rock
You say let's get down tonight
But then I awake, I hear whispers in the dark

I hear whispers in the dark
Sayin', "Baby, don't you stop"
Makin' love to you but you're not in my bed

Sexy dreams that stop and start
Voices tearin' me apart
You keep on callin' me, whispers in the dark

[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible] gettin' strong
While the nights can get long

Every time and every moment, [Incomprehensible]
Like a dream you fade away
[Incomprehensible] and I hear whispers oh, in the dark

I hear whispers in the dark
Sayin', "Baby, don't you stop"
Makin' love to you but you're not in my bed

Sexy dreams that stop and start
Voices tearin' me apart
You keep on callin' me, whispers in the dark

I hear whispers in the dark
Sayin', "Baby, don't you stop"
Makin' love to you but you're not in my bed

Sexy dreams that stop and start
Voices tearin' me apart
You keep on callin' me, whispers in the dark

I hear whispers in the dark
Sayin', "Baby, don't you stop"
Makin' love to you but you're not in my bed

Sexy dreams that stop and start
Voices tearin' me apart
You keep on callin' me
