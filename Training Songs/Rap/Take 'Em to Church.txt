Uh, this that Harlem music right here, this that Diddy Bop
Get ready for the winter music right here, this what it is [Incomprehensible]

You know me dog, I just wanna keep the peace
But sayin' my name that's only gon' lead to beef
Tell my niggaz chill but they wanna heat the streets
Or do it on record check it we spit heat to beats

Everybody welcomin' this, welcomin' that
He wasn't welcome in the first place, how we welcome him back?
Gimme that Mack, let me work him wit that
Tell Mr.Rogers I'll leave his brain on the trolley track, now prolly that

Listen, y'all stop it, I know you appalled dot it
But this my call by the false Prophet, all Prophet
Harlem hustle, I can't at all knock it
But you hard when you go in the Lords pocket

What you offerin' put it right in offerin'
They take it all, cash, credit, silver down the porcelain
Look at the Porche he's in and give a portionin'
No handicap, Annie you're orphan friend, friend

But the sizzurp I'm drinkin' on, birds I'm bankin' on
Get Cha Kirk Franklin on, word, so get ya Ben Franklin on
Just when you think it's wrong, one blink he's gone

Father forgive us but we gon' take 'em to Church
Father forgive us and the truth it hurts
Father forgive us and that won't work
No, no, no, no, noway

Yo, you try to handle us, get on the air and damage us
Screamin' out Harlem world, like you ain't just abandon us
Well, let me fill you in, now it's a whole clan of us
Blink so mad he went and beat us Cannibus
Zeek got shot then Zeek locked up
E got killed, be popped up but be hopped up

And still poke out his chest
I'm probation, Doe on house arrest
Right out the flesh, sit in the house rest
He don't pout get 'em gear, in the house we fresh
Not that you care, just get it clear and think
One glare and wink, everyone wearin' pink

I'm the reason that ya two rings are clear, yeah
I'm the reason that ya earrings are square, ya hear
Now, we take trips, casinos' the lovely homes
We check on Lodi mom's, Meano, Huddy Combs
Huh, you tryna' fake wit Cardan, Pardan
We gon' leave him naked like Tarzan

[Incomprehensible]
But we gon' take 'em to Church
Father forgive us and the truth it hurts
Father forgive us and that won't work
No, no, no, no, noway
No, no, no, no, noway

Yo, I kill diamonds get wit pearls, I ain't tryna kid the world
I ain't got beef, when I do I say, get 'em girls
Not at this dog, we just heard the frontin'
Do Harlem a favor, give the churches somethin'

A rec' center, in the winter where the youth can play
They don't even shoot the J, sell drugs shoot his spray
I'm no better still move a duece a day that's two keys, I still move VA
Found the new away, my crew do and say
Fists fights to shoot outs, we won't move away

All my niggas who held it down the last half a decade
My nigga Gruff, Bad 140th, 139th, Black Tone, White Tone
142nd Rell Street and 141st, Tito, my Jamaicans, my Belegians
33 33, Polo grounds, St.Nick Colonial Jurist, Lincoln
Tab, Forster, Johnson, Jeff Wagner, Wilson

East River, The 9, 145th St.Nick, 145th Broadway
Lukas, Taliban, 135th, 118th Manhattan
134th and 8th, powerful what's really popping
Sarge hold your head, Freaky Seeky hold your head

The OBBO, 151st Amsterdam holla at your boy
A.K. Jackie Rob, all my niggas in Harlem
Get your hustle on keep your muzzle strong
I know about the blocks you hustle on
[Inaudible]
