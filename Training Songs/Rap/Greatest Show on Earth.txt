okay listen up gentlemen 
veterans vitamins specimen Letterman 
tell a friend pedalin' 
amphetamine medicine Medalin 
hematology skeleton trojan velatin
reverend see no evil since Solomon
origin motherland 
must I begin babbling?
amphibian oblivion
i'm livin' the life of ten men following a mannequin that leads you
straight into a brick wall you shall fall like Berlin
you believe in oppression lesson learnin' Zen 
gatherin melanin oxygen 
wonder if this never could truly never be comprehended
i bled so sick when down to a mic and a pen
listen
it's the greatest show on earth

the audience is manipulated by the benevolence kind (?????)
poison keen justify recollect sunken boisterous wallow
devoted dominate vanity vanguard assimilation 
accusation aggression stolen light picture convexity contrast 
prepare aware 
humanize imitate overpower initiate 
dispell this spell
transgression transcend transmission
lurking avarice secluded passe mundane fleeced
dim obscure evangelistic prophet 
evoke revoke dominion legend load
flamboyant judgemental swift vex sex decadence and solitude
dude

maybe i should warn you before i storm on you some more
disarm you and reform you 
don't want to harm you or alarm you
but nobody's leavin' here till they stop breathin' and choke
ever since i was a child teethin' and able to speak i spoke heathen
under this tent's the greatest show ever seen ever heard
from the evergreen to the neverland ranch you never dreamed
but you slept and i witnessed it
it's over your head it's way outta your grasp now
you're outta weed outta cash outta gas and you're outta style
outta place and you're outta line and you're outta touch and you're outta
time
and you're outta turn outta tune and you're outta wind 
and you're one outta ten who must be outta their goddamn minds
i'm outta reach i'm outta you're element out of the ordinary outta sight
i'm a outsider 
it's outta my hands i'm outta this world on the mic
and this is the greatest show on earth

Aceyalone sends his wishes to all the frightful night out on the (????)
circus
under the stars electric traveling bazarre/bizarre packed w/laughter
how far do you have to go to see the half-man amphibian show
Mars
sarcasm at it's best but of course the exhibit's droppin' right into your
neighbourhood parking lot structure
colorful gleamin' beamin' neon ferris wheel
the kid in all of us fool
you want a ticket what is magic a woman being sawed in half
and live to talk about it you'll see her spine gyrate
we'll have a gypsy read your palm and tell your fate
we'll have the great bandini's opening act a spoon bender
he'll do his thing kid shook his coat and he dropped a fork
ta da!

it's a concrete forest of course it is of course it is
the lamp posts are the oak trees the street tops are the streams
the natives all stay inside their huts until that bright sun beams
then slowly they crept out to get some air
some argued some screamed some beamed some slept
som re-tatched some wept some hobbled some betrayed
some planted some begged some parted others laughed
some paniced some breathed some movement by the trees
somebody some magical logical something in the loom
some whom shall i say someone is watching every step you take
some doom is waiting for you in the shed
some thought some book some other's point of view
some bled some bland some music by the band
some danced some stood some drunk some (?plight/plotted?)
some plant some growth some joint some exotic
some gather in the end and they bought the farm
some dared some (?apple?) some charm some scared
some hands around your neck some place some (?scapel?)
some trouble some fallin' from beginnin' to end
but never could understand 
the greatest show on earth

it's the greatest show that's ever been
it's the greatest show you've ever seen
