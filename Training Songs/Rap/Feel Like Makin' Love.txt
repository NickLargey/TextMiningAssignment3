I'm sittin' in the park
Watching winter turn to spring

Walkin' in the park 
Watchin' lovers do their thing

It's the time 
I feel like makin' love with you
Its the time 
I feel like makin' dreams come true
When you talk to me 
Speakin' in your sexy tone
When your holdin' me 
I don't want you to let go

It's the time 
I feel like makin' love with you
Its the time 
I feel like makin' dreams come true

It's the time I feel like makin' love with you
Its the time 
I feel like makin' dreams come true
When you talk to me
