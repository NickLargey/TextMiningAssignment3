Baby, I've got many problems
But my momma won't help me solve them
So I come to you (you you)
But your ass don't wanna be bothered
So I come around don't wanna be bothered
So I come around trying to be down
But you're acting like a silly clown
Ask me for $50
Said to myself
Well I'll be damned
Why are you trying to give me such a very very hard time
When I spend the money on you
You can't get a little of the bump and grind
There must be another man (man), holding your hand (hand)
Please tell me
Baby, baby
I will

I'm trying to go on without you here in my life
I don't wanna accept the fact that your no longer mine
Just to know there's somebody else who's holding and kissing you
It makes a guy like me feel like I'm a fool

So girl, I'll do anything
Anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done
I'm sorry for all the things I did, I'm sorry, yes, I am
I'm sorry for all the things I did, I'm sorry, yes, I am

I'm trying to cope with these emotions everyday (day)
I realize it's too late now you're gone away
Is there something that I can do to reassure
That I won't hurt you like this anymore

So I'll do anything
Anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done (tell me one thing I have to do)
I'm sorry for all the things I did I'm sorry, yes, I am

So I'll do anything, anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done 
I'm sorry, I'm begging you, I'm begging me

I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
That's my word is (that's my word is bond)
Please forgive me (can't you tell, can't you tell by the look in my eye)
I'll do anything 
That's my word is bond (I like that)
Please forgive me (please forgive me I'm sorry) 
Everything I've done
I'm sorry

So I'll do anything
Anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done (tell me one thing I have to do)
I'm sorry for all the things I did I'm sorry, yes, I am
