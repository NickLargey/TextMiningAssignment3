[Lady Sovereign]
Yeah!
It's officially the biggest midget in the game
I don't know
Make way for the Sove!

[Chorus: x2]
Love me or hate me, it's still an obsession
Love me or hate me, that is the question
If you love me then, thank you
If you hate me then, f*ck you!

[Missy Elliott]
I'm ridin' like a Range Rover, bitch move over
Wear mo' ice than the bears in the polar
Off my shoulders, ice, baby
Don't the jewelry look, nice, baby
I don't really give a bud
I tell 'em all they can kiss my but
I got three groupies up in the club
I ain't payin' for the tab, pick it UP
I'm a lover, I don't need to fight
Give me time and I'll blow your mind
If you give me two secs to blow your mind
Yeah five plus five, yeah, I'm a dime
Yeah I got twelve cars and I'm a star, OK K?
Them seven digits numbers that's the cash in my bank
I write, I sing, and I do my, do my, do my thing
I dance, romance, and Lady Sovereign tell 'em how it is

[Chorus]

[Lady Sovereign]
Styles mine, hair to the side
Came roll up like Adidas, three stripe
No one got creps like mine
When I step you see that shit shines
I don't show flesh but I'm so fresh to death
But when I wake up early early I got that dirty mornin' breath
Whoops! Might burp in ya face again
My friend don't get offended, m-K?
I'm the realest girl in the game and no I ain't pretendin'
Yeah I got no car but I'm a star OK?
Them seven digit numbers well umm, they're not that far away
Alright, I don't sing, but I do my thing
I don't dance, I just grin, Missy Elliot and sovereign!

[Chorus]

[Lady Sovereign]
Love me or hate me, love me or hate me
Love me or hate me

[Repeat: x2]
So I can't dance and I really can't sing, yeah
I can only do one thing and that must be Lady Sovereign

[Chorus: x2]

[Repeat: x2]
Love me or hate me, love me or hate me
Love me or hate me, love me or hate me
I can only do one thing and that's be Lady Sovereign
