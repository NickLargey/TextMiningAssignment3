I'm not gonna lie, I'm pissed off
My iPhone 5 just got switched off
Cause I don't wanna know him and I don't wanna know you or anybody thats popped up
My phone was ringing and I sat thinking 'What can he give me that I have not already got?'
Then I went to London with a backpack and came back with a suitcase full of brand new stuff
The door to the game just got kicked off
And I ran through with a gang like Rick Ross
Shouting 0161 Manny on the map, I told every mandem he's dog
I was born in the 90's inspired by gangsters
Fascinated by criminal things
I wear Nikes and Trespass pants cause nobody knows what tonight might bring
Anybody comes at me they will get spun around on a Mike Tyson thing
I come here to defeat the boss
What do you think that I'd let M.Bison win?
Them manna dead I'm the next of kings
Their inheritance, money I'm spending
You're looking at Grime 2015, I am the start, middle and ending

Watch them walk with me
Walk with me, Walk with me
Walk with me, Walk with me
I told them watch how they walk with me
Watch them walk with me
Walk with me, Walk with me
Walk with me, Walk with me
I told them watch how they walk with me

I'm not gonna lie I'm stressed out
When everybody telling me that I'm the best out
I just got a million views in 25 days
Do I walk around with a vest now?
Or do I just walk around like it's normal?
It's a shutdown when I walk through town
It's a shutdown when I pick up the mic and I just can't put the microphone down
It's a shutdown when I'm in Footlocker
It's a shutdown when I'm in JD
It's a shutdown when I'm shouting 0161, watch how they walk with me
It's a shutdown when I'm in Footlocker
It's a shutdown when I'm in JD
It's a shutdown when I'm shouting Manny on the map, cause everybody goes crazy
I just wanna chill
But there's no chilling, no such thing as refocusing
When your phone is ringing, texting, WhatsApp message there's no focusing
When you're phone is tweeting, hyping, Instagram liking, likes are rolling in
All this from a Fire In The Booth, It's Charlie's fault, I'm just playing with him

Watch them walk with me
Walk with me, Walk with me
Walk with me, Walk with me
I told them watch how they walk with me
Watch them walk with me
Walk with me, Walk with me
Walk with me, Walk with me
I told them watch how they walk with me
