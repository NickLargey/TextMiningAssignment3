"He's a sweet, soul, brother!"
Money, money, money, money! [Repeat: x2]
"You make me feel so goooood!"
Money, money, money, money!

Money, money, money, money! [Repeat: x3]

[Chorus: Mr. Kane]
In the world of change, here I am
Trying to have some things
So what you need is some game, to get your money man
Oh baby, in the world of paper, paper

[Snoop Dogg]
Thinking of a master plan
Cause ain't nothing but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I, start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smiling, cause still don't nothing move but the money
Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistling this
Feeling out of place cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thing
But without no money man that shit's a dream
Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the DoggHouse, cause I'm paid in full [echoes]

[Chorus]
Money, money, money, money! [Repeat: x3]

[Mr. Kane: x2]
Well
Well
Oh baby
Well
Well, oh baby
Oh baby
