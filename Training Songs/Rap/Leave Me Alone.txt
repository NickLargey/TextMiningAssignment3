Yeah
To all my fans
The people, who don't know..
What I been goin through
To make my, own..

Now it's time to hurt your feelings as I upsets music industry fan
Hey yo my man, look at my hand, they look human right?
You think I'm a monster, ill circus clown
Not a specimen, don't look at me funny when I come around
A&R been tryin to figure me out for years
Tryin to re-duplicate me but they can't so they hate me
While white boys run the head of black music with a Japanese assistant
What does a Chinese kid know about the rap game? That's a shame
As I see and watch on BET
There's a million uncreative rappers tryin to be me
I'm startin to feel like Jimi Hendrix
When they covered the story who started rock
Magazines put blankets over my interviews
They don't want to see me on channel 7 news, tellin the truth
Off the project roof, they always have secret spies with eyes
Watchin me recordin my album, send in producers with wack tracks
And DAT's, messin up my whole format
Can you imagine somethin on the kneeboard with Con-Funk-Shun?
With an alternative hippie kid from the record label watchin your back
Talkin about, "Mariah Carey's funky,"
Makin the average group buckdance like a barrel full of monkies
While I break out to shoppin mall he's makin a quick phone call
About my sound is too new and different
I need to be regular like Dru Hill and a little more ill
(Hey Keith, we want you to be ill)

OF COURSE I'm hard to work with cause you hard to work with
I don't want to meet Insane Clown Posse and collaborate
I'm tryin to innovate and think quick at a fast rate
Why you mad cause I'm original - you can't do the material
When I sit back and watch you act big
Spend your budget on your video
I'm in one of my three luxury apartments eatin Raisin Bran cereal
While you front low, I take my bike ride down to Wells Fargo
How long is it gon' take, nine-hundred-thousand in clear
Takin with a clear, I don't need a Benz this year
Took care of my paperwork
Takin United Taxi out to Vegas
While the average R&B group is doin a promo concert
Ignorin your phone calls from broke labels
Who try to put out underground MC's
Tryin to get me to rap on a wack jazz track for one G
How dare you try to insult me?
I got 40 grand for three minutes to write a song with Prodigy
Other crews don't get budget, got the nerve to call me
Welcome to the business, stand as a witness
Work on your stomach, do physical fitness
I ain't playin, all this African stuff all look the same
I don't need a Joey Neckbone puttin his artwork on my CD
Drawin Apple Jacks and Honeycomb with me sittin on the throne
No I'm takin a regular picture by the hotel St. Bonaventure
Besides I do wear a coat in the winter
And eat at beautiful restaurants

Why you think I should wear a motorcycle helmet??
Why don't you wear it?! Put on some wings like a PARROT
Let's discuss this contract
Why are you hypin up a normal female group with fat cellulite
That sound wack? Most of why'all goin out like Uncle Tom's
Like Louis Armstrong
Wearin a tattoo and goin onstage like Tracy Chapman
I cancelled a big tour cause I was prepared
Why'all on the road with per diem money and why'all scared
While why'all walk and look hard
Your manager got his name all over your Versatile card
And plus this video treatment sucks
The fish lens effects, the lens to the camera only cost a hundred bucks
Look at the director, tryin to tell me what to do
I done this before, 14 degrees freezin cold
Doin _Poppa Large_ with a cage on my head, that's dead
Don't get your imagination too messed up
I'm wearin a Yankee hat and a Starter I'm not dressin up
How you gonna tell me what to wear?!
I don't need mascara and a stylist
Save that for a big rock group like Pantera
Experience, Next Plateau, Mercury, Wild Pitch, EMI, Capitol, DreamWorks
Never got dropped
Put my lyrics away and stopped
Too many people with hands in my projects
Havin fantasies of me bein Superman you bein stupid man
I'm like Prince, you might see me once every five years
At the record company
While most of why'all live at the label
Beggin for your rent and car notes to be paid
Under the table, doin routine dances for advances
(Ooh, you get involved!)
