Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
I look up, I said I think it's time to kill it

Bitch I'm sexy as f*ck, you ain't even gotta tell me
I ride around to Pac, I f*ck my girl to R. Kelly
Tell her make me a sandwich, no pb and jelly
She look back like "Goddamn, what you think this? A deli?"
I'm screaming "Hell yeah trick, Hell yeah whoa"
That shit make her love me more, and she know I love her too
She know I been to hell and through, I need what Reverends do
Power of the revenue got me up 2 to 10, and 10 to 2
I gotta shine boy I be a star, on fire that's a meteor
So I'm either or on TV with a Rita Ora set your DVR
Stacking money face to face what that mean CPR
Everyday the day date, gang bang major pain
D-Town I ride around, me and my dog like Charlie Brown
Just trying to get that white money you know, countin' cake and KK's
On a day to day to day base, then vacay for eight days, ooh
You know mutha f*ck taking a vacation
Put palm trees up in my house and have a stay-cation
Getting paid while I'm chilling that's a paid-cation
Full glass of champagne, oh no, you can't taste it

I seen cars (switch up)
Seen Hoes (switch up)
Seen Money all switch up
When the days get dimmer
Who gon' leave you there and who gon' leave with ya
This is for the ones that's always riding with ya ain't switched
I ain't switch up naw naw I ain't switched up
The same me, naw naw I ain't
Switch up
The same team, naw naw I ain't switch up, I ain't switch up
I think it's time to kill it

Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
I said I think its time to kill it

Bought a Cadillac, now I’m Cadillac Com
She ride alright, when I'm riding right, Put a Cadillac on that lawn
Might even let her meet Ye, might even let her meet Sean
Might even let her meet Push, she never meet my Mom
Chi Town is my town, I ride around like I'm lying down
South side my eyes down, I'm the shit y'all fly around(Oww)
I’m in my mode today, sayin' what the f*ck I’m ‘posed to say
Moving making money, got them trash bags back
Smoke Chibahs with leaders, Pussy sweeter and I'll eat her
Got strippers and Divas, Plus some Cougars and Cheetahs
Oh you with GOOD, put me on like Benita
I said ease up, ease up, ease up
Ain’t anybody fucking with my clique

And all these bad bitches man, they want the

All I care bout's my crew, my family and women
Except these women that’s hoeing, and these hoes that be stealing
Trying to get them a cut, that’s how you end up with stitches
I tell a bitch quit playing, and play ya position
Either move or get devoured, f*ck a coward
I be fresher than these motherfuckers head to toe
If I rocked Eddie Bauer, but I don't
Aura Gold, everything I do I do it overboard Michael Phelps splash,
Smile for the Polaroid, self-employed
Now you shelf employed, D-Boy
Never sold, but I still got more lines than corduroy
And I'm with the same crew until I'm a old man
'Cause there no such thing as new old friends

I seen cars (switch up)
Seen hoes (switch up)
Seen money all switch up
When the days get dimmer
Who gon' leave you there and who gon' leave with ya
This is for the ones that's always riding with ya ain't switched
I ain't switch up naw naw I ain't switched up
The same me, naw naw I ain't
Switch up
The same team, naw naw I ain't switch up, I ain't switch up
I think it's time to kill it

Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
I said I think its time to kill it

Rollin' with the same team I ain't switched shit
Rollin' with the same team I ain't switched shit
I'm with the same OG's
The same home team, and you know my team
Ain't switched

I said I think it's time to kill it!
