I couldn't have done it better
I couldn't have done this shit any other way
I made it now when they tried to convince me to make it another day
Glad I can see another day
I do this shit for my squad, my home team
My family, f*ck what another say

I'm here now, it's all clear now
Somebody pour up
I'm eating good y'all can't see my competition til I throw up
I'm tore up but I keep shit 100
That's from the toes up
Last night it felt like I ran through four clubs
Stood on the couch and everyone of em' screaming out
"Hoes down and bros up"
It's different when we show up, kicking doors up
I'm a young Stunna, young Wayne, I'm Young Money
I'm growned up like I'm new here but I'm nuclear
That's a bomb threat mothafucker, watch how blow up

I'm good, I'm reminded I'm good
From time to time I'm fine
I be spending time with the Greatest Of All Time all the time
And ever since I'm living life every night like it's '99
I'm way ahead of my time I think I was only 8 at that time
I rep them five letters forever
Will someone just tell the bartender to mix my drink
While I mix my thoughts of business in pleasure, I'm clever
Long money all around me
I just hope I live long enough, long enough to measure
We should take pictures sippin' Cristal in COOGI sweaters
And I'm still getting better nigga, what's better?
They said I never do it now I'm looking around like, nigga what's never?
And now they run from us when they see us, boy that money's pressure
Plots on the wall of every building that I walk into
Phone taps 'cause they curious, careful what you talk into
Living the star life you'll never know you'll run into
Like baby I can change your life
Just leave everything that you been through and rise

Long as my niggas right then we alright
Long as the women right then we alright
Long as the drinks on ice then we alright
Long as these private flights then we alright
Long as we living right then we alright
Long as it's high life then we alright
'Cause I love it more than anything (anything)
Boy it's money over everything, we've been alright

Yea, it's money over everything
We motivated, flying over everything
We make something out of nuttin, what up 5?
Bag full of every president that ever died
Yea, spraying everything that's in the way
We eating over here extended clips, 50 plates
It's a lifestyle, stunna life, everyday
A million ones we can throw this shit a million ways
Youngin, if you alright then we alright
Night life GTV popping every night
Fly rich in a different city bright lights
With my niggas, rich gang and living high life
Yea, guns in the basement, millions in the wall, GTV cases
If it's f*ck em' then it's f*ck em' all
Audemars and cigars and them new toys

Long as my niggas right then we alright
Long as the women right then we alright
Long as the drinks on ice then we alright
Long as these private flights then we alright
Long as we living right then we alright
Long as it's high life then we alright
'Cause I love it more than anything
Boy it's money over everything, we been alright

Do this shit for riz-zeal
Young Money, Rich Gang, ya heard me, with big ears
You just a crocodile, I drink a full cup of his tears
Can’t recognize you nigga, like Santa cut off his beard
And Tunechi, he gon’ be alright as long as he got his pills
I’m higher than my bitch bill, stop cryin bout' em', bitch chill
And I'm working on that Carter 5, I got this bitch in fifth gear
I can't stand these niggas, I'ma lie down or sit still
Get tied down with that fucking steel, at your eyebrow or your fucking grill
Catch you while you layed up, straight up, bunny ears
I shoot your fucking fade up, badges don't touch me
If that pussy smell like cat fish salmon trout or guppies
I ain't trippin on no ho, treat that ho like a servant
I know that ho better know, how to deep throat like a serpent
But lose lips shink ships, but I just let these hoes Worship
She think I'm a window of opportunity, close curtains, Tunechi

If my niggas right then we alright
If the women right then we alright (we alright)
Them drinks on ice then we alright (we alright)
If it's private flights then we alright (alright alright)
Long as we living right then we alright (alright alright)
Long as it's high life then we alright (alright alright)
'Cause I love it more than anything
Boy it's money over everything, we been alright

Yeah long as my niggas right then we alright (we alright)
