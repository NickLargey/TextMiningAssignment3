Oh ooh

For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin
It's time to sink or swim
Watch 'em play for ya
For you I'd be (Whoa)
Runnin' a thousand miles
Just get you where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot but coming from you
I admit I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine

I know that I won't be the first one
Given you all this attention
Baby listen

I just need somebody to love
I-I don't need too much
Just need somebody to love
(Somebody to love)
I don't need nothing else
I promise girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love.
I need somebody I-I need somebody
I need somebody I-I need somebody

Everyday I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds
Smile for me (Smile for me)
I would take
Every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime
Step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot but coming from you
I admit I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine

I know I won't be the first one
Given you all this attention
But baby listen

I just need somebody to love (Oh, no no no no)
I-I don't need too much
Just need somebody to love
(Somebody to love)
I don't need nothing else
I promise girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love

I need somebody I-I need somebody
I need somebody I-I need somebody
(Somebody to love)
I need somebody I-I need somebody
I need somebody I-I need somebody

And you can have it all
Anything you want I can bring
Give you the finer things, yeah

But what I really want
I can't find 'cause, money can't find me
Somebody to love (Oh)

Find me somebody to love (Oh)

I need somebody to love (Yeah)
I-I don't need too much
Just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else,
I promise girl I swear,
I just need somebody to love

I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
(Somebody to love)
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody (I swear I just need somebody to love)
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody

Is she out there?

Is she out there?

I just need somebody to love
J-B you are, yeah man
