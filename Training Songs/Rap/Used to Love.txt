Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh

Now baby I been thinking 
Bout how you been acting strange
And baby I been thinking 
How so many things have changed
In my life, in my home, in my bed
Said I remember how you used to love

How you used to love, you don't love no more
How you used to care, you don't care no more
That's alright, that's OK
Drop the key on your way
Catch a bus, ride the train
It doesn't matter just keep going

Now boy I can remember how I used to foot the bill
And yes I do regret the day I took your broke ass in
To my life, to my home, to my bed
Said that I must have lost my head

I guess you thought 
That I'd let you walk on me like the floor
I guess you thought 
That you'd keep tracking dirt inside my door
You got it all wrong
It's been too long 
All of the love is gone
Now I'm singing you this song

How you used to love, you don't love no more
How you used to care, you don't care no more
That's alright, that's OK
Drop the key on your way
Grab a bus, ride the train
It doesn't matter just keep going

How you used to love, you don't love no more
How you used to care, you don't care no more
That's alright, that's OK
Drop the keys on your way
Grab a bus, ride the train
It doesn't matter just keep going

You must have thought 
That you were getting over for so long
But I was giving you the chance 
To make things right from being so wrong
But your time is up, took too long, 
I don't want to hear it
Get your shirt, shoes, pants 
And draws up from outta here

Oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh ooh whoa
Woo woo oh

Like you used to love, you don't love no more
How you used to care, you don't care no more
That's alright, that's OK
Drop the keys on your way
Grab a bus, ride the train
It doesn't matter just keep going

How you used to love, you don't love no more
How you used to care, you don't care no more
That's alright, that's OK
Drop the keys on your way
Grab a bus, ride the train
It doesn't matter just keep going

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
