Oh

Damn
I just keep thinking about you (oh, baby)
I mean I wanna move on, but I can't move on (oh)
It's like you have some kind of hold on me, and I don't know (oh, oh, oh, oh)
But I'm a go ahead and talk about it
Listen

I'm sitting, looking out the window like damn
Trying a fix this situation that's at hand
You still running through my mind when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be
Me all on yo' mind, and I'm knowing that it couldn't be
'Cause you ain't call, and I ain't even appalled
I still got a lot of pain, I ain't dealt wit' it all
I been running round with other chicks
I'm single, and they loving it
I'm liking it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it, I'm tryin' a let you know I can't
Get a grip of it is what I'm tryin' a let you know
You got a hold or some kind of control of me
I don't know what it is, but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm working at it, and it ain't getting no better
Just tryin' a be like, yeah, forget it, whatever
Instead of staring out this glass looking at this bad weather
Damn, I gotta pull myself together
'Cause

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick
Outta town visits
All the time we spent together makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)
You don't even understand (damn)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

I'm too attached, my heart won't let me fall back
I got it bad, that's what you can call that (ah)
When I see you in the streets, that's the worst for me
Used to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you on my pager
Know what you doing, where you at, or can I see you later? (Can I see you later?)
The fellas telling me 'just let her go, Bow.'
Believe me, I'm trying, man
I just don't know how
(Just don't know how)
I be in all the top spots, leaving with the hot shots
Knowing they just want me 'cause I'm in the top spot
That's not poppin', and my brain ain't stopping thinking
Who she with, or where she going; is she club hoppin'?
I never had this kind of problem in my life
This is my first time dealing with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and every time you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right, cause

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick
Outta town visits
All the time we spent together makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)
You don't even understand (damn)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

Is it wrong for me to feel this way?
You been running through my mind all day
Can you feel me?
I been tryin' a get you off my mind, but I can't after all this time
That's what kills me
Is it wrong for me to feel this way?
You been running through my mind all day
Can you feel me?
I been tryin' a get you off my mind, but I can't after all this time
And it kills me

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick
Outta town visits
All the time we spent together makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)
You don't even understand (damn)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole lives planned out together (oh, oh, oh, oh)
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did
But now I guess I gotta move on, right?
It's still hard, and I still love you till this day
Peace
