Swiss, Po
Respect our gangsta nigga
Lay down

What you know bout holding out big Tec.
Big vest , hollow tips all up in the kid Neck
Po live it up, yellow stones lid it Up
Long Johns (siggaz) tuck, it's the kid nigga What
Some of ya rap niggas is girls
On my dick yapping, flappin'
Fucking cartoons,
These niggas guns don't go off
Until they say lights, camera, action
Yo Swiss tell them niggas eat a Dick
Gun up in yo face, bitch that Reary won't Miss
Unload the shit then reload the shit
Head str8 to the airport and unload sum Bricks
No lyin', you niggas seem me comin down to shoot ya
Think I was flyin', 12 syllabus

Yea I'm talking to you. Fuckin Dick Blowa

[Chorus:]
Fo all of ya'll, keepin ya'll in Health
Juss to see you wildin and enjoy Yoself
'cause it's cool when you fuckin wit a nigga like me
Cool when you ridin' wit a nigga like me
To all my (money makin) bitches juss Shine
To all my niggas keepin it gully juss Shine
To all the ghettos in America, ohh Shine

All I need in this world of sin
Is a crooked lawyer, big rims and a Mac. 10
Ridin' through the city like I'm used to this Shit
F*ck yo vest nigga, my cells will chew through that Shit
Catch a breath, you ain't heard bout that nigga Po
Murdah cases diamond faces, Mat-hat-lo'
Leavin' pieces of yo brian on yo car Do'
Lookin gully in that Bent.on that R.O.
L.L. see you niggas in Hell
Soon as they set my bell, I make another Cell
Shiet I set my mind at a the early age
I was gon' be paid or early graved
Whatta f*ck I got-ta have, blocks to smash
Lots a cash, drop sum Ass
This iz the truth, I probebly die in my Coup
But I bet you and them bitches that come to get me, I Shoot

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I got my mind on the Shipment
Shipment on my Mind
Bout to meet these Dominican niggas at 9
Rhyme, rap, what to f*ck is That
Only thing I rap is Ye, nigga die Today
Ya got it confused I ain't trying to fill nobody's Shoes
I'm just looking fo connects nigga
Doin' what I Do
Back against the wall
Against all odds
Tune in to my Live nigga, this shit is sicka then OZ
Fightin' 'gainst them Crackaz

No where to run, so I grab my Gun
N' start blazin', this shit got a nigga Agin'

A G. faithfully, momma pray for Me
Lil nigga go to school, stay away from Me
Got hoez fo you hustlaz
Bullets fo you cowards
N' dick fo you bitches up in the Trunk-Tower

[Chorus]
