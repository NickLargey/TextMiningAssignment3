We used to play jump the line,
Or who could wrap the swing around the frame the most times, back in the day,
Riding our bike around the estate and playin' basketball in the cage, those were the days,
I remember them water fights, the tap outside,
Used to race our bikes,
Grinnin' with two front teeth missing we did what we liked,
Those days I'm missin', those days were alright,
Knock down ginger,
Knock knock then shift,
Two minute later we got locked in the lift,
Laughing when we got out,
Got into silly arguments about who found the pound on the ground,
Bopped to the shops bought about ten ice pops,
The weather was hot so they melted in our pockets,
Used to carry my belongings in them McDonald's bumbags,
That was back then so boy don't mock it.

[Chorus]
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I could never regret,
Yeah Yeah,
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah Yeah,
Those were the days.

Used to race down the hill in old Safeway trolleys,
I wasn't indoors playing with Barbies or dollies,
I was outside jumpin' off walls or playin' foot ball,
Or getting chased by the local pitbull,
The odd character that every borough had,
Mad Phillip, Ginger beard or Mad Max,
The face you wouldn't wanna see when you're on your jacks,
In the places you wouldn't be in if you stuck to your packs,
Stayed out till it was pitch black,
Sprayed my name out on concrete slabs,
And I never got bitch-slapped,
Seen a couple of mans get stabbed,
Been chased by the mad man,
Gotta get back so I can..
Catch a joke with my next door neightbour,
We played the first Mortal Kombat on the Sega,
Playing the latest jungle tunes we had on cassette,
Those were the days I will never forget

[Chorus]

Remember naf naf jackets and spliffy jeans,
Adidas campus them things were in,
It wasn't about the king of the bling,
It was about the king of rim or the king of the swing,
Back then well I kinda had less,
But less was much better cause it saved a lot of stress,
I hung out in Coffers community center,
Now they've knocked it down and replaced it with an Asda,
My parents way of tellin' us to get our backs in,
Was them sounding some old fucking claxon,
We soldier marched back up to Redcliffe walk,
Chalkhill Estate don't exist no more it's just talk.

[Chorus]
