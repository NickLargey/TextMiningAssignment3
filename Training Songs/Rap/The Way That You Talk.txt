It's scary, I'm Miss Up's to da area
So So Def, next to Jay D
This funkdafide baby keep 'em crazy
My mentality happen to be livin' lavish
With formalities of having the fat shit
My status is impeccable
We wreckin' yo crew, the casualty is you
Jagged Edge coming through
Remember who

Hit it, did it something like a thousand times
Can't stop, can't quit
Gotta, gotta get mine
Get yours

I catch you off guard
Keep yo dick hard
Follow the yellow bitch
To the road to riches
And if the smoke thickens
It's to be the beat
Or it detrimental to your brain
Choakin' off Mary Jane
A.T. lettin' it ill, say 'kay
And kept it wetter than Niagra
The main dame who maintain to stay platinum, yeah, aww

We talking, me touchin you and your body
We even talkin' 'bout you and your other guys
I like it when you tell me what you'd do if I was with you
I like it 'cause you have nothin' to hide

The way that you talk to me
The things that you say to me
You got my body girl
Have your way with me
I'm tellin' you now
There's something about
Girl, I can't live without
The way you talk to me

We talking 'bout dreams you have about you and I
You tell me things I did to you once I got up inside
You make me look forward to the future
Wanna have a wife and kid
'Cause all the time that I been gettin' around
I never felt like this, yeah

I know you know baby, how much I love you
I love you, you love me, and I know
Baby, I know (whoa, whoa)

It's all about the poom poom nanny nanny
And mo' money
With me pink bunny and the G
You just in the D J.E. era
Chromed out carreras
Sex, boozin', and nonstop I flow watch out
Gimme some chrystal, a sip or so
You can send 'em all back
The type that walk up in the club screamin'
Where the ho's at
Tracks stay steaming, keep your floors packed
Diamonds stay gleeming and you're no match
For me and my faculty
Actually all y'all are whacked to me
Send me some some true playa's, with true rank
Don't give a damn what you think
Make a bet and I'll stop yo' bank, baby
You dress jiggy, body bomdigi
Then it's a possiblity that you and I can get busy
What you wanna do, shit
I got a pocket full of rubbers, and Jay D. do too

The way that you talk to me
The things that you say to me
You got my body girl
Have your way with me
I'm tellin' you now
There's something about
Girl, I can't live without
The way you talk to me

Make you scream papa
You the best da da
Make you scream papa
You the best da da
Make you scream papa
You the best da da
