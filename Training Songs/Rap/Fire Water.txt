featuring Noreaga 
[Noreaga] 
Yeah yeah 
Niggaz is travellin everywhere word up 
I perform in the South 
You know I put on _Fish'N'Grits_ and shit like that ya heard? 
Word up; I perform in the West I put on.. 
_Ain't Nuttin Like a Sunny Day in Cali For Ni A_ ya heard? 
I'm on the East I'm rockin _T.O.N.Y._ 
In the Midwest I put on a little No Limit or some shit like that 
Word is bond 

Chorus: Crooked Lettaz 
We got that firewater (WHAT?)

We got that firewater (WHAT?)

[Noreaga] 
Yo, yo 
Yo I'msa gangsta, so y'all niggaz, know that I mask 
I smoke, mad weed, while I drink a V-8 splash 
Niggaz, f*ck with me, and you will get smashed 
I'm gettin, head in the whip, and I won't even crash 
I'm sayin, niggaz don't f*ck no mo', all we get is head 
Niggaz don't play with bread and butter, all we count is bread 
My niggaz from, Mississipp-I, still get high 
Off the water-water, slangin quarter-quarter 
across the border border, Seargeant Slaughter Slaughter 
My Down South niggaz, yo we got mad game 
And we both, from the ghetto, so we kick it the same 
You call your weed chronic, we call our weed hydro 
You call your shit doja, we call out shit gamble 
From the Calliope to Iraq, we still get dough 
We call a, bitch is a bitch, and a hoe is a hoe 
Penalty the label, in New York, we on cable 

Chorus 
[Crooked Lettaz 1] 
Check it out 
Basically, you silly niggaz ain't facin me 
I turn my back and then you chase me hate me daily 
And you attempt to limp like youse a pimp 
but youse a shrimp, you can't play me 
See we the brothers with the hot tracks 
Puttin butter on the hot wax 
You want to ball with the top cats 
Well you talk about fat gats 
You can't rap nigga stop that, got that 
You want to act like you cock back 
Couldn't hold a nigga jockstrap 
We can take it to the streets when the party people meet 
tell the niggaz take a seat take a beat and cold rock that 
back to the M-I, mill'n-dol'-mill'n-dol'-I 
mill'n-dol'-mill'n-dol'-I, humpback, humpback 
Watch a nigga jump back, dead I 
Spittin that upon the red eye, flyin to the N.Y. 
Niggaz high from coast to coast 
Keepin it close, put it in a post 
E.T. the coach, niggaz want to be me the most 
You boast and brag and sport the sag 
cause I dope rhyme, niggaz never want to quote rhymes 
Try to bite and then you choke rhyme 
Rollin up a smoke rhyme 
Comin out with your wrote rhyme 
Ain't nuttin but some broke rhymes 
Me I got the right rhymes, always comin out tight rhymes 
Break a nigga see the light rhymes 
want to fight rhymes? Naw nigga not tonight rhymes 
Get your girl I just might rhyme 
And the story go, for the thugs even Nore know 
the gory flow, can't be faded 
Prayed it down, laid it down, and I'm gone 
Take double-steps turn around and show em 

Chorus 
[Crooked Lettaz 2] 
Now it's that Crooked Letta hot shit 
Old block rockin locked quick 
Rhymes shined with hot spit 
y'all speak about shine I write rhymes 
then I burn clicks, and give em this 
Your platinum plaque's counterfeit 
You shipped gold, is what I was told 
Your airplay was BOUGHT hits 
Payola Motorala cell phones 
where you spent all these ends, then he's gone 
in the wind POOF, ain't no PROOF, a super sleuth 
couldn't find his shoes 
I wrap heads, like bad news 
And bust bass and blow a fuse 
Then I move to Baton Rouge like, Snoop on the move 
I'm like Megatron, an underground rap shit phenomenon 
I blow up in my Prime (and after that?) 
Then I move to Cybertron, with Omega Supreme 
But it seems that I gotta sit back and pray (back and pray) 
to God that these niggaz won't take me away (why?) 
I say it seems that I gotta sit back and pray 
to God that these niggaz won't take me away 

Chorus 
[Noreaga] 
Firewater HUH?

If y'all niggaz ain't got a car wash

And get the inside done up, you feel?
