Yeah,come on Motown!
Girls help me sing it
Tell me your name
(Cauz i want to know)
What car do you drive
(Tell me where can we go)
How much money do you make
(How can i be down)
As long as you have 
(I'll be around)
Most guys they come as dime a dozen
And they always try to get with me
Don't think that i'm an opitimist
I fall in love betcha not for free
So baby tell me

[Chorus]
Most guys they think that i'm a user
They think i take and then i never give
It's time for girls to make a statement
I'm going for mine, This lady's got to live
Oh! Tell Me!

[Chorus x2]
If you want me
Then i must see
You'll give me any and everything that i need baby
I'll fall in love
If love was meant
Cause ain't nuthin goin' on but the rent
So Tell Me!
([Chorus] til out)
