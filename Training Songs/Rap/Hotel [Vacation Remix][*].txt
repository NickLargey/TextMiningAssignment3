We got Cassidy in here, Kels! We not throwbacks

Girl you wanna come to my hotel
Baby I will leave you my room key
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl
And I wanna get with you 'cuz you's a cutie

So if you wanna come to my hotel
All you gotta do is holler at me
'Cuz we're having an after party
Checkin' out 6 in the mornin'
