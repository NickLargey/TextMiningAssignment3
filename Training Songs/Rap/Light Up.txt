There's nothing wrong with getting a buzz on

And light up like a motherfucker hot
And light up when this motherfucker drops
(Rocky Mountain, mountain high, Colorado)
(Rocky-rocky-rocky Mountain, mountain high, Colorado)
And light up like a motherfucker load
And light up like this motherfucker blow
(Rocky Mountain, climbing high, Colorado)
(Rocky-rocky-rocky Mountain, climbing high, Colorado)

And let me hit that g 'fore it goes, oh
Don't be so, so stingy
Just pass it on the left
And let me hit that g 'fore it goes, oh
Ooh, like a motherfucker hot
Everybody, let's go

I did this one for the stone heads
And the motherfuckers with the strong weed
Oh, shit, my weed man phone dead
See that's why I need to start growing my own weed
I'm like, "Oh my goodness, I don't smoke bullshit"
If you sober, don't judge me, leave it up to the jury
Smoke medicinal weed like I'm tryna cure shit
And I feel better than alligators with good skin
She roll my weed for me, hold my weed for me
She hold that shit, them other bitches got weak stomachs
I don't smoke hookah, I don't know the future
But last night was nuts, and it never got neutered
It go smell it like you buy it light it, hit it
Mix it with the Hash, now we getting scientific
Psychedelic grass, I feel like the highest cricket
Just a pot head, weed stanky like a pot to piss in, holla at me

And light up like a motherfucker hot
And light up when this motherfucker drops
(Rocky Mountain, mountain high, Colorado)
(Rocky-rocky-rocky Mountain, mountain high, Colorado)
And light up like a motherfucker load
And light up like this motherfucker blow

And let me hit that g 'fore it goes, oh
Don't be so, so stingy
Just pass it on the left
And let me hit that g 'fore it goes, oh
Ooh, like a motherfucker hot
Now everybody, put one one in the air now

Okay, I'm smokin' strong, we smokin' strong
Living that pot head life, my nigga, my stove is on
I got them suicide doors and they look like open arms
My nigga T in this bitch, I save all my rolls just for him
Okay, my pusher stay lowkey, my kush is a OG
I don't smoke regular like I don't eat whole wheat
I don't smoke men either
I got two bad bitches named Indica and Sativa
And we 'bout to have a threesome, alright
I'm in need of light
My high coming down, I feel like I'm eating right
Marijuana should be legal, I'ma fight for equal rights
I think I can, I think I can, got a nigga thinking twice
Coming straight from Cloud 9 like a lightning strike
Hit the blunt two times, then go nighty-night
She just want to open up, girl here's a blunt and be you
She just want to smoke and f*ck
I said, "Girl, that's all that we do", yeah

Light up like a motherfucker hot
