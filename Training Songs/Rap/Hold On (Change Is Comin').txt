Alright, oh yeah
Well, oh yeah
Here's we go y'all
Singin' out the message for those of y'all
Who think feel like you're strugglin'
It's a simple song

Yesterday, a man step to me
He said, "How can you smile
When your world is crumbling down?"
I said, "Here's my secret, when I wanna cry
I take a look around and I see that I'm getting by"

And hold on
(Hold on)
A change is coming
(Change is coming)

Hold on
(Hold on)
Don't you worry
(Don't worry 'bout a thing)

Hold on
(Hold on)
You can make it
(You can make it)

Hold on
(Hold on)
Everything
(Everything will be alright)

Some people like to worry
Some people like hide
Some people like to run away
From the pain inside

Now it's your business
Do whatever you wanna do
But if it don't work out
Here's what you oughta do

Now just hold on
(Hold on)
A change is coming
(Change is coming)

Hold on
(Hold on)
Don't you worry
(Don't worry 'bout a thing)

Hold on
(Hold on)
You can make it
(You can make it)

Now hold on
(Hold on)
Everything's gonna be alright
(Everything will be alright)

When the troubles of life weigh you down
Just lift your head up, yeah, yeah
When the love you seek is hard to find
Don't give up, just keep strong, keep the faith

And hold on
(Hold on)
A change is coming
(Change is coming)

Hold on
(Hold on)
(Don't worry 'bout a thing)

Hold on
You can make it
(You can make it)
Hold on
(Hold on)
Everything will be alright

Here's the little simple song, y'all
When the trouble seem like they just won't go away
Friends let you down, things gettin' bounced around
Here's the little lullaby we like to sing
And it goes a little like this, come on, listen
