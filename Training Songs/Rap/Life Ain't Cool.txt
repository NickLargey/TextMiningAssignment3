[Featuring Master P  Silkk The Shocker] 
[Master P] 
Ain't No Woman Like My Momma (12x) 
[Chorus] 
Momma Life Ain't Cool 
Tell Me What Would I Do Without You (2x) 
[Master P] 
Lookin' With The Homies 
Remenising Bout The Old Days 
Cookin' Dinner In Your Kitchen 
Listenin' To The Barcades 
When I Was Sick You Came Got Me From School 
When I Got Suspended Momma  You Taught Me The Rules 
And Even Though I Never Had A Daddy 
But Momma Always Took Me Where I Needed To Go 
In The Old School Caddy 
A Single Parent On Wellfare (Wellfare) 
And Even Though Times Were Hard 
Momma Made Sure We Remem His Death 
And We Couldn't Afford Name Brands (Name Brands) 
But Momma Kept Her Kids Neat 
That's Why We Understand 
And Momma Even Rode The Grey Hound (Grey Hound) 
To See Her Little Man, When He Was Locked Down 
And Even Though I Lived The Street Life 
Momma Pray For Her Baby, Hope He Get His Mind Right 
It Feel Good To See Momma On The Top 
I Told Ya If I Make It Momma 
You Won't Be Forgot 
[Master P] 
Ain't No Woman Like My Momma (4x) 
[Chorus] 
Momma Life Ain't Cool 
Tell Me What Would I Do Without You (2x) 
[Mystikal] 
I Thank God For Keepin' You Strong 
But You Keep Me Strong 
Thangs Would Be Different If Momma Wasn't Home 
Who Would Fix The Grits, And The Eggs And Smoked Sasuage 
Teach Me, And Love Me, And Raise Me, And Watch Me 
Who Would Lift My Tears When I Get Sad 
Discipline Me When I Need A Striaght Whip In My Ass 
I Was Seven Years Old When I Lost Dad 
Tryin' To Get Self, In Fact 
But I Was To Young One To Understand 
Who Would Take The Slack And Carry The Load 
Make Ends Meet And Be Working In The Crossing Stones 
Who The Single Parent, To Me And My Big Sister 
They Had Me Happy On My Birthday 
And Merry At Christmas 
Who Took Care, Did Everythang For Us 
If I Didn't Leave, Just because 
We Was Yours 
She Was Ours 
Who Was Still Sweet When Everything Went Sour 
[Chorus] 
Momma Life Ain't Cool 
Tell Me What Could I Do Without You (2x) 
[Master P] 
Ain't No Woman Life My Momma (6x) 
[Silkk The Shocker] 
I Couldn't Imagine Gettin' This Far Without You 
Even When The Bills Was Due 
You Found A Way To Come Through 
Even Though When We Had Money 
We Seemed Rich, Yeah We Tell Each Other 
Me, My Sisters And Brothers To Forget The Other Shit 
You Was Side By Side When I Was Sick 
Early In The Mornin' Cookin' Eggs And Grits 
You's Was The First One Up 
You's Was The Last One Asleep 
Made Sure We Had Something To Eat 
You's Was The Last One To Eat 
Couldn't Live Our Lives For Us 
You Have To Let Us Know 
You Wanted To Tell Us 
But You Had To Just Let Us Grow 
We Knows Now You Had To Let Us Go 
You's Was Going Through Some Things Ma 
But You Never Let It Show 
And I Only Give One To You 
So I; 
I Cherish The Times 
Don't Know How To Tell You How Much You Meant To Me 
So I Wrote It In Lines 
So Wherever You At 
Hope You Doing Fine 
You Did So Much For Me Then 
I Say Thanks For The Time 
[Chorus] 
Momma Life Ain't Cool 
Tell Me What Would I Do Without You (4x) 
[Master P] 
Ugh.. 
Ain't No Woman Like My Momma (5x) 
that's Why I Love My Momma
