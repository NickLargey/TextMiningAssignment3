With Lester Cane's revenge complete
There's only one thing left to do
Logan begs him to stop, but Lester does not listen
He puts the gun to his head, and pulls the trigger
Killing himself with honor
Seconds before Lester's final breath escapes his body
Ghostface becomes consumed by a diabolical revelation
Inhabit the flesh of his young son, and he could live as a reincarnated Tony Starks

I'm taking the soul of my son
Live through the eyes of my young
We gon' rule, conquer, pillage and destroy
Bulletproof blast through alloys
But first things first with the worst
Logan, I'm about to quench ya thirst
Put two to your head, leak brainal fluid
(Oh please! Stop, don't do it!)
Bang bang,no more time for compassion
My reactions to your action, satisfaction
No more DeLucas, the rise of a new day
Hey, hey, mister GFK
The rhymes of the black sis no longer play
I'm avenged, a proud man walking the Earth
Satisfied with my kills and my life's a rebirth
So live long, and long live the illest
Twelve Reasons to Die, Ghostface Killah
