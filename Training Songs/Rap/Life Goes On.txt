In the beginning there was confrontations in these streets
'Cause these police beat us
We tired of runnin' f*ck peace
Young brothers born to fail, skippin' bail, helluva start
Could it be them, bitches was hatin' 'cause our skin was too dark?
Handed down his sentence, he got no reason to live
A 25-to-life nigga never knowin' his kids
That's how they do it to us, it seem we caught in between
Another one, wastin' away for what he did in his teens
Life is hard, situation on these streets is critical
Everybody chasin' dough, if them ain't your folks, then here we go
If we ridin', then let's ride, do-or-die, homicide
But tell me the reason for lost lives
Could it be we all caught up in a scandalous system?
Fallin' through the cracks, blinded by the lies we given
Seen these g's on these streets bleed freely but why?
It seem too many of us born to die
But life goes on, and on situation in time
How many lost souls molded by a criminal mind?
From the bay in california to the streets of the east
Can't be no justice without no peace, believe

Life goes on
No matter what they say or do, I ain't never givin' up on you
I won't doubt ya baby, won't doubt ya baby
And no matter I'ma keep it true, and together we gon' make it through
I'm about ya baby, ain't livin' without ya baby

A ruthless cycle of thugs, coppers, drugs, heliocopters, blood, spitting choppers, slugs
Who could stop to love this lifestyle juveniles embracin'?
I'm lacin' adolescents with lessons no one could beat the cases
I'm chasin', my competitors, no need for a spot
Conversation keep these cowards off my stick when I bust
Forget versache-watchy cartier playas, I'm still the same
But I can't condone the phony 'cause I'm prone to be me
Now what you sayin' huh? life goes on
From the atlantic to the bay, what? life goes on
To all my people gettin' paid, huh? life goes on
Never forgettin' where you came from, life goes on, fa' sho
Now keep on strivin' and survivin' don't let life get down on you
Forget these haters that betray mistakin' kindness for a fool
Keep your head up, don't get fed up, keep on doin' what you do
For all true players in this game of life you got to know the rules, true

But life goes on
No matter what they say or do, I ain't never givin' up on you
I won't doubt ya baby, won't doubt ya baby
And no matter I'ma keep it true, and together we gon' make it through
I'm about ya baby, ain't livin' without ya baby

No matter what they say or do, I ain't never givin' up on you
I won't doubt ya baby, won't doubt ya baby
And no matter I'ma keep it true, and together we gon' make it through
I'm about ya baby, ain't livin' without ya baby

Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up 
Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up 
Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up 
Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up

Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up 
Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up 
Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up 
Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up

Now that's one too many times more than three had to die 45's got to spittin
6:30 was the time, 7 years gone by, 8 of us done been deceased
9 times outta 10 somebody bleedin' in these streets
Tell me what's the reason? trial date's the 10th
These juveniles in wild life smile upon your death
Went from kids to killas, fun lovin' to felonies could it be
We self-destructin' in this rush for the cheese?
Everybody in this world gone crazy
See money and murder be the measure of a man everyday
Separate from the fake, break bustas for how they livin
'Cause some takin' better care of their cars then of their kids
And it still seem we caught up in a scandalous system
Fallin' through the cracks, blinded by the lies we given
Seen these g's on these streets bleed freely but why?
It seem too many of us born to die

But life goes on
No matter what they say or do, I ain't never givin' up on you
I won't doubt ya baby, won't doubt ya baby
And no matter I'ma keep it true, and together we gon' make it through
I'm about ya baby, ain't livin' without ya baby

No matter what they say or do, I ain't never givin' up on you
I won't doubt ya baby, won't doubt ya baby
And no matter I'ma keep it true, and together we gon' make it through
I'm about ya baby, ain't livin' without ya baby

Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up 
Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up 
Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up 
Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up

Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up 
Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up 
Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up 
Don't stop, don't stop movin' on up
