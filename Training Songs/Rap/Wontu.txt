Ah yeah, wontu (get busy nigga), word up
Ha ha (check check)

Gimme room to get this mic check
'Cause I'm about to wreck it one time for my peeps from the sewer
My sewer style run through any slum crew tryin' to get the wontu
checks, 'cause rippin' dialects is what my tongue do
Best sold on a-nother slang son-a
Yo Krazy come and kick it like the [shit], well hear, I want to!

Well here I be-a with the quickness, kid I'm wit this, I rip to swig my verses
Just because they think this be like leapin' out my curses
Who's the next jerk to test the expert? You might regret it
I fry ya to a fricker seed 'cause if you see me, baby, be like curtains
I put the hurt ins on that body when I spark it
I'm super like the market when I'm bringin' niggas' harkin'

Yeah it's my man and me bringin' more horrors than that gripplin' Amityville, 
still my crew be pulli'n bitches like Vanity
Six for kicks 'cause I write songs like I was lyrical
Straight from the bottom of the pit with the residue
If niggas want to box with rhymes than ring the bellhops
'Cause yo I got more lives than ????? ?????

Aiyo well check it, it's my follow up so watch me swallow up these kids for rippin'
Boy I shock 'em when I rock em 'cause my crew be on a mission
Boy I swing it yes indeedy, I get more props than Speedy
Gonzalez, make more dollars than these niggas write graffiti
Boy I'm straight up, you're gettin' ate up, that's how it go
Bring terror to your era so you better check my flow so

OK, I float just like some helium and stings like Tabasco
The nice with mic skills ever since I had an Afro
Aw shit, sometimes I get the notion when I'm rippin'
to flow or slang, is it just to keep a nigga slippin'
Think I ain't when I is or is it when I ain't
From subject to butter, kid my rhetoric is spank
It's no competition when I'm flixin' with my diction
Oops flexin' to the beat y'all, yes yes yes

I cross my heart and hope to spark up blood the size of marker
Some say I look like Books but, kids I be a tad bit darker
Ain't no jokin' when I'm rhymin', I'm in effect so check my structure
I switch again, I'm in this bitch again see how I flucture
Wait, I'm great, ya niggas know who sent this
I be knockin' out more teeth than your local family dentist
Boy, I'm dynamite, just peep the rhymer right, that gets me over
You better get'cha crew because theis when I grow up
