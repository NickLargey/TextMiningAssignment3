Have you ever seen the thug in the club with a bottle turned up
Head bobbin' like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen the chick in the club with a drink in the cup
Booty shakin' like hell, yeah
Have you seen those Big Tymers pull up in the front of the club
24s like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen 50 thousand strong with their hands in the air
Up and down like hell, yeah

So fresh, so fly, so sweet, so polite
So much, too many, but we ridin' tonight
Well, it's that pimp talk that ain't that pimp walk
It's big pimpin' over here, player, that just started

See, we fresh with Air Ones, Lexus and big drums
[Ginuwine]
Chips, Willie Chicks, Willie crisp, big fun

I'm sittin' in my truck, snakin' the club out
Kill this sip then go wild the f*ck out
Up in the club with my hands in the air
There's so much shit in the atmosphere
So girl, quit frontin' and get you're ass over here
And get yourself a cup of this Crown and Belvedere
I'm all off in the corner 100 honeys takin' pics
They be in the VIP with lots of chicks
I'm pimped out now, low cut, and a pick
G and Big Tymers together, that's what I'm talkin'
