Call it how it is
Hendrix
I promise, I swear I swear
Spit it
Yo

Percocets
Molly, Percocets
Percocets
Molly, Percocets
Rep the set
Gotta rep the set
Chase a check
Never chase a bitch
Mask on 
F*ck it, mask off
Mask on
F*ck it, mask off
Percocets
Molly, Percocets
Chase a check
Never chase a bitch

Two cups
Toast up with the gang
From food stamps
To a whole nother domain
Out the bottom
I’m a living proof
They compromising
Half a million on the coupe
Drug houses
Looking like Peru
Graduated
I was overdue
Pink molly
I can barely move
Ask about me
I’m going bust a move
Rick James
33 chains
Ocean air
Crusin' Biscayne
Top off
That’s a liability
Hit the gas
Boosting my adrenaline

Before the Maybach
I’d drive anything
Buy my Range
Make ‘em go insane
My guillotine
Drank promethazine
TEC and beams
Go to those extremes
Parliament
Calamari Wednesday
Parlay in Vegas
We was in attendance
Before the business
Theodore lenses (Theo-Dur)
More prescriptions
Focus on the missions
Intermission
Never take a break
Switch states
Touch down, foreign plates
Ain’t no way
Ain’t no fucking way
We call the play
We didn’t come to play
Rob the bank
We gone rob the game
They gang, we gang
But they are not the same

Gas gone
Never nod huh
