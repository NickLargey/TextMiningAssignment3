Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you trying to make yo ass fall off
Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all
Now speed up, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal
Now speed up, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal

I put my foot down yeah that's the way it is
Suck it good now what you see is what you get
Neighborhood's hella jealous when they see the wheels
Pull up in the gun metal 'rari with a fresh fit
Gas pedal, gas pedal
Trying to keep up like adderall
I ain't even stressing no a-at all
So presidential I'm federal

I'm trying to get there, so when I get there
Imma make sure you won't forget babe
Hold on, don't sweat it babe
I saw the writing on your ass and yeah I read it babe
So hold on, you won't forget it babe
Yeah you know I'm ready if you ready baby
Gotta take the short route, pedal to the floor watch me peel out

Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you trying to make yo ass fall off
Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all
Now speed up, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal
Now speed up, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal

Non responsive, I'm killin' post de-activator
Dry niggas, no sheen, no neutrons or activator
It's going up, no explaining the escalator
I'm trying to keep this here alive the Bay's respirator
Let 'em see me shine, they call me one hit wonder now I'm that 3 times
I'm seeing big things now they want me blind
I made your girl fall ain't even check archives
Kelly boy, HBK, I make songs like it's my last name I must be Trey
Ballin' like Dave Chappelle, playin' Princeton, shoot the jay.
Fairfield where I stay, I just seen Mrs. ?
More money for the Bay, and no we ain't gon pass the ball
Haters die slow and get your caskets tossed
Audi S7 sport pass 'em all
Speed up, gas pedal

I'm trying to get there, so when I get there
Imma make sure you won't forget babe
Hold on, don't sweat it babe
I saw the writing on your ass and yeah I read it babe
So hold on, you won't forget it babe
Yeah you know I'm ready if you ready baby
Gotta take the short route, pedal to the floor watch me peel out

Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you trying to make yo ass fall off
Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all
Now speed up, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal
Now speed up, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal

I'm the bomb you can't disarm me
I need multiple cuts like a swiss army
And I hope that she ain't looking for no prince charming
Charm yo ass in the cab on the next morning
Tell the driver gas pedal, yo Suzy I got cash to blow
Follow the leader, in high school I was an under-achiever
Made haters believers, or beliebers, look at me sir
Went from nobodies to 20k for a feature
Eat your heart out used to take the BART out
To the city from my mom house, now I ball with my tongue out
Pull out my chain and think that the sun out
When you walk in the building the bitches run out
It should be already platinum before it come out
We should do it major look in the eyes of my haters they say

Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you trying to make yo ass fall off
Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all
Now speed up, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal
Now speed up, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal

I'm trying to get there, so when I get there
Imma make sure you won't forget babe
Hold on, don't sweat it babe
I saw the writing on your ass and yeah I read it babe
So hold on, you won't forget it babe
Yeah you know I'm ready if you ready baby
Gotta take the short route, pedal to the floor watch me peel out

Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you trying to make yo ass fall off
Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all
Now speed up, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal
Now speed up, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal
