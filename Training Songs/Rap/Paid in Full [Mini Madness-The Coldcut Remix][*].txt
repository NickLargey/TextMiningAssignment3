Okay, so who we rollin with?
We rollin with Rush
Of Rushtown Management 
Check this out, since we talking over
This def beat that I put together
I want to hear some of them def rhymes
Know what I'm sayin? 
And together, we can get
Paid in full...

Thinkin' of a master plan
'Cause ain't nuthin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper but still comin' up with lint
So I start my mission- leave my residence

Thinkin' how could I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin' funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthin' move but the money

But now I learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great! so maybe I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistlin' this

Feelin' out of place 'cause, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric be	, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money it's still a wish

'Cause I don't like to dream about gettin paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
To now test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, 'cause I'm paid in full
