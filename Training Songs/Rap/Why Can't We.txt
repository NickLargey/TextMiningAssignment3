Gave you all my soul then
What? What? What?
Say what? Sing!

1 - If you gave me all your heart
And I gave you all my soul
Then why can't we be happy?
Good lovin' no frontin'
Come on baby show me something
Why can't we just be happy, oh girl?

Such a sticky situation
Your girlfriends say 
I am not for you
Girl you are the object of affection
No matter what they say
I'm gonna run to you
Here's an open invitation
Trip around the world
I'll make you my girl
There will be no hesitation
My love is waiting
So tell me what you gon' do?

Repeat 1 (2x)
Girl I just wanted to let you know
How much you turn me on
Boo I feel you strong, uh
You're body is my inspiration
What I would do for you
 
Honey you have no clue
Ever since the day I met you
You stayed on my mind
Damn you are so fine
So come on now just meet with all your love
I swear I'll set you free
From all your misery

Repeat 1 (3x)
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Danger zone, danger zone
Uh, uh, uh, uh yeah
Just bounce, just bounce
Just bounce, just bounce

Repeat 1 
If you gave me all your heart
And I gave you all my soul
Then why can't we?

Ay yo I don't think you heard me baby
But just in case here's something 
To keep it real for ya
Why don't you let me know?
I need to know
Just let me know
I need it now
Whoa let me know
I need your love
Why don't you let me know?
Ooh wee baby now, why?
