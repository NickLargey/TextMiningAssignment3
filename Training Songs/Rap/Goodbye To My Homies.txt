[Master P] 
RIP homie  RIP 
[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick] 
How do I say goodbye to what we had 
The good times that made us laugh outweighted the bad 
I thought we'd get to see forever 
But forever's gone away 
It's so hard to say goodbye to my homies 
[Master P] 
y'all niggas smile for my ghetto heroes 
So many homies gone  trying to ball till they fall 
Now I'm left with nothing but old cards 
and a bunch of pictures on the wall 
RIP tatoos nigga, just to show you that we real 
But I still can't believe that your dead fool, and how you got killed 
And on your birthday me and my boys visit your grave 
And I remember when you first got high 
and the first time you got laid 
And I'm going through a thing, Kevin nigga, what should I do 
I never imagined living life without a nigga like you 
[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick] 
Chorus 
Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies 
Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies 
[Master P] 
We shed so many ghetto tears, see time is crazy 
And every sunday grandma go to church 
she said she gotta pray for her baby 
And ah, your little son, he look just like you 
And momma going through a thang, but she gonna pull it through 
And ah me, see and Silk we got a little money but that don't mean shit 
Cause I burn all that shit up nigga, just to have you again 
And it's real out here, all you niggas that's goin through some pain 
Keep your head up, and this for everybody 
that lost a relative in the street game 
[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick] 
Chorus 
[Silkk The Shocker] 
Now look, I couldn't imagine life without you 
I just sit here wonderin why 
But the law of life, and god placed us here 
and said everybody must die 
Ended hard trying to move on but still I try 
Even though we got money, judgement day 
just some things we can't buy 
Even though you gone, I never let you move on 
Cause every time i think about you 
I sit back and write your name in a song 
Now ashes to ashes, and dust to dirt 
It's kinda spooky when one day I see your face on a t-shirt 
I just pray to god it's hard wishing it would get better 
And why it take a death or a funeral to bring our family together 
Now look, we done lost a brother, your son done lost a father 
Life ain't promised us so tell somebody you love them 
You'll never know whether they'll be here tomorrow
