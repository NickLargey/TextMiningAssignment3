All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

I roll up something, nah I don't f*ck with the drink
Would have wrote this verse down, but I'm too high to think
Pupils is pink
Like my nigga Spitta, I'm too fly to sink
Devin, light the stink
Let's go, I'll smoke a zone playing P3
My nigga Shiest got that E.T.,
Got a nigga sleepy, yah
I used to coast down posts
Lookin' real nonchalant
This sale, off the Audemar
You go to coppin', don't get more than one!
I go to coppin', and they throw me somethin'
It's like that
This for my piss-test failures who won't leave it alone
Shout out to Ricky Williams and Pacman Jones c'mon

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

Even before I get my pad and my pen
I must have my weed, I grab my bag, then dig in
Mix my shit together so that it's all different kinds of flavors
They think I'm baking pies to distribute to the neighbors, no
I'm smoking weed, that tastes like, kinda cake-like
Bud is getting better, but the price is starting
To skyrocket, so I said f*ck it, bought an Aerogarden
So I can get high, smoke big, and break even
No longer have to wait for harvest season
For strictly smoking, why do I have to push
Sitting back with a fat sack of pineapple kush
I wish a motherfucker would try to take my weed
So I take it and I stash the shit, so no one can see
Then I make it safe grab a brew to equalize it
Every day I'm smoking weed, I'm hoping soon they'll legalize it

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

The bud brownies that I ate just kicking in
I got my Jordan Number Eights, black, aqua, and grape
These niggas try'na duplicate the Pilot DNA
Copycats see the big dog comin' and run away
Bitches fall through at the crib and can't get up, they want to stay
I got your old lady in my '88 Z-28
Haze got her dazed, she's stuck, she don't know what to say
I have the best week ever every seven days
In the magazine pictures, so high I might fly off the page
Rap, smoke, fly, drive, do it all with grace
For the Kush, I got a Jones like Grace
I call my house first, cause first is my place, yeah

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe
