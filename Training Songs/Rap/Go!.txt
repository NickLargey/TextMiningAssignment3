Go, go, go, go, go,
And on the count of three, go! Go, go, go, go, go
And on the count of three, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, uh,
On the count of three, everybody run back to your fantasy

She was a bad, uh
The type at the club niggas would grab her
Fantasize when I had her in the bathroom sweating with her ass up
The body of a dancer
We had chemistry 'cause she was a cancer
Thought forever it would last for, but forever moved faster so I had to: Go!

Still, I got to pause when I think about her in them drawers
And, ooh baby she liked it raw
And, like rain, when she came it poured
And, like a car I can't afford, I would want it, then want some more
The positions our frames explored let me know she was secure
Back for more

Go, go, go, go, go,
And on the count of three, go! Go, go, go, go, go
And on the count of three, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, uh,
On the count of three, everybody run back to your fantasy

Go, go, go, go, go,
And on the count of three, go! Go, go, go, go, go
And on the count of three, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, uh,
On the count of three, everybody run back to your fantasy

Freaky, like the daughter of a pastor
Said I was bait and for me to mack her
Little red Corvette? Naw, she was faster
Wet dreams, Lemair Cream and after
We'd make love and then laughter
And any way I wanted I could have her
Said it was some girls that did attract her
A new chapter she was after, so I said let's go!
To a place that you want to be
Get what you want from her and me, free love I wanna see
Hot sex in the third degree, you're getting served while serving me
Dirty words encourage me to rock steady and sturdily
On you're turning me, no turning back, the further we: GO!

Go, go, go, go, go,
And on the count of three, go! Go, go, go, go, go
And on the count of three, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, uh,
On the count of three, everybody run back to your fantasy
