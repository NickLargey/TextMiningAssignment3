Just can't help it
I love my hun
All that I need and all that I want

Said I just can't help it
I love my hun
All that I need and all that I want

Everybody asking
"Why Mary ain't mad no more?"
It seems like a question that I've already answered
Like too many times before
Now, ladies, if you got a man and he treat you real good
Ain't you gon' flex every chance that you get?
Now, ain't you gonna love him just like you should
Especially when you never thought you would?
Yeah, oh, you know that I'm all into the feeling
And I never look to lose it
Oh, for sho'
This is consistent with you
I find a rhythm

From the day to the night
We ride
We ride
We ride
Hey, how you like it?
How you like it?
I see the future, baby
You and I, better with time

And it is what it is
And I just can't help it
And I felt what I felt
No, I just can't help it
I see the future, baby
Me and you
That's how we do

I got a song in my heart
That's all that I need
I sing it A Capella
I sing it to the beat
What we are is classic
You know it because your attitude shows it
Now, fellas, if you got a girl, and she treats you right
Ain't you gonna spend every dollar, every cent?
Eh, ain't you gonna make sure she stay fly
Especially when she's reppin' you for life?

From the day to the night
We ride
We ride
We ride
Hey, how you like it?
How you like it?
I see the future, baby
You and I, better with time

And it is what it is
And I just can't help it
And I felt what I felt
No, I just can't help it
I see the future, baby
Me and you
That's how we do

You are mine
I told you before
I wouldn't lie
I need you and more
Gotta stay with you
I am safe with you
Let me repeat it in case you forgot
Love is a mountain and we're at the top
Yeah, breath and strength
'Cause I see the future in your eyes

From the day to the night
We ride
We ride
We ride
Hey, how you like it?
How you like it?
I see the future, baby
You and I, better with time

And it is what it is
And I just can't help it
And I felt what I felt
No, I just can't help it
I see the future, baby
Me and you
That's how we do

From the day to the night
We ride
We ride
We ride
Now how you like it?
How you like it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I see the future, baby
You and I, better with time

And it is what it is
And I just can't help it
And I felt what I felt
No, I just can't help it
I see the future, baby
Me and you
That's how we do

Just can't help it
I love my hun
(And we ride)
All that I need and all that I want

Said I just can't help it
I love my hun
(And we ride)
All that I need and all that I want
