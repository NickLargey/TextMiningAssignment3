Yeah
 Okay
 Uh
 
 You see a woman got to do what a woman got to do
 If your man keep on trippin' then you need to cut him
 loose
 Ain't nothin' he could do for you that he can't do
 What I'm supposed to go, â??Oohâ??, â??cause he rollin' on
 22s
 No, I'm ain't one of those after-show h**s
 And if you don't know I gots my own dough
 I only need you for companionship
 Well, you could keep your chips, ain't no sponsorship
 I just need you to keep your lips between my hips
 That girl Sarai is a silly chick
 But on the really tip, I got benefits
 This independent chick and anything I want I gets
 Don't even try me with those player scripts, I know
 the game
 Actin' like you big money, but really small change
 Boy, please stay up out of my face
 You see it's men like you that make us ladies say

 Here go the kick in your pants (Pack ya bags)
 Get out (Just pack ya bags)

 That's right, you got to beat it, boy
 All the blizzy-blizzy blah, I ain't hearin' it, boy
 I get ya, get ya what you're askin' for
 Now don't be blowin' up my celly â??cause your own
 ignore
 Ain't no more walkin' through my door
 Now come and get your, get your s*** off my porch
 And I know you hear the hurt in my voice
 But I had no choice, you made me do it by force
 But you know your girl gon' be a'ight
 I'mma keep on movin', keep my head up high
 Probably chilly-chilly-chill till the time is right
 That I feely-feely-feel I need a man in my life
 But for now I'mma keep it tight
 Till I burst under pressure when my temperature rise
 I'm on the women's pride, feel me right
 So it's-it's-it's that ladies night

 You got to gizzy-go
 â??Cause I don't want you bein' in my life no more
 I shoulda told you long time ago
 But my mind was sayin' yes and my heart said no
 Ya'll know how that love thing go
 How your mind in a bind goin' out of control
 Be careful â??fore you take that road
 Think it's a, it's a game, but that thang ain't no
 joke
 Let it be known if you see somethin' wrong
 â??Cause understandin' that-that help you out in the
 long
 You got to, got to, got to come on strong
 And make him, make him, make him want to leave you
 alone
 And put that on every-everything I love
 Don't be scare-scare-scared, kick that boy to the curb
