(Make it up) we can make it better
(Make it up) we can make it better
(Make it up) we can make it better
(Make it up) we can make it

Somebody told me that delta's brownskinned, akas' lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougious, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for a sight, man
She said, "i know what you about to say, like your hypeman"
She let a nigga hit it, and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightnin' but

(Make it up) we can make it better
(Better we can)
(Make it up) we can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
(Make it up) we can make it better
(Better we can)
(Make it up) we can make it

The night fallin' over brooklyn, where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drug dealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth, like I'm comin' out the mouth of bass
One for it, one for out the grave
Niggas want they reparations, how you calculate the amount to be paid
You try to imagine america without the slaves (the slaves)
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel 
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

Her tenament yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold booya cause she wouldn't protest it
'Cause, her best friends man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a glock
In the hood is a everyday happenin'
A friend of the priest say she chose out the captain
She yelled out "why you do this to black men? "

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel 
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
I think of eighty seven ways, to make better days
Whether climb or rhyme, I heard of rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
Music, rhymin' good like escalates
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And niggas wit' things ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinking big like lil wayne in the problem set

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel 
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
C'mon, tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our newports
Patriot act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
Johnny cochran dead, who gonna get us free now? 
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now? 
Who gon' make it better for the thugs and p's now? 
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile? 
Oh, it's good music, yeah dog I see now

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel 
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
