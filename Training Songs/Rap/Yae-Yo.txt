We doing this baby,
Oh shit!
What the f*ck happened
Nah man, Nah 
Nah this what I'm a do
I'm a get on the phone one time
Stupid, yo, eh yo
Eh yo

Why this shit ain't cooking up right
Papi told me this is solid white
F*ck it wrap it up take it back up
Still in all it's a play out
Tired of spending money
Might get them niggas laid out
Yo, yo Fernando sent me yo
Stop acting hostile yo
And yo don't point that shit at me
Bad enough I gotta come in the crib
Wid Spanish niggas using languages and shit
I'm feeling like a dick
Left the crib wit my hand brolic
This is some bullshit
Might get knocked take the wrist coward
Yo Fernando what happened?
Shit cooking up backwards
Light up a Back wood
Don't make me backtrack
Blew it dime it the llelo lay low
Saying in my mind 
F*ck that papi gotta pay off
Cash rules the Power-Wu chant it
Yo Louis this ain't our product
This is Carlos family
Oh y'all want to play me like a smoker
Coming out my ice choker
My man in the back, looking colder
Papi yo why y'all want to jucks me
Yo listen B, we got the best clientele since '83
F*ck it, pull out the pot let's cook it 
Light the stove up
Julie go to the store get some flour
Sat back burning a big dutch
With the crisp 18 shot glock, stashed in my nuts
Poured it in the Pyrex sizzling
Now it start drizzling
Rainy day murder black won't miss him
Still I'm yelling this shit is business
But they still ain't gon' violate 
What I stand for wid these drizzers
He took it off the stove run the water
Trying to work me yo
Knew I shouldn'ta hit the nigga's daughter
He mighta showed more love
Than went in the freezer 
Broke the ice down, pour it in
We both looking at it on the twirl around particles grew 
Fly Khaluas is mad sliding Coronas through
Feeling like Castro's cousin
Gave them niggas all of my life 
All of my paper all my judgement
It droppa only like an ounce worth
Should I just come out my shirt
Go berserk and let the Macks burst
Skate off body in the Bronx
Same shit Gotti was on
Shallah they gonna get yours play it calm
Seventeen five was the total plus the five, 
Hundred for the cab driver that was rolling
