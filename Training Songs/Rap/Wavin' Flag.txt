When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
So wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Oh

Born to a throne, stronger than Rome
But violent prone, poor people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, streets we would roam
Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest survival
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Except no defeat, surrender, retreat

So we struggling, fighting to eat and
We wondering when we'll be free
So we patiently we wait, for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now we say

When I get older, I will be stronger
I'll make it better, struggle no longer
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
So wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Oh

So many wars (wars), settling scores (scores)
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor
And in the situation, when there's no compensation
They got no occupation, no buy no medication
See its a combination, of no education
We can never get it say, tomorrow's generation
'Cause they can't control us, no they can't hold us down
We gonna pick it up, even though we all struggling
Fighting to eat
And we wondering
When we'll be free
So we patiently (wait) for that faithful day (go)
It's not far away, but for now we say

When I get older, I will be stronger
I'll make it better, struggle no longer
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
So wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag

Oh oh oh oh
And everybody will be singing it
And you and I will be singing it
And we all will be singing it
Oh oh oh

When I get older 
I will be stronger, stronger, stronger
I will be stronger, stronger, stronger
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
So wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag
Now wave your flag

Yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Just like a waving flag
Just like a waving flag
Just like a waving flag
Just like a waving flag
