I feel like a felon with two strikes, mad bullshit in this life
I done seen everythin but Christ
Luckily I'm just off the basement
You niggas just bullshittin with bars, the boys you got just tryin my patience
Like, I don't carry around banana clips like groceries
With a presence that make em don't wanna get em close to me
Talk about we suppose to be brothers
Don't make me laugh, motherfucka you chose to be
On the side opposin me, no matter what culture you be
From, Young Hova light your ass up exposively
A lil' use K for ya, pour out the P-A for ya
Had to bring y'all like back in the day for ya
They don't respect nothin else, they somethin else
Two guns with sons will get inside yourself
Loose two lungs, bullets'll get inside your health
Will take the wind outta yourself, like so
Niggas for truly in a war with yours truly
While they emulating shit they saw in the Art Of War movie
But I'm the writer of Sun Tzu, so whatever son do
I do better, more lyrics, way more cheddar
Catch me if you can, I'm the gingerbread man
Keep pumpin em up make me injure bre-thren
Niggas is tryna capitalize of Hov
Like I don't realize, I see the demons inside of they souls
Niggas is dreamin to sell what I sold
Fuckers is fiendin to held what I hold
I just know what I know, they respect me all across the globe
Although, I'm from

Uh, uh huh, yea, yo, yo
It ain't nothin to double clips, trust the fifth could be toss
Niggas poppin their shit, they startin ta piss me off
Bitches and bitch niggas tryna ride against homie
So f*ck them and the Originator of Sophie
The gat spit rapid, duel actions
Look I'm nice with the fifth the moments when you bastard get sick
I'm from the ghetto is turf where the metal do work
My ER eight grade, they had the errors since birth
Me and the God spittin, you know police come chalk ya
It's like you peep this and I'm the young A. Walker
F*ck it, I'm ridin with Sig, you niggas is sweet

Balls splat, you will lay in the ground for real
All day I'ma ammo for real

Six saw head splittin your grill
New issue, or I might grip the Uz pistol
Do more than bruise tissues
Crack bone marrow, lose grisel 
Sit you down in a chair for real
Forever you'll wheel around for real
Listen boy, I get it down for real
I clutch pound for real
When I ball you touch down for real
