P. Diddy]
Come on, a come on now

[Loon]
This is what they want to hear right here

[P. Diddy]
Come on, a come on now

[Loon]
This is what they want to hear right here

[P. Diddy]
Come on, a come on now

[Loon]
This is what they want to hear right here

[Chorus - Loon]
Yo, relax your mind, let your conscious free
Your now rollin with the sounds of the be	-A-D
be	-O-why, niggaz don't be that fly
Niggaz don't see sun and we those guys

[Loon]
Check it out, cause I been stackin dough
Been mackin hos, nigga Loon a pimp go ask the hos
Nigga you's a simp, cause your smack the hos (yeah)
And lose your temper like John McEnroe
Me, I'm cool I keep my jewels intact (c'mon)
Loon ain't type of dude that'll move like that (that's right)
Don't compare me to no boozy cat
Cause Loon'll call them dudes, come use them gats
Remember the time when I didn't use to rap
You know me, O.G., O.T. movin past
As far as the street, I already proved that fact
Not to be rude, but I ain't in the mood for that
Movin on to bigger songs, bigger things
Use my arm for bigger charms, bigger rings
Usually calm, but when it's on, nigga trained
To drop the bomb, word to my mom
Ya'll niggaz playin

[P. Diddy - talking behind Chorus]
Yeah, Bad Boy
Yeah, come on now

[Loon]
Now what's your forte, chicks they all say
That they want a nigga, sip Cris' all day
This be all great, merely kiss for foreplay
When I slip and slide with this chick from Norway
Whips I push, make the bitch's jaw sway
Then I hit they bush, leave 'em drippin all day
Then I get like Bush, when I flip the war play
F*ck the horse play, hot sex in hallways
Pick your spot now, got you hot now
Since you locked down, roof put the top down
I know you eager to leave this hot town
Know how you feel we can leave or not now
First you was fiendin, but screamin stop now
Walls got knocked down, when I laid my cock down
Spendin my cheese while you breathin shop round
I can't believe that you screamin cop now

[Chorus]

[Loon]
Yo, in one year I gave you bastards, two classics
Between me, Puff and Usher it was too drastic
Between me, Puff and Gin was true magic (yeah you remember her)
Cause everybody +Needed a Girl+ but who asked em
You was scured, basically you wasn't prepared
To gettin murried and havin a couple of chirls
I'm a grown man nigga, I ain't never concerned
About how nice your ice, or the money you earn
I'm the slim guy, spend years reppin N.Y
So you just start pullin on blunts, I've been high
You just start visitin spots, I've been by
And the hell with a throwback nigga, I've been fly

[P. Diddy]
Come on now

[Loon]
Definitely real, spend time in Beverly Hills
Been gettin money since Tiffany Mills
I've got a debt to fulfill
Front, I'm a definitely kill
I might peel wole left of your grill
With no mercy, niggaz don't know I'm so thirsty
Sticks and stones break bones but don't hurt me
Niggaz want to clap they chrome but won't murk me
Niggaz keep frontin like Loon won't get dirty

[Chorus - 2X]

[P. Diddy - talking behind Chorus]
Relax your mind
Yeah, what's the name
Bad Boy
Yeah, let's go
yeah, c'mon
Bad Boy baby, yeah

[P. Diddy - talking]
One God, one love, one family
Bad Boy, they ain't never seen nothin like this
I see you Loon [echo]
Come on, come on now
I don't think they heard you
Tell 'em one more time

[Chorus - 2X]

[P. Diddy - talking behind Chorus]
Yeah, what's the name
Bad Boy, YEAH
Relax your mind
Bad Boy baby, and we don't stop

[P. Diddy - talking]
Cause we can't stop
And we won't stop cause we can't stop
Ya'll remember that
Yeah it's still there, it's still there
Ten years later .
Your our future Loon, let's go boy
Let's go, yeah, let's go
This goes out to Harlem
I see you Harlem, that's where we from
