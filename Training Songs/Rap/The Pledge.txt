[Ashanti]
(There's no me)
In the beginnin'
When no one else was around
You were there
(Don't you know that I would never...)
And now, that everything is good
You gotta know
I'll ride out wit'chu
Foreva

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
I neva thought that I could finally stay
That always got me comin' back again
Somethin' about the way you move
Ya got me hooked on you, no matta what I do
I neva felt this way for anotha
It's feelin' kinda strange but I love it
You gotta know that I will neva leave
You did that thang to me
And you will where I be

[Chorus: Ashanti]
There's no me, without you
I can't be, without you
Don't you know that I will never leave, leavin' you
All I need, need is you

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
You're always there to make me feel so right
You got me thinkin' bout you day and night
Thinkin' bout how my life is now
How you make me smile, and I love your style
We've been togetha through thick and thin
Whateva troubles you're in, I'm in
You gotta know that I would neva leave
You did that thang to me
And you will where I be
What you've done to me
You know that I can't see, myself
Livin' without you
Bein' without you
Breathin' without you baby
What you've done to me
You know that I can't see, myself
Livin' without you
Bein' without you
Breathin' without you baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Caddillac Tah (Ashanti)]
Yeah, now it don't matta if you hatin' us more
We gon' get that dough
Tha camp is strong
Can't do nuttin' else but flow
I chant this cause
I'm lettin' you all know
(It's Murda, murda) Yeah
Now you know I'ma put my life on the line for yours
Pullin' nine out the drawer
Strap up when it's time for war
Stack up, every penny money over these broads
Back up, against the wall in the right or wrong
I pledge allegiance to I-N-see, it's the clique
Until I die I'ma ride for my niggas, through thick
And thin, playa and we playin' to win
Steady ballin', soarin', long diggin' these broads in
Now my brothas keep my slugs a street and pluggin' heat
Ya fuckin' wit ma family so undastand be	
There's no me without them, all we got is us
Me and Ashanti tearin' it up
Nigga what

[Chorus: x 2]

[Verse 4: Ashanti]
Murder I-N-see
You know that I can't see, myself
Livin' without you
Bein' without you
Breathin' without you baby
What you've done to me
You know that I can't see, myself
Livin' without you
Bein' without you
Breathin' without you baby
Murder I-N-see
