Girl I just wanna get inside
Just get inside you six at night
Oh, I just wanna cross the line, the line
Baby!
Aah aah, before it all goes crazy tonight
Aah aah, I just wanna say
You're beautiful, beautiful
Ah aah, you're rock and roll
Rock and roll
Aah aah, you're beautiful, beautiful
You're beautiful

With you I lost all my control,
The minute you walked in the door
But I always got my eye
On the prize, the prize
Lady!
Aah aah, before it all goes crazy tonight
Aah aah, I just wanna say
You're beautiful, beautiful
Aah aah, you're rock and roll
Rock and roll
Ah aah, you're beautiful, beautiful
You're beautiful

Aah aah ooh yeah
Yeah!
And I ain't gon' lie
Gon' lie, no!

You're beautiful, beautiful
Aah aah, you're rock and roll
Rock and roll
Ah aah, you're beautiful, beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, beautiful
Aah aah you're beautiful
Aah aah you're beautiful
