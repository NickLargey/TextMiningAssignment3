[Chorus:]
You're foolin' around
Foolin', foolin' around
You're foolin' around
Foolin', foolin' around
You're foolin' around
Foolin', foolin' around
You're foolin' around
Foolin', foolin' around

We used to be so close
And now things have changed
It's not the same, no, no
Since I heard you calling her name
So quick to tell me that
She was just a friend
I don't want to hear the same lie again, again

I got a hunch
Something ain't right, no, no
This is no illusion
I've come to this conclusion that... 

[Chorus]

I can't believe that I, was fooling myself
When all along oh yes you were with someone else
No more games, I'm letting you go your way
Cause three is a crowd, so I'm giving you your space

I got a hunch
Something ain't right, no, no
This is no illusion
I've come to this conclusion that... 

[Chorus]

Ooh, oh
Oh boy you're...

[Chorus]

I gave you the chance to give me romance
I was there for you boy and you know it's true
See you're weak not strong you should have held on
Cause toys are for boys

[Chorus to Fade]
