By the time I hit the door I saw hoes on the floor
Niggas dressed in suits trickin' all they dough
Me? I'm a pimp, I ain't payin' for no sex
Man I'd rather buy a car or a new Rolex
'Cause I got street fame so hoes flock like birds
I got one holdin' the weed, I got one holdin' the syrup
When I hit the club, I'ma be with David Banner
A thug ass nigga with bad table manners
We act bad, my nigga what is y'all sayin'?
Like when we walk inside clubs, niggas hold they gal hand
'Cause they know we run trains (choo-choo) all night 
How could your gal leave me and be with you all night?
But it's all right, 'cause you know we don't kiss
Like Too Short said, "Bitches ain't shit"
I tried to told ya that most girls really freaks
And this is how they got to make they money every week

Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor (like a pimp)
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor 
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor (like a pimp)
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor 
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor (like a pimp)
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor (like a pimp)

Step into club lookin' just like a pimp
We got cash, so we screamin' out, "Shake some' bitch!"
This is your song, tell the DJ put it on
Michael Tyler made you shake and Sisqo made you show your thong
Bitch I'm dead wrong, been playa from the crib
So get out on the floor, girl, and get it how you live
And since you so hot, f*ck it, show your pussy lips
You go to Tougaloo, but I know you still flip
Bitch, don't trip, ain't a damn thing changed
I still love my queen but bitches hip me to the game
So if you gotta ho, shake them cuffs and let it go, yeah
And let them girls get down on the flo', on the flo' (like a pimp, yeah)

Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor (like a pimp)
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor 
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor (like a pimp)
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor 
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor (like a pimp)
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor
Make them girls get down on the floor, on the floor (like a pimp)

Now don't you hate them old, lyin' ass hoes?
Smilin' in your face wearin' her best friend's clothes
I suppose they like the way me and Banner pimp
You can catch us at Pappadeaux eatin' steak and shrimp
Or you can catch us at E&J's pourin' it up
Flip whippin' Caddy trucks
Your girl lickin' my nuts
We some Southside pimps
And we ain't givin' a f*ck
Poke your girl up in the throat
And make her swallow the nut
We make 'em swallow the nut, so
Follow the truck, Lil Flip and David Banner
We got all of the bucks
And all of they sluts and all of the hoes
So drop it like it's hot, girl
Touch your fuckin' toes (oh)
Gon' touch your toes
And make me a roll and 
Go hit the mall and buy me some clothes, mane
And if your boy trip, I'ma bust a clip
Y'all bitches can't f*ck with me and Lil Flip, nigga

Nigga, nigga
Yeah, nigga
This for the real money makin' niggas out there, you know?
Get yo' mother fuckin' money
Don't worry 'bout the next, nigga
Get yo' mother fuckin' money
Get yo' mother fuckin' money, nigga
Uh, get your money
