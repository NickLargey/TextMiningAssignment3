Everybody needs somebody
All the pretty girls wanna have some fun

Everybody tryna find the perfect one
And I'm a little picky not just anybody
I'm not tryna be greedy give me one and I'm done
If his swag right he could come get me
I will make it so he never forgets me, tell me

Girl
Weren't no swag in that room at all
Definitely not what I'm looking for
I'm looking for somebody
With a nearly perfect body
Pretty smile and some tatts
Where you at, where you at?
Who can take me to a party dance with me not anybody else
Be honest when I ask him, are you seeing anybody else?
Riding in the Range, jumping in/out the car
More in love with the fact
His sneaker game up to par
I've been searching near and far for someone whose so official
Who can let me wear a necklace with his initials?

I'm still looking for you
