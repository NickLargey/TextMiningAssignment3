I tried so hard to make a change 
But now I'm here and I'm the same 
And once I tried to let it go 
But its so impossible I just don't know

And once again I've let it go 
It's so impossible now I know

So is it still too late 
Two sides decide my fate

And once again I've let it go 
It's so impossible now I know
