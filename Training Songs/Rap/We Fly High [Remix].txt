Remix!
We fly high no lie you know this (ballin!)
Foreign rides, outside it's like showbiz (ladies)
We stay fly, no lie, and you no this (remix!)
Hips and thighs,oh my!, stay focused

(Jones!) He, she blowticious,
Lamborghini, it's audicious
From Harlem to Hollywood I'm still hood,
500 Horses stuffed in my Ferarri hood
F*ck niggas talk bout MC's on my hills
Hip hop was dead and killa gave me the will (flee)
Black car fever got this nigga feelin ill (ill)
It's the shop for a now nigga givin' out deals
(It's all about the Benjamen's baby)
I'm flying off Lennox, in the Bentley all crazy (check)
The roof topless, I'm showin' my ass
I brought New York back ya niggas ain't got a chance

Remix!
We fly high no lie you know this (ballin!)
Foreign rides, outside it's like showbiz

I ain't gon' lie I'm fucked up, if we all die then we all shall
But only one thang gonna get us by and that's the ball game,
I buy me a lonely crib 50 on the dog tag
Crack's in the deal that's twenty mill you thought I have gone mad
Naw I had to gone grab the spida at the red light,
Blue florescent head light, you better get your bread right,
You ain't a baller, you chase checks I check write,
Even when his dog got signed, I had my neck right

Ey ya hold up, pick a restaurant Chows or Chin Chin (5 stars)
Now pick a car, which one I ain't been in (ballin!)
Pick a watch, as long as the hands spinnin'
Pick a actress, which one I ain't swim in
(What about to ride) the yachts still on deck
Retirement plan, I dropped it on her neck
I'm still spendin' ol' money
Benjamin's Remix, 10 Year Gold Money (Mothafuckas!)

Oh look at this presendentish and get it twisted
I'm still in the clubs on the chairs gettin' twisted
Nonstop rhyme from the summer to the winter (ballin')
Harder than ? Sportcenter
Who you think started all this makin' ?
Ask the girls they'll tell you that some MC Jermaine
Money anything, you seen the video
? I been half the globe
(Tell 'em!) (Ladies)

We stay fly, no lie, and you know this (remix!)
Hips and thighs, oh my! Stay focused

500 On the Bentley, 50 g's on the Caddy,
100 Gs on my bar 'cause we both livin' ?
Doin' my thang wit this uptown swang
Nigga get it how we live like money ain't a thang
And I'm stuntin' on them thangs
Every time you see me swang
Every time you see me hang
Best believe I got that thang.
Pop up at the club nigga show them hoes love
'Cause they know we make it rain so they show us gangsta love

I feel like I'm skating on ice like Christie Yamaguchi
Sit up in the Chevy eating blow fish sushi
550 Mint colored Benz me n' Jim wit the back cab twins and they blowin out Fluties
Hell rail block so you know we gettin coofy,
Iceberg drop nigga now ridin' goofy,
28 Inches in the air, know I'm ballin' 'cause my whole wrist pink
And my neck kinda bluey (Dro!)

We fly high no lie you know this (ballin!)
Foreign rides, outside it's like showbiz (ladies)
We stay fly, no lie, and you know this (remix!)
Hips and thighs,oh my!, stay focused

We stay fly, no lie, and you know this (ballin')
Hips and thighs, oh my!, stay focused

You just been included in the Ballaz Extravaganza
You are now a Ballaholic
Just like my team (Dipset, Dipset)
Shouts to Diddy, T.I., Birdman, Dro (Ho)
Remix!
It's like showbiz, ballin'
