Headz ain't ready for this Clik we got
Headz ain't ready man I swear they not

Now a days I had it up to here, from my chest to my head
When the Buddha bless bless my head and the eyes are red
Comin' for ya, 3-2-1 nice to know ya
You wanted to pop junk
So now it's like a little Vigor
I outta floor ya

Headz ain't ready got the Original Gunz and machetes
I Pen-dat ass to de-grass like I was Teddy
Cause brothas ain't ready for the fros and the dreads
Grab the glock and hitcha from ya toes to ya head

There's an X amount of yar-we, yo pass the gar-weed
Pass it over here so I can get Irie-why we
Smoke so much brothas be askin'
Why the Originoo Gunn Clappaz keep on clappin

Headz ain't ready for what my clique got in store
Cause what we got in store keeps us prepared for the war
Shows get blown, hoes get thrown out the room
Plus napkins for nitwits that ride deez from now til noon
Now assume, position, punks pissin' dey pants
Caise lyrical skillz is makin' you feel

Still if-in-case you didn't know how we be livin
It's in, my nature to keep Robin like Givens
For real doe, bring your steel bro'
Kill or be killed jerk - you don't know
So that leaves ya screwed like a dildo
I still blow, punks I crush into dust
Plus we gothcha bucks (Who the warriors?)
Rock and Ruck, and what?

Headz ain't ready for this Clik we got
Headz ain't ready man I swear they not

Headz ain't ready for this Clik we got
Headz ain't ready man I swear they not

What's that aroma in the air? Trees
So what that means son?
Son that mean it's huntin' season
Time to stack papes do you got what it takes
Can you react when your life's at stake?
I rock the stripes of an M-P, pon my timb tree
And keep the Taurus for my enemies
Whenever he comes in the mist of this Boot Camp Clik
It gets realer so watch Steele serve justice
Thirty-two degrees freeze until
These MC's decide to relieve you of grievin'

On my way from out of state, I hit my block F-A-P
Wit my man Ruck and my man Rock S-T
Jus' left my man brown nose
Now we gotta sack of the black for the shows
Clothes, ain't really nuthin to me
But I stay wit my Timberland tree, and my
B-double-O-T-C
Rock, the party, keep my hair notty
Did you notice me flowin' with potency
Buckshot b-d-b-d and the Evil Dee, we rock fluently

Headz ain't ready for this Clik we got
Headz ain't ready man I swear they not

Headz ain't ready for this Clik we got
Headz ain't ready man I swear they not

Mr. McGee don't get me angry (why?)
You wouldn't like it when I'm angry
Ill thoughts to the dome start to change me
Rearrange the, way I be kickin', my flavor
Even my neighbors
Notice a change in the Ruck-est behavior

Now you roaches don't even come close or approach this
What I be smokin' leave your monkey ass chokin'
Straight from yardie like the one Robert Marley
You hardly ever saw me without a bag of that bomb weed
I wake up in the mornin' and chocolate's what starts it
Reachin' in my pocket for the roach to spark it

I'm steppin' in hotter this year
Wit my bredern dry-tear, my cousin wit no fear
So who, wanna come tess Top Dawg
They dig you out the ditch and then they take you to the morgue

Here's Misdemeanor, the crook wit the mouth full
Known for bein' live and rockin' those flava Timbos
Half pass Lincoln, clothes dead and stinkin'
Country bwoy got me just zonin' and thinkin'
Time to start stackin' on you crab ass snakes
Gotta move right, cause my rep's at stake
Call up my dawgs that's quick to bust
P.N.C. take it back to the dust
Now I got fo' eyes to watch my back
Plus my own two make it a full six-pack
Now we bring the ruckas to wannabee knuckas
Bodyin' suckas like I change up my chuckas

Don't you know the W-a-r (war)
Is o-n (on) open to them headz scopin'
Hopin' they can get a bite, and write what I write
But they don't know the night
Keeps me and my Clik air tight (right)
All you biters wanna chunk the script
But your quick to take a flick
By my side as you take my hand, givin' the fake smile
But I peeped you for awhile
Ease off selecta when the B.D. pulled your file
Can I pull your card again, the Buck's guardian
Is the Arm-a-Leg-Leg-Arm-a-Head
So begin to drop the bombs (Heltah Skeltah)
Booyah!

You ask for it, who want beef well here's war
For this I packs twin automatic 4-4's
Kids this ain't before don't even speak about my fleet
Many pop junk but front when MC's meet
Dem not ready

Headz ain't ready for this Clik we got (dem not ready)
Headz ain't ready man I swear they not (naw)
Heady Ain't Ready for the Clik we got (we really ready)
Headz ain't ready man I swear they not (naw)
Headz ain't ready, for the Click we got
(They ain't nowhere near ready)
