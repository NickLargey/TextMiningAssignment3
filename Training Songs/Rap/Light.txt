Ayy, ayy, what's up gang
Let me go secure the M's for the gang
Ayy, ayy, what's up gang
Y'all niggas think it's my fault
Ayy

I got that check and took off
A lot of these niggas look lost
They broke they think it's my fault (f*ck 'em)
Want smoke? We blowing, no cough
I want the bitch, she caught
I'm drippin', I'm stuck with the sauce (good drip)
Yo bitch be fuckin' me raw (good drip)
But she love you don't cut yo bitch off (yo bitch)
Brand new Givenchy it's white (that's light)
Limited Louis, that's light (too light)
Wraith in the city, that's light (that's light)
LED, look at the lights (too light)
We the ones niggas don't like (don't like)
But you lil' niggas too light (too light)
Why even play with yo life? (yo, life)
Bank account looking like yikes (Bank account lookin' like yikes)

I went from fillin' out kites
To puttin' an M on my block
New Gucci sweater is drip (that's drip)
Somebody give me a mop (that's drip)
These niggas act like the cops (Like fuzz)
Gossipin' more than the thots (nigga what?)
In jail I had stripes off the rocks (stripes)
I make you count off the rocks
These niggas think that I made it and can't get my friends, so they wanna be opps
If I see no niggas who hatin' and I'm in that spaceship, I'm droppin' that top
I get that cake like my b-day ain't no happy belated
I'm countin' the guap
Who gave you niggas a voice
Who told you your thoughts count
GPS straight to the money
I put my niggas in route
Big homie got bricks in the drought
AR with the big Mickey Mouse
You pose with your lady at 12, at 8 at that night she had my dick in her mouth
Cameras all over the mansion
You lil' niggas can't shit on my house

I got that check and took off

F*ck-f*ck with-with me-me boy
Cut off your hands and your fingers
100 round in your ears with a ringer
Cock it back, watch it turn to a singer
Get to firing like this Jerry Springer
All of my niggas on go-go
Zip the bag, that AR back like the Pogo
Don't do dirt with these niggas, they popo
Had a G Wagon truck turned to Rojo
Finally came for two weeks in that cold-cold
Heard the hoes going' wild down in soho
One's black and the other one's Mexican
Had the hoes eating dick like El Pollo
Younger than you with a Maybach
Younger than you with a Bentley
Fuckin' your bitch from the back, got her head in a pillow, she keep yellin' gently
Ain't being friends with these niggas 'cause when I was down not a soul had sympathy
But that's how it go when you broke
Now a nigga up like mistletoe 
This bitch on the boat do coke
Bitch I fucked up on my own
Not gonna lie, some of these new niggas clones
Fucked that bitch and she asked for a loan
Had to laugh then I told her get gone
Bitch you gon' get that shit on your own
And nobody give me not a thing
So I spend 90k on my ring
You can see all my pain in my watch
Got my ex downing' bottles of Scotch
Walkin' round with my hand on my crotch
'Cause I'm popping and I know you not
And I know you see just how I'm livin'
You not happy with life so you sippin'
Walkin' Reeboks on treetops gettin' hella guap
Got a big Benz like Sasquatch, every time you see a nigga with a bitch
Know it's top notch

The iPhone IG all the time (I see you)
I dare them niggas go live
Wagyu steak, I dine (real steak)
8 oz, two 55 (real steak)
I can't get funky with niggas, my niggas so groovy, you niggas be jives
If I ain't had love for Meek, I woulda tried to get Nicki Minaj
I need a duffle a verse, I do a hook for a dime
Put murders on FaceTime before I get to the club, nigga, look at the line
Money ain't changed my heart but I'm smarter
I guess it changed my mind
And I take care of my hitters in prison, don't think it's safe inside (stab his ass)
