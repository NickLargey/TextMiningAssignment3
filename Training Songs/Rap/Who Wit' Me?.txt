Oh bar
What is it?

Move it up
Drink it up
Roll it up
Shake it up

Money, sex, alcohol
Shopping sprees at the mall
Who wit' me?
Who? Who?
Who wit' me?
Who? Who?

Mink coats, rabbit furs
Anything that she prefers
Who wit' me?
Who? Who?
Who wit' me?
Who? Who?

Candy thangs, switching lanes
Kron grills and wood brains
Who wit' me?
Who? Who?
Who wit' me?
Who? Who?

Love peace, chicken grease
In the club or in the streets
Who wit' me?

You must be dumb or blind
If you can't see my kind
Sharp as a porcupine
We off the party line

I'm so electrified
I'm so electrified
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so
I'm so electrified

You know there's nothing to it
Where the hell you goin'? Stupid
We off them trees, honey bees
With that duel fluid

Across the river
Above the clouds
It's where you find me wit' my people
Is what I'm talkin' 'bout

Heaven's the mother troad
Clovers and blue diamonds
I don't know what the hell I'm sayin'
But I'm still rhyming

And I'm so ultra fly
Ultramagnetic fly
This vodka wit' this red bulls
Got me energized
