On Friday time to party
Let me see you swing and sway
Let me see you swing 
Tell me are you down with me 
Are you with me
Are you with me

Friday, payday
Ready to do the things we love
We're gonna get our groove on
All night long
Give it up now for the DJ
And put your hands where my eyes can see
It maybe raining but who cares about the weather
Cause when the heat it on
We'll all be getting wetter
It's the start of the weekend
Don't waste no time
For tonight is your night

On Friday time to party
Let me see you swing and sway
Let me see you swing 
Tell me are you down with me 
Are you with me
Are you with me

Everybody's feeling right
Cause we know it's party night
All the ladies looking tight
Weather silk or satin lace or leather
Ooh what a sight
Here's where the party starts
Things can only get better
Just make your way onto the dance floor get together
It's the start of the weekend don't waste no time
For tonight is your night

On Friday time to party
Let me see you swing and sway
Let me see you swing 
Tell me are you down with me 
Are you with me

This party be going on til the break of dawn
Let's give it up let's get it on
Break open a bottle of moet and chandon and when it's gone
We'll start on the dom perignon
This vibe's makin' me high
Like Toni surrounded by
Other people movin' their body
We be kicking mad flavor in yeah ear
Big shout to the people round the side
In the front at the rear 
This is gonna be one hell of a year
And there's no way that I'm letting anyone interfere
This is how we do getting it on in the venue
Can you check my microphone 1 2
Can you give it up now please for the DJ
Giving you a party like a summer sorta okay
Let's see those hands in the air
And wave them around like you just don't care come on
