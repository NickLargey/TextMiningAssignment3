Check, check, check
This is Bones Owens to my right, right here
To my left DJ Klever
My name is Yelawolf
This is Trial By Fire

Uh
Back in 1979 it was a cold day in December
Mamma peeled the paint off the wall screamed
Baby's on the way
They rushed her to the hospital in that old Chevy truck
Running 90 miles an hour down them back roads
Blowing past the sheriff, in the woods smoke bellowing off the engine
Running hot, must of been a sign
They rushed her to the emergency room
Barely made it to the bed
A few minutes later I was screaming for my first breath
A little devil the doctor said
He's got that look in his eye y'know
Reminds me of mischief
Yeah this ones gonna be trouble I can tell it
And then the lights went
Then mamma said doctor somethings burning I can smell it

And it was trial by fire
I'm just under a plane singing to burn it down
You better watch your step
When I come around

Damn right, uh
You could hear lightning for miles around
And oak trees hitting the ground
The wind tore holds on that old Dixie flag on the capitol steps
Change is coming, my great grand mamma said
Quietly clutching her bible, sitting in a rocking chair smoking a cigarette
And the wood creep beneath the porch and the old dog moaned and cried
As the sirens passing by
And Mr. Williams brought a mean batch of that moonshine to the wake
You know one comes and one goes as they say
And they laid a flower on the grave
Buried on December 29th for robbing a bank
And killed by the police, see you in the next life old friend
Little did he know, his old friend was back again
As the son of Sheila Diane

And it was trial by fire
I'm just under a plane singing to burn it down
You better watch your step
When I come around

You know how the story goes
See I'm a curious soul
A straight bullet to some a chatter and whisper at night 
And the head of a following smoke a rebel at heart a devilish grin
A leader of men a preacher at ten
I was already in spiritual spin
Back in the saddle again
12s in the back of the trunk making it rattle again
Giving them nothing but trunk living
The baby the babies got powers the baby is harming
F*ck a church im a confession for profession
