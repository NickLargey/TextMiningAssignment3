Girl I feel the way you love me, hold me at night and hug me
You got the phone from my pocket to beep me and bug me
Forget the do rag, I ain't no thug, gee, I'm more bugged gee
Sleep in the bathtub, get rid of the waterbed

Move your thongs out to the side
Forget the the room, hotel lobby, I bone on the rug, gee
Reset the tripod, filming women like Rocco
Putting their hands between their legs, with ecstasy

I feed the girls like cats, Purina to go
Here's your bowl, they always jump out the shower
Doggy style on the couch, with their heads shedding on my pants
Rubbing next to me, you pay me, I'll pull out a [unverified] gee
You changed up on me, now you gotta pee

Freaks get naked, freaks get naked
Freaks get naked baby, freaks get naked baby
Freaks get naked, freaks get naked
Freaks get naked baby, freaks get naked baby

Trojans in the green pack, you lay on the kitchen table
And lean back, fruit cocktail and pancakes syrup
Flow down your butt crack, ice cream around your pelvis
You're a star, baby, buy a ticket from New York

You wanna meet guys like me, directors in Hollywood
You wanna sell this, win awards in Vegas, slide your G-strings off
You're wit' the top film makers, mid-town traffic
I'm meeting with Black Tail, you're talking to fakers

I own a factory, my workers are thong makers
Black woman with Carribean shakers
I've been doin' this since Time Square Arcades had Space Invaders
Removing your panties off slow on Penn Station escalators

I love lesbians, they're not haters hunny, you graduated to booty shorts
Hands around the missal, you made it to the majors
Pick a condom, cherry, strawberry, blue berry
I got all flavors, I got all the flavors

Freaks get naked, freaks get naked
Freaks get naked baby, freaks get naked baby
Freaks get naked, freaks get naked
Freaks get naked baby, freaks get naked baby

You make the appetizers, I'ma reconnect the DVD's
The television is clear, ghetto booty in progress
Adjust the antennas, hunny, no need for cable
I fix the triple X wires, don't lie if you're on your time of the month

You don't have to rush, 'cause internal problems can hold
I don't want the room to smell like car tires
I'm sipping stolichnayas, butterscotch
Soaking your G-spot area from Breyer's
Don't fool yourself with the toys under your bed

You're deniers, no time to hurt you, they're looking for screamers
I'm looking for cryers, admire your bed sheet you're on
Careful planning, the one I need to teach you on
No regular movie, I rather watch porn

Freaks get naked, freaks get naked
Freaks get naked baby, freaks get naked baby
Freaks get naked, freaks get naked
Freaks get naked baby, freaks get naked baby
