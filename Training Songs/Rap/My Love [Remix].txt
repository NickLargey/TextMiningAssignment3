Long checks, long chips, long dick and rubbers

On the block soon as the moon it be scramblin'

How to snap it on, how to take trips with the package on
How to go and come back with the package gone

Hit a town, hit a city, hit a state
Every club, every party, we fly
Baggin' bitches, every party and high

Yeah, please believe Jimmy Jizzie's the truth
Every where I go to brezies I'm true
Man they tell me that I over does it
You need to slow up, you over thugging

But the hoes slugging in the open public
I smoke like f*ck it, I just roll up puffing
Now they roll up fucking
Take two totes and love it

Put them in my Coupe moving fast switching gears
Tell 'em to listen here, get it crystal clear
Stay crispy to the fit in every kick I wear

Summer time in one's jeans and my tank top
I'm on the scene with the dice like banks stock
Get money man, yeah uh

Moving fast, hundred grand on the black fall
Please love, get your feet up off my dad's velour
