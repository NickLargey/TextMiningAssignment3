Cut the gain (x3)

Wind up my wind with your grinder
With width up my vain
Cut the gain
Hurt me, hurt me twice
The trash will hit
Hit high hit low
While I do neither
I spit I throw up my despisor
Fit fit the bit with it
The trash will hit 
Bounce bend bust I
Move fast
I move three to the first
One I rock
I kick the can
I can the first melted

Extend my body to the wider
Spy light I try super fruit lighter
I could neither glide the night
This try

Wipe that sound
But I deny it
Wipe that sound
