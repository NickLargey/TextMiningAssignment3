You've been
Missin'
Out out on all the chances you've been given
Is it something
Within
Holding you back instead of living

Your day is coming though it seems far
Things will be clear when you love who you are
Nothin' can stop you as long as you listen to your heart

Lift your head to the sky
And keep tryin'
Believe in you
And it will take you higher

You have
Sorrows
Everywhere you turn they seem to follow
If you
Let go
Happiness will come to you tomorrow

Your day is coming though it seems far
Things will be clear when you love who you are
Nothin' can stop you as long as you listen to your heart

Lift your head to the sky
And keep tryin'
Believe in you
And it will take you higher
