You see lately, there's been a funny feelin'
That won't stop bothering me
Your tub is shakin'
Erase it from my heart and mine
But it just don't want to leave

I can't explain the way you driving me insane
I can't explain the way you drive me insane
No, I can't
And I can't complain, baby
I can't complain
'Cause, girl, I love that thing
I love the things that you do
When you do what you do to me

I've got this feelin', baby
I've got this feelin', baby
I've got this feelin' inside
I've got this feelin', baby
I've got this feelin' inside

Got me searching for someone to find the
Perfect one for me that I can trust in
And I've been yearning for someone to love me
Just for me, just for me
Well, well, well, well

I can't explain the way you driving me insane
I can't explain the way you drive me insane
No, I can't
And I can't complain, baby
I can't complain
'Cause, girl, I love that thing
I love the things that you do
When you do what you do to me

Feel it, feel it, deep inside

I can't explain the way you driving me insane
I can't explain the way you drive me insane
No, I can't
And I can't complain, baby
I can't complain
'Cause, girl, I love that thing
I love the things that you do
When you do what you do to me

Now lately there's been a funny feelin'
