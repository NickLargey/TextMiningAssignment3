I'm jumpin' out my coupe wit' da missin' roof 
And I'm so fuckin' high I need a parachute.
"Gucci Mane, do you remember me from last month?"
"Girl, I can't remember nothin' but my last blunt"
Bling blau diamond necklaces is for every chain.
Bitch I'm Gucci so I put rims on bout everything.
I used to care about money now a days 
I don't so if I like her enough I'll buy her everythang she want.

I got that 3-5-7 so don't try your luck.
Bullets have yo body hot you'll need a fire truck.
So re-up with us, got white girl yeah that Anime.
Today I'm shittin' on rappers so I call 'em Jazze Pha.

I'm not a boy so I can not be your boyfriend 
but if you want me to then I can be your Gucci Mane.
And if you're man can't beat it up then I bet Gucci can.
Just ask your lady and I bet that shes a Gucci fan. Gucci!
Bought all my hoes Gucci, most all my clothes Gucci, 
This ain't no Coogi you still can't move me.
And this is the soundtrack of the Gucci Mane movie, 
Gucci Mane movie, the Gucci mane movie.

Lambo engine in the rear and I'm switchin' gears.
Y'all suckas can't f*ck wit dis young nigga here.
Diamonds on my neck colder than a case of beer.
So when I fall off in the club all the bitches cheer.
In an '06 convertible my top can disappear.
Just bought a house in cali pool parties all through of the year.
Tip fade stupid ways I don't wear a beard.
They say that Gucci stay fresh but the nigga weird.
I shop of at Phil plaza look at lil buddy he shop at Sears
Diamonds solid so big it damn near broke my ears
Girl you ridin' wit' la flare so what you got to fear?
2010 no more Rolls Royces i'm just coppin' theirs

I'm not a boy so I can not be your boyfriend 
but if you want me to then I can be your Gucci Mane.
And if you're man can't beat it up then I bet Gucci can.
Just ask your lady and I bet that shes a Gucci fan.
Bought all my hoes Gucci, most all my clothes Gucci, 
This ain't no Coogi you still can't move me.
And this is the soundtrack of the Gucci Mane movie, 
Gucci Mane movie, Gucci Mane movie.

Jazze Pha, Gucci know they didn't expect this 
It ain't no secret run up on me you'll regret it.
I'm like a ball player focused on my next hit.
And I hit home runs I don't know how to bunt bitch.
And this that Cali kush you need to pass the blunt bitch.
I'm Sorry that I cuss you baby girl you're gorgeous.
Psych you're not gorgeous but your ass is enormous.
And if you never call me I'll be rich regardless.
Picture perfect flow this verse is a portrait
I got three matches but I'm for Valley apartments
Bouldercrest flash show, seen Gresham where I started
You want to find me bitch just keep ridin' down Mortlen
Gucci!

I'm not a boy so I can not be your boyfriend
But if you want me to then I can be your Gucci Mane.
And if you're man can't beat it up then I bet Gucci can.
Just ask your lady and I bet that shes a Gucci fan.
Bought all my hoes Gucci, most all my clothes Gucci, 
This ain't no Coogi you still can't move me.
And this is the soundtrack of the Gucci Mane movie, 
Gucci Mane movie, Gucci Mane movie.
