Just be very still, I ain’t gonna hurt anybody

Catch me sliding with the slimes cause them my youngins

Chrissy Carter bezel inside my baby pampers, eww
I get out the work and let the jay snap the scale
My bitch ride slow with the yay like she get L’s
I wear that white, I cook that white, but I am not no chef
Add a little soda, put the tan on it
I got the shit for the L O and my shawty want it
I drink more mud than a pig, I think pork want me
And the front of the Mazzi look like a fork don't it?
Let it breathe
I'm not no rat but Young Thugger be chasing cheese
I want the M's and I’m not talking Micky D’s
My jewelry gold like the tokens at Chuck E. Cheese

One night I was in Santos, it was lit like a candle
I was fly like a bird, I had on Stüssy Bape camo
With a cutie espanol, she had a booty like J-Lo
She had on jeggings and sandals, you've been trapped in the bando
She has to trap in the bando, ‘cause her momma got cancer
She can’t work in the states because her green papers ain’t legal
F*ck Obama un peso, she be like grande un peso, push the molly un peso
So she can feed her abuelo, she refuse to just settle
On them shoes with them red soles
And refuse to be nude in front of them dudes on that there pole
She can’t lose she just ooze a bunch of ambition like Nepo
Meanwhile I could be ruler, and ride the streets on my Benzo
So now she get money by carrying stuff for friends though
'Cause the kid named birdy look nerdy but he be up at the bandos
She robbed Birdy for birdies, now Birdy's after her head tho'
Hold on I think I see Birdy, and Birdy killed my Cuban ho
