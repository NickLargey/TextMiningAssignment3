All day long 'til the early morn, you got your mind on him
Who's got their mind on you
And while he creeps on you, I'm diggin' on you
So crazy, sexy, cool, girl he must be a fool

If you spent last night crying on your pillow
It's on tonight, tonight
If he leaves you hanging on the weekend
It's on tonight, tonight

If you put me on, I will guarantee, you won't be sorry, no
Cause I'm the man you need
Ain't trying to player hate, but I just can't wait
To show that I can do all the things that Joe won't do

If you spent last night crying on your pillow
It's on tonight, tonight
If he leaves you hanging on the weekend
It's on tonight, tonight

Baby, it's just the thing that you want
I'm everything that your seeing, baby

If you spent last night crying on your pillow
It's on tonight, tonight
If he leaves you hanging on the weekend
It's on tonight, tonight

If you spent last night crying on your pillow
It's on tonight, tonight
If he leaves you hanging on the weekend
It's on tonight, tonight

I just wanna love you down
I only want to be around
I just wanna love you down
Wanna be your love

If you spent last night crying on your pillow
It's on tonight, tonight
If he leaves you hanging on the weekend
It's on tonight, tonight

If you spent last night crying on your pillow
It's on tonight, tonight
If he leaves you hanging on the weekend
It's on tonight, tonight

If you spent last night crying on your pillow
It's on tonight, tonight
