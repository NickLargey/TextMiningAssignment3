I woke up in the night
Grabbed my forehead
Wipe my forehead with the sweat on to the bed
Deep inside thought
Thinking of a way to get trapped 
And walk the streets without getting clapped
Just because I'm tieing the fuzz growing in my buzz
I'm doing my justice, bust this slug to the ignorant
Who said I didn't have knowledge of self
So come and feel the wrath
So listen
First of all let me explain
That sometimes when I drop this see I'm bound to make it rain 
The god is heavy
I blow you up like dynamite
Into my dome I let the l ignite
Right, I take you on flight, soar, into there
The war starts here

See we murder mc's every day
Motherfuckers don't play
Straight from the bucktown side of the block
Keep your shit hot
Like we said, that's when all the madness stops

See we murder mc's every day
Motherfuckers don't play
Straight from the bucktown side of the block
Keep your shit hot
Like we said, that's when all the madness stops

To all the gods who know who's the coloured man
The colored man is the obvious, you understand?
I kill him, and drill 'I'm in my bootcamp
Who can't survive in the creek?
You can't
Champion, bootcampian click
Stick and move
I bust your shit
Move and stick
It's the original crook
Stomping through your army, what!
Gortex to your head
Keep your eyes shut
But, I'll take you in consideration
My occupation is to bust your federation
With my ammunition
Flipping precision, being precise
He's right, I'm nice
You can check my status and my apparatus
See the baddest buckshot shot the buddah
Murder hero to clean my pipe like ruger
Smoke a bag of charm then I drop the bomb
Buckshot I represent the arm leg leg arm
Head, natty dread, boy big him up
Roll thick like syrup
Cause chaos and terror

See we murder mc's every day
Motherfuckers don't play
Straight from the bucktown side of the block
Keep your shit hot
Like we said, that's when all the madness stops

See we murder mc's every day
Motherfuckers don't play
Straight from the bucktown side of the block
Keep your shit hot
Like we said, that's when all the madness stops

I had a vision
It appeared to me in the form of a devil
But the rebel wasn't there to see
For me this is the year to be
Head of the army, the follower must flee
And ain't no room for the weak f*ck the weak
They get bucked down by my Boot Camp murder fleet
We come through, representin' on the regular everyday
Night time is the only way
You feel the breeze from your enemy
Take flight with these when you rock with these MCs
Mind degrees is known to some
The son is the seven, representing the Sun
The heatseeker
Cypher maker
Quick to look into the eye of a nigga then take a
Sec to realize, I see right through you
Double gauge
I'm pointing the rage at your crew
Blow your back out until your chest disappear
I blew the motherfucker
Now we outta here

See we murder mc's every day
Motherfuckers don't play
Straight from the bucktown side of the block
Keep your shit hot
Like we said, that's when all the madness stops

See we murder mc's every day
Motherfuckers don't play
Straight from the bucktown side of the block
Keep your shit hot
Like we said, that's when all the madness stops

See we murder mc's every day
Motherfuckers don't play
Straight from the bucktown side of the block
Keep your shit hot
Like we said, that's when all the madness stops

See we murder mc's every day
Motherfuckers don't play
Straight from the bucktown side of the block
Keep your shit hot
Like we said, that's when all the madness stops
