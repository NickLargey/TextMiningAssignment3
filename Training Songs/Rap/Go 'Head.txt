Aye yo this on my momma 
Straight up this my wizard 
Girl with that fatty 
You deserve to get served 
Consider, this a invitation from that kidder 
Meaning hood nigga that smoke and sip scissor up
Submit her to the apple bottom contest
Yes I confess
Your bottom is the biggest 
I guess it's how it's positioned and where it sit at 

All up high and that's why I wanna hit that (yes) 
Get at me before you leave off the scene
I'm a post over there in these thousand dollar jeans 
With Gipp at the bar with the rest of my team
I know I sound anxious but momma I'm on a bean
You know what I mean, I hope you on the scene 
The way you move that thing that got me insane 
I seen you when I walked over dancing with that line 
Damn girl, that ass off the chain

You see me watchin' that booty 
Booty, booty, booty, booty, booty 
I see you lookin' at my booty 
Booty, booty, booty, booty, booty 
Now move your booty to that beat 
Go head 
Now watch me move it to that beat 
Go head 
You see me watching that booty 

Yeah hey lil mama, what you doin' on the curb 
Pretty face, long lean draggin' on the flinnur 
Light blue Benz got fins like flippers 
So plush when I push guaranteed to hit her 
Split her, put her on lean and baby sit her 
Feathers round her neck, buck naked - take a picture (Kodak) 
No mixed drinks, straight shot. She got a scissor up  
She can't be my girlfriend but she can be my wizzard
Tall heels, painted toes in them glass slippers 

All spandex, no buttons, no zippers 
Body tap tippers 
Blow pop lickers 
Booty in my face with the wide load sticker 
Moonshine sippers 
Money go-getters 
In every city we go, the freaks gonna feel us 
Give it to slow it down 
Spin around, don't run 
Gipp got a jaw breaker for ya honey bun 

You see me watchin' that booty 
Booty, booty, booty, booty, booty 
I see you lookin' at my booty 
Booty, booty, booty, booty, booty 
Now move yo booty to that beat

I want all that booty in line 
So when the beat break down one time 
Just grind 
And if you bring a friend, now that's fine 
I want all that booty in line 
So when the beat break down two times 
Just grind 
And if you bring a friend, well that's fine 

There it is 
If your lady didn't come back 
Gipp must have pimped her 
Gotta dig deep, Nickname Dirk Diggler 
If she fine then a dime 
Then she mine with the hid up 
I'm pumped 
Watch me jump pronto on that rizz up 
Playin' wit a onion, can't get no bigger 
Zip lock that ass and bag it like killer

For shorty sho' shake that for that kitty
