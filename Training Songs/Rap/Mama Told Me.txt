Hey, Big Boi

Kelly

Player, player

As the world shakes unharmed
Twan, calm in the middle of the storm bomb
Flow tsunami, ring the alarm
Big Boi for dummies come and get some huh, wisdom,
Like yo back teeth or get the f*ck on, like some bad chi
Negative energy not tolerated
You all about a dollar and I'm ?
Freefalling, Tom Petty heartbreaker, living legend, rap scholar, art major
'Cause I make major art
Like Beethoven, Van Gogh, or Mozart so don’t start
Around these parts we reign supreme and stay Krispy Kreme clean
Blue jeans, Jordans Number 3's, that’s important

Be careful how you play your cards (That's what my mama told me)
Be true to self and you’ll go far (That's what mama told me)
Try not to break too many hearts (That's what mama told me)
I always knew I’d be a star (That’s what mama told me)

Mama used to say take your time
Well I’m a pickpocket when I design rhymes
Every little step I take like Bob Brown
And It's so profound that when I throw those nouns
We gon' get low low down until we get back up while everything gravy, taters mashed up
You know I keep a full plate
And a full thing of hot ones, throw away 38's
But everything's straight, Bleed, shit
I got everything I can need
Me, boy, I’m everything you can’t see
Like three blind mice, on the chase of some great cheese
And Cheddar Man say he got some great trees, say he serve me and my nigga Three G
Butt tees, Jordans, number 5, you niggas boring

Be careful how you play your cards (That's what my mama told me)
Be true to self and you’ll go far (That's what mama told me)
Try not to break too many hearts (That's what mama told me)
I always knew I’d be a star (That’s what mama told me)

'Cause I travel like a rocket, I do
Mind riddle every socket for you
I sway on the edge of the lightning (Yeah)
Magnetic, can’t stop
Just floating won’t drop
I slip (I slip) I slide (I slide)
Back up the ride
I'm skippin' every mountaintop
I'm reachin' for the highest high

Be careful how you play your cards (That's what my mama told me)
Be true to self and you’ll go far (That's what mama told me)
Try not to break too many hearts (That's what mama told me)
I always knew I’d be a star (That’s what mama told me)

Yeah
Yeah
That's what mama told me
That's what mama told me
Mama told me
Thats what mama told me (Mama told me)
Mama told me

Auu!
