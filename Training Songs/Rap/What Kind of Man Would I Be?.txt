You know
We can't do this
We just can't
Listen

You say you feel disenchanted
Cause lately he takes you for granted
Still faithful and true you've remain to hurt so have I
You pour out your heart and I listen
And we catch a vibe reminiscing
Temptation so strong not to mention the yearning inside

But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
Cause I don't want to see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
Cause if we lay down tonight
It won't justify through a lover's sigh

The feeling is strong and we know it
But we gotta see past the moment
There's too much to lose if we blow it
This is no lie
Still here we are both together
With promises made that we'd never
Yet feeling it now more than ever
I can't deny

But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
Cause I don't want to see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
Cause if we lay down tonight
It won't justify through a lover's sigh

Here we are
All alone
But somehow we got to be strong

But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
Cause I don't want to see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
Cause if we lay down tonight
It won't justify through a lover's sigh

Makes me wanna say oh-oh
Just gotta say oh-oh
Makes me wanna say oh-oh
Just gotta say oh-oh

What kind of man could I be
Oh can't be unfaithful
Sorry baby
