-P. Barrett-M. Bennett-

When Israel was in Egypt's land
Suffering, suffering, suffering
Oppressed so hard they could not stand
The more things change a the more they remain the same
Suffering, suffering, suffering
And God said, go down Moses
Way down in Egypt's tend
We say pharaoh but you know them name

Tell old pharaoh, this is just a lyrical game
Let my people go
Big up all South African freedom fighters

Because a me philosophy, them would a kill me
Look how me right and yet them wrong me
And if them have the power
Then me know them woulda hang me
But that nah stop me from talk reality

Chorus:
'Cause I will be the voice, I will be the pen
I will be the Moses weh come back again
And if it cost me me wealth, cost me me fame
I will wear the next X behind my name

'Cause big speech mouth sweet big promises a make
And all now mi no see weh poor people a get
A pure blood and tears and whole heap of sweat
And that cause sufferation and a whole heap of death
How could you be sifting there, telling me that you care
Promise people good things and by the Bible you swear
Now is the time to make you speech
Because the right time come
An you a go on like you dumb or them cut out you tongue
Me haffi talk even if you brand me
You look how me right and yet you want wrong me
And if them have the power
Then me know them woulda hang me
But that nah stop me from talk reality
I will be the voice, I will be the pen
I will be the Moses weh come back again
And if it cost me me wealth, cost me me fame
I will wear the next X behind my name

Go down Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old pharaoh
Let my people go
Gwann go do it, by any means necessary

Equality and justice free from prejudice
True love from above, a that we fi practice
It kind of hard but we still optimistic
Help the children of Israel, right out of Egypt
This task is very
Extraordinary
But we haffi use any means necessary

Long time we a hush a full time we speak up
'Cause f-are-e-e-d-o-m is a must

Chorus

A put me life on the line for things me believe in
Knowing the truth cause offense but me know a no sin
Confident in the victory over evil will win
So people smile and stop the crying
Them try to destroy every prophet that Massa God send
But God is so good that him send more again
With diplomatic attitude and strategic trend
Come fi help another Daniel out of the lion den
A me philosophy, them woulda kill

A put the captive case in front of the Almighty God
An him say, Son don't run, you cannot be coward
Moses was protected because him have a rod
Now we use a chapter a day run the devil away method

Go down Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old pharaoh
Let my people go
Because a me philosophy, them would a kill me
Look how me right and yet them wrong me
And if them have the power
Then me know them woulda hang me
But that nah stop me from talk reality

Chorus

This is a warning to all pharaoh
All false leader, all the downpressor
Them have the whole world under severe pressure
And them don't love people, them only love more power
But your days are numbered, Massa God nah sleep
And if you follow we through the red sea
Then you must get defeat
You have strength for the coward, and you frighten the weak
But a God give we the word and we must have to speak

Go down Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old pharaoh
Let my people go
Warning, warning, warning
Tell you this morning, I tell this evening
Take warning
Let my people go, my people go
