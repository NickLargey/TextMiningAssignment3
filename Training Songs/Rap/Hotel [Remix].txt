And I wanna get wit you cause yous a cutie

Just when you thought I was done

Cum see the strip its like takin' a ski trip
Zero degree wrist 80 a whop
My chain blingy pinky full of radiant rocks
I ain't Chingy I'm outside the motel party
Passenger side wit Rob in the Ferrari
I smoke la-la get high like I'm a Marley
Wit the mami's you can find me where the bar be
Its hot as hell in here got Kels in here
You can smell in the air we got L's in here

And ain't nothin' but pretty females in here yeah

And vacation on an island I ain't know existed

And you know I do my thing in the Vera Wang
So fresh so clean 20 carrot pinky ring

But tell the truth you don't know a bitch as bad as me

In the penthouse suite and we actin' naughty
Dis chicks so nice got the cris so nice
In the hotel room thoia thoing all night
And you know I'm ready, L'Pearla teddy
Rock the boat steady till I'm hot and sweaty
In the hotel motel make you wanna go tell

So I can afford to spend 10 grand on room service a week

And the tip the waiter get prolly more than he make in a month
I'm in the hot tub breaking a blunt
I got 4 freaks in my suite all getting naked at once
While their girlfriends wait in the front
I got plenty cigars and plenty bottles and they not from the mini bar
I got Swissy looking out for me
I'm in the presidential you can see the whole city from my balcony

[Chorus]
