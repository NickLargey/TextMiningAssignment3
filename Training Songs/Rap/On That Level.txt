I got that liq' in my system, somebody gonna be my victim
Got me a turned up shawty, man this girl know how to party
VIP turned up with the models, drinks free so we turn up the bottles
Rubbing on her body, twerking, licking out her tongue like she thirsty
Hands in the air when her song on, love dancing in the mirror with her thong on
Know what she want and she gon' get it, know what I want and I'm gon' hit it
Look in her eyes saying "Come get it," tried to decide I gotta come with it
Real cute face, nice titties, uncut, explicit

Shawty don't want wait no more, she on that level
And tonight she gonna do the most, she on that level
So I tell her do you, get your money, do you
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you

'Fore you burn that cake, you gotta earn that cake
'Fore you burn that cake, you gotta earn that cake
'Fore you make them tips you gotta shake them hips
'Fore you make them tips you gotta shake them hips
Show 'em you know how to get it, bounce ya ass and shake ya titties
Bounce ya ass and shake ya titties, bust it open make it jiggle
You might get a cash roll if you show that ass ho
You might get a cash-roll if you show that ass ho
We be really throwing hundreds 'cause we really getting money
We be really throwing hundreds 'cause we really getting money
She a fool, everybody throwing 10s on that bitch
I'm sloppy, I'm pissy on Ros√© and Crys
I'm drinking, I'm driving, I'm celebrating living
I'm smoking, I'm sipping, hands down I'm pimpin'
I can still see some haters in the corners of my eyes
Ain't worry 'bout nothing man, this motherfucker life

Shawty don't want wait no more, she on that level
And tonight she gonna do the most, she on that level
So I tell her do you, get your money, do you
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you

Do you slow roll that body? Do you come pop this molly?
Do you and I'mma do me baby, just came home please drive me crazy
I need a freak who gon' give it to me all day,
Let her have at and suck it in the hallway
We both grown so it's time to play,
Ass up face down she ain't tryna wait
I'm horny as ever, ready to clip,
Time ticking baby girl is you ready or what?
She a freak in them sheets and a geek in school,
No playing, no hands when she eat the dude
Pretty face, small waist, she a main attraction,
Talk that talk plus her walk is nasty
She ready all the time, she ain't faking the f*ck,
And I respect her mind 'cause I know what she want

Shawty don't want wait no more, she on that level
And tonight she gonna do the most, she on that level
So I tell her do you, get your money, do you
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
