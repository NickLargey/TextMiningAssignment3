Pullin' up to the club 
Six coke dealers in my truck 
Slidin' to the v.i room 
Hypnotik is in my cup 

Then I felt someone grab me 
And say ain't you from Cali 
Then say welcome to Miami 
Yea she was on me heavy 

So I brushed up like whats up 
So her jeans was tight as what 
I say next she made me step 
Back a minute she was wet 
By then I was so ready 

She got my tank top so sweaty 
Tossed her up like Machiavelli 
And yea she was on me heavy 

[Chorus] 
Oh keep sweatin 
Uh uh keep swe'tin' 
(oh I'm sweaty its so hot I'm sweaty) 
Oh well you really don't stop 
Do what you do till you're bodies hot 
Back it on up to the wall then drop 
Oh now take it to the top 
Now push it back push it back push it back baby 
Now push it back push it back push it back oh 
Push it back push it back uh push it back push it bak uh 

Come on 
3am club is packed 
Sure by now she's feelin' that 
I might go and take her home 
Yea she knew I made it known 
Sweat drippin' down her face 
Took my mind to a different place 
Club was cool 
If I had my way yea we'd be at my place 
Krazzi how she was down 
Looked at me and said lets bounce 
Gt coupe in velor 
Looked at her and said swell huh 
Then we started to roll out 
Almost to my crib and she's down 
For whateva' you know I'm down 
Yea she'll be sweatin' for me now 
Come on 

[Chorus]

Woke up in the mornin'
And I washed my face 
Had hoochies in my bed 
3 by the fire place 
Another 4 on the rug 
And they keepin' on touch 
Everybody do the snake 
Wen they fuckin' wit us 
Now chicks love me 
Well at least they say so 
Or maybe its the money 
Or the sweet 
See I dun give a f*ck 
I just leave and replace hoes 
And everyone's a playa'
But believe me they ain't Joe 

Stains on my shirt 
And its not from that club 
Ray j dunno how to act 
You can if you feel me 
We can rock away 
I just wanna make ya sweat 
Y'all feel me 
Right around tha world 
From east to west coasts 
Gonna make sure y'all go home 
And change clothes 
But now we just want you're clothes to be soaked 
And if you can't take it 
Undress on the dance floor 

Oh keep sweatin'
Uh uh keep sweatin'
(oh in sweaty its so hot I'm sweaty) 
Oh well you really don't stop 
Do what you do till you're bodies hot 
Back it on up to the wall then drop 
Oh now take it to the top 

Keep sweatin'
Uh uh keep sweatin'
(oh I'm sweaty its so hot I'm sweaty) 
Oh well you really don't stop 
Do what you do till you're bodies hot 
Back it on up to the wall then drop 
O0o now take it to the top 
Now push it back push it back push it back baby 
Now push it back push it back push it back oh 
Push it back push it back uh push it back push it back uh
