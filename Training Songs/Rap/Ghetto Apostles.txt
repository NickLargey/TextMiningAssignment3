featuring Bless  Freestyle  Poetic 

[Intro: Shabazz The Disciple] 
Yeah  yeah  the revenge of the saga 
Ghetto apostles 
General Grym  Sargeant Shabazz 
Lieutenant Bless  Captain Freestyle 
Repport to your post 
Baby J  C12 
The industry... give up the ghost 

[Chorus: Shabazz The Disciple] 
We win the war 'cause we bomb first 
It's like grenade converse 
Snatch it with the Vietnam verse 
Ghetto apostles doin Godz Work 
Boostin camouflaged shirts 
Marchin through your bitches and your concerts 

[Shabazz The Disciple] 
I'm that gorilla in the mist 
Stalkin with an army of insalents 
I got your organization under surveillence 
You move your pawn 2 squares as the King unveils 
Hired military agents, soldiers marchin in for the kill 
This is a war, join ranks, play your position 
Put the industry in checkmate, force 'em under submission 
Your whole perimeter is surrounded by my legion 
You're trapped inside the center of an isolated region 
Chk-chk-bloaw! Bloaw! Glass shatters, bullets scatter 
No evidence or fingerprints of C12 matter 
Black bishop movin in, attack the queen 
Sabotage frontlines, the industry's in quarentine 

[Bless] 
This is a violent course, forget all violent thoughts 
No silent war, massive survival course 
Mount your ridin horse and rapid thoughts 
Survive the holocaust, grab your holy cross 
and crush 'em like star 
Witness your empire fall like Sodom and Gamorra 
Convert your bibles, cut rhymes of Tora 
Bless'll be the high exhaltor 
Divine curer, whose mind is purer 
Starrin in my rivals eyes, I analyze 
Causin examinin, paralyze 
Although they choose to itemize lives 

[Chorus x2] 

[Freestyle of Arsonists] 
Continue infiltration by firebomb detonation 
Phasers and lasers, scopin, token from smoke inhalation 
Secret service agents are comin at me, I gotta hit 'em 
Eye strain, threw a grenade, settin off the sprinkler system 

[Poetic/Grym Reaper of Gravediggaz] 
I specialize in inferior terrorizin your airwaves 
Like droppin off thermal-nuclear bombs in subways 
I'm here to stress your life, paintin pictures of death 
Ancient scriptures with your silhouette 
I'm coldest winter, bringin the Earth tremors 
Inverse your innersanctum, my sagmental warden 
Haha, I laugh at how I bang them 
Hoes coppin a plea should've took the oppurtunity to flee 
I bring terror to ears like the Phantom 
My foes reveal a Navy Seal approachin ghetto walls 
Enemies forfeit, jackets stained from open sores 
Non-negociable term for your surrender 
I beat your weak arsenal and burn it in the center 

[Chorus x2] 

[Freestyle of Arsonists] 
Rhyme angle, special operation, sub-team Arsonist 
Switch the disc and get out of there fast, we don't want to take no risk 
Code name, Freestyle, alias the asthmatic 
Full metal jacket status with the diplomatic 
Burocratic tactics, we got the area secure now 
Triple the see-4 and get rid of the whole floor, yo 
Copy, I copy that, we got the whole music business wired 
When the shit blow, your whole empire despise is 

[Bless] 
We could take it and live lavish and still build on the mathematics 
More precise, cut karets, rock ice and still civilize the savage 

[Shabazz The Disciple] 
Dancin in the garden of eden, gotta take a long breathin 
Glancin back at days I used to be behind the bars with heathin 

[Poetic/Grym Reaper of Gravediggaz] 
Last like the Aztecs, cash checks, blast techs 
Collect all of my assets from sales from the cats sets 

[Freestyle of Arsonists] 
Iceless but priceless, top of the price list 
Probably the first on your heist list 
You might miss, so knowledge this 

[Outro] 
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! What?! What!? 
No commercials, baby! What!?
