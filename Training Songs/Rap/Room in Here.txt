Baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

I want you by lonesome, above this counter space
It's easy and wholesome when no one's in the way
Well if no one's in the running for the part
I'd love to pick a day
To show you the main room (Whatever's a good time)
I don't need a bouquet, I just need proper space
Homie three blocks away, I got bottles for days
I got tropical haze, go ahead and wave bye
Let me help with your coat, grab a hold of my arm
Tell them niggas to move, tell your sister you fine

Cause baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

As crazy as it may seem, it's not too hard to read
It's too many if's and maybe's, and not enough certainty
Well if no one's putting numbers on the board
I'd love to take a swing, might even graze you
But I don't mean any harm, I'm just speaking my mind
Take a look at the moon, 'bout as bright as your eyes
We got plenty of space, go ahead and recline
Take a puff of that, get a sip of this wine
Yeah, feelin' good?

Cause baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

She had a bright smile, big white teeth, I mean
Whiter than a white T, remind me of wifey
Met her at the studio, sort of like a high buyer
She told me she had game so we connected like the wifi
She had this Asian swagger â€˜bout her, so I call her mai tai
Started followin' her, she was the only thing on my timeline
And there was this one picture, her in the swimsuit
That made a nigga want to beat it up, and I intend to
But I'mma have to put in work, baby girl then drink it all
Face like Mona Lisa, I'm just tryna be the wall to hang on
I ain't got no patience, I can't wait long
She come and see me, and she don't stay long
And that's the problem, she a good girl
Maybe it's too much smoke in the room
And she don't want that Mary Jane in her Vidal Sassoon
So I'mma take a minute, and walk her to her Uber
Got a bullet in my heart, and she the shooter
Ay, .Paak

Baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?
