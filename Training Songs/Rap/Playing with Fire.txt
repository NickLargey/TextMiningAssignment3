KEVIN FEDERLINE LYRICS

"Lose Control"

That's right just get it 
Let you feel it 
Make you lose control 
This is that hip-hop flavor mixed with a lil bit of rock & roll 
Valet your whip Grab your chick 
You know how it goes 
I got that shit, I got them beats that'll make you lose control 

Step up in the club, so fresh and clean 
Not the outcast that they label me 
I'm rolling with a team, that roll so deep 
We in and out the club everyday of the week 
And I make them hits, when the beat drop 
That's when you here me say say hold up, stop 

Let me take you back to 5o'clock 
When I roll the lamborghini off the block 
But not before I made them chop the top 
And throw some 20 shoe's, oh that's hot 

Hit Nastros For a bite to eat 
No tuxedo 'cause they reconize me 
Her lifestyle, the rich living, the fast cars 
Don't hate 'cause I'm a superstar and I married a superstar 
Never come between us no matter who you are, c'mon 

That's right just get it 
Let you feel it 
Make you lose control 
This is that hip-hop flavor mixed with a lil bit of rock & roll 
Valet your whip Grab your chick 
You know how it goes 
I got that shit, I got them beats that'll make you lose control 

Closet full of kicks 
Garage full of whips 
Vegas crap table got the pit ball sticks 
They never seen a kid win like this 
So rich, that I tattoo the dice on my wrist 
And my girl too, It's no coincidence that SRT got all black tints 
I've never been a digger but I rock 'em nuggets 
One earing cost more than your budget 
I ain't here to brag I'm just here to pop tags 
My ferrari cost more than your lil S-class 
Look man I'm in a whole 'nother tax bracket 
It don't matter what you blow, boy you can't match it 
40 grand I take the whole crew to Miami 
Then we pop Crys off like they won Grammy's 
I take care of my own, that's my family 
Magazine talk 'cause they don't understand me 

That's right just get it 
Let you feel it 
Make you lose control 
This is that hip-hop flavor mixed with a lil bit of rock & roll 
Valet your whip Grab your chick 
You know how it goes 
I got that shit, I got them beats that'll make you lose control 

That's right just get it 
Let you feel it 
Make you lose control 
This is that hip-hop flavor mixed with a lil bit of rock & roll 
Valet your whip Grab your chick 
You know how it goes 
I got that shit, I got them beats that'll make you lose control
