[Verse 1] 
I can't believe you left me in the rain 
Come back to me, I need you in my life 
These tears of mine have washed away my smile 
I need you by my side,baby hold me tonight 

[Bridge] 
You promised me forever 
Forever you and me 
Say that you love me 
Say you'll never leave 

[Chorus] 
Tell me it's not over now 
I can't believe it's true 
Tell me it's not over now 
I'm still in love with you 
Tell me it's not over now 
Please don't say goodbye 
Tell me it's not over now 
'Cause without you I'd just die 

[Verse 2] 
Just one kiss, one touch is all I need 
hold me in your arms and say that you'll be mine 
It hurts so bad, oh it hurts so sad 
Don't leave me alone, don't say goodbye tonight 

[Bridge] 
Oh promise me forever 
Forever you and me 
Say that you love me 
Say you'll never leave oh... 

[Chorus] 
Tell me it's not over now 
 (say you love me oh) 
I can't believe it's true 
Tell me it's not over now 
 (tell me it's not over) 
I'm still in love with you 

[Hook] 
Please, won't you tell me 
Why you've changed your mind 
Just open up your heart tonight 
I'm gonna love you 
For the rest of my life 
Well the way that I'm feeling 
It will not be changing 
'Cause my heart is bleeding 
And I can't stop needing you now... 

[Chorus] 
Tell me it's not over now 
 (Oh tell me) 
I can't believe it's true 
Tell me it's not over now 
 (Tell me it's not over) 
I'm still in love with you 
 (In love) 
Tell me it's not over now 
 (Baby how could you leave me standing in the rain) 
Please don't say goodbye 
 (Come back to me, come back to me) 
Tell me it's not over now 
 (Come back to me, oh tell me) 
'Cause without you I'd just die 

Tell me baby, tell me baby 
It's not over, please don't say goodbye 
without you I'd just die 

Tell me baby, tell me baby...
