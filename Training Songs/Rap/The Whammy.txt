Look deep into my iris 
Mysteries unfold beyond scrolls of papyrus 
Your mind flips - the hieroglyphs are explicit 
Ancient arts from other parts of existence 
Scribes from the tribes of Hebrews and Nubians 
Passed through to the true blue like cerulean 
The source of my voice be the key to truly enhance 
Now you dance to the trance that you be in 
Excellent like dumpling - its fabulous 
Heaven sent like the coming - miraculous 
Ain't it somethin' how we do with gumption 
It's a safe assumption that we get the party bumpin' 
Small wonder that you're under my influence 
It's over, I'm takin' over in increments 
As I tighten in my vice like Miami 
The super bad osu got you movin' to the power of the whammy 
Get down, get down, listen to the sound 
>From your earlobe to your frontal lobe the whammy's got ya bound 
The power of suggestion's got you on your knees genuflecting 
Dimensions arise before your eyes 
Disguised, your new initials - DUI 
You try to flex your force, influenced under mine 
We spread to your head like infection 
The ghost in my throat, tones and inflections make connections 
Between resistant synapses 
Your willpower snapses, we transmit like faxes 
We vanquish the masses like Allies to Axis 
You dances - you dances 
You're tricked by the tricks you designed 
The toungue is quicker than the mind 
We'll bewitch you with rituals 
We bring emerging energies, forming mass from individuals 
With residuals the kid quits, but can he? 
I'll hit him with the whammy 
It's the whammy y'all
