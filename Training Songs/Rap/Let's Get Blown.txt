[Chorus]
Can I get my thrills
You know you want some mo girl, So come on
Can I get my thrills
You know you want some mo girl, So come on
Let's get blown

Lookin' at the ladies
All of them fly
I don't know which one I want dog
I can't make up my mind girl
So won't you make it easy on me
Take this drink and hit this weed
Two step wit me
Let's slip to the dance floor
On an on, on, an on we go
I'll dip you if you want me to
You see I want to get a little funk? wit you
Biggity bunk wit you
A nigga want to hump you
And just comfort you
And then I'll pop the top
And lay you on a cot
And get you nice and hot
Yeah yeah it's all to the real
We can do it like I
Come on girl let's chill 

[Chorus]

Now you can fly the friendly skys 
Wit the S-N- double O-P D-O- double G-Y
Now don't ask why
Just keep lookin' good in the hood
Damn girl you so fly
We could do what you want to
You say you drink Alize
Or was it Malibu
It don't really matter though
You remind me of the time when I had a ho
She kept telling me 
Doggy dog I gotta go
So I let her get in the wind
And cope mack a friend
2+2 it equals fo'
This is some shit that could last for forever mo'
I'm tryin' to put my bid in
Na I'm just kiddin'
Come on ma wit in
And don't ask where we goin'
Pimpn' and hoe-in' drink flowin' and weed blowin'
You know it come on

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Come here baby let me holla at you real quick
I've been lookin' at you 
From the corners of my eyes
Checking at your hips, lips, tips, and your thighs
I've been wanting to do you
For a mighty long time
You make a pimp want to sing ah ah ah

From the head to the hills
Your dreams are fulfilled
We could do it how you want 
Cause I'm oh so real
Telling you no
I won't squeal
You wit the big boss dogg
So seal the deal
For real got the baby face
And dog got the whipper pill
So name the place
This love I bring to you 
On the real baby girl
Won't you give me your fav and sing for snoop

[Chorus]

(Pharrell)
You know you want it
(If I got it I'ma' give it to you)
So come and get it
(If I got it I'ma' give it to you)
If I got it
(If I got it I'ma' give it to you)
Then you can get it, you know
Hey

Can I get my thrills
Can I get my thrills
