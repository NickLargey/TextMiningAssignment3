Me and my homies, loc
You know we kick it like every day
Me and my homies
Kick it like every day

When I'm alone in my room
And I don't have no one to talk to
I can pick up my phone
And call some folks who know what I go through
After I smoke a joint, come on
To keep my temper low
I parlay with my friends
There's really nowhere else to go, mm

Me and my homies, loc
You know we kick it like every day
Me and my homies
Kick it like every day

I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried than see us parted
Keep 'em close to my heart
'Cause we the ones that got this shit started
You recollect, we used to bust on snitches
Nobody come before my niggas, f*ck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self sufficient
So we suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police takin' our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my motherfuckin' homeboys down to die
For each other 'cause we closer than brothers, it's like we kin
We known for gettin' the party poppin' when my squad walks in
Throw up your hands, baby, buy me a drink, stop actin' phony
Don't forget to bring somethin' for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest
Duckin' bullets, snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world know me
But I ain't shit without my fuckin' homies
Me and my fuckin' homies

Me and my homies, loc
You know we kick it like every day
Me and my homies
Kick it like every day

(Me and my homies)
Constantly we mash
(Me and my homies)
Gotta make that cash
(Me and my homies)
There's no need to ask
(Me and my homies)
We are still the best
