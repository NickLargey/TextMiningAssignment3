Maybe we can talk it over
And save our hopes and dreams
Though the waves seem endless
Somehow we'll cross this angry sea
With love all things are possible
If we just believe

I need to know, yes it's OK
Can I hurdle this storm, yes but only together
With love in our hearts, the only way
Somehow,things will work out just you wait and see
Oh it will, believe it will

See real life confrontations
Caused our vows to break
But I learned the word forgiveness
Can time chase the pain away
True love made our hearts inseparable
If we just believe

I need to know, yes it's okay
Can I hurdle this storm, yes but only together
With god in our hearts, the only way
Somehow,things will work out just you
Wait and see

But right now it hurts so bad
And feels so bad
But tomorrow waits with laughter
If we endure the tears then joy comes after

I need to know, you need to know,
It's gonna be okay
Can I hurdle this storm, only together
With love in our hearts, the only way
And somehow, somehow I can feel love again
Somehow, things have worked out
'cause you stayed with me
I'm glad to know it's okay, it's okay
