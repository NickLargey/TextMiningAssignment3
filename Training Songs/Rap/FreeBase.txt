What is it?
Freebase
What's free about it? I thought about it, I said, listen
Should I talk about freebase and what if, or somethin' people say
Well no, everybody goes and then people will start goin'
No, let me, I gotta talk about what happened to me

See where we're from, it's all or nothing
But we take penitentiary chances like it's nothing
We came from nothing but nothing
Freebase from top of the oven
Get money my type of discussion
Yaw can do this shit for free a nigga like me gone be hustlin'
Freebase
