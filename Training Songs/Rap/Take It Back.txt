Yo Prev (what's up)
I'm thinking man, we don't always have to talk about
dungeons and dragons all the time, you know?
We don't have to make things so complicated (no doubt)
Let's take this back and show them how we can do this too (word)

Deep, I'm using canyons you can't get by the cannon (no way)
Season veterans, the hawk has landed
Toxic tandem, the docotorum of mad men
The planet of apes is now a main attraction
How does it happen? If I knew I'd tell ya
They'd probably try to say I worshiped devils in the cellar
It's just a slight of hand, like Penn and Teller
The mighty dollar, is taller than the scholar
Ask your neighbourhood martyr about the fire starter
People are driven to buildings when I let it out my system
Built my the hands of man and women
Thinking of quitting? Now's the time
There's more job opportunites at the back of the line
Applications, and registrations
Feels more like an investigation
Now how's that for a demonstration

Four, three, two, one
Go back to the essence
What were gonna do right here, take it back to the basics
Swollen Members, word
What were gonna do right here, is go back
Go back to the essence
What were gonna do right here, take it back to the basics
Swollen Members

Eh yo, we all get older, rhymes get bolder
Series of events makes the heart grow colder
Started off with two, now we got mad soldiers
Battle Axe warriors, bitch, I thought I told ya
Heinekens on stage, never rock shows sober
Spit venom over cobra, hatched in October
Libra scorpion is taking over
Still the silver server, I ain't trippin on nova
Introducin' Madchild, ladies and gentleman
Lets give a big round of applause for adrenalin
You ain't right, I'ma fucking phantom at night
That wears a mask by day, with a temper tantrum
Don't light my fuse, 'cause if this dynamite blows up in your face
There won't be no one left to clean up the place
Swollen Members adds up to one thing, and you can quote this
Temporary relief for the hopeless

What were gonna do right here, is go back
Go back to the essence
What were gonna do right here, take it back to the basics

What were gonna do right here, is go back
Go back to the essence
What were gonna do right here, take it back to the basics

Prisons that are made by the minds of lethals
Truly blind, it confines all people
Make you want to call out for water and bread
My name is Prev One I put the thought in your head

Manic depressant, I panic from too much stressin'
Of course I'm second guessin' cause life is just a question
Keep your suggestions, we ain't hearin' you guys
My name is Madchild I put the fear in your eyes

Grey skies, disguise my chariot
I've arrived to mesmerize the arrogant
Clear the area, and change the false
Pathetic speakers that lead the lost

We feed the need to work and conquer at all costs
Underground so there ain't nothing to fall off
Never spoke soft, so what if we get broke
We ain't the type of people that's meant to make a joke of

What were gonna do right here, take it back to the basics
What were gonna do right here, is go back
Go back to the essence

What were gonna do right here, take it back to the basics
What were gonna do right here, is go back
Go back to the essence
