Hey, pretty boy you know how the world turns, 
One wrong move and you'll get burnt
I can see you need motivation
Let me give it to you

Yeah, come taste the fruits of my hustle, 
Fly with me, private jet fuel
Consider this your invitation
You don't even know

You, you can change your life right now
You, turn it all around right now
You, I ain't tryin' to hold you down
You know, you know, you know, you know

Think I'm really looking for a trophy boy
Someone to ride on the passenger side
Eh, eh! 
Think I'm really looking for a trophy boy
Which one of you's with me?
You can have this and you can have that
And if you man up then you get a call back
Think I'm really looking, really looking for a trophy boy
Trophy boy

I'm looking for my trophy, for my trophy
You could be my trophy boy
I'm looking for my trophy, for my trophy
You could be my trophy boy

Yeah, let's go from London to Cairo
Show you the places that I know
Walk the red carpet in Moscow
With you on my arm

Upgrade you from good to amazing
Don't listen cause they're only hating
Sky is the limit, no faking
You don't even know

You, you can change your life right now
You, turn it all around right now
You, I ain't tryin' to hold you down
You know, you know, you know, you know

Think I'm really looking for a trophy boy
Someone to ride on the passenger side
Eh, eh!

Be my trophy, be my, be my trophy
Girls point him out if he could be your trophy
Be your trophy boy

Be my trophy, be my, be my trophy
Girls point him out if he could be your trophy
(Point him out, point him out)
Be a trophy boy
