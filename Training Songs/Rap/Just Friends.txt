From the day that I first met you
And you looked into my eyes
I could hardly believe
Love took me by surprise
And now that we are friends
I don`t want it to end
`cause I would rather lose your love
To be your friend
I guess I never told you
Exactly how I feel
`cause I believe if you knew
You`d probably just leave
Don`t know what i`d do
Without you
Be on my own again
Without you
Bridge:
Don`t understand it
If I could have planned it
How would it be
There`s no use pretending
Don`t want our love ending
No
The way I feel about you
I could never let you know
And all the feelings I have
I`m too afraid to let them show
So I close my eyes and count to ten
`cause I would rather lose your love
To be your friend
I`d rather lose your love to be your friend
