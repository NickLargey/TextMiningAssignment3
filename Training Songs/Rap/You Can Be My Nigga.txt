Girl, you betta call him you know
You ain't been home in three days

As I lay here and just smokin' on a blunt
The situation is gettin' blurrier and blurrier, oh

When you're living in the hood, you're up to no good
That's how the story goes, but

You could be my nigga and I could be your girl
You could be my nigga and I could be your girl
You could be my nigga and I could be your girl

'Cause I gotta thang for you, baby
And you can be my nigga anytime

So what I hang out with the homies all day
And just kick it, gettin' twisted
What you want me in the kitchen?
Look you can't be controlin' my life

But honey let's get it right, huh

Smokin' blunts on the regular
That's all that really counts
And sorry but, soap can't wash this mouth out

Deal with this drama

You could be my nigga and I could be your girl
You could be my nigga and I could be your girl
You could be my nigga and I could be your girl
