Nasty girl, nasty girl, nasty girl, nasty girl

[Chorus:]
Far as I know you a freak, (Who me?) 
A lil' nasty girl to shake her ass to the beat, to the beat, 
Clap clap skeet skeet, (skeet skeet) 
Cause all I really wanna do' but she don't come cheap.
Far as I no you a freak, 
A lil' nasty girl to shake her ass to the beat, to the beat, 
Clap clap Skeet skeet, (skeet skeet) 
Cause all I really wanna do' but she don't come cheap.
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon chicken head patty cake, lean wit it rock wit it
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon chicken head patty cake, lean wit it rock wit it

Hands up lil' momma was up, 
Know you see me pulling up in that truck, 
Rimmed up chin chilla timbed up. 
Hopped out matchin' fur brim what?
Yeah these freaks out tonight, 
Man herd they in route tonight, 
No body should be sitting on the couch tonight, 
Hey gray goose got me feeling so rite.

[Chorus]

Now I'm looking for that ass and them jeans, 
Shaped like a eight walk real mean, 
High class and always on the scene, 
Cats ask her why she always looking mean.
Behind closed doors its a different thing, 
She get it from her momma I ain't mad na mean, na mean
I can only show you these two things, clap clap, skeet skeet, now beat.

[Chorus]

Nasty (Who?) Nasty girl (Me?) 
I don't mean to sturr (Boy what chu' looking at?)
Me I'd be at my hotel suite and maybe we can take it thurr? (That's Right).
Nasty (Who?) Nasty girl (Me?) 
I don't mean to sturr (Boy what chu' looking at?)
Me I'd be at my hotel suite and maybe we can take it thurr? (That's Right).
