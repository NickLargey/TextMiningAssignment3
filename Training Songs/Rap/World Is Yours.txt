Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a lot of, it's a lot of hatin' goin' on
Lot of foolery
Lot of fugazin'
Lot of, lot of fakes

Get off your ass and hustle
Now that I flex with muscle (muscle)
Niggas they runnin' for cover
I'm fuckin' your bitch under covers
I'm the definition of a hustler
I was juggin' so hard, got busted (busted)
Them lil' model bitches ain't nothin'
I would hustle so hard, my wrist straight busted
Get off your ass and hustle
Now that I flex with muscle (flex)
Niggas they runnin' for cover
I'm fuckin' your bitch under covers

Them lil' model bitches ain't nothin'
I would hustle so hard, my wrist straight busted

Your bitch want some head on the couch
These Instagram facin' for the cloud
I was broke, bands and accounts
First thing, told my son how to count
These rappers, they real, they hoes
I know that you actin', you might get exposed
My pockets, they finna explode
Ride with the lean, pourin' more than a 4
I finally finished probation
The feds, they watchin', I stick with my Haitians 
My only friend is the Benjamins
I'm finally rich but got too many enemies
I need my percentage, you bitin'
In love with the flex, and keep talkin' 'bout diamonds (flex)
You f*ck niggas doubted me (doubtin' me)
I'm hurtin' they feelings, I pull out the Lamborghini
Ooh, my niggas shootin' a mmovie
No Biggie but I used to trap in a Coogi
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, dat way (dat way)
Yeah, bitch, I pull up that Wraith (flex)
She wanna f*ck with the campaign
150 bottles but I don't drink champagne
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, dat way (dat way)
Money way, bitch, that's the only way (flex)
