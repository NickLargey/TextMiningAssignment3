Why don't you and me take a trip and go back to my crib
I'd like to lay ya down, I'd really like to lay ya down

Here we are, alone in my car and I can feel your temperature rising
You want me, I want you too and I can see it in your eyes babe
You ready to hit the backseat of my jeep right now
If the mood ain't right, my jeep is tight, I gotta better place to lay 
ya down

Why don't you and me take a chance and get back to my crib 
I wanna lay ya down, I really wanna lay ya down
Why don't you and me take a chance and get back to my crib 
I wanna lay ya down, I really wanna lay ya down

I said baby, before we lay everything's gotta be just right
Cuz tonight is the night I've been waitin' for, you and me are about to 
take flight
I don't want no distraction's cuz once we get into it 
I wanna be alone, getting it on all night long

Why don't you and me take a chance and get back to my crib 
I wanna lay ya down, I really wanna lay ya down
Why don't you and me take a chance and get back to my crib 
I wanna lay ya down, I really wanna lay ya down

Baby, come this way no longer will I make you wait
I can feel your pressure rising in and you're my love
I've been waiting for your love
I can hardly wait, I can hardly wait to lay you down

Why don't you wait, kid, let the freak show begin, let the freak show 
begin
Let the freak show begin
What chu waitin for, let the freak show begin, let the freak show begin, 
let the freak show begin
What chu waitin for, let the freak show begin, let the freak show begin, 
let the freak show begin
What chu waitin for, let the freak show begin, let the freak show begin, 
let the freak show begin
Ya heard me?

Her destination 
It's my second destination after the lights go out
I'll kindly get you up and take you to my playground and let cha see
My destination
It's my second destination after the lights go out
I'm gonna make you wish that every day you live that you could be in 
your life with me

Why don't you and me take a chance and get back to my crib 
I wanna lay ya down, I really wanna lay ya down
Why don't you and me take a chance and get back to my crib 
I wanna lay ya down, I really wanna lay ya down

Why don't you and me take a chance and get back to my crib 
I wanna lay ya down, I really wanna lay ya down
Why don't you and me take a chance and get back to my crib 
I wanna lay ya down, I really wanna lay ya down
