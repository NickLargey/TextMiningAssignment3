Billy built a robot in his parent's garage
Because he had a list of problems that he needed to solve
He said, "I'm sick of the Hills, Laguna Beach is fake and whack
Let's party like it's '96 and bring the horn section back"

Back before Gwen Stefani started rapping with Pharrell
Gas cost one fifteen and Goldfinger could sell
When reality TV wasn't scripted or contrived
The brass was phat and bumpin' and the beats were all played live

See, Billy was obsessed with third wave ska
The Mighty Bosstones, Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake
He'd seen them all
He longed for a time when even Bill Clinton played the sax
On the white house lawn and kids wore shades and checkered slacks

So Billy sits back in the class and labs
Put a notebook on his lap 'cause he plans a task
To make a giant robot, how's that?
And bring the real Orange County back

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's got a cannon on his shoulder and a laser in his hand
He's gonna win the day for Billy, make the city understand

The robot was completed and it opened up its eyes
Weighing seven hundred pounds and standing eight foot five
With his black coat, white shoes, black hat, set to attack
The robot headed to the hills to give those spoiled kids a smack

Christoph Leary got knocked flat as Billy bumped the Aquabats
He ripped out Mischa Barton's spine to crank Save Ferris and Sublime
He burnt down Heidi Montag's home and to blast the OC Supertones
His scream was smashing LC's head, ska is not dead

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's blasting bullets from his elbows, shooting missiles from his eyes
He's gonna win the day for Billy, take the OC by surprise

He'll make you do the Macarena as you rock your Tamagachi
With your Newton down in Woodstock playing Sega la-di-da-di
He brought the 90's back and then he freed Tibet
If you can't find his jam on Napster then the warehouse sells cassettes
(Old school)

Gigantic
(He was)
Gigantic
(This robot)

Gigantic
(So very)
Gigantic
(Ska robot)

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's got a cannon on his shoulder and a laser in his hand
He's gonna win the day for Billy, make the city understand

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's blasting bullets from his elbows, shooting missiles from his eyes
He's gonna win the day for Billy, take the whole world by surprise

Ska is not dead
