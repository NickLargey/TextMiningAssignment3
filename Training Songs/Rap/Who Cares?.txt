Basically I'm complicated
I have a hard time taking the easy way
I wouldn't call it schizophrenia
But I'll be in these two here today
If that's ok

An I could go on an on an on
But who cares?

It's deep how you can be so shallow
An I'm afraid coz I have no fear
An I didn't believe in magic
Until I watched you disappear
I wish you were here

An I could go on an on an on
But who cares?

You see, everybody is somebody
But nobody wants to be themselves
Ooh
And if I ever wanted to ever understand me
I'd have to talk to someone else
Coz every little bit helps

An I could go on an on an on
But who cares?

It feels like
The surreal life
But it's still nice
Wish I could live twice
An I still might
If these wounds heal right
I see a lil' light
Even though it's still night 

It feels like
The surreal life
But its still nice
Wish I live twice
An I still might
If these wounds heal right
I see a lil' light
Even though it's still night 

And I could go on an on an on
But who cares?

And I can go on an on an on
But who cares?
