I wish you were here
How I wish you were here

[CIXX PAC]
Too many deaths in the family, everybody around me
They droppin like flies and is makin' me crazy
Another year, another one passed
Mourn a brother seem you locked up and dead in that bodybag
But now he gone to a better place
But then we won't never be the same if you ain't standin' face to face
Everybody shed a tear when they go down
But loc as you reminiscin' you know they still around
So drop your head to the church song
And for that one that can you take it for them, gotta stay strong
Some callin' a miracle, some callin' a blessing
Call it what you want but the homie still left me
And now we're going to ?? of bud
Don't go them Gates in wait so that it mean they show you love
I reminisce so I shed a tear
Shouts out to Tiny Half Dead wishing you was here

[YOUNG MALCOLM]
I wish you were here (I wish you were here)
How I wish you were here (I wish you were here)

[BIG FREEZE]
Memories of many homies left dead in the streets
Of casualties, all my homies caught without they heat
Fatalities left my young partner dead in the casket
The first shout pop, drop my loc when they blasted
Then I'm right out to these days I still hearse
So when I reminisce on Tiny Half
I put it in work
And living on the memory of the dead trick
And I'll be scopin' like a shark shooter with the 30 ?? 6
Hennessy keeps my mind kinda glossy
I choke one of that indo smoke
Man, I miss my loc
In lovin' memory of Tiny Half
My homie Rock T
My young player partner Thai Tsu
Death for death I love y'all 'cause
Big Freeze and I'm out

[LIL' HAWK]
Back Down Mafia Lane
It's the YGB Little Hawk to representin' CMG
To the day that I die like my homies did
Like we promised too
Ever since we was kids
I'ma ride for this
I will die for this
I gotta tear on my eyes cause I even cry for this
Ride, slide through the West Side
Thinkin' to myself will I live or will I die?
Cause this gangbangin' drama have to be taken for no joke and
I'm hopin' that you hear me Blood you hear-hear to memory
It's the bhico, chico, a Inglewood's brazy
You can't fade this and bless this while I made this
