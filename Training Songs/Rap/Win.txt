I told them I was sick with the flow
One day you going to have me on repeat
I am not stopping till I'm sick with the dough
I Caught a flu blow out benjis when I sneeze
Shorty I'm a don act like you know
Ask your ho bet you money that she know me
Took over the city now I'm coming for the globe
They feel it more when you killing them slowly
It's all in your eyes, i can tell from your approach
You've been plotting on a scheme trying to harm me
And I hope to God you thought I came  alone
I brought the squad and we looking like an army
Surely
I Overcame the odds
I bet it all on greatness
I Made it through all that fake shit
I overcame y’all that hatred
I never worried about placement
Cause of all the talent I was blessed with
Been working hard just to make it
Success so close I can taste it
Bitches all on my page
Finessed off what I made
Niggaz isn’t up on my range
 My pockets swollen off my gains
 I'm only here to get paid
I only came  for one thing
Squeeze racks all in my jeans
Me and my team came for that ring

Something about winning
that I'm addicted to
I’m working every night for that condo with the view
All I ever wanted is in my point of view
I came up from the bottom and if you want to know the truth
Man I came up off ambition
I'm, addicted winning
Came up off ambition
I'm, addicted to winning
Came up off ambition
I'm, addicted to winning
Came up off ambition
Made a come up off ambition
Said I came up off ambition
I'm, addicted to winning
Came up off ambition
I'm, addicted to winning
Came up off ambition
I'm, addicted to winning
Came up off ambition
Made a come up off ambition

They don't want me up in my zone
Zone
23 when I step to the phone
Phone
Sprint solo alone when I roam
Roam
Any hood I feel like I'm home
Only the real feel the level I'm on
Sip vodka mixed with the soda
Throw my own shows f*ck a promoter
Niggaz priorities all out of order
Be a sheep f*ck around and get slaughtered. I’m a monster
Yea yeah
Freddy Krueger, spit like a rugar
Not with that drama
No no
But for what I love I’m turn to a shooter
Always known I was blessed
I made it through moments of stress
Off of nights I invest
I’m close to collecting a check
I paid all my debts
Come correct better come with respect
I'm the plug, who plug your connect
Was told to keep pressing my foot on their neck
And apply pressure, never let up
Hit niggaz up where it hurts
Phatten my pockets, my hustle can't knock it, the reason I walk with a smirk
I put in my work, I gave it my worth
Succeeding is all I deserve
I’m Hooked to the perks, been winning since birth, won’t stop till I'm deep in the dirt
