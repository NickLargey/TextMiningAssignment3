Mmm, yeah
Girl I've lied, but please forgive me
It's been a few months now since I did it
I don't wanna go on reliving this
Put it in the past, I wanna make this love last

Listen, don't keep on pushin' me
Don't you do, I just might fall
Over the edge, baby, oh, oh yeah, yeah

Girl, I'm tryin' and I don't wanna waste your time
No longer do I have a one-track mind
I know I broke your trust, baby
But I love you too much, baby, mmm

Listen, don't keep on pushin' me
If you do, I just might fall
Over the edge baby, mmm
Listen baby right now this is a bridge

Sometimes, your anger's hard for me to bear
I just want, baby, take my hands and
Run my fingers through your hair

Listen, don't keep on pushin' me
If you do, I just might fall
Over the edge, baby, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
(Will you please?)

Listen, hush, baby, don't say a word
A nigga like me had to be first
I told you before, I can't take no more
Don't push me, push me no more

'Cause I'm warnin' you
I'm fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'
Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin' out of love
Fallin' out of love, baby
Wanna tell you one more time, listen

Sometimes, your anger's hard for me to bear
I just want, baby, take my hands and
Run my fingers through your hair

Listen, don't keep on pushin' me
If you do I just might fall
Over the edge, baby
Said I just might do it

Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'
Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin' out of love, mmm, yeah

I said I'm fallin'
Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'
Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin' out of love
Mmm, baby, don't push me, yeah

Don't keep on pushin' me
If you do I just might fall
Over the edge, baby
Said I just might do it, yeah

Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'
Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin' out of love
