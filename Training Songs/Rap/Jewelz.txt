Uhh, Uhh, yea, yea, ha
Come on, Come on, Come on
Ha 
What, yea
Diggin In The Crates ya'
Come on, Come on, Come on
Uhh, yea
Lord Finesse ya'
Check it, yea
Uhh, check it out
Check it out

Yo, my movement motion
Smooth or rough as the ocean
Sometimes it slip away and I lose devotion
My judgement get cloudy
Then I want to get rowdy
Like Arabia
Terrorize like Saudi Arabia
My avons reflects my mood swing
Switch colors like a mood ring
Wifey telling me good things
So I won't strain
Got grey hairs, and only been here 25 years
Shed tears for niggaz I knew for life, now lifeless
When you died to us, was like the Iranian crisis
I took it hard like a flick slow mo' breathing
Prophetize dot of a book______summer night's dreaming
Semi-wet as I write this
Dragging the cancer sticks
Smoke thick, Hennessey shots to my wig
Half naked while I jot this
Lounging in my boxers
Dreaming Tahiti, even settle for the Bahamas
I get a boner
When am asleep dreaming that I'm louging on a yaucht
(Chillin in the sun), bom bout the leave the docks
Reality I wake up to
Feels like I woked up to a cloud filled room with angel dust
It's just the...

(Chorus)
Stress, frust, make me want to bust
Make me want to cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course

I'm searching for the light like Noah
The flame combust
Upon the bush forseeing my future like the Nova
Pushing for the brighter side of living a life
A better time pouring rhymes like wine
Till my cup run it over
Temptation on my shoulder
I'm growing colder then a polar bear
Thinking about a bank hold up
I fall upon my lap, and rest my head upon my knee caps
Is it a crime that I be dreaming about the G's black?
Freeze for a minute, gotta take control of my life
Gotta hold it like a knife
Must have more then a slice you know
Frustration, mental masturbation, (confusion)
Life is love living till I'm right be in a illusion
Seclusion, seeing me is rare
I rather attain stacks mack the islands on a plane ready for lift off
And spend grands, sipping exotic juice
Laying in the shade and shores
At a fly resort, on my cell contact the D.I.T.C. cohorts
Talking to the God Finesse
We tight like indians with a mohawk
And so on,
Conversation going on do the math
Dreaming I leave the___ Champagne bubble bath
Reality I wake up to
Feels like I woked up to a cloud filled room with angel dust
It's just the...

(Chorus 2X)
Stress, frust, make me want to bust
Make me want to cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course

(Your working hard for the dough)
But time seem to go slow
Busting your ass to go from a amateur to a pro
Low budget feeling inside no more can you score
Bad and good fight inside just like a war
(Slavery later foundation for my nation centuries before 
 Final Call be the New World Order) 
2 K's on it's way, no time for play
So I prey to God got me on a path of righteuos ways
Even though i get stressed, and frustrated
The best time for me to bless a rhyme is to put the pen through a test
(Yeah I want the riches
 The misses on my side on a pool, with the night
 When blitzed, and magic like a grand wizard)
Official O.C. a two syllable sound
Three six incomplete like the earth was round
And on that note keep hope alive
Striving to rise
From the inner soul
Seeing through the eyes of a crow you know
Slow pacing walk forth is only right
separating the cause
From another man "Far From Yours"
(Going for mine still coming off a two year hiatus)
And in that time nigga's bit my shit like alligators
It's alright though this rap shit is stress for us
It makes you feel like your in a hallway robust with angel dust
Reality i wake up to
My old dad once told me how you live your life is all on you son

(Chorus 2X)
Stress, frust, make me want to bust
Make me want to cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course
