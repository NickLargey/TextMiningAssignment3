Pay for what, girl you better pay for this dick
She the type to fall for two Zans in an outfit
I'm with the Zans crew, so it's hunneds on the floor
My hoes is off in the mo, I be balling hoe

Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, ok
Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, ok
Okay, uh, flex, these hoes, we done run through them
Zans we the the truth them, lames better salute them
These hoes, we done run through them
Zans we the the truth them, lames better salute them

I don't like your kid, you a boogie hoe
All in my face like a groupie hoe
Can't do one girl need a group of hoe
She a fool when she on that pole
Break it down, drop it low
Clap that, do it slow
Ran out of ones I'ma order some mo
Shawty got good friends on her honor roll
And â€¦ with moves like that no, girl you a pro
Hundred bands in my pocket, just to let you know
I'm too turnt, everything's a go
What it's gonna be, what it's gonna cost
Everything's on me, my god believe
We're bricksquad monopoly

Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, ok
Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, ok
Okay, uh, flex, these hoes, we done run through them
Zans we the the truth them, lames better salute them
These hoes, we done run through them
Zans we the the truth them, lames better salute them

I stay flexin iced out with a bank roll
Drunk as f*ck everything's slow mo
Black girls, white girls at my show
Even got latin girls in the front row
Throwin' Throwin' Throwing dough
Throwing dough, Throwin' dough
Throwin'g dough, Throwin' dough
Bitch I said Throwing stacks
Flocka, her hair long and her ass fat
She screaming broke niggas that way
Where the ballers at, f*ck her all night
And never call her back
Homerun the pussy every time I swing my bat
Squad, and if it's good I'ma double-back
Desperately I need some Zans, where my da-da at
Squad, if it's good, I'ma double-back
Flocka, desperate needs for them Zans, where my Da-Da at

Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, ok
Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, ok
Okay, uh, flex, these hoes, we done run through them
Zans we the the truth them, lames better salute them
These hoes, we done run through them
Zans we the the truth them, lames better salute them.
