Friends come a dime a dozen (ooh)
And I know that I'll never find a friend like you (oh, yeah)
And that's why I wanna sing this song, wherever you are
Wherever (I will never lie again, Ooh)
I just want to let you know
That I'll never lie to you again 
(I will never lie again) I promise

I will never lie again (ooh)
'Cause you'll always be my friend (you will always be)
I will never lie again (I will never lie again)
'Cause a friend like you will last forever

Sittin' in my window, I'm thinkin' of you
And all the fun things we used to do
I feel the pain, please come back to me
'Cause a friend like you will only come once in a lifetime, I

I will never lie again (I will never lie again)
'Cause you'll always be my friend (you will always be my friend)
I will never lie again ( I will never, I will never lie)
'Cause a friend like you will last forever (last forever)

On the phone when you were here
Laughin' and jokin', cryin' and sulkin'
In my dreams, you're still with me
'Cause a friend like you only comes once in a lifetime

I will never lie again (I will never lie)
'Cause you'll always be my friend (you will always be my friend)
I will never lie again ( I will never, never lie)
'Cause a friend like you will last forever (last forever)

When I think of you, I think of someone special (ooh)
And how it used to be, yeah (ooh)
I know you'll always be my friend
I'm so sad it had to end, oh yeah, baby (so sad, so sad)

I will never lie again (lie, don't wanna lie to you)
'Cause you'll always be my friend (come back to me)
(Come back, I love you)
I will never lie again (I don't wanna lie)
'Cause a friend like you will last forever (a friend like you will last forever)

I will never lie again (la, la)
'Cause you'll always be my friend (you'll always be my friend, ohh)
I will never lie again (Idon't' wanna lie to you, girl)
'Cause a friend like you will last forever (a friend like you)

I will never lie again (la, la)
