If you're single to mingle 
I'd love if we could do the town 
There's a love that could be found 

If you're single to mingle 
I'd love if we could do the town 
There's a love that could be found 

Verse:

I spotted that smile across your face 
From across the room 
My memory can't erase 

My heart exceeded its normal pace 
As oxygen takes a violent haste from my face 

Bridge:

Time and time again 
It's agreed that we are friends 
Then I awake 
Awake from my daydreams 

Sleeping all the time 
There was something on my mind 
Listen to my heart beats begin 

Chorus:

If you're single to mingle 
I'd love if we could do the town 
There's a love that could be found 

If your single to mingle 
I'd love if we could do the town 
There's a love that could be found 

Verse: 

When I lay me down to sleep 
I close my eyes and all I see is you 
Happy thoughts of us in a deep romance 
You and dancing close with our eyes in a trance 

Bridge
