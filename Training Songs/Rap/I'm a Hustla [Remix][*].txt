To get paid you got saved dont be spending the change, 
In 5th grade i was hustling my genesis games, 
I was dumb young, selling chewing gum to my classmates, 
On the cash chase, moving at a fast pace, 
Never been a dummy, never did what the dummys do, 
So I had to mill the bird before I turn twenty two, 
More money more problems is true, 
Cuz the more money I make the more problems for you,
Yeah I use dude voice, props to the boy sean, 
He made it a hot line, I made it a hot song, 
So stop drawn man you gotta respect it, 
I'm the best swizz got it perfected, 
Dont mess with C-A double S-I-D-Y, 
Cuz I became the best when B-I-G died, 
The kid do it big like P-U-N, 
Cuz I'm nice like P-A-C with the P-E-N
