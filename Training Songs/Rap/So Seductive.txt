Aw no do you know what this is
One shot one kill what's the deal G-Unit!Here we go now!}

Aw nigga do you know who you with
It's Tony Yayo up in this bitch
Got them drum luggers with them hollow tips
Hottest hit of the year yeah this is it

50 Cent back on that gangsta shit
On my way out to flip them bricks
In that big body Benz you know its oh 6
Got your bitch on my dick I stack them chips
And a flash as a f*** my jewels so sick
From a block away you can see them kid
Don't front motherfucer you know my style
I don't go nowhere without my 40 cal
On the low shorty gotta thing for the kid
And you know I'm finna take her back to the crib
Here we go I'm a show her how a playa' live
At the door I tell her to take her clothes off, shit

[Chorus]
Shorty so seductive dancin' on me
It's the way that she move that makin' me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'm a turn over and tell her let's do it again
Shorty so seductive dancin' on me
The way that she move is makin' me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'm a turn over and tell her lets do it again

I put the G in G-unit baby I got game
Head to go good to go and I don't know your name
Is it the wheels on the hot car
Meals on the shock bar
Or you just want a quickie with a rap star
Ladies tell the truth you know I'm cute
But what really turns you on is the rims on my Coupe
Before you jump in my whip and you get dropped off
You goin' to the telly and you gettin' popped off
I can't stop thinkin' of the things you do
When your freakin' me and I'm freakin' you
I said the ice on my neck make the shorty's stare
Baby let me fly you in my lair
Stop slow down baby if you hear this in the club shake and go down baby
Its past my curfew but parole don't know
Tear up the club don't call my p.o.

[Chorus]

My ways be spinnin' I charm the amazing way
You know them black and white and asian women
Let's cut the small talk you know why I approach you
I can't stand when a dime act anti-social
Gucci,lip gloss,Louis Baton,and the boots from Batego Vanetto cost a arm
Yayo's a don my car European
You got mirrors in your pants 'cause I can see me in them
Listen I piss out Cris inhale haze
I'm in the Marriott gettin' laid all day
Tattoos and piercings and rings in your tongue
Shorty things like that will make my black dick cum
I need groupie love the Coupe on dubs
I'm in this club with a tre pound star
Don't blame it on David I'm all iced out
'cause 50 got me rich so the bar all priced out

[Chorus]
