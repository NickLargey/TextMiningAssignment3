Uh oh  whutcha want whutcha gon do nigga

I know y'all nigga ain't fuckin wit me  you lookin for me 

If you gonna be down with me 
You gotta be down for year round 
You see what I'm doin but don't like it even though everybody and their moms 
is bout it bout it 
Up in concerts cryin to the croud you used to be down but now you doubt it 
You fuckin playa hatin cowards! 
We rule over here 
We buildin the No Limit mountain 
2 million records and countin 
So how the f*ck is you soundin 
Nothin but lessons 
2 multimillionaires rhymin 
Soundscan be astounded 
We sellin, ya'll drownin 
Black owned and climbin 
CDs across the counter 
Told y'all I was gonna do it 
But you didn't want to see 
Wasn't worried about a nigga 
Till I was leavin 
Come here, let me show you the difference between a man and a ho 
It's the man right chea, oh you lookin for me

Chastising proovalizing stop em from dissin 
If I'm in it I own it 
Put the keys in ignition 
I hope your seatbelts get fastened 
I'm known for massive harassing 
Havin to snatch your ass off the mic 
Grab ya and slap ya 
Psh come here psh come here 
I know you ain't gonna do it no more 
You sayin my name you must be lookin for me 
Here I Go! 
Whutchu whutchu want do

We can do it whenever however you want to 
Entrepreneur soldier guns galore 
Watch em burn bitch burn like a flame thrower 
Rock it all sharp as a bull's horn 
Gaul strong as a python 
Whores they get they fight on 
Soon as I cut my mic on 
Niggas getting humped or stumped 
Fumbling mcs I crumble 
Come through like the reaper 
So daily you don't want to rumble 
That's right don't panic 
Mystikal the mechanic 
Sank you like a torpedo gigantic 
As the titanic 
Rhymes I'm hummin keep hummin 
I'ma keep comin 
Grabbin ya woman 
But the drummer still drummin 
Hard hitter bullshitter head splitter when brittle 
Assassinate a rookie killa 
Like Adolph Hitler 
A mandingo WARRIOR 
Guns Galore 
Opponents get crushed 
I'm too cruel to be moved 
Too fuckin much to be touched 
Got em danglin and janglin 
To that shit when they hear this 
Fight me like a fight bitch I'm tragy like a terrorist 
You think you don't like it but I have yet to begin 
You'd rather be my enemy cause I'ma deadly friend 
So stay the f*ck from around me do I make myself clear 
Unless you lookin for the man 
Cause the man right chea
