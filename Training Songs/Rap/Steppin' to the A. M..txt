At the sound of the tone, the time will be twelve A.M.

Ready in the intro, cue up the Serch-lite
Point us to the center stage (I'll grab the first mic)
Projectin' the voice with this mic that I'm cuffin'
You ain't my nucka, sucker I'm snuffin'
The word of the third stands true, so no panickin'
(Man verse man) you freeze up like a mannequin
Petrol, you let go, the wax for the new jacks
To dwell upon you're steppin' on the trigger as the tune smacks
(Square in the butt) Pete gave me the cue
So I'ma put up or shut up until my jam is through
But for now I want to freak em, so I'll embark
To spark your mission posse, til way past dark
(Don't park there's no standin') or I'll play the five-oh
You don't stop movin' until the Serch says so
To keep the tribe open, shootin' out to play em
Three the hard way'll keep you steppin' to the A.M.

What's the time?
It's about that time
What's the time?
Time to get stupid! (At the sound of the tone)
What's the time? (The time will be one A.M.)
It's about that time
What time is it?
Shootin' for the A.M.

My mind has a question, I respond
To a silver domed microphone (one step beyond)
Straight to eighty-eight to the curves of the nineties
I'm universal, I set a line free
Behind me, the three the hard way, the jackpot
(Awaitin' Satan's, tryin' to take cheap shots)
We groove crowds, the three stand proud
The brothers round the way sit down and say
(How'd you do this?) Ludicrous rhythm of rhyme
Anticipate like a bottle of Heinz ketchup
(No catch up!) 'Cause you fell behind
I'm steppin' to the A.M., dickin' down swine
Pete Nice skims over lyrics, I pick em
Strong and long, you're wrong, I stick em
(He's the law with the sword) with my cable swingin'
(Like the pit or the pendulum) Pete Nice bringin'
the sunrise with no lies, legitimate (and you despise)
Envy this emcees magnitude (so realize)
The MC emceed (the DJ deejayed 'em)
Until the next time I keep you steppin' to the A.M.

Two for the time
Two for the time

What's the time?
It's about that time
What's the time?
Time to get stupid! (At the sound of the tone)
What's the time? (The time will be one A.M.)
It's about that time
What time is it?
Shootin' for the A.M.

No weight on the felt plate, deep bass below rise
Needle torture groove, move the record til the whack stride
(Schoolin' the swine on the strength of my vocab)
Bet you wonder you're a goner
(You're thinkin' that you had)
Lyrics to the A.M. but the house needs a swinger
You st-st-st-st-stutter, but I'm a stinger
(My rhymes so potent, I wrote em and it's evident)
You're just a stunt, seekin' a settlement
The lyrical line (The article original)
Afflict like a convict, I ain't no criminal
Schemin' on a cable or slobbin' the knob
You played me like a foul ball
(How you livin' Hobbes?)
Now groove into the A.M., the master spoon feedin'
out a jumper, you're bumpin' a freak while I'm G'n
Peter let the record spin (Serch'll get a second wind)
Motivate the crowd, til it's steppin' to the A.M.

What's the time?
It's about that time
What's the time?
Time to get stupid! (At the sound of the tone)
What's the time? (The time will be one A.M.)
It's about that time
What time is it?
For, for the A.M.

I slide swiftly, keep a brother steppin
(Loungin', strength in my throat)
Sweatin' as you get hit with the rhythm
My lines sustain like a crane, so uplift them
(Slow and smooth) Flowin' like fluid
The mass did worship the lyrics the three did
(Amid all crisis) Drop it like a guillotine
(You're moist) fearing the voice of the rhyme fiend
Scene is zipped, Pete Nice is your worst dream
Fulfilled your illed I thrilled (I heard a loud scream)
My mind is cued, so I run down a menu
That downgrades the weak as my lyrics tend to
(The needs of a shaker, sweatin' to the point of exhaust)
So listen to the mission horse
Blinded by the science, my mind starts flexin'
Sexin' down females to the A.M., perplexin'
A complex reflex (you wonder if we slumber)
The three don't sleep (ayo Pete Nice take 'em under!)
Steppin' to the A.M., I'm steppin' to the mic
To snatch up and smash up the club until daylight!

Two for the time
Two for the time

What's the time?
It's about that time
What's the time?
Time to get stupid! (At the sound of the tone)
What's the time? (The time will be one A.M.)
It's about that time
What time is it?
For, for the A.M.

What's the time?
It's about that time
What's the time?
Time to get stupid! (At the sound of the tone)
