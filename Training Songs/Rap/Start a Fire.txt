Mama I'm in love with a hot girl
And they just don't get it
They just don't get it
Temperature's risin', her body yearnin', yeah we on that R. Kelly
And then she tell me

Let's start a fire
You'll be my lighter
Baby I'll be your gasoline (and they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire
Watch the entire
World as it opens up in flames (and they just don't get it)

Let's start a fire
Yeah, Mickey and Valerie
Let's start a fire (yeah, Bonnie and Clyde)
(Thelma and Lil Weezy alright) Let's start a fire
Let's start a fire, ire, yeah

I'm like goodness gracious, great wall of China
All we do is f*ck all day, all ma√±ana
It's a cold world, I stay warm inside her
Make her perspire, sweat, blood, and crying
Goodness gracious, great God almighty
She f*ck me like a king, Stephen, Martin, Rodney
We break all of monotony, baby we high commodity
And they just don't get it

Let's start a fire
You'll be my lighter
Baby I'll be your gasoline (and they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire
Watch the entire
World as it opens up in flames (and they just don't get it)

Let's start a fire (me and you)
Let's start a fire (and they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire
Let's start a fire, ire, yeah

Mama I'm in love with a hot girl
And they just don't get it
They just don't get it
Temperature's risin', her body yearnin', yeah we on that R. Kelly
Then then she tell me (Let's start a fire)

Like goodness gracious, great balls of fire
She ridin' me like a street car named Desire
Stop, drop, roll, and shake what her mama
Gave her, clap that ass like the choir
Oh, I run into my old thing
I say bitch you broke my heart, but that's just growin' pains
But trust me, she ain't nothin' but an old flame
And I threw water on that old flame, no more flames
I'm so glad I'm out the dope game
'Cause now I got more time to burn in that pussy like some propane
Now that pussy is my domain
And I know they just don't get it

Let's start a fire
You'll be my lighter
Baby I'll be your gasoline
Let's start a fire
Watch the entire
World as it opens up in flames (and they just don't get it)

Let's start a fire (f*ck 'em, f*ck it)
They just don't get it, see we already
We already lit it and now we on fire (let's start a fire)
We on fire, yeah, it's me and you
Let's start a fire
Just don't get it
We already, we already did it (let's start a fire, ire, yeah)
And now we on fire, we on fire, yeah
