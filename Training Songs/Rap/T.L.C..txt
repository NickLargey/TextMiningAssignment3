Ooh baby, ooh yeah, it's tender love again
Tender love…Tender love

Hey there, where are you going?
I won't let you pass me by without knowing
Right now I'm hypnotized, just a little mesmerized
It's you you're the reason why

I spend my time thinking of the things we can do
I want to share my loving
I spend my time thinking of the ways I will do

You know what T.L.C. coming from me
Everything's gonna be all right, why don't you spend the night?
T.L.C. coming from me
Everything's gonna be all right, why don't you spend the night?
If you please, ooh baby

Hey sugar, gotta have a little faith for you and me
I won't ever let you down and have the strength to believe
Baby I want you to know that I'll always love you so
It's you, baby, you're the reason why I love you

I spend my time thinking of the things we can do
(We can do.  Baby, we spend our time)
I want to share my loving
I spend my time thinking of the ways I will do

You know what T.L.C. coming from me
Everything's gonna be all right, why don't you spend the night?
T.L.C. coming from me
Everything's gonna be all right, why don't you spend the night?

Oh yeah, yes we have one thing love that we share
Baby, we got it.  Oh yes, baby, we got it.
Who cares what people gonna say?
We're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, oh yeah, baby!

Tender love…Tender love

T.L.C. coming from me
Everything's gonna be all right, why don't you spend the night?
T.L.C. coming from me
Everything's gonna be all right, why don't you spend the night?
T.L.C. coming from me
Everything's gonna be all right, why don't you spend the night?
T.L.C. coming from me
Everything's gonna be all right, why don't you spend the night?
