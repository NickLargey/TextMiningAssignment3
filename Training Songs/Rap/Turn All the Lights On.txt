Turn all the lights on!

Take off your shoes (shoes shoes)
Ain't nobody gon' see nothin'
Bring out the booze (booze booze)
Baby girl stop frontin'
I ain't got nothin' to (lose lose lose)
And I ain't gotta go to work no more
F*ck that place, f*ck my boss
I'm about to ball don't care what it cost

I'm going hard
I need some lights, it's way too dark
Oh yeah I'm going in
And now I'm with my friends
Let the party begin!
Turn all the lights on!
A-a-a-a-a-a-a a-ah

A-a-a-a-a-a-a a-ah

Oh yeah I'm going in
Okay okay I'm with my friends
Let the party begin
Turn all the lights on!

Give me that glass, little bit of ice
Pour that red in there
This must be her song
Dancing like ain't nobody else in here
Sexy as she wanna be and she
Dancing next so close to me
I said please excuse
You steppin' on expensive shoes
Shawty is a perfect ten
This angelic body made to sin
I love it when you get it in
Come over here and shake it for a gentleman
'Cause you want it

I'm going hard
I need some lights, it's way too dark
Oh yeah I'm going in
And now I'm with my friends
Let the party begin!
Turn all the lights on!
A-a-a-a-a-a-a a-ah
