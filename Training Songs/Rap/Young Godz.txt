Yo 
Older cats 
Yo 
Whassup Rae? What's going on Son? 
Whattup dude? 
Yeah  I ain't see y'all cats in a long time 
Check it  yo 
Y'all better be on that shit too 
Older cats max with young godz who got the guns 
KnowhatI'msayin son? 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Y'all the little y'all the youth coming up 
Or get stung by the killer bee stinga from the slums 
KnowhatI'msayin son? 
Yo son 
Of the young Shaolin Monks, chickenheads will get done 
You the first man, you go first son 

I'm Mobb Deep, in cherry Cherokees I forever be 
On some thug shit, runnin' wild through New York City 
Bustin' guns rockin' jew-els that shine like sun 
Stapleton is where I'm from 
And been down for years stayed on point like stairs (yeah, word up) 
Cause the jealous motherfuckers want to end my career 
I never feared, the ghetto is hell, but I learned ta 
Keep my mouth shut and pack a nickel-plated burner 
And squeeze, if I get front on my nine millimi 
Will have my enemies, behind trees 
Niggaz that think they live 'cause they puff a little lye 
Pack a bullshit, twenty-five, nah don't think they'll kill us 

[Chorus]
Older cats mack, roll with young godz that got the guns 
You right about that kid 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Now yo y'all just keep everything moving you know 
Or get stung by the killer bee stinga from the slums 
The beat is sounding like Star Trek 
Of the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads, with the tongue 
So yo, youknowhatI'msayin son? 

Yo, deep in the ocean of the Atlantic, here comes the killa falcon 
I meditate then swing with the force of mountains 
Brain cells is able to be bi-debatable 
When I think it's hazardous to your ozone layer 
A premeditated killer plan so kill the Mayor, my silencer 
Causes niggaz to hush, then I rush, like Manchus 
Who guard jewels and collect, Cash Rules with heavy jewels 
I live by name and cut veins 
Burning bodies into flames 
Between my anger, I lock down every chamber 
Hillside strangler, a nigga with a mask like Lone Ranger 
Rap poetic is injected into the brain athletic 
Build off of rhymin' calisthenics 
I'm determined, I raise a army like Hitler done Germans 
And become the Allied commander, my enemies is catching on camera 
They seek death, I begin to torture them (calm down kid take your time) 
By giving butterfly stitches, bear witness 
As I hang with Jehovah's Witnesses 

[Chorus]

Older cats max with young godz that got the guns 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Or get stung, by the killa bee stinga from the slums 
From the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads with the tongue 

Yo, yo, this is manslaughter, so what you want to do 
Last year, you ran for the border with your crew 
I flip, stacks, all the, time when I rhyme 
Libra is my sign, and can't stand swine 
When I dine, the automatic weapon 
Got niggaz steppin', in the opposite direction 
My jurisdiction, is off grounds to you clowns 
My proposition, meaning you go round for round 
Straight up and down, I broke the sound barrier 
Scarier, than a tight skirt wrapped around a transvestite 
The grammar, hype, nigga check your stacks 
Or you'll be rhyming with a broke back 
Niggaz talk about they rollin deep up in here 
The only way you roll is if you in a wheelchair 

[Chorus]

Older
Yo, y'all calm down man calm down calm down 
Yeah, and yo 
Now yo, youknowhatI'msayin? 
I want to tell y'all 
Y'all up under the restrictions of the Wu camp 
Aiyyo Rae, you got Killa Sin 
YouknowhatI'msayin? 
Madman, Shyheim the Rugged Child 
So just take your time and handle life as it comes 
Motherfuckin' Rubbabandz, the young godz comin' through 
Cause the real nigga gonna know what they gotta do 
Showin' and provin' youknowhatI'msayin? Shaolin forever 

Yo, may all the bullshit cease, increase the war f*ck the peace 
Make shit hot like rockin' tube socks at Jones Beach 
N the summer, number one gunner run for cover 
Keep 'em steppin' with more Lethal Weapons than Danny Gloves 
I cock back, action packed raps and gats 
Niggaz trade mats for prats people react, to RZA sharp tracks 
Another day nother body dropped you better keep your shottie cocked 
For actin' snotty Hobbes catch karate chops 
Cause Wu-Tang live, forever and a day 
You better pray for better ways to get away when my Beretta spray 
We never play with commercialism 
The hardcore rhythm give em more hell than an exorcism 

My terrordome be a clever poem let it be known 
I'm packin' chrome and rollin phatter than eleven bones 
My crew's sicker than that AIDS shit 
While others get played quick, cause we be making hits through the grave sift 
My right hand man, myself and the Clan 
Gun and mic stands reverses help me see my first a hundred grand 
And to my Physical one love power crazy real 
For all them carbon copy niggaz lurkin' in the rap deal 

[Chorus]
