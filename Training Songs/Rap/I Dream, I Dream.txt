I'm so excited with the thought of touching you
So please don't deny me
Make my wish a dream come true
Oooh 'cause every time I close my eyes
I feel a little magic
I get a little tingle in my heart
So I start gettin' butterflies
I love it when I have it
I never want this to end 'cause when

I dream, I dream
I dream of you
All day long and all day through
I dream, I dream oooh baby
I dream of you
All day long I dream of you

You're like a habit
Can't let it go stays on my mind
Girl I sho nuff got to have it
Keep me wanting all the time
In the middle of a lonely night
I kinda got addicted
I felt a good rush come over me, so I
Started dreamin' overtime

I didn't want to miss it
I didn't want to miss a dream 'cause when

Hook
Here's my heart
Take my hand
I'll be your girl
You'll be my man
So wake me up
With your love
Please don't stop
'cause I just can't get enough

'Cause every time I close my eyes
I fell a little magic
I get a little ting in my heart
So I start gettin' butterflies
I love it when I have it
I never want this to end 'cause when

Hook
In the middle of a lonely night
I dream about you baby holding me tight
I felt a rush comin' over me
Kinda got addicted from dreamin' the dream
In a world where love is hard to find
I think a bout you 'cause you're one of a kind
Because it's you that I want in my life
I dream, I dream
