I started rhyming just to be somebody
To make people notice me at the party
And not just be the new kid that's albino
Make em say yeah I know but have you heard him rhyme though
Now take that same party around the globe
And my stories connected with a lot of folks
I hope so cause that's the only thing I know
I know it so well I tell it with my eyes closed
And I go with the feeling from the start
Blind in the eye so I see you with my heart
And to me all ya'll look exactly the same fear faith compassion and pain
And try as we may to mask it remains
Such as your religion or your past and your race
The same color blood just pass through our veins
And tears taste the same when they splash on your face
The worlds getting too small to stand in one place
Its like we're roommates just sharing a space
Can't separate and still carry the weight
Gotta heal get away from the fear and the hate
Gotta shake free from the chains
You see what remains
Just a human being end of the day
Don't matter to me what name you gave your spiritual plane
Close your eyes and you'll see what I'm saying
I started rhyming just to be somebody
Found out that I already was
Cause can't nobody be free unless we're all free
There's no me and no you its just us
Street preacher what a fan once called me
I been called worse and tried to live up
Hope you don't mind a few more stories
I swear to god ya'll I tell em with love
