What do you want from me 
Every time I see you, you're asking me 
Asking me to give you more from me 
Can't you see I'm giving you everything 
What do you want from me 
Every time I see you, you're asking me 
Asking me to give you more of me 
Can't you see I'm giving you everything 

I can no longer give you what I'm giving 
I can no longer be your wonder woman 
I am a human being, know that 
You've got to respect me, know that 
I have no idea who you think this is 
I have given all that I am 'bout to give 
When will you say thank you, know that 
I've had enough of you no 

I am not your superwoman 
I am not your slave and 
I am not the one to get no appreciation 

What do you want from me 
Every time I see you, you're asking me 
Asking me to give you more from me 
Can't you see I'm giving you everything 
What do you want from me 
Every time I see you, you're asking me 
Asking me to give you more of me 
Can't you see I'm giving you everything 

I know you brought me 'til you wanted something 
I know you brought me 'til you needed something 
Sometimes you could call me, know that 
Ask me how I'm doing, know that 
I try so hard to satisfy your needs 
I realize I'm only at your feet 
I'm trying hard to get good at 
I need a break from you, no 

I am not your superwoman 
I am not your slave and 
I am not the one to get no appreciation 

What do you want from me 
Every time I see you, you're asking me 
Asking me to give you more from me 
Can't you see I'm giving you everything 
What do you want from me 
Every time I see you, you're asking me 
Asking me to give you more of me 
Can't you see I'm giving you everything 

(Why you, why you) 
Why you want to taught me? 
(You don't realize it) 
But you're the one who taught me how 
You are crazy, you driving me crazy 
I just can't take it no more 
(If you, if you) 
Won't respect me please 
If you won't open your eyes and respect me 
I'm not your superwoman, I need appreciation 

What do you want from me 
Every time I see you, you're asking me 
Asking me to give you more from me 
Can't you see I'm giving you everything 
What do you want from me 
Every time I see you, you're asking me 
Asking me to give you more of me 
Can't you see I'm giving you everything
