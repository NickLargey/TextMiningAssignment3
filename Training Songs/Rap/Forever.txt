Oh
Forever

I often wonder each and every day
If I should open to your right away
Oh, would you stay here by my side in life {In love}

Time will guide us together
Find us both in happiness
Well, I can do is hope that you'll feel the same
{Should I tell you, I tell you, I tell you}

I love you 
And I need you
Cause I want you here {I want you here}
Right by my side forever

My empty teardrops no longer fall
You rescue me, baby, when loneliness calls
So happy am I cause true love is so hard to find

Time will guide us together
Overcome the differences well find
Let love be your guide, don't hold back what you feel inside, yeah
{Should I tell you, I tell you, I tell you}

I love you 
And I need you
Cause I want you here {I want you here}
Right by my side forever, forever

I want you next to me
I need you desperately {Forever}
I want you next to me
I need you desperately forever {Forever} forever {Forever} forever {Forever}

I want you next to me
I need you desperately
I want you next to me
I need you desperately forever {Forever} forever {Forever} forever {Forever}

I want you
And I need you
Forever, forever, forever

Forever
