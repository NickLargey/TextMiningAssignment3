Now eva since I can remember, I've been poppin' my collar
(Poppin' poppin' my collar, poppin' poppin' my collar)
Now eva since I can remember, I've been workin' these ho's
'N they betta put my money in my hand

I know you sicker than sicka
When you see the rims flicka
The paint drip off
Ice in my Range glitta
I straight flippa
The cheese like pancake-a
Foldin' my cheese like the leaves in my hand bricka?
Project Pat-ter
Attracted to dime pieces
I'm dirty southern
French braids, gold teeth-a
I'm out here makin' sense
Plus, I'm out here makin' dollars
I keep a bad broad, though, and a popped collar

She's just another ho that I met in the hood
I told her I was Crunchy Black and it was all good
She might as well go on head and suck on my wood
And let me whisper something in her ear if I could

Now eva since I can remember, I've been poppin' my collar

Now eva since I can remember, I've been workin' these ho's

Now when it comes to getting bread I got the keys to the bakery
A lot of dudes swear they play, man they some fake-ery
Let me catch a girl up out some work in my site
And believe I'm gon' be atcha in the daylight with a flashlight
I'm tryin' to get paid however money is made
A lot dudes like to pay ladies to get laid
But me, I ain't no pimp, I just love to borrow
Paper from a fat bitch, a ugly bitch, a model fa real

Well you know me by the Juice man hangin' out with Big Triece
Standin' on tha porch, drinkin' liquor, drunk, smokin' weed
Trying to get a paycheck, but work that ain't came yet
That's why I stay in a girl ear, to keep that pussy wet

Now eva since I can remember, I've been poppin' my collar
(Poppin' poppin' my collar, poppin' poppin' my collar)
Now eva since I can remember, I've been workin' these ho's

Poppin' poppin' my collar, poppin' poppin' my collar
Poppin' poppin' my collar, poppin' poppin' my collar
Collar, collar, collar, collar
