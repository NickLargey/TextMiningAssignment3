I finally figured it out that haters' mouths is used for suckin'
Suckin'

You niggas paper weights
y'all don't want to f*ck with the great
Fakin' moves like you wantin' somethin' get it straight
Cause one mistake'll get this motherfucker aired out
You niggas better recognize this is Brad's house
I put the mic down to give you other rappers a chance
But all you niggas want to write about is dance
I tell another nigga 'bout your mama
So I'll be forced to bring you back the raw shit
The hardships of growin' up
Stuck in the hood
Broke as f*ck, out to hustle
Facin life struggle
And havin' nightmares about gettin' big scrilla
And that's the type of shit that turn these mama boys to killers
On the realer, it's a nigga comin' back for the streets
Cause this bullshit I been hearin in the rap game is weak
You got these killas on your payroll
I'm doin it out of love
But if you cross me I'm fuckin' you up
I keep a ?
I'm a nigga in destroyer mode
I squeeze it once you blow you out of your soul
Who's the "boss" in this rap shit?
I let my opposition judge me
But if push came to shove they couldn't budge me
Cause I'm ugly with styles identical to none
I'm tellin' you
Don't f*ck with me, nigga, I ain't the one

I ain't the one
These niggas better recognize the realest
Keep a loaded .45 inside for protection

I'm a .45 packer, nigga hoe subtractor
blacka blacka blacka 
Nigga, back up!
I'm a bad actor
With no respect for the nigga haters
I kill a motherfucker stiff cause he's a traitor
I ain't a player
I got my stripes from these streets
I'm a killa
That's probably why at night I can't sleep
I strike a match and watch a motherfucker burn
That's just treatment ? you fuckin' worm
I'm the Don Corleone
y'all niggas is phony
I put that on my mob and my goddamn homies
Recognize niggas who can't be touched
If they can't be seen
I'm a lost ? 
Undestroyable by human plagues
You got a strap? I got a strap too!
You f*ck with me I have to clap you!
And now you stearin' down the barrel of a gun
I told you
Don't f*ck with me, nigga, I ain't the one

[Chorus]

Wait,
This motherfucker got me bend, I gots to break
Before I shoot this motherfucker in his face
Cause niggas on the edge don't want to play right
So I'ma lay his ass down in broad daylight
Now what's up, bitch, ?
? let me clear this motherfuckin' corner
Mayhem unlike a nigga ever seen
? in his face all in once gettin' clean
I'm dashin in my undercover hoo-doo
(Who you?)
You run up on me? I got's to shoot you!
And you know me
And ain't shit changed but my zip code
Your ?I'm in a flipmode
A tip-top murderer
Comin' for you bullshitters
Squash you motherfuckin' niggas
I ain't the one

[Chorus]

Realest Niggas Down South, motherfuckers
Don't get that shit twisted
Just them hoes
?
Aight
?
For all you fake motherfuckers who was talkin' 'bout the first joint
Suck a nigga dick
Fake-ass ho's
Know where started it
Know where started it
Know where started it
Me ?
Lay this motherfuckers down
In broad daylight
Bitches be squeezin' they pistols
They want to play fight
Me? I'm the colder
Bold-bold-bolder
Bold-bolder
Hit em from the shoulder
Puncher
Dumper dumper
You motherfuckers talking shit
I drag him on the back of the bumper
? Face to M-o-B and
Can't a motherfucker see em ?
