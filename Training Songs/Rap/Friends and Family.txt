Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Some call me a loser,
Some call me a cheater,
Some say I'm a selfish
Untalented dreamer
Cause all I try to do
Is keep my dreams alive
Is that so hard to do?

When you're workin' nine to five,
I've never been born afraid to die,
But I'm afraid to leave behind
The precious life that grows through the sands of time
Cause Now I've got two daughters and I know they need there father
To help them make it through/All the devious things that people do

Cause every moment counts from the good times to the bad
I don't have time to envy those who've got things that I never had
Cause the one thing most important is the thing we take for granted
Until your life is on that line/I think that's the way God had planned it
So open up your eyes/To make you realize/ that there's some/ Life is money
But what is money without life? Cause all I need
Is the air that I breathe and my friends and family
To believe in me

It's deep as the abyss where the waters run
It's deep as the land of the rising sun
And they won't die
(Even when their minds are against us)
Doesn't even matter
Nothing else matters

It's deep as the abyss where the waters run
It's deep as the land of the rising sun
And they won't die
(Even when their minds are against us)
Doesn't even matter
Nothing else matters

We bleed the same blood
We cry the same tears/We have the same fears
We pass the same gears
We see the same stars
We live the same sky
We pass the same time
We all live and die

'Cause friends, family will stick in the blood
And if you've never felt love than I pray for you cause
Cause life's full of brothas
Seven forty sevens
Who will love us
Before they go to heaven

And everything in-between has a meaning
Some stay connected
While others keep dreaming

Looking for that meaning
But the lost can't be found
Drop to your calves and break 
Can you hear the sound?

Do you feel it?
And do you feel it coming?
To triple zero
The hunters are the hunted

Electrical currents
Conflict with the spirits
Ah do you hear it?
Ah well can you feel it?

Deep like seven the life brings its intelligence
Got no time for cleaver
You're late if there's hesitance
Put your foot forward and you'll be a helping hand
Take a step back than your stuck in the quick sand
And just the toxic keeps us locked in

A mental jail trapped 
99
Where your family at?

(Oh my mind did fail/ oh my mind succeed
Whatever the outcome is/ Just keep your faith in me
Just believe in me
I will be there)

It's deep as the abyss where the waters run
It's deep as the land of the rising sun
And they won't die
(Even when their minds are against us)
Doesn't even matter
Nothing else matters
