Raheem presents Drama
Tight two motherfucking Def
Get at they ass, boy!

[Chorus]
Ice on my wrist, I'm ballin', man
Hos on my dick, I'm ballin', man
Cases of Crystal, I'm ballin', man
Shoes of crocodile, I'm ballin', man
House on the lake, I'm ballin', man
Tight Two Def straight pushing weight, I'm ballin', man
Dubs on the Lex', I'm ballin', man
Cashing eight figure checks, I'm ballin', man

Yo, yo, yo, yo, Drama, how you doing it?
Me and my niggas - we riding dirty from Charleston to Texas
Bowling ball paint job with Ds on the Lex
Beamers and Cadillacs, Optimos and fat sacks
We trained for combat; you wrong, then we attack
We ride like Desperado on the spokes goldened out
Keep cheese in the pockets
And keep our distance from cop blockers
AK on the front seat for any drama I may meet
My pager off killing hos, providing them Bs and Vogues
Clientelle getting bigger while calculating money figures
More realer than Rockafeller, more cheese than Donald Trump
Niggas - they hear me, they want to kill me like JFK
Why?  'Cause I ride tight, on out of sight
It might be the hos, or could it be that I ride on Vogues?
My trunk is filled with speakers; I know damn well you hear me
Got a torch, you see me
Hundred spokes that beaming
Niggas plotting - they haters
And busters - they want to be me
 
[Chorus]

In the club I'm balling, bitch; now show me love
Bossalinie, Versace shoes, with some Gator boots
Dom Perion, it's on now through the early morn'
F*ck a hobby, man, 'cause balling be my occupation
Playa hating ass nigga; can't take the temptation
Want to rush me, then bust me, then leave me fucked in the game
All because I drained his bitch; now partners use his name
See the spokes, and how the gleaming make 'em want to scheme
Eighty-five Chevy Caprice off on some Dayne-Daynes
Paint job, be clocking miles with some blowed brains
Twenty and bubble, gon' buy the Reeboks - now them some shoes
With the nine up on the seat - that's where it's supposed to be
For them bustas and them haters that want to touch a G
Put it down and moved on up too, like me George Jefferson
F*ck the law, and f*ck the pen, because I'm ballin', man
Loved the living, I'm dedicated all to the game
I'm ballin' man
 
[Chorus]

When I'm heated in the club, around twelve o' clock
All eyes on a playa, 'cause I'll blow up the spot
You can hate; we blowing clouts in the V.I.P.
Ballers sport rims like they stars of films
My money's too un-fadable for them too-tight crews
And tear da roof off this bitch with this Tight Two Def shit
Nigga knocking, ho jocking, 'cause this shit don't quit
In the club V.I.P till the early morning
Cases of Crystal, even Dom Perion
A McGuyver Road nigga, so you know I don't play
But if it come down to it, I got my K
F*ck the flexing, 'cause we ballin', shot callin', and stacking
And if it come down to the gunplay
Tight Two Def ain't lacking
Your money ain't long enough for me, so, ho, don't talk
'Cause down here in Atlanta, nigga, we walk the walk
I say it loud and clear
I'm ballin' man

[Chorus]
