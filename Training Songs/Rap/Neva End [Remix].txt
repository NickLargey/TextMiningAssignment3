You go, you come, you stay, you leave
Come back again!
You here babe

We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna neva

We don’t wanna neva end
It’s like our life has just began
You walkin’ out, you comin’ back again
'Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna

I could tell you was into me, from my instant chemistry
As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me
I’ll go to war over you I don’t give a f*ck about showing you
You know what it is, shorty, forever my lil' shawty
Long as I’m swimmin’ in benjamins, you shop with no limited
You’ll see reminisce every session, know you’ll come back again
I know you can’t breathe without me, you gon’ need the oxygen
I damn near gave you an overdose, on my own medicine
I took a sip of your tea and I ain’t been right ever since
As I think to myself what it be is it heaven sent
Let’s put the past behind us
And go far away where nobody can find us!

We don’t wanna neva end
It’s like our life has just began
You walkin’ out, you comin’ back again
'Cause we became the best of friends
I got all the questions, you got all the answers
I took your heart boy, held it up for ransom
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna

Oh, neva say neva
From the day we got together
I thought it will be forever, but baby, woh
You showed your true colors
I can’t believe you played me
I let you meet my mother, oh
Oh, you hung out with my brother,
My significant other
You know I still love you, baby, oh
Oh boy, you make me so mad, but I come right back
It’s like I can’t get over
You, I can’t get over you
And the things that you do
Swear I don’t want nobody but you, baby!

We don’t wanna neva end
It’s like our life has just began
You walkin’ out, you comin’ back again
'Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna

Is there anything you wanna know? (Girl ask me)
Is there any place you rather be? (I know the answer)
You walk until your feet get sore (Watch this)
I bet you walking back
I bet you walking back to me (A matter of fact)
Actually that’s a guarantee (Ima hear everything)
Our friendship was guaranteed you got my ego in another league
I ain’t tryna be cocky
I got your heart in my pocket

We don’t wanna neva end
It’s like our life has just began
You walkin’ out, you comin’ back again
'Cause we became the best of friends
I got all the questions you all the answers
I took your boy, held it up for ransom
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
