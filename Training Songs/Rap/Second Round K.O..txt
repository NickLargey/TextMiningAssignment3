Hey, Mike Tyson here, speakin' with the Canibus man over here
Yo, Canibus, your main objective out here is to do nottin' but
Eat, eat, eat, eat, emcees for lunch, breakfast
Hey, man, they been playin' me all my life, man
You know I won a title a couple a times, did right
No, but they can't hurt us, man
We gonna do it, get up in this ring, man, put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle this lil' nigga

[Canibus]
So I'm a let the world know the truth; you don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you lays your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, somethin' that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum, you only droppin' clues
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched the footnotes 'bout how you used to sniff coke
Frontin' like a drug free role model; you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showin' off your body 'cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me 'cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While ninety-nine percent of your fans wear high heels
From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to jay-z
Now you wanna f*ck with me? You must be crazy
You drippin' with whack juice, and you can't get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start, nigga

[Referee]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you just hold it right there
(Yo, get off me, man)
We got an illegal low blow on the fighter in the blue trunks
(Yo, yo, get the f*ck off me, man)
If I see one more of those, you're outta here, brother
(Yo, get out my way, man
Yo, he started this shit)
You understand? (F*ck you!)
You'll be disqualified 
(I'll bite that nigga again!)
Stop bein' a bitch 
(Get the f*ck off me, man!)
We came to see a fight

[Mike Tyson]
Yo, Canibus, man, you gotta hit harder than that, man
You don't want no bitch ass niggas hangin' out wit' me, man
We're warriors, man, when we go into battle
We come out, or don't come out at all

[Canibus]
Yo, you better give me the respect that I deserve or I'm a take it by force
Blast you with a 45 colt, make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk?
It's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that whack-ass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
'Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March ninth
God bless his soul; rest in peace, kid
It's because of him, now, at least I know what beef is
It's not what I would call this; see, this is somethin' different
A faggot nigga tryin' to make a livin' off a dissin'
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feelin' himself 'cause he got more cheddar than him
Well, lemme tell you somethin: you might got mo cash than me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a niggas ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verse; f*ck it, I'll let you kick 'em all
I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom, your first, second, and third born
Make your wife get on the horn, call minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it; I say, naw, he started it
He forgot what a hardcore artist is
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man, such as myself
Trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars off hand
From a lost and forgotten land; you done did it, man
You done spitted some whack shit
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'll forget it
F*ck that, 'cause like Common and Cube, I see the bitch in you
And I'm a make the world see it too, motherfucker

[Referee]
Ladies and gentleman, we have a new lyrical weight champion
By second round knock-out, three minutes and forty seconds: Can-i-bus

[Mike Tyson]
Yo, Canibus, man, you movin' like Mike Tyson Jr., man
You in and out, and you're agile with your flow, man
But dig right; you got, you got meat, man; that's your name: Canibus
Your whole agenda is to eat these niggas, man
They have no business to be in the same stage with you
Holdin' a mic with you

But dig right

But dig right

But dig right

But dig right

Hey, Mike Tyson here, speakin' with the Canibus man over here
Yo, Canibus, your main objective out here is to do nottin' but
Eat, eat, eat, eat, emcees for lunch, breakfast, dinner
That's your agenda, baby
Your, your agenda to to consume them
Their whole existence; they can't exist in your presence
The Canibus is here to rule forever
Mike Tyson, on the death
