[Verse One: Snoop Dogg]
The gangstas bang, do that dame thang 
Me and my nephew dogghouse keep it tru 
Roll that weed, pass that drank 
Holla at your nigga baby bring your thang 

You could shake what you got 
Get your pussy real hot 
Jump in the gator we could slide to my ??? 
Just keep it on leasy 

I know it ain easy 
Your fuckin mouth greasy 
Silkk this bitch cute, thick and all that 
Why must I, chase the game 

If you was me and I was you 
You probably fuss on a nigga 
Buring rubber in a 52 
Most bitches do and most niggas do to 

In the land where it all about the red and blue 
But me I'd rather get the greenery 
Smoke out the whole muthafucking sceanery 

[Hook: x 2]

[Verse Two: Goldie Loc]
Why must I, be like that 
With them [unknown] tux 
Draped in all black 
Takin' back like the pop lockin' [unknown] gold suits 

Bangin back in the day juss to get a lil Juice 
F*ck the trus 
'Cause we can get criped out krazy 
Blast on all you suckas 

Went to throw away 380 
F*ck around get found up in a dumpster some where 
'Cause them south side east side gangstas don't care 
Nigga I would, fool you don't {know you don't} 

He fuckin' with no niggas more gangsta than me 
Tell him the truth loc 
120 proof outs the sun roof 
Throwing up the muthafuckin ??

Tru Tank Doggs fuckin with Bigg Snoop Dogg 
Soopafly to keep them high so they could come out there draws 
What you player hatin perpitratior niggas make me mad 
So I'm mad off you suckas and my pants never sagg 

[Hook: x 2]

[Verse Three: Silkk The Shocker]
It ain't nothing but a gangsta party 
You know what we bring

Ain't nothing but a G thang 

You know, we thank the ?? 
Ya'll think moneys all out 
Ya'll better thank again 
'Cause if ain't about money 

Then why would I bother 
If she ain't keepin it real 
Then why would I holla 
She come over by the crib 

House comes with a lake 
Eat as much as you want too 
[unknown]
On my lap fo' five 

In the trunk [unknown] 
And the day P, Snoop, Biggie and Pac ??
And the heat I got on me 
Always got to ride with it 

I spend money floss money 
'Cause I can die with it 
Project nigga 
Get my work on 

Host MTV with an Eastsidaz shirt on 
I'm young like that, you know how we live 
On the east it's 6 feet 
On the west it's 3 wheels
