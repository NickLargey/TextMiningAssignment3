Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh

I think about all the time
Think you may need all of mine
Hate to say you know that love is blind
I'm 'bout to see, I'll close my eyes
(Truth is) They can't see you in here though
Most of them need dollar signs to make
Every day your birthday
And every night your Valentine

If we tried that we could be
Somewhere the climate is warm, long as you around me
I swear that everything will be just fine
I wish that we could take some time
Go anywhere, baby I don’t mind
Grown man, in my suit and tie
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh, yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I

See my baby know, where my baby go, I go
It's no better feeling, you know when I’m next to her for sure
It's like,
Oh how can they hate? Get this off my chest
Oh girl, I think I love you, I swear your **** look best
Friends, they know they hate, they don't get the best
Ah yea, I think I love you, oh baby maybe

If we tried that we could be

Oh, yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I

Oohh, da du du du du
Oohh, da du du du du
Oohh, da du du du du
