I'm back, I'm on my Dip set shit
20 30 grand in one pocket, foreign car outside
Living life fast, you niggaz need to catch up, slow pokes
NYC here we go again

Dip, dip set, I get on extra grind, I get on extra grind
I get on extra grind when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time

I get on extra grind, I get on extra grind
I get on extra grind when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time

I get on extra grind, I get on extra grind
I get on extra grind when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time

I'm in the coupe relaxing, you see the roof collapsing
I got my paper up although I'm still kufi smacking
And it's God fearing, foreign car steering
60 thou Jabar wearing, just beat a trial hearing

You should catch me walking cocky out the courtroom
Like eat my dust, a buck 40 for the Porsche zoom
We back in population, we cop drops to race 'em
We getting money over here what's your occupation

We on top of things and we got them things
But we only sell them birds, you tryna cop a wing?
I know the real rich, the real Richard Porter
RIP he left the hood to us, we own the corners

The bright lights and my big city
My ice bright and the wrist silly
I'm risking Fed time, front page headline
Make the pedal hit the floor 'til the throttle red line

Dip, dip, dip, dip set when it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time

I let my pants sag, so I can show my ass
It's twenty g's a pocket, that's 'cause we blowing cash
And when the photo's flash, Gallardies going pass
Lights, camera's, autographs 'Wet Willies", call a cab

The fast life is pricey, the time piece is icey
And my niggaz moving fish scale just like the Pisces
Momma raised a thug, lawyers when we face the judge
This is the chance we take to try and put ya brain on drugs

And we invade the clubs standing on the furniture
Throwing gang signs, two stepping with our burners tucked
And we will burn you up like three star alarm
We are the bomb hundred g's on the charm

You'd think I own the cleaners how I wash that paper
And now we at the dealer tryna cop all flavors
We at the dealer dog, so how you feeling y'all?
Just tear the ceiling off, f*ck the light we peeling off

Dip, dip, dip, dip set when it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time

Dip, dip set, I get on extra grind, I get on extra grind
I get on extra grind when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time

The young and the restless live life reckless
House money on the necklace the pigs want him arrested
'Cause I'm obsessed with the guns and the vest's
'Cause when you get some cake, the candles come with a death wish

The rock star living, the hot cars and women
The God forgive him, hope the cop cars don't get 'em
Them bitches on the bozart at the club, throwing stacks
At Star Wars, they threw two I threw four back

And I'm back, it's Mr. New York City
My hat to the back, I stay flyer than a Frisbee
We still Diddy bopping, we still could get it poppin'
Ain't nothing change but the year of the Range

And the clouds still moving with the squamy
And the gangsta's don't die, we get money and move to Miami!
When it's repping time, I get on extra grind
40 cal, an extra nine Dip set the cities mine

Dip, dip, dip, dip set when it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's, when it's reppin' time
