Short, Short

Short Dog, you so cold
You'ze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog, let 'em know
Still spitting that game and macking hoes

Short Dog, you so cold
You'ze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog, let 'em know
Still spitting that game, Cadillac on voes

I heard Short Dog settled down and tied the knot
You think I'm dreaming, you think I fade 'em all and lied a lot
My real friends know I always try to find me a woman
But everywhere I go, bitches try to slide me something

Now listen up, I try to make it quick
I tell you about my greatest hits my latest flick was a porno
'Cuz I reached that level I fulfilled all my fantasies
I passed several beautiful women, I'm a thrill seeker, a pro player
My specialty is ex-cheerleaders, dancers, gymnasts and ballerinas

They all hot like some halapenos
If I released the names and pictures of all the bitches
Drop everything you doing and call the missus
She was young when she met me, so don't hate her
I'm an entertainer and a master manipulator

Short Dog, let them know
Just how the game really goes
I don't think they know
The game is still not told

Short Dog, you so cold
You'ze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog, let 'em know
Still spitting that game and macking hoes

Short Dog, you so cold
You'ze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog, let 'em know
Still spitting that game, Cadillac on voes

Now would it make you mad?
Knowing Too Short had wine and laughs
Candle-lit bubble baths, I hit that ass
Way before you knew your bitch, she's kinda fast
I still wanna do your bitch

Take a chance, sit down and have a seat
You know the saying, don't bring your girl 'round me
Did you think my greatest hits was gonna be some songs?
Nope, just some stories about a bunch of thongs, fo' sho'

She's the type that you had to marry
You walked in the room and said Hallie Berry
That's what she looked like so I put my thing up in her
Rolled over and said goodnight

When I woke up in the morning, she looked the same
So I did the same thing to her, hooked her mayn
I hit her two best friends first that's what I did
She heard I was good in bed that's what they said

Short Dog let them know
Just how the game really goes
I don't think they know
The game is still not told

Short Dog, you so cold
You'ze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog, let 'em know
Still spitting that game and macking hoes

Short Dog, you so cold
You'ze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog, let 'em know
Still spitting that game, Cadillac on voes

From 14-41, 4'11-6 feet
Lil' mama was a big freak
The 6 footer had her time with me
I got some supermodel head on Miami Beach

Then I finger fucked the woman on the plane next to me
When it landed, the flight attendant had sex with me
And they ask, “Is it the pimp in you?”
I hit reporters morning after interviews

Checking in, lil' cutie at the front desk
All in my face, lookin' like she wants this
Later on, she asks me to play her a song
Getting nasty in my room with her uniform on

I been with roommates, sisters, even twins
Next door neighbors, so rose and best friends
I got passed around the crew, willingly
Until this very day they all feeling me

Short Dog let them know
Just how the game really goes
I don't think they know
The game is still not told

Short Dog, you so cold
You'ze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog, let 'em know
Still spitting that game and macking hoes

Short Dog, you so cold
You'ze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog, let 'em know
Still spitting that game, Cadillac on voes

Short Dog, you so cold
You'ze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog, let 'em know
Still spitting that game and macking hoes
