Love, electricity, shockwave central
Power on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes the lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the

Oh Stylo,
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love

When the mako flies up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I know the twilight skies are not so broken hearted

If its love is electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard

Right now

Sing yourself out of depression, rise above
Always searching if I know your heart
Electric is the love

There's only one way
Let it pray a little while longer
It's got a way of passing through man and woman
In another world
In another world, in the universe

Right now

Here's what we got to do

If its love is electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard

That's what I'm talking about

Love, electricity, shockwave central
Power on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes the lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

Right now
