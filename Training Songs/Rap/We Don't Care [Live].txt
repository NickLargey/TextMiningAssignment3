For all my niggaz, that drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya money till it gets sky high
Do me a favor kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say we don't care what people say

If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dope man
Only a dope man, I knew that wasn't a coke man
Flickin' starter coats man, man, you know man
We don't care what people say

This is for my niggaz outside all winter
'Cuz this summer they ain't finna to say next summer, I'm finna
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no to tuition for havin' no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
We forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man your ass is grown

Say, drug dealin' just to get by
Sing, stack ya money till it gets sky high
Do me a favor kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say we don't care what people say

The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5
That still hustle, a nigga can't shine off 6.55
And everybody sellin' make-up, Jacobs
And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work than push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say

My momma say she wanna move south
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
Around the same time, Doe ran up in dudes house, couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game polemic, it's hard to get weight
Niggaz money is homo, it's hard to get straight
We gon' keep bakin' to the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say

My niggaz, drug dealin' just to get by
Sing, stack ya money till it gets sky high
Do me a favor kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
But the jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say we don't care what people say
