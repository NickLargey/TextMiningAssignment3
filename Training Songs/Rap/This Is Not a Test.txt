Fell out of the sky 
Hit the ground runnin’ 
The future is tonight 
They’ll never see us comin’ 
Taken by this urgency, won’t let this moment pass 
The Kingdom is alive, we’re steppin’ on the gas 

We’re checkin’ in, so check it out 
We’re droppin’ in, there ain’t no stopping us now 

We’ve only got one shot, gonna to take it now 
Goin’ all in, gonna make it count 
Won’t look back, gonna set my eyes 
‘Cause there ain’t no practice runs in life 

This is not a, this is not a test (this is the real thing)
This is not a, this is not a test (this is the real thing)
We gonna go till we got nothin’ left (this is the real thing)
This is not a, this is not a, this is not a test 
This is not a test 
This is not a test 

We’re checkin’ in, so check it out 
We’re droppin’ in, there ain’t no stopping us now 
We’re breathin’ in, we’re breathin’ out 
We’re droppin’ in, there ain’t no stoppin’, stoppin’ us now 

We’ve only got one shot, gonna to take it now 
Goin’ all in, gonna make it count 
Won’t look back, gonna set my eyes 
‘Cause there ain’t no practice runs in life 

This is life
This is life
This is life
This is life, this is life, this is life, this is life
This is life, life, life, life, life, life (so don’t get left behind!)

This is not a, this is not a test (this is the real thing)
This is not a, this is not a test (this is the real thing)
We gonna go till we got nothin’ left (this is the real thing)
This is not a, this is not a, this is not a test 

(This is not a test) we gonna move
Live every second, make it count for you (make it count, make it count)
We gonna move
Live every second, make it count for you (make it count, make it count) (this is not a test)
We gonna move
Live every second, make it count for you
