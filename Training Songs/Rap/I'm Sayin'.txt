Somewhere in here there's a bad bitch that's been on my mind
She tried to call but I missed it when she hit my line
I know I've been drinking a lot and I'm probably too high
If I hit it once then I probably could hit one more time

'Cause her sex game on Beyoncé
I think she drinking Bombay
Don't take this the wrong way
I eat that sweet pussy on a Saturday

I'm saying, might make her my fiancée
I'm saying, don't care what they gon' say
I'm saying, I give it to her long way
Bang bang when I hit her with the gunplay
Where are you?
(I'm saying) At the end of the night where you going?
(I'm saying) When it's all said and done is you rolling?
I'm saying
I'm saying
I'm saying, tryna hit her with the gunplay
I'm saying, tryna hit her with the gunplay

Suicide, suicide Lamborghini's outside
Wanna ride? Wanna ride? We could run the baller life
Like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, head on my lap
So low, low, low, low, you remember that?
Baby, I'm a savage, you ain't fucking with the average
Sex game, I'm an addict, she ain't tripping off the status
Red light, green light, we can skip the foreplay
Left, right, she be going both ways

I'm saying (Tell 'em what you talking 'bout)
I'm saying (Omarion, you saying to 'em?)
I'm saying, tryna hit her with the gunplay

Pull up on that girl with her legs open
After she sucked my mmm, leave her head swollen
She just wanna mmm with me for a little exposure
Tell me, do you f*ck with me? Tell me, what's your motive?
Tell me why you do that shit you do to me
When you do it, girl you got a nigga feeling so bad
And I be feeling like Jay-Z you don't know why girl
Yeah you do, Quan
