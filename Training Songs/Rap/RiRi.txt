So I just came out the booth to goddamn, to hear this
To hear this shit right here? And my niggas, niggas just sayin'
"Bruh I just told 'em the same shit"
The niggas just told these girls that he do it all by himself
It's crazy, cray-cray, I did though, you know what I'm sayin'?
With a golden shovel, iced out AP, plus a Rollie bezel on another level

I say bitch what is you thinkin', we Arthur Blankin'
Bitch ass on me and I got rank and I'm steady rankin'
Better stop listenin' to these hoes 'fore you start shrinkin'
I know I'm a blood, I'm a gang banger
I know where the bitch but I'm still singin'
Mothafuck the rest, they ain’t really bangin'
I got the real hitters with me and they dangerous
You can't find 'em on no camera but they no namin'
Washin' powder bae on Tide, I've been up all night
Me and bae Bonnie Clyde, everything we do right
Love her vibe, love her vibe, she make me feel so nice
She 100, the first day we met she let me f*ck all night

Drop top in a RR with a big tall demon

Like shoutout to Stevie but these niggas not seein' me
I'm a big dinosaur B and these niggas not beatin' me
Aye, I'm scared to trust you, I'm scared you'll trick me
I done drive by in a foreign car but they're still tryna eat me
Put 60,000 on my mama ring and it ain't even come out of Tiffany's
