The whole damn world is country...
The whole damn world is country...

[Skinny DeVille]
Yeah...
Aww man, the grass done got green on the other side of the fence
So I hopped my ass over to see if I was convinced
Fast paced city life, but country livin's the sense
Cop me a Caddy say to hell with a Benz
Benz, Benz, twenty inch rims
I can't leave the vertical grill back at the ranch
Got a "Phat" farm with with cows and whole lotta land
Twenty acres (???)

[B. Stille]
Meanwhile up in the D where they hollowin up dope
And thugs blow weed in the park when the club close
In Mil-waukee the beats it petro
Off in D.C., the streets is ghetto
Let's roll - to Cali where they chief the best 'dro
And drive cars so big you can't reach the pedal
Never had a glass of purple juice for breakfast
Until I took my ass to Houston, Texas, that's country!

[Chorus]
The whole damn world is country
Been all around the globe from Monday to Sunday
y'all the same folk we see in Kentucky (it must mean)
The whole damn world is country
Been all around the globe from Monday to Sunday
y'all the same folk we see in Kentucky (it must mean)
The whole damn world is country

[Big V]
(???) they was sportin, Jordans and Waltons
Went in for the cage, and winded up staying
In Kentucky it was meth but Miami they was basing
Rap my ass off then I'll see ya at the Bassment
Hit VA, where they do nothing but cook
Carolina, Indiana, Alabama, Savannah
Boston, Denver, and all points between
Tennesse, Florida, ain't nothing love for ya

[R. Prophit]
Now shake it, bounce, sit back and let ya hair blow
Spanish chicas waving, hasta luego
Pearl white drop, weather's bueno
They say opposites attract, I'm a moreno
(whispered: ???) so clear
(whispered: ???) my clear
(???) girl, all she want to do is (???)
Top of the hill, take the breath from her lungs
(Country boys been overseas)
Toppin it off, London, Germany

[Chorus]

[R. Prophit]
Now shake it, bounce, sit back and let ya hair blow
Ladies make ya hands clap like bueno
Now shake it, bounce, sit back and let ya hair blow
Holla atcha boy, hasta luego...

[Scales]
I'll prolly say a prayer for those that come back
Might could throw somethin on the grill when you come back
Might could take a trip to the 'Ville and then back
We can all get loose on the 'Ports, and of course
Hit Churchill Downs and throw some on a horse
Or we can hit them Saint Claire waters
You ain't seen country till you been through Georgia
God durn, they still got girls with perms (dang)
Big cars, big wheels is the biggest concern

[Ron Clutch]
My old Kentucky home, I was
born and raised on catfish and corn, collard greens and fatback
It's country than a mug, don't care where ya stay
Ya got country in ya blood if ya love 'em and that's that
Circled the globe, met the important and paid
Now I know for a fact that...

[Chorus] 2X
