Boys feel to play, it's shockin' me but
You're the only one I'm thinkin' 'bout
Why you want to keep procrastinating
Better step to me 'fore time runs out
The jam is about to end

See man with the heat, give me a shot
No you better not sleep
Better get it while it's hot

Why you get so nervous
Do you think I'm the clown
Have you all embarrassed

A little conversation
But you gotta be smooth

When we vibe,
When you ride with me, ooh,
With such a vibrant thing, uh,
A vibrant thing,
