Biz Markie and Elephant Man, we sensei
Bump fair ladies like Sean Paul, okay, see'mon!

Ladies and gentlemen, how do you do (a do)
It's been a long time but without further adieu (adieu)
The Diabolical came to get the job done
'Cause I'm the, Woogie Boogie and the master of fun
If you're ready to rock, and ready to get down
The grand groovin' here to prove a different sound
I gotta get funky for the Y2K
Each and every time I know what to say
East West Midwest and the Dirty South
Always love the way that I be rockin' the house
All the ladies, in the new jeans
Like Steve Arrington, you make me weak at the knees
I'm glad to be right here with why'all
Let the players play, and ballers ball, so
Chant, if you like the song
C'mon baby doll just sing along

[Chorus x2]
Girl, let me see you bounce
Let me see you bounce
Let me see you bounce
Bounce

Every ting be a bounce, make me see girls a bounce
Make me see boots a bounce, make me see party a bounce
Disc jockey be a bounce, raise the stage up and bounce
Hopin' dat de club a bounce, if ya irie a bounce
All de funkers a bounce, bartenders a bounce
Soul people a bounce, all dese people a bounce
Every ting a bounce, ju know!
Bouncy bouncy bounce bounce, she no care
Bouncy bouncy bounce bounce, anywhere
What kind of booty dat she have {?} in de air
Just a bouncy bouncy bounce bounce, she no care
Bouncy bouncy bounce bounce, anywhere ju know!
C'mon

[Chorus]

Yes, I'm here to confess
That I took the S off Superman's chest
He got mad cause I felt, Lois Lane's breasts
I asked her could I touch
