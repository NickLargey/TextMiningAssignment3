I can understand it
V, the beat bandit 
Who bring heat from the mic
Unhanded, who ever go after
Burn their hands and lips, a lot of rappers
Ran and abandon their whips
It's just another day in the dunia
Don't leave your girl around v he might swoon her
Up and under the window, serenade like hakuna
Stay ahead of the game and cut her off soon or
Ever later, use her to carbonate her
Scoop her in the butter, soft of a spoon roof navigator
Or the land or the lex or the benz
A hundred and sixteenth by the hour of the africans
But they won't let you push him
One tried to get fly, almost had to mush him
If I wanted to wobble, I would've warned ass
Hit him with the phone, took the dough and tore ass
Want not, waste not, front not
They didn't see him dippin to the fiftycent blunt spot
V walk the town with space boots
Space suits, fucked up cut, but they
Still say his face's cute
To all the streets, what you staring at? 
The sewer cat opened up and said: why you wearing that? 
He said 'ow you want to snap
Pissface, the way you in everybody's buziness is a disgrace
At the park gate : halt who goes there
It's v the mc, who's nasty as nosehair
You may go he said : you should've been say so
Dripped him in cash, argentini and peso's
There you go, my good man
Buy something nice for the seed
And please keep it moving twice the speed
Consider this your fair warning
Or else I'll bring it to you express like airborne

Vaughn, drop a turd on the beat
And shoutout that little bird for the word on the street
He write vik in a sick, demented handstyle
And go bombin with a chick, who rips a rental van 
While all he say : is you nuts
He really had enough of poon puts and crewcuts
Soup√ßonne, and I got a coupon
Chinese restaurant, asking for the great poopon
He said no, don't soy soysauce(? ?) And this ain't no burgerking
So you get no toy boss, ow ow
It's mirror o'clock, I think I'm sober
How about we think this over, over a can of king cobra
You ain't nicer than a loonatic shiesta
Aka the vicster, or the vic miceter
He wanted ;should he get a baldie
Or keep his edge up, v-shaped like by my waldy
But that is the question, he wonders why he always
Wearing hats in the sessions
Listen up, new drink
Named it after chong's daughter
Triple shot of yak, with the chaser of bong water
Com'on bring the slaughter
Triple shot of yak, with the chaser of bong water
