[Chorus]
Money over everything (that's my attitude)
Still the baddest bitch in the game (that's my attitude)
Talk to ya man when I get ready (that's my attitude)
Have him blowing stacks I ain't petty (that's my attitude)
(yeah)that's my attitude (yeah) (that's my attitude)
And I feel like I'm tha shit, (that's my attitude)
(yeah)(that's my attitude) (yeah) (that's my attitude)
I feel like I run this shit (that's my attitude)

Money over everything I'm all about my change
I'm still rich, still the baddest bitch in the game
F*ck this hoe, that hoe, all them bitches lame
And I ain't gotta say it, you already know the name.
See I'm still running over bitches, still fuckin' ova niggas
Ya husband and yo boyfriend I don't see none them niggas
I roll with C-E-O and stock brokers niggas
While you b riding around town with the brokest niggas
I'm filthy rich my money talk a lot shit
I don't hear ya hoe, here let me turn it down a bit
I feel like I'm the shit, I feel I run this shit
I'm bout to marry my money, I'm so in love with it (yea) 

[Chorus]

Go and do ya thang shawty, naw I ain't mad at chu
But chu can't f*ck with me, I'm mo betta' than you
My waist skinny my ass more fatter than you
Sorry for being conceited that's just my attitude
Get on my level hoe you ain't on my latitude
I got plenty cribs, no tellin' where I travel too
You thank u living good, I got a better view
Condo on south beach, beach villa in Malibu
Hate to brag, but I got a hundred in that, new Louie bag
Pull up in the Benz with tha paypa' tag
I got major swag, them niggas yellin' "shawty bad"
Them hoes mad, cause I got everything they wish they had. (yea)

[Chorus]

M-O-E that's the shit that I'm on
If you ain't got no money, take yo broke ass home
You talkin' couple hundred betta' leave me alone.
Need diamonds and black cars, save ya dollas for tha shones (come on)
I'm on tha paper chase, my man paypa' straight,
He took me to his house "welcome to the safe"
"Oh My God" he made it hard to keep a straight face
I got 'em on his knees telling me "how good it taste"
You bitches hella fake, I'm getting hella cake
Like I'm the birthday girl, it's time to celebrate
I'm so paid, looking sharp with the Louie shades
I put these bitches in they place (that's my attitude)
