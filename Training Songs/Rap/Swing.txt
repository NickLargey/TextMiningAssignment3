Verse One: Geechie Suede 
Now for the grab the stash(?) 
To the alley Varner(?) any splash 
Tryin not to crash 
Swervin got the la la on the dash 
Getting bent up in the armored truck 
stuck him for his glam 
shit is candy yams 
Now we movin on the ancient mans(?) 
They using psycho vision 
For the Valentino Gorabani(?) 
F*ck Armani Butter 
We above these climbs 
Hiest the harbours 
Word to godfathers getting bleed 
Chasing on (?) down to Venice 
Tellin sire bout my alley runnin ways 
that's how it was cus 
Now they got us blammin at the fuzz 
Its all gun and poses 
on a bed of roses gettin shugged 
wrap him in a rug 
leave him on the roof till he stink 
Hit the pool-hall 
Fled the calico and watch him blink 
Movin on Picaso 
Painting my portraits and condos 
'cause when the Lo blows 
Only the Lo knows who doe knows (hey hey) 
Ish:

Geechie:

Verse Two: Ish 
(check this) 
I don't hate players, I'm from the crown rhyme sayers 
Whatever kid- sayers get down with no delaying 
I play my cards shark style, kings and aces 
Welcome to New York the illest of all places 
I never bleed even through this plaza of greed 
You got the rarest, true ain't game in yo world 
Not them Forrest Gump niggas with shades and S-curls (uh) 
I tilt my crown fly I'm trying to angle you girl 
The me and you alliance, is no doubt the fly science 
We'll prosecute the phony star picks with our style 
The million dollar necks word go head crack a smile 
My name is Ish and that's something even in this tish 
Of pimps, players, hustlers, and killahs and they wish 
Your pretty to me, put in me in your frame 
your complex attitude intrigue me...stronger than blow 
you know, we can play the scenes like Pacino and Pfieffer 
My queen'll shine on brinks three karats and brighter 
Finesse in foreign fabrics crit seers(?) tighter 
Them clown kids you dealt never belt 
I came around swift and got felt 
That champagne brand name style got melt 
My man Killah Jules put me close to these jewels 
that's dropped in the lesson sent to crush fools (crush em..peace) 
Yo yo, don't give me your swing 
I got mines and that's the thing 
Its not your swing 
Its mines and that's the thing 
So all that blahzay blahzay blahzay who name bell rings 
All that blahzay blahzay blahzay who name bell rings
