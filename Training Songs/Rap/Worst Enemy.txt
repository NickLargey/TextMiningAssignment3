I'm my best friend
And I'm my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them
Is you feelin' me
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery my infamy got me in hip hop history
First Tupac died then Biggie died
And that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I make history
So I don't turn around no more
I look at whats in front of me
I'm focused on the future cause yesterday is history

A hard head makes a soft ass
Guess yo mom didn't teach ya that
Pick a spot to beef with me and that spot I will meet ya at
But let me check my schedule
I'm free Tuesday 3 weeks from now
You bring your crew I bring my crew
Just pick a time and side of town
Zone 6 is my stomping ground
But I guess you know that by now
But everywhere you go you hear me
That's why your upset right now
Bought a Phantom and a Lamb
But I'm in my vette right now
I raped the game without a rubber
Bank account are pregnant now
The day they tried to murder me a day I cant forget about
And I don't wish no death on homie
Just want him to hear me out
Think about the past and all the many things we talked about
Think about all the people influenced by what comes out our mouth

I'm my best friend
And I'm my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them
Is you feelin' me
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery my infamy got me in hip hop history
First Tupac died then Biggie died

I am not the perfect person
Me don't spit the perfect verses
I wouldn't hurt a girl on purpose cause I feel they don't deserve it
I admit my words can hurt
I dissed tiny she didn't deserve it
Our song I didn't interpret it right and I'm sorry for it
T.I. many times encouraged
Told me face the game with courage
Clay me some great advice and still today I thankful for it
Me Jeezy and T.I. share one thing in common all are poets
Role model to young people tho at times man we still ignore it
And y'all gon owe respect to me and I don't like apologies
Just diss me till you satisfied
I swear it doesn't bother me
Sticks and stones will break my bones and bullets
Wont reflect off me but words and insults only show the world how y'all respectin' me

I'm my best friend
And I'm my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them

All my homies ain't my homies
Half my friends no longer want me
I'm still hungry as I was when I did my first live performance
Things I got I know they want it
Things I done they haven't done it
Tho' they say that they my friends
I know that these niggas opponent
We can joke and laugh and party
But I know their smiles are phony
But I still pray that the Lord give 'em all the things they wanted
All the money in the world cant get the joy I'm felling homie
Like the third date with a woman like you and not for your money
You can help someone and love someone but still they turn and burn you so hard
Want you and revenge watch out cos so called friends
And MJG said it best man will I ever know who my friends
Through thick and thin cos so called friends will turn to foes.

I'm my best friend
And I'm my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them
