Don't wanna go
Don't wanna go
Don't wanna go
Don't wanna go

Don't wanna do this by myself 
Can't help but think this ride won't last too long for me 
Move so long and the mileage that I gain is to touch you 
And leave myself a name 

Nobody said it was gonna be easy 
Nobody said you would always be lost inside 
Nobody said it was gonna be easy 
Nobody said you would always be lost (lost)
