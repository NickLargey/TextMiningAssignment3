It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you

The way your makin' me feel inside feels just so right
Girl I've tried to front before I can't even lie
The way I stayed cool, tried to ignore you
But I knew there was nobody but you
The way you hold me it really shows me
You got a hold on me you drive me crazy
Girl its what you do, I'm so into you
Your the reason why its all about

[Chorus: x2]
You make me feel so good I said
You give good lovin' that I can't deny
Said it makes me want to go and tell the whole wide world
About your lovin' girl you got me goin'

The way that you look at me brightens up my day
You bring out the best in me girl I have to say
Its all about the way you talk to me 
Girl you know what I mean 
Said I want you there's nobody who can love me like you do
Nobody
Girl its what you do I'm so into you
Your the reason why its all about you

[Chorus: x2]

You
Your the reason why I stay true
Your the reason why I love you
Your the reason why its all about you

[Chorus: x4]
