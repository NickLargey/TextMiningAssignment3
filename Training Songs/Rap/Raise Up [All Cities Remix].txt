In the time of need
When the world is going through so many changes
So many ups and downs, so many obstacles
So much confusion
I take it upon myself as one of them new leaders of hip-hop
To make a change, and bring it to the forefront

USACome on and raise up
Take the flag, put it in the air, spin it like a helicopter
USACome on and raise up
This one's for you, uh-uh, this one's for who
Us, us, us, yes sir

USACome on and raise up
Take the flag, put it in the air, spin it like a helicopter

Us, us, us, yes sir

Say it loud, United States of America
Time to put it down and do it like this
Now fight for somethin that's worth it
I'm a country boy, never really cared before what was goin on
Now that it came a little closer to home
I got a couple more, but make somethin go uh-uh
Everybody get strapped
If you gon' get it let's get it if you ain't then get back
Big fella, who dat

All the people around the world that's why we get through that
Fort Jackson, Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune and David (damn!)
Pensacola, Parris Island, troops over here, Seals over there
Fort Dix, Fort Lee, Pearl Harbor (let me think)
The Army(ARMY), the Navy(NAVY), Air Force, Marines(RINES)
Green Beret, Navy Seals, New York Police
Even got me dressed in Army Fatigues, how ya love that

USACome on and raise up
Take the flag, put it in the air, spin it like a helicopter
USACome on and raise up

USACome on and raise up
Take the flag, put it in the air, spin it like a helicopter
USACome on and raise up

You remember them days y'all
When the teacher told us
About World War I and World War II, now the time has come
For us to rep our country
Wave the flag strong
And could somebody tell Mr. bin Laden
He got a lot of people lookin for him

My house, my home, my hood
My brother, my sister, my 'cause
Land of the free, home of the brave, it's the land I love
I had to bring it up, ask Petey Brown If I could change it up
Now I really got the whole world raisin up, come on
And sing with us

Raise up(Raise up!) Raise up(Raise up!) Raise up(Raise up!)
For that star-spangled banner

USACome on and raise up
Take the flag, put it in the air, spin it like a helicopter
USACome on and raise up
This one's for you, uh-uh, this one's for who
Us, us, us, yes sir

USACome on and raise up
Take the flag, put it in the air, spin it like a helicopter
USACome on and raise up
This one's for you, uh-uh, this one's for who
Us, us, us, yes sir

Thank you Petey Pablo
Cause if we don't stand for somethin, we're bound to fall for anything at all
Here reporting live from the front lines
Sending lots of love and prayers out to everybody from every corner of the Earth
Who lost a loved one, a homie, a friend
I'm talkin about a mother, father, sister, brother, even a cousin
On September 11th, we miss you, and we love you, and we will never, ever forget
Now

USACome on and raise up
Take the flag, put it in the air, spin it like a helicopter
USACome on and raise up
This one's for you, uh-uh, this one's for who
Us, us, us, yes sir

USACome on and raise up
Take the flag, put it in the air, spin it like a helicopter
USACome on and raise up
This one's for you, uh-uh, this one's for who
Us, us, us, yes sir
