Ay, baby baby

Lyrical finessing' without question is how I'm rocking this here flow
MC's move the crowd, but I'm the kind to spit lyrics for your soul
Recognize your inner greatness, stop being brain dead, nigga wake up
There's more to life than hustling hard daily trying to, get your cake up, we can't just
Keep blaming our failure and mess ups on another
When we speak, but don't seek to be true keepers of our brother
Tell me what's come of, our current, state of mind
Promoting foolishness through music leaving behind our children blind
Is we scared to actually grow up and be what we oughta
Give the people what they be needing so they can grow and move forward
It's like a trap without drugs or a jail cell nigga
Where keeping it real means living broke instead of excelling in living, who built this prison
Is it truly the ones we loving to blame
Who no where to be found when it's your own that's causing you pain
They say the music we pushing lack substance and ain't really worth listening, 
But I got a message in mine, hip-hop still living

Remember the music that used to encourage you through knowledge and wisdom
While at the same time still dropping boombastic bomb lyrics
Tunes that used to have you teary eyed 'cause it resonate with your suffering
Gave you strength to keep on fighting when this cruel world you had enough of
Gave you lessons you sometimes never find in those you confide
That you often find yourself using through your day to day life
Whatever happened to the soul once interwoven with rhythm
Authentic representation through open statements from within
Lyricism so frigid it'll give old man winter the shivers
But never sacrificing realism just for figgaz and women
Music with meaning that felt tangible though you know you can't see it
Promoted peace, unity and love and wasn't deemed made for weaklings
Those before us paved the path and set the standard to follow
Have we forgotten our responsibility to the youth of tomorrow
Nothing wrong with having fun, kicking back and chilling
But remember keep it real, baby, hip hop still living

People suffer from a lack of knowledge 'cause we ain't giving it nigga
To busy and caught up in nonsensical childish bickering nigga
Forget the gimmicks and imagery used as tools to get you loot
'Cause if you get rich off that then you can't say people feel you
Keep in mind when you rhyme how you wanna be remembered
An MC spitting in vain or authentic and genuine
When you speak is it for hoes or from the depths of your soul
Is your music for the love or the fame and zeros
Don't you want a legacy beyond time measured in glass
'Cause people's hearts you truly touched in ways they'll never forget
See as for me, I aim to spit lyrics that'll move a nation
Put love and truth in men heart destroying lies and hatred
Bringing changes many for years have only hoped and dreamed
Showing what it means to be a real and truth telling MC
Standing on principles breaking fictitious and fickle brittle images
Giving what many been waiting on, proof hip hop still living
