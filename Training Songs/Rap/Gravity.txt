Is it East and West? I ask you, or is it who's the best?
Well I don't know what is all this stress 
Ain't gotta beat the money man in a contest  
And so I think 'em 

Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Everybody want to be number one  
Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Rudebwoy you have to pay for the part
Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Everybody want to be number one  
Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Rudebwoy you have to pay for the part

We in this modern day Babylon with empty palms 
I think about my last dollar while you hollar for these rap songs 
I'm in my Eden when I rap about what I believe in 
No deceivin' Illuminati got that ass thinkin' 
Yo should I even rap or will I ever blow 
Or should I take the loot I got and call a cab and go 
'Cause now-a-days you can't smile up in your video 
I'm livin' off sour milk and cold cereal 
My moms stated that life is what you make it 
Hold everyday sacred I'm filled with such hatred 
'Cause a lot of niggas in the east don't represent 
And out west I saw a few that was fraudulent 
Hesitant to give a man a pound and step 
'Cause when your songs don't bump 
They look through that ass like fish net 
With no respect how could you look up in the mirror 
The world is lookin' shady and the futures no clearer 

Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Everybody want to be number one  
Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Rudebwoy you have to pay for the part
Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Everybody want to be number one  
Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Rudebwoy you have to pay for the part

Now as dem rumors dem spreadin' I want a single now-a-day 
Everybody want to the king but no man want to work 
Fight di system, dem have to multiply, now fi hands up in dem
Now I say reap is what you sow, deal is what you detonate 
But now your own broda would choke you for your wealth
'Member mi tell you don't make yuh head swell
I'm biggin' up mi bredgin and from cage they all well

Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Everybody want to be number one  
Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Rudebwoy you have to pay for the part
Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Everybody want to be number one  
Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Rudebwoy you have to pay for the part

It's time to invent the future 'cause there ain't nobody else 
Who can make it happen right so make it happen for yourself 
Instead of stressin' everything the next man got 
And trying to blow up the next mans' spot 
And always actin' like you got a whole lot 
When the fact is you're trying to be something you're not 
Yo if you don't cut it out you're gone be forgot 
'Cause the madness got to stop 
See life is kinda stressful, especially when you tryna be sucessful
So many twist and turns it's like you walkin' on a pretzel 
Yet and still I swear to build by any means 
Mr. Man and Non Ether represent for Elohim
And you don't stop 

Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Everybody want to be number one  
Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Rudebwoy you have to pay for the part
Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Everybody want to be number one  
Everybody want the same thing don't they 
Rudebwoy you have to pay for the part

Is it East and West? I ask you, or is it who's the best?
Well I don't know what is all this stress 
Ain't gotta beat the money man in a contest 
Mi sing again

Is it East and West? I ask you, or is it who's the best?
Well I don't know what is all this stress 
Ain't gotta beat the money man in a contest 
So den
