Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Ain't nobody rock it like this
Ain't nobody out there swift like this
Everywhere I go all I hear is this (you're all right)
Yes, I must confess
And it's true we keeps it fresh
Cause keepin' it fresh is my main interest
Just stayin' consistent flippin' them hits
Can't hate on this

[Bridge]
So hate if you wanna wanna
Cause that ain't gon' make me wanna
Gon' stop what I'm doin' to you
Co' ma beat go bu-mp, bu-mp
In the club they be jumpin', jumpin'
To the bass that's like pumpin', pumpin'
And the girls like the speakers thumpin'
Cause I told 'em to shake they humps

[Chorus:]
And any minute I'll be rollin' through
So get ready, so get ready
And any minute I'll be comin' through
So get ready, so get ready
Cause here I come; get ready, 'cause here I come
Comin' for ya, baby (get ready, 'cause here I come)
Takin' ya higher now (get ready, 'cause here I come)
Get ready, 'cause here I come

Ain't nobody rip it like me
F to the E-R-G-I-E
I rock it hardcore for my fly ladies
I rock it, yes indeed
I represent Los Angeles City
Hacienda Heights is the vicinity
Old school homies still rollin' with me
Money don't change me

[Bridge]

So hate if u gotta gotta,
Cause I gotta lotta, lotta
Fans that I holla, holla
I'm makin' it hot, hot
In the club they be jumpin', jumpin'
To the bass thats like pumpin', pumpin'
And the girls like the speakers thumpin'
Cause I told 'em to shake they humps

Oh!

[Chorus]

[will.i.am]
Will.i.am steppin' in just like a gentleman
Dressed to impress just to mess with them feminines
Buy you long island but my name ain't Gilligan
If I get you tipsy, do you mind if I fill him in?
How ya doin'? Yeah, yeah, what's the dealy?
You can call me Willy, you can call me Billy
You can call me whatever you'd like, no, really
Just don't call me up 'cause I got a milli-on dollars in the bank
Gotta be frank
Captain Hook chicks quick to make you walk the plank
Pirates of the Caribbean; I ain't bein' robbed for my dividends for not seein' it comin'
I keep movin' and runnin', I keep shootin' and gunnin'
I'm holdin it down, I ain't foolin' around
Will.i.am bring the heat in your town

[Chorus]
