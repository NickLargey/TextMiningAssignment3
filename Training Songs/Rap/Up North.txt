Aye yo I turned 21 bust 22 shots in the air
Like I don't care, I swear
want to represent all my peeps
Niggas maintain, shits all the same in the game

CHORUS: (Mighty Ha)
UP NORTH, DOO ON (???), BIG OOH, SOUTH SIDE!!!
(give my nigga love on a seven inch slide)
UP NORTH, DOO ON (???), BIG OOH, SOUTH SIDE!!!

(Chadio)
Lick a shot for my peeps Uptown (LICK A SHOT!!!)
Lick a shot for my peeps downtown (LICK A SHOT!!!)
Lick a shot, baby pop for all my real peeps
who make this here world go 'round
You see there's no short takin', no move fakin'
When you're the streets out makin' the bacon
Rakin' the doe is all a nigga know

The only difference now is I'm paid for my flow
But there's no right and wrong in the street
So keep it on (GRRR)
It's all about survival of the strong
(Yogi)
I got the pass like arkmonk
Kid pass the skunk
Comin' crazy strong like airborn is gum
All around the world, ghetto boys and girls
Rest in peace to my nigga Squrill
Niggas hustler as a major

(Yogi) 
Rollin' through the ghettos of New York City
Open up kids, here come the why-O-G
Straight to bring the buttahs from my peoples up north
Down south, back east, out west with force
Feelin' I'm a feelin' I could burst
One in the air make the whole crowd disperse
why-O-G baby, in it to win it
I send a slice of cake with a fuckin foul in it
(Chadio)
In a minute Ima huff and puff and blow chunks down
Down to the ground with my Rhythm Blunt sound
I'm hellbound, but who gives a f*ck now?
I shook the hand of death and gave him a smile

CHORUS: (Mighty Ha)
UP NORTH, DOO ON (???), BIG OOH, SOUTH SIDE!!!
(give my nigga love on a seven inch slide)
UP NORTH, DOO ON (???), BIG OOH, SOUTH SIDE!!!

(Yogi)
Let me know, let me know
If you represent your ghetto
Meadows of the mind anytime, anyplace
Reconize you if you in there
Home so on the love, love
All your family love
Peeps show you love
We gon' show you love
(Chadio)
More love than slugs in the air
Yeah, bent you down without a care
What's a fair, up in the ghetto
Word up, 'cause this ain't no sleepy type of meadow
Out in the wilderness, I'm skilled in this
Rap type shit, wordisborn I might flip

CHORUS: (Mighty Ha)
UP NORTH, DOO ON (???), BIG OOH, SOUTH SIDE!!!
(give my nigga love on a seven inch slide)
	*repeat 4X*
UP NORTH, DOO ON (???), BIG OOH, SOUTH SHIT!!!
UP NORTH, DOO ON (???), BIG OOH, SOUTH SHIT!!!
UP NORTH, DOO ON (???), BIG OOH, SOUTH SHIT!!!
