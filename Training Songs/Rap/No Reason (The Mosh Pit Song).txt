Times like this I don't know how to have fun
I think I'ma f*ck somebody up (f*ck 'em up)
You gon need someone to hold you up
What the f*ck

My city stand up
Stoppin people that got into my city and what
Copyin' me and the property, poppy ya jammed up
While I eat the cam bust
Don't mock me the brand's us
Strange music
The game shoot this right at the fakers
The game stupid with the claim
You can flip the change and name usage
Steppin' to me
Lick with the lane and you lose indefinitely
Ready for ruckers really we reppin' the B
Ah Ah
This the eviction notice
Missingly quickly and go get
Hit us and consider me and my nigga
Be sick and rogueish
Stop you ain't ready to brawl you can hang
Lock you too dead in the jaw you claim Strange
It ain't came
Kan City to jam with me
You damn sissy eat up a oxy
To stance tizzy in my pants with me
Never honor who bringing drama to the Don
If you continue now gonna do what I come to do
Guess what I'ma do

Start shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, our shit
For no reason, the hardest
For no reason, start shit
For no reason, mob shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, mosh pit

I just think you fucking with the wrong one (the wrong one tho!)
Times like this I don't know how to have fun (I don't know!)
I think I'ma f*ck somebody up, f*ck 'em up (gunna)
You gon need someone to hold you up (hold you up, huh)
What the f*ck

It's only one option
You gon need a doctor
I ain't talkin bout the one from Compton
Arms feet legs all gone like I'm Don Corleone
Hiring James Bond that's what I'm on
Remain calm but aware that I'm armed and dangerous
See Double X is known to gang with us
So hang tight I'm trying to get this right
You think cause I wrote a pop hit that I won't pop shit?
The fucks wrong with you poptarts
I pop cherries and popstars you popsicles is not hard
Poppin' on the top charts out the cop car
To remind yall you just rap and not guards
And I don't care who got bars
Because they don't acknowledge mine
So show me who got scars
Show me the greatest on the stage and the arena
Bet they point they finger up at the gunner and Tecca N9na

I just think you fucking with the wrong one
Times like this I don't know how to have fun
I think I'ma f*ck somebody up
You gon need someone to hold you up
What the f*ck

She will not leave a bunch of passes
I just wanna see that ass
Caribou Lou in my glass yeah

Somebody been showing ass again
I just started throwing some cash again
Pushing the crowd we harassing them
If you start making me mad

Start shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, our shit
For no reason, the hardest
For no reason, start shit
For no reason, mob shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, mosh pit
