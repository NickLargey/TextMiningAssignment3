I want you 
I can't get you off my mind
Ooh you turn me on-stay

So sorry you think it's wrong being here alone with me
I wish I could understand you and what you feel
You must feel something or you wouldn't have let me get this far
So don't be afraid just give in

If you let me have you just this once I promise never to want you anymore
'Cuz what's happening now feels so good
And the forbidden always arouses temptations
Come here let me have you 
Just stay
Ooh baby come on let me
