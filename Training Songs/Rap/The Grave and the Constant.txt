I used to wear dress blues, I used to get my cues from the dudes in
D.C. with the wing tip shoes.
My boss said it was Paris or Prison and the judge said: "son you better
Make a decision."

I chose the former because I heard it was warmer, April in Paris, hell
South of the border. They put me together, tougher than leather. Set
Me on your ass because they didn't know better.
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on, getting it on, getting it on. 
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on, getting it on, getting it on. 
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on, getting it on, getting it on. 
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on, getting it on, getting it on. 

I hold the fort left, right and center
The number running hardass punk, flygirl bender. Check the photo
Finish I'm in this to satisfy parole, not posing not playing the role,
See I got more gumbas than Bobby De Niro and if I was you I'd

Act like Nixon and Spiro. So drink your rock and smoke your pot
And chill where it's shady. I got more endurance than In-A-Gadda-
Da-Vida baby.
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on, getting it on, getting it on. 
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on, getting it on, getting it on. 
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on, getting it on, getting it on. 
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on, getting it on, getting it on.

I'm up to no good, with no place to go but down

I'm up to no good, with no place to go but down
I'm up to no good, with no place to go but down
I'm up to no good, with no place to go but down

Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on, getting it on, getting it on. 
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on, getting it on, getting it on. 
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on, getting it on, getting it on. 
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on, getting it on, getting it on.
