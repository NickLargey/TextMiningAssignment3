Yo, yo, wakin' up about ten kid
Jumpin' in the shower, peace about to make
(Moves and slide like greese)
What? I'm all about tecs and checks and nuff respect you front
I'm slammin' you like the lex
So now I'm out in the ninety-five
Rockin' that real nigga don't die
Guess down
(Drawers kani)
But yo I'm makin' a pit stop
Go and buy a box of glocks, til he rolled up and yo
(What up hobbes?, yo, remember that kid that we vicked
He made a half of mil for real, he brought about fo' bricks)
Yo, so now we connect doors, meet me at the airport
Tell golden arms maintain the fort
(get in touch with that west coast cali crab you stabbed, and meet me at the bitch lab)
So word up kid, we slid like a fat four to twelve bid and shit
(couldn't even rest, I need the vic)
And when I slept, I dream g's, son I need some (keys won't sell, call up son)
I heard pook and tyriq caught a beef over some real shit
(a fake nigga faked and they killed his click)
Gimme a minute and I'm with it (yo niggas done did it) rock your vest
(keep your whip tinted, so now we see him up in bojangles
Stranglin' a forty ounce, with ten g's worth of gold bangles)
Diamonds, what, all up in his face
(with his man's mace, medallions the size of dinner plates

Yo, he knew we knew him so we blew him
Took thirty g's worth of jewels of that nigga)
Do him! (so now I'm lampin' in my man's land)
Streets is hot like sand (jesus rollin' in my right hand)
Yup, you know the steezo black, got to go down like that (shallah)
Cigars (and ball hats)

Ninety-four, takin' niggas to war, yo, yo

What do you believe in? heaven or hell?
You don't believe in heaven cause we're livin' in hell
You don't believe in heaven cause we're livin' in hell
So it's your life
(What a chamber, fuckin' with mad strangers
Yeah, you know how it runs baby, straight up yo
Money clothes, designer hoes and shows y'all
That's how it goes whatever)
What do you believe in? heaven or hell?
You don't believe in heaven cause we're livin' in hell
(31st chamber y'all) so it's your life

Niggas ain't even know son, only half is sewed cash
They haven't yet sold their weight
(Question, shit is real, you know what I'm sayin')
Niggas think it's all about a real live allah
A little hundred dollars and that make you a man
Know what I'm sayin'
