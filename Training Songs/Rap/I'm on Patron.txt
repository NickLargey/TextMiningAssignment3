I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome (to tha dome)
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home
I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome (to tha dome)
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home

Hey what it do,
I'm on like a light switch
My wrist well froze up like a computer glitch
I'm drinkin' one fifty one karaboolu
Take nine gone get it jumpin' like a kangaroo
Is it yo birthday lets go on have a shot or two
My partner glue you put me on to somethin' new
Snuck in a gallon of lemonade from chic-fil-a
Mix it up with this a rockin' we gonna parlee

I'm lookin' for a hot girl that like ta ay baybaybay
Come out and play lets see ya shake it this way
That patron clear as day I'm on that hard
Gettin' lit wit my dogs havin' a party with these broads

I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome, (to tha dome)
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home
I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome (to tha dome)
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home

Gone and poppin' another bottle get this party to crackin'
All these barbie doll models make the champs start backin'
Five fifty's everywhere nothing cant depend it, hes on his fifth premiere
Seven it ain't even eleven
Thug boss slim thug drinkin' gpo grey goose patron and orange juice
Po' me some mo'

Now box and Poppy Joe just ordered the rose mo
Drunkin' dueces to my partner how I see 'm big go
I'm loaded like a full clip
Leanin' like a sinkin' ship
Lit up like a christmas tree
How much throwed up can I get
Stone and lil'c
Bringin' out the jagger bomb
If I get pulled over DJ Jonny can pay my bond off

I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome, (to tha dome)
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home
I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome(to tha dome)
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home

I keep bumpin' into people say man my bad
I'm intoxicated a tad and the DJ had to be
Miskin' mike and scad my family gettin slammed

Beans and corn bread just bought around another damn grand
Man I'm so throwed I can't think
Who the hell been puttin' they lips on my drink
What the hell the waitress doin' wit my change
Maybe some red bull will help me sober up
Matter fact mix it wit this grey goose in my cup
I can barely stand up I'm about to throw up
If you cant roll with the big dogs go hang wit the pups

I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome, (to tha dome)
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home
I'm on patron I just took some shots to tha dome (to tha dome)
I'm gone, so gone, so yo can I get a ride home
