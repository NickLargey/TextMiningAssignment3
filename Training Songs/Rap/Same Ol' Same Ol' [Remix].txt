Yeah, yeah mama, we done this before
It's the same ol', same ol', same ol', same ol'
Yeah, yeah mama, we done this before
It's the same ol', same ol', same ol', same ol'

First time you said that you were leaving
I cried ouz you said, you didn't need me
But the second that I started seeing somebody else
That's when ya had to come back to me

Gone continued moving now I'm better
I moved on to someone who would treat me better
But now you're tripping 'cuz you see, I ain't all by myself
And you won't let be me boy

Why you wanna call me on my phone?
Every time you see another boy in my door
Oh boy, you shoulda thought of that before
Now you wanna come home when you're alone
It's the same ol', same ol' sad scenario

Every time you say, you wanna be solo
Oh boy, you shoulda never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know it's the same ol', same ol'

You thought that you could keep on doing
This to you me like I won't keep on moving
I admit it for a minute, you was having your way
What can I say? I wasn't over you
Things change, you and me, best forget it
(No more games)

And no more playing, I admit it
Don't you get it boy
You take it back tryin' to say like it was yesterday?
But boy we're through
'Cuz you, ain't never really ever cared about me
'Cuz if you ever really cared about me

It wouldn't take another man
To make you understand that you want me
(You want me)
'Cause if you really ever cared about me
You wouldn't have a broken heart, allow me
And now you wanna come back and call me up tonight

Why you wanna call me on my phone?
Every time you see another boy in my door
Oh boy, you shoulda thought of that before
Now you wanna come home when you're alone
It's the same ol', same ol' sad scenario

Every time you say, you wanna be solo
Oh boy, you shoulda never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know it's the same ol', same ol'

I'm tired of the same ol' games and the same ol' lies
The I'm sorry babies and the lame alabies
Your love had me blind, like Stevie you made me wonder
Was it the love cast spell you had me under

You got me, already she had me
Now that I'm gone, I know that your missing me madly
Now the tables turned no more you and me
Roll with your boys, I'ma roll with P.Y.T

Why you wanna call me on my phone?
Every time you see another boy in my door
Oh boy, you shoulda thought of that before
Now you wanna come home when you're alone
It's the same ol', same ol' sad scenario

Every time you say, you wanna be solo
Oh boy, you shoulda never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know it's the same ol', same ol'

Why you wanna call me on my phone?
Every time you see another boy in my door
Oh boy, you shoulda thought of that before
Now you wanna come home when you're alone
It's the same ol', same ol' sad scenario

Every time you say, you wanna be solo
Oh boy, you shoulda never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know it's the same ol', same ol'

Why you wanna call me on my phone?
