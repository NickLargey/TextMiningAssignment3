Pull up and I set up shop
She drinking that shit by the shots
Stunt on the block, same spot
Pull up and count up the knots
Niggas out here straight pie
If you hanging with a group of guys
Better make sure they gon' ride
I pull up like ¿cómo estás?
None of your traps exist, nigga
Selling that snort to your bitch, nigga
That ain't making my dick bigger
Count it up and drop it on that fist, nigga
Look at your unc with that itch
Pop that, a nigga won't twitch
No matter where, poppin' on Ferc and once you present
They gon' say "I ain't said that shit man"

30 rounds and the clip clear
Make you and the Draco french kiss
Can't stand a dirty ass kitchen
Broke up with my mistress
Took the fork and I bent it
Had a Panamera on Emmits
Five wood issue, pretty
Still a harder way like Penny
Skrrt, yeah, that is the sound
I'm scraping the bowl
Momma depend on me, and I got kids
I gotta make it back home
One phone call will get you killed
I ain't even gotta scroll
Had apartment with no furniture
But at least I had a stove
Turned old nut to whitewater
Er'body get the splash on
Other day I walked into Gucci
Told them folks that I'm back home
Got the city on my backbone
Black on like sea bone
Money calling, check the ringtone
Phil Jackson with the rings on
Yeah
