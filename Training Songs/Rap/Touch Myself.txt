Oh I, ohh baby
Oh I, ohh baby

I won't be afraid to touch myself
It's all right (to touch myself)
I said it's alright (to touch myself)
I don't think it?s wrong to touch yourself
Ain't nothin wrong with making it feel good

Baby it's been awhile since my lovin 
And I wanted to know if you missed me 
Since last November you were my contender
And then you played another girl in December

Why do you treat me like you do
Go away and play me a fool
I just want to get close to you
But now all I'm going to do is

Hook
(verse 2-Total)
Ohhh baby since you've been away
I thought that this was okay
I needed a soft touch 
And I knew I could do it right
And so I touch myself ohhhhhh

Bridge (T-Boz)
Hook
(Missy Elliott)
Know listen up
Since you been gone working on the pump
You like a basketball star cause you a playa
You get girls like killers by a slaya
Listen up playaz cause us ladies ain't afraid
To get played by our selves
A nice smooth touch straigh up my stomach
A little ecstacy never heart nobody
