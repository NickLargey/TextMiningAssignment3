I remember the way
You used to love me
I remember the days
You used to love me

You don't appreciate the time
I put into this love affair of ours, baby
I couldn't let you walk around
Thinking it's alright to let me down, I remember

I remember the way
You used to love me
I remember the days
You used to love me

I gave you all my precious love
And anything you wanted from me
You didn't hear me callin' out
Callin' for your warm affection, after all this time

You can't deny what I'm feelin', it's real
And I stood right by your side
Went through all the hurt and pain
Then you turned and walked away

I remember the way
You used to love me
I remember the days
You used to love me

Oh, Remember
Can't give up on the way you used to give it to me, give it to me
What a feeling, it's so real

I remember the way
You used to love me
I remember the days
You used to love me

You didn't hear me callin' out
And that's not what love's about (no, no)
I remember
You used to love me everyday,
Now your love has gone away
I remember, I remember

I remember the way
You used to love me
I remember the days
You used to love me
