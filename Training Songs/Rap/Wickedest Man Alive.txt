[Queen Latifah]
Mercifully  mercifully  mercifully massacre  Naughty By Nature 
Through it ever time  comin at a dance 
My man Treacherous MC  go on  let the saxophone man play a little 
Make it lovely 

[Treach]
You got beef  well what we do  talk to the bunny  sunny 
He's the man  Bugs the thug wit the money 
Funny that you should mention as my family  they covered 
Wassup to my cousins and my sisters and my Warner Brothers 
Birds of a feather, flap and fold and be together 
No matter what your whatever, endeavor, find us better 
You mean he, she, them, him, those and others 
Let's kill two ducks in one, pluck, initiate the trouble 
For those who disagree, I maybe feel the need to front it 
Show me your whole entire crew, two shoes and I'ma run it 
Do you want it? Maybe so, but just know, we're rolling spreads 
You claim you want it but you need it just about as much as a hole in ya head 
This is a flow-er show, a product float a while ago 
With a new swing, I think so, bring it, sing it, act like you know 
And if ya don't, you won't by the time this track is done 
Queen Latifah the sire, give em some, come 

[Chorus: Queen Latifah]
Every time they coming at the dance, what you know 
It's time for rum, man, yeah man 
Every time they coming at the dance, what you know 
It's for jamming, g'yeah know? 
Every time they come, you know they come without the flow 
Soon we have a single, they're the quickest out the door 
The wickedest man, the wickedest man in dance hall, well ya know 
I'm out for rum, come! 

[Treach]
118th Street keeps production, conjunction junction nothin 
Huh, what's your function? 
I don't mean to be blunt or front, true or rude 
How can he diss? Your honey dip looks like a honey dude 
So keep it to yourself, greedy when you're in good health 
So before you come and try the Treach, try yourself 
'cause I ain't having it, remember act like you know 
And if ya can't act jack, you best find the door 
I hate to think a trade, I slot another, see ya gator 
A stam yada, peace!, sasalama, lick em later 
Yeah, you don't have a chance, but I see ya next 
This track is KayGee's baby and he named it "Def" 
I'm smoking in em, it's like chimneys, I ain't friendly 
F*ck your fendy, I'm swinging for your diet kidney 
Pimples are simple to pop, I want temple's op 
Then slop your rock wit more flopping than a waffle spot 
The wickedest man alive, I am what I am and I'm 
Damn good to be a no good, hooded by 
The wiggle in the middle, simple to party thumps 
They call me the wickedest man alive, make em jump 

[Chorus]

[Treach]
Getting it and hitting wit it a old fashion weapon when you're slipping, I got time 
Try to stand and get rammed like a Stop sign 
The bad just got worse within one verse 
Put the shitty verse and reverse and this fella's first 
Wrecking is second, so back with ya wacked disc 
For candle after candle and still couldn't wax this 
I be the wickedest while you're still the wackest 
I need wallpaper to list what your track miss 
This is a double decker from the head wrecker, neck and head checker 
Check the check and who's def? Who's left ya? 
Standing back canning ya, plan ta stay back 
I'm down wit Kay's tracks, black, this is the payback, lay back, jack 
I have you every which way but loose, blowing your sound proof 
That's happening to me, your thanks for giving a neck noose 
This comes naturally, all day and night 
I make a party of all lefty's leave screaming out "Alright!" 
Talking bout needing a lot more work than you had 
Twelve years, twelve hundred, twelve inches and sold one 
Who's getting done? Who's swifter? Who's badder? 
You be able to get down wit some help in a step ladder 
This is another song, we check out the style that I've 
Picked and rip, I be the wickedest man alive 

[Queen Latifah]
