And it don't stop
Uh, yeah
Word
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Co-come on down

Y'all mythological niggas is comical
The astronomical is coming through like the flu bombing you
And embalming in your crew too
With the musical mystical magical, you know how I do
With word attack skills and vocabulary too (uh)
Come to hit you with this Edition, it's all brand New (yeah)
You're through, I'm interplanetarian like Doctor Who (uh, who? who?)
So who? (who?) (Word)
Born to get tripped on, word is bond
I'm kicking rhymes 'til the A.M. vultures swarm
Not Quincy, but I'm back on the block and not selling crack
Accompanied with the fat funk flows and tracks
So what you saying black, with all that yackedy yack?
My artifacts can't be beat with bats
I'm saying, I eat up everything up on the menu
And bend you and send you swaying, to be continued

The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya

Spur of the moment opponents is suspects (ha)
Caught up in precipitation reign of the tech- (pow)
'Niques, I speak my concepts freak
The ichi ni san shi funk figures of speech
Now that shit is in the open, I'm open, hoking, scoping
Waiting for the next nigga to get opened on
And break him down like a organic compound
That's the weight of the world as the Earth goes round (round and round)
Now, how the f*ck you sound
I represent my clique, like a four-pound
You better pack your levodopa medication for the shaking
Meditation from the earth, that quaking shit that we be making
Never faking I gets down for my crown clown
Shaking the membrane of Encyclopedia Brown (word)
Freaking the funk in any throw down (throw down)
While you sustained to the sounds, up in you (ah)

The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya

I comes down breaking ground
So back up off of me and sit your ass down
Now when I'm on the microphone I roam through zones
But don't be trying this shit at home (no, no, no)
No matter what race, creed, color him or her
I comes cleaner than Jeru and Damaja amateur
As chronical facial disorders occur
I'll assassinate your character's caliber
I channel my anger, from the double edged banger (banger)
And turn into the microphone strangler
So stop tryna see where your eyes can't follow
Say goodnight to the world and goodbye to tomorrow
You rave and cuss so it's a must you get bust (bust)
We're not to be fucked with, Toys Ain't Us
For eternity, through infinity (yeah) (uh)
I eternally, get in you (uh)

The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya

What you folks want? Yeah
We got the funk so come on down
What you folks want? Yeah
We got the funk so come on down
What you folks want?
We got the funk so come on down
