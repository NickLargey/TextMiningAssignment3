Yo, can I get a witness
Brothers don't want ta be on my hit-list
Time to kick positivity with the quickness
I'm breakin 'em somethin off slick
Which ______
Now what is all this, am I _____
I'm not havin it
It's time to chill, G 
I know ya feel me
So bob ya heads back and forth wit the swiftness cause it's really
Bless the visitor so please stand
These men are Hieroglyphics
And yes that's the reason
That you're feeling like ya do don't attempt to simp
Be true to what ya know
Forget about pimps and limps
Close your eyes and think in spite of how we go right
Of wrong situations long, when you can't even think tight
And my view should be
A place just for the crews and g's
face to face
It ain't no losing sleep, be
A million niggas havin good times
We pass to Del, makin mail
Kickin good rhymes
The doors are open, so you're welcome to do biz quick tricks
Risin, surprisin, and down 6-6-6
If ya need my help
Below lets takin a limb
Better than them, yes I am
First Sermon I'm the man

(Chorus)

We havin church today
ehmmm, we havin church today
Lift your hands, to the man, don't be shy
We're havin church today
Oh, Git out your seats, havin church today
Clap your hands we're havin church today
Lift your hands, to the man, don't be shy
We're havin church today

Verse two
And ain't no such thing as a curfew
Cause when you're chillin on this vibe
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you
Relaxin, kickin and maxin
Strictly no packin, listenin to the sax, and
Takin time to the hole, is just another hobby troop
And plus I'm juiced, and Mike G is bringin barbecue
Sparin ribs
There it is, whoomp
Ain't no harm in movinU your arms
And feelin the groove
Bringin a ting-a-ling to your body. Move
And if ya can't
We're laying hands all over you
Close your eyes, and repeat after me
It ain't the power comin from pastor Snupe Lee
Phesto test
Your abilitys as you're an usher
Hush ya
Wit the silence of the spirits
Than rush ya
Wit your hand stand on the grand non-ficition
And hurry up so we can do the benediction

(Chorus)

Extra Prolific's havin church today
Souls of Mischief havin church today
Lift your hands, to the man, don't be shy
We're havin church today
Em, Casual's havin church today
Yes the Shamen's havin church today
Lift your hands, to the man, don't be shy
We're havin church today

We're havin church today, 'em
My man Del's havin church today
Lift your hands, to the man, don't be shy
We're havin church today
Oh, git out your seats havin church today, 'em
Yes we all havin church today
Lift your hands, to the man, don't be shy
We're havin church today

Oh, what's going down...
