[Chorus: x2 Ludacris]
If you a lame motherfucker, get yo' ass out!
I'm from the A, I came to party 'til I pass out!
So if you with me and you tipsy throw your fist up!
If you got diamonds and they shining throw your wrist up!

[Ludacris]
Hey hey
It's Luda Luda get it right I'm Mr. Money Machine
And I'm steady looking for two women I can come in between
You can catch me chilling up in the cut but I'm always ready for action
I'm stunt, like Jackie Chan and lay low, like {?} Jack-son
Maxing and relaxing, haters, do they really want to test me man
I got an arsenal waiting, do they really want to catch me man
No, I, don't, think, so
I've, got killers on the pay-roll if there's a, problem then say-so
I, make dough until there's none left
I run with plenty gangs that's holding things
And rearrange your frame in one breath
So to keep on breathing I suggest you take this beating
'Tis the season for bleeding and we've been looking for a reason

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Hey hey
Come holla at me, I'm a star, I got the hood on smash
You know me! My whole car smell like a wood shop class
I point 'em out like her, her, that girl with the mouth
Plus you and your friends
Let me show you some whips that don't come out 'til the year of 2010
So I'm flocking 'em in, 'til the drop top is rocking again
Boy I got it locked, if you think not, then you'll get popped in the chin
And I'm clocking these ends, my record sales are blocking 'em in
Gotta thank those blessed to walk the streets to those that's locked in the pen
My entourage is game faces, mean mugging, mean mugging
Now the media is convinced that we thuggin', we thuggin'
Momma told me grow up to be something, be something
I went diamond with this album so we bucking, we bucking

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I'm so far ahead it's only RIGHT for you to hate on me man
When I'm pushing 90 by myself up in the H.O.B. lane
They trying to figure how many mo' women that I can take on my plane
Being one of the few rappers responsible for changing the game
Now desperate artists trying to sue but they just making some claims
Can't get in the spotlight for nothing and it just makes 'em insane
That's why some of the niggas resort right back to baking that 'caine
And selling it off to junky monkeys who keep baking they brain
As they grow older they'll be feeling a lot of aching and pain
So right at the head they might as well just be aiming that thing
And you ain't helping the process out by always caking these dames
But it is hard giving up the place where they be shaking they things

[Chorus]
