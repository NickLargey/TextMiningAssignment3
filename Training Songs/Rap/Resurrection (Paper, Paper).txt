Better yet sustained the flurry
Hide in the fury,

Don't mean you've died out of my life,

Tie down
And child hood scars,
Crackhead cause niggas I don't know

And here we are, steady we roll out over you
When it's over it's over,
For the soldiers who hear me, that'll
Get me in trouble
Can I be closer, stay right near me
Here we are, ain't no stars, uh huh
Can I get drunk off in some bar,
Without some haters sayin
"Who do you think you are?!"
When I'm sober, start jumping in it to win it

When you niggas get serious, let a nigga know,
Maybe then we can roll
Nigga bad to the bone,
But I sure don't click with hoes
And no busters, haters, or hoes when
They poppin up at my door

And if he flossing cash and jewelry,
Rip it off his ass,
Keep walking fast

Time after time,
Everywhere I look,
Everywhere I turn,
Niggas talking bout death
Like a nigga can't dream of nothing else,
But a lil' bit of wealth
Trying to help they self,
And I really can't blame you,
Cause I do the same too
Man do what you gotta do
But what I'ma do is keep protecting my cheddar fool
Ain't none of y'all niggas do it better, oh
And I'm ahead of you and y'all hate it,
Only the real thugs keeping it raw
Gripping that heat tight,
Living that street life
Nigga I'ma let it fool round and get war
Niggas is plotting that 2-11,
That's why I got heat for armageddon
Picture lay on his knees and I'm begging,
Nigga better shoot me and send me to heaven
F*ck all the drama, I'ma just blast,
Hollow point tips off in that ass
Tha slicka the nigga
That's pulling the trigga
Is the nigga that's standing up last
Counting this cash,
Still doing this mash
Blowing much weed
As we watch you bleed
Nigga got killed for the love of the cheese
Now you can't do shit cause your 6 feet deep
Fucking with lay

Even myself I could die today
I could lie, but hey it ain't worth it,
Shit, ain't none of us here to stay
I'ma hold my ground,
And I'ma lace my boots
So when its time to shoot, then that's it
Screaming out mo thug in this bitch,
And bone thugs in this bitch, nigga

Four other niggas that I run with,

But not anymore (uh uh, no, no)
And ain't a damn thing come easy,
A lot of planning, bus rides, and (eazy)

Smoke out with some hoes,

Righteous ones,
