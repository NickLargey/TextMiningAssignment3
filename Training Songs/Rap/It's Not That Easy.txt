Was it me?
Was it you?
Was it all the little things that I didn't do?
Try to move on, but I can't
No I can't imagine being someone else's man

girl I tried, I tried a million times
To get you off my mind
Its not that easy no
Not that easy
Don't you know how hard it is for me
To smile and say goodbye
It's not that easy no
It's not that easy

its not over
Not for me
Used to have so much faith and I still believe
You're my weakness
You're my strength
And one without the other
Just don't make no sense

girl I tried, I tried a million times
To get you off my mind
Its not that easy no
Not that easy
Don't you know how hard it is for me
To smile and say goodbye
It's not that easy no
It's not that easy

its not as easy for me
As it is for you
Let me talk about it
Its not that easy
Listen
What am I meant to do without your love, your love
What am I meant to do without your love
Oh what am I meant to do without your love, your love
What am I meant to do without your love

girl I tried, I tried a million times
To get you off my mind
Its not that easy no
Not that easy
Don't you know how hard it is for me
To smile and say goodbye
It's not that easy no
It's not that easy

what am I meant to do without your love, your love
What am I meant to do without your love
What am I meant to do without your love, your love
What am I meant to do without your love

don't you know how hard it is for me
To smile and say goodbye
It's not that easy no
It's not that easy
