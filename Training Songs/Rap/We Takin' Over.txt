Oh, oh, oh DJ Khaled!
Konvict Music
We the best (yeah) we takin' over, listen!

Aye, aye started in Atlanta, then I spread out wit' it
South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi
On to North Carolina, Philadelphia and Virginia
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn. holla at me
Me in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland daddy
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett
Drop six-fo', three-wheel then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches
Glock fo'-fifty, blow your head off wit' it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it
King got the crown then sped off it wit' it
Say you need bricks, I said I get it

If you want to, we can supply you
Got enough work, to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you, unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground
'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time (Triple C, Black flag, we rich)

(Listen!) Boss, it's what I does
I get money 'erry day, 'erry day I does that Benz,
is how I ride, black flag on the left, two hoes and ride, you better, move!
A-K all day get shot up like Shyne, that's on my neck
I'm big like Diddy damn it, I'm wit' it
Khaled we did it, Biggie of my city
Please no fitted, f*ck it, I'm too pretty
The brother get brain, stupid, I'm silly
Money that come, runnin' like water
Mommy so hot, damn it, she gorgeous
Miami on fire, you better be cautious
Might get shot on the porch of your fortress
Now they see that you know I'm from Port City
I run this, Rick Ross it's boss shit

'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time (Cribs Mania)
Said we takin' over, one city at a time (BX, TS nigga)

(Listen!) Brat, when you see Crack,
Better duck like the mac gotta ease past, nigga what shit
I don't give f*ck, I run these streets y'all talk that shit, I want that beef
I'm a tell you like a g told me they'll come back quick if a nigga O.D.
"Cash rule everything around me" I'm Y-S-L, Versace
You could see me in that Porsche G-T
Comin' down Sunset, sittin' on D's
Feelin' like 'Pac, All Eyez On Me
Fresh bandanna when I'm blowin' mad trees
Nigga please, I spit crack every verse a key
Some say Khaled, some say Khaleed
Twelve years down and I'm finally free, crack!

If you want to, we can supply you
Got enough work, to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you, unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground
'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time

(Listen!) Birdman daddy, I'm number one
Nigga came at me wrong so we got him done
Fuckin' with the fam', I'm a give him some
Spent that corner, he didn't run
Sunday had a whole church singin' a song
"Why'd they have to send my baby home?"
Fuckin' with some niggas, that paper long
Been a "G" in the game now my son on the throne

I am the beast, feed me rappers or feed me beats
I am untamed, I need a leash
I am insane, I need a shrink
I love brain, I need a leech
Why complain on easy streets?
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak
And I like, my sprite Easter pink
And my wrist match the par but the mula's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust your Medulla
That's a bullet hole, it is not a tumor
Red light, red light stop your rumors
I stay on track like a box of Pumas
Now just rock rock rock with Junior
I am the little big Kahuna, ya dig ('Cause we takin' over, one city at a time)
