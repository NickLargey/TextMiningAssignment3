Monica, Twista, Twista, you already know

It's the 17th, one week before the day you were born
I been makin' big plans just for over a month
Tryin' to make this the best birthday you ever had
Show you that you're my baby

Damn, all this strain got me feelin' somethin's wrong
Pulled up to my gate, they keep sayin', ?He's gone?
Found envelopes in between my door
Biggest day got me panickin', what the hell this letter gonna read?

Hell no, you say you don't want it no more
Hell no, you say you can't give me what I want
Hell no, how you just gonna leave
When I stayed wit you through hard times and you cheated?

Hell no, I hate to say it but I need it
Hell no, God, please talk to me
Hell no, your so called love was so deep when it told you
You should run far and not give a damn about me

How could you leave me when you see me desperately
In need of what we had before? How could you leave home
I cried so many times but never did it cross my mind
To think but let it go, how could you leave home

Didn't even ever see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road before, how could you leave home
How could you leave me, baby? Please my heart is beating
For the beat we had before, how could you leave home

Now I need you, wanna laugh, wanna stand
Wanna get just one more chance just to see you
All my friends, all my kin say, ?Mo, just let that end?
But I breath you

In the driveway, I found pictures on the ground of our first date
I never in a million years thought this would be me
I'm trapped in love with somebody that no longer thinks
I'm somebody special, look at me

Hell no, you say you don't want it no more
Hell no, you say you can't give me what I want
Hell no, how you just gonna leave
When I stayed wit you through hard times and you cheated?

Hell no, I hate to say it but I need it
Hell no, God, please talk to me
Hell no, your so called love was so deep that it told you
You should run far and not give a damn about me

How could you leave me when you see me desperately
In need of what we had before? How could you leave home?
I cried so many times but never did it cross my mind
To think but let it go, how could you leave home?

Didn't even ever see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road before, how could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby? Please my heart is beating
For the beat we had before, how could you leave home?

Monica and Twista, y'all

I remember when you said I couldn't get none of that
Then I remember when you let me hit it from the back
I remember we was young and sprung
And steady talkin' on the phone and how we both kept runnin' back

To each other, we were always together forever to the end
I don't really know why I froze up
Plannin' for a weddin' but gettin' married, it's scary
Now I got you cryin' 'cause a nigga didn't show up
Can't really tell you why but I'm Twista from the Chi
And I'm dyin' inside 'cause I know I really want you

So for leavin' one day, I will have to give you the answer, girl
But right now, I can't tell you why I left, girl
Sweet personality and good sex, girl
Fear will take a man life, you suppose to be my wife
Goodbye, hope to see you in the next world

You was all up under me, actin' like you was so in love
I was talkin' 'bout you but thug nigga, what you runnin' for?
Cop wit you in the Benz, you the first one seen on the block wit it
Took you to the club, showed you how to 'Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It'

You was bold when you wanna get some of that
When you wanna hit the hole like a running back
Then you left, now you wanna come runnin' back
Hell no, nigga, I don't wanna hear none of that

I know you quick, betta spit that shit to so
All I ever wanna say to you is
How could you leave me when you?
How could you leave me when you?

How could you leave me when you see me desperately
In need of what we had before? How could you leave home?
I cried so many times but never did it cross my mind
To think but let it go, how could you leave home?

Didn't even ever see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road before, how could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby? Please my heart is beating
For the beat we had before, how could you leave home?

All the women I caught you with
Still I didn't leave but I didn't forget
All those women I caught you with
Maybe I didn't leave but I didn't forget

All those women I caught you with
But I didn't leave but I didn't forget
All those women, women I caught you with
I didn't leave but I didn't forget
