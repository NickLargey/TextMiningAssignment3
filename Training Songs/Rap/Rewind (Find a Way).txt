[Chorus]
Restart, retrigger, press rewind and you just come again
Reset, reprogramme, wheel it back and you just come again
Restart, retrigger, press rewind and you just come again
Reset, reprogramme, wheel it back and you just come again

Funny how, when in love, everything your baby does has meaning
Then it ends, love is spurned and then your sanity returns you seething
What do you do?
You scream you shout you fall about, you do whatever suits ya
Yourself control is left to doubt
Revenge it seems so right
You weep you wail you tell your tale
To anyone who'll listen
Then when you find the time to chill, discover life is out there still, so

Find a way to start it again 
Bring it back and start it over
Find another way to begin
Fade to grey and turn it over
Find a way to start it again
Bring it back and start it over, again, again, again 

Most of us in our lives, made a choice and sacrificed our feelings
And who's to say, that you're okay, when you feel like the layers of your soul are peeling 
Oh and I know, all you want is solitude, 'cause you're ain't in the mood 
But you gotta find a way to start again, so

[Chorus]

Oh and I know, all you want is solitude, 'cause you're ain't in the mood
But you gotta find a way to start again

[Chorus]
