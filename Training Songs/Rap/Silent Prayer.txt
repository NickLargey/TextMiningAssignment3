I send to you, my silent prayer
Before I sleep at night
I send to you, my silent prayer
Baby, so you'll be all right

Every moment a think of you
I just can shake up my dreams
I read the paper and watch the news
I don't know what it means

When you do what you got to do
You must know that I'm down with you
Every breath that I take
I hope and I pray sweet baby
Baby, we're okay
Silent prayer

[Chorus:]
Silent prayer (silent prayer)
Silent prayer (silent prayer)
Silent prayer (I send to you my silent prayer)

I hold a picture of a golden sunset
And I'll take you're hand (take my hand)
We're gonna walk down that promise road
Just like we planned (just like we planned)

Cause I know what I'm gonna do
Just as soon as I'm back with you
Every breath that I take,
I hope and I pray sweet baby
Baby, we're okkay
Silent prayer

[Chorus:]
I send to you my silent prayer
I send to you my silent prayer
I send to you my silent (baby) prayer (every hour)
My silent prayer

[Chorus:]
