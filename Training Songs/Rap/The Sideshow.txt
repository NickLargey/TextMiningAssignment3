The sound you are hearing 
Is a relatively new one
Who is making the sound?
Who? Ask yo mama

Clap your hands until the beat drops
Clap your hands until the beat drops
Come on, my breakdown

Knowledge is born when the DJ gets loose
You never see him sweat but produce the def juice
Here in full effect, known for causin a wreck
Try the gas but he manifest what I express
He's a pinnacle, that means he's bigger than y'all know
The murder weapon X mic checks the fly flow
Everywhere we go, we, everywhere we go, we, every-every
Everywhere we go, we light it up like the sideshow

Paow! 
Boom straight to the cash
Now, now, now this is how it's started
All eyes on the DJ
(Damn it) Can't stop the needle, won't stop the needle
Can't stop the needle (?)

Get loose y'all, get off the wall for real
A scientist is on the mix, it ain't time to chill
You get beat up from the feet up if you trying to flex
With a flick of the wrist, the ball is a bloody mess
Put the needle to the wax, so don't let it react
When the party is packed like it's about to explode
Everywhere we go, we, everywhere we go, we, every-every
Everywhere we go, we light it up like the sideshow

Paow! Paow! Like a maniac, and you wanna know why?
'Cause I'm playing my music too loud
Yeah

The way that I see it, you ain't taking nobody out
Intelligence is power, that ain't what you about
We be causing much damage in the place to be
On the shrank like a tank, on the m-i-c
On the scene with a gangster lead
The one man band reaches the fans with gasoline
Let the beat drop until the dust clears
DJ's fear him, when they see him, they say "I'm outta here"
The closer you get to feel the effect
My DJ earns respect while you stack the creds
So don't front or you'll be sleeping on your death bed
'Cause flying images and memories roll through your head
That's what you get when you mess with true pros
Going toe to toe, blow for blow, now you know
Everywhere we go, we, everywhere we go, we, every-every
Everywhere we go, we light it up like the sideshow
Everywhere we go, we, e-e-every, e-e-every, every
Everywhere we go, we light it up like the sideshow
