I rode in on a lightwave
I never been a good slave
I kissed the queens of Zanzibarâ€‹
I even blew up the Death Star (haha)
My niggas is all wizards
Paradise Sportif shit
We expandin' out
Let me show you how

Quazarz, born on a gangster star
Quazarz, born on a gangster star
Quazarz, born on a gangster star
Quazarz, born on a gangster star

Robed in rareness
Money stared at us
Style married us
God carried us
Golden chariots
Rose interiors
Glowin' serious
Known nefarious
Know who family is
Fans erroneous
Gang so glorious
Pop and poured up
2 girls, I'm wonderful
They say I'm a handful
My bands is animals
My crown got hella jewels
Born to never lose
Wave set to cruise
Brazilian avenues
Paris, copped the shoes
Please let him choose
My don't's and do's
Made from galaxies
Stolen legacies
Fulfilled the prophecy
Time's a lottery
To dine's a fantasy
To shine for all to see

He was born on this gangster star
