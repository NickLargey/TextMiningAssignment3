[Little Ceas]
How you figure that your team can affect my cream
Gold and platinum. Black since I stepped on the scene
Kn, I mean, peep the scene,
Jacooze full of women.
She hittin' me and him and him much love like Wimbeldon
While niggas screamin' killa
I'm overseas in my villa
Wit my masseuse struttin' illa
Frank switch the plan. Cock the Lexus Lan
See cutta, Rockafella 4 hundreds and better
Little Ceas push threes with fives in his eyes
Not that I'm goin' cry for Mary Blige
I die for my niggas packin' steel
Chicken heads with sex appeal
Reveal sexual acts up in Capone's Ac
The Chocolate Dime watch the Mafia shine
Girls git your own, can't touch a dime of mine

And if you don't stop, then we won't stop
Continuously to git (git money)

You can be as good as the best of them
But as bad as the worst
So don't test me (get money)
You better move over (get money)

[Little Kim]
Big Momma, keys in Tiawana
Some call me Donna Karan or Armani
Gats for the poonani
For brown nose pussy crushers
Cap peelin' others, Ignorant motherfuckers.
Drive a Benz or Miata. This honey's got a
Sweet peniata, Six shotta
Little Kim the Black Erika Caine -in
Who remains in Chanel frames and
Animals of all kind.
Russian Fendi sables
With matchin' pool tables
Read the Label, MAFIA
Admirin' my shoes by Gucci
I be eatin' sushi, playin' with my coochi
Countin' lucci. Nigga I got banks to rob
Convertible Saabs. I'm married to the mob

Biggie

[B.I.G.]
Frank White the desperado
Used to rock the all black Movado
The all black Eldorado.
All that and a bottle of Don P
Niggas can't harm me, I keep the army.
Is Brooklyn in the house? Without a doubt
I'm the rapper with clout everybody yap about
Check it out, guns I bust em
Problems with my wife, don't discuss em
Coups and lier jets I lust them
Finger prints I dust them, recent address
Stuck you for your stash in your pissy mattress
Your mom's a actress. 
Didn't wanna show me the thing
It's OK, she was old anyway, I display
Hot 97 rhyme ready. Cocked Mac-11, line steady.
Like Tevin Campbell I'm ready to do what I do
Continuously to git

You can be as good as the best of them
