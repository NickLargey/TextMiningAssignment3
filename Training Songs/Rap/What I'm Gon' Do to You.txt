[Chorus]
Heard you in the booty club
Tryin' to get new love
I wanted to scream and shout
But I went home
Just picked up the phone
Cleared your bank account out
It's gonna be such a shame
What I'm gonna do to you
Revenge is a must
When my heart you crush
You know I'm goin' burn yo' house to dust
Cause a girl really gets so serious
When you really make a girl so furious
It's such a shame
What I'm gonna do to you
 
This is the last time
That I'm goin' let you get away
With all these games that you're playing with me
Cause I kept seeing the signs
But I ignored them anyway
I once was a blind but now I see
Cause when you came home last night
You just wasn't smelling right
And that look in your eyes
Is telling me what is going on
What the hell is that smell
Could it be someone else
 
[Chorus]

I'm getting so tired
Of you always coming in late
With the scent of some female
On your face
It's only so much I can take
And you know, homeless
Just might be your fate
If you keep pushing the the limit with me
Cause when you came home last night
You just wasn't smelling right
And that look in your eyes
Is telling me what is going on
What the hell is that smell
Could it be someone else
 
[Chorus]
