Did everything that I had to do to make it by
Did everything on my own and now that boy so fly
They can't see what I'm doing they tryna ask me why
Stay down for the come up now I gotta multiply
All them digits they were sleeping
I went slipping on my pimpin'
Try to tell 'em I'mma get 'em
I'mma hit 'em like I'm pitching
And all them broken promises and wishes that they make
You know they know my name
I'm 'bout to change the game
Light it up for the season I should’ve been here
Now you want something, nah nigga you should've been here
Bathroom so big I can kick shit in it
