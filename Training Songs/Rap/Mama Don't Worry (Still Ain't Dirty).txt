I was out there on the hustle
I know you remember me
No more sleepin' on the floor
I got some money finally
Mama don't worry, mama don't worry
I did all this dirt and still ain't dirty

Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty (still ain't dirty)
Baby, I'm on to ya so don't worry (so don't worry)
I'm in the field without no jersey (without no jersey)
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty (still ain't dirty)
I came through, popped up on the first day (on the first day)
She say she love me 'cause I'm worthy ('cause I'm worthy)
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty

Eleven years old I was sittin' on the block
Yeah, my family had a little so I hid it in my sock (in my sock)
Sold them pills like they was Skittles, yeah, I always made a lot
I was always dodgin' twelve, puttin' work in off the clock
Almost got cuffed, it was too much, it was a lot of drama (lot of drama)
It was the streets that raisin' me, had to be dad and mama (dad and mama)
I was young, head strong, wasn't lettin' up (lettin' up)
Disrespectful my demeanor, didn't know who to trust

Now my mama straight, I ain't gotta push no weight
I came from the dirt, now I'm livin' great (from the dirt, livin' great)
Said I wasn't gon' make it, look how hard they hated
Never had enough and now the bank, we break it
(We break it, bitch)

Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty (still ain't dirty)
Baby, I'm on to ya so don't worry (so don't worry)
I'm in the field without no jersey (without no jersey)
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty (still ain't dirty)
I came through, popped up on the first day (on the first day)
She say she love me 'cause I'm worthy ('cause I'm worthy)
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty

Escaped the belly of the beast without a stain on me (stain on me)
Ready for fightin' now my fist, it got that ring on it (name on it)
Boynton Beach out to the hills, how far I came from it (came from it)
Now the whole world sneakin' pictures for the fame of it
Reckless on that show, man that's old news (old news)
Hundred and twenty on that ranch, on my own two (own two)
I did that crime, I beat that case, kept payin' my dues (I'ma my dues)
I did my time, I made them wait, and now I can't lose

Now my mama straight, I ain't gotta push no weight (she's straight, ain't push no weight)
I came from the dirt, now I'm livin' great (from the dirt, bitch I'm livin' great)
Said I wasn't gon' make it, look how hard they hated
Never had enough and now the bank, we break it
(Now we break it, bitch)

Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty (still ain't dirty)
Baby, I'm on to ya so don't worry (so don't worry)
I'm in the field without no jersey (without no jersey)
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty (still ain't dirty)
I came through, popped up on the first day (on the first day)
She say she love me 'cause I'm worthy ('cause I'm worthy)
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
