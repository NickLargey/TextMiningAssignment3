Come on, move your body girl
I wanna see you shaking
Like that
Yeah
Woo!

Walk into the party
I can feel your eyes on me as I walk in
Let's get this business started
It's time to make my move
You only get one shot

I push up on your body
Now I finally have us standin' face to face
Away from everybody
I gotta throw a line
To show you what I've got

I say shorty here's my cue
'Cause I just had to talk to you 
And I can tell you want it too
I said I need to get with you 

Girl, it's goin' down tonight
I'm gonna make you mine
Can't you see I want ya, I want ya girl

I've been checkin' you all night
So what's the point of lying
Now can't you see I want ya I want ya girl

Now I can be committed
I'll work that body like a nine to five
I might as well admit it
And as I grab your hips
I watch you lick your lips

You know I'm about to kiss you 
Can't wait to taste the honey from the hive
To think I almost missed you 
And now I'm standing here about to
Cash my chips

I say shorty here's my cue
'Cause I just had to talk to you 
And I can tell you want it too
I said I need to get with you 

Girl, it's goin' down tonight
I'm gonna make you mine
Can't you see I want ya, I want ya girl

I've been checkin' you all night
So what's the point of lying
Now can't you see I want ya I want ya girl

Yay
Ooh girl, I think its time we get together
Now everybody dance
Darin (track slammer)
Come on, come on, come on
Gonna make you mine

Girl, it's goin' down tonight
I'm gonna make you mine
Can't you see I want ya, I want ya girl

I've been checkin' you all night
So what's the point of lying
Now can't you see I want ya I want ya girl
