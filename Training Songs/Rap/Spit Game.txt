And my whole bidy smellin like reefa'

Why quit? I love ta talk shit

Here's a peace of my heat that I won't take
He's been sold a dream'a he had the prevalege to hold the neena
He's been exposed ta penis
Grown niggas speak wit they hand 'causez they know how ta bring it
Know how ta fold his fing'as slingin the oldest english
My co-fee, smokin a roll that's how it be
When tha hoe start smokin the co she I'm me
She prolly sip on tha nutta,she prolly winey
Chickens still love us but we still slip on the rubba's
Why is'nt the bitches sensitive lova's
We keep these bitches flyyy-we keep em' on the cova's
Niggas is humble this is our label so snap out
Niggas try ta cova' tha card table and they crap out
In japan like I'm the man you be lucky ta know 
That I be fukin these hoes like yo-tochy-you-toes

[Chorus]

Girls at the bar mmeet me in the middle
Back that ass up shake it juss a little
Come on show me somethin make ya titty's jiggle
Ya gotta love the way I spit it 'causez my game is tight
It's Pretty Ugly I'm the same dude ya friend like
Ain't nottin change I'm the shit baby it's my time
Spt game the boy Pates Royce Da 5'9''

Wat' in ya mind ta make you think that my click be trippin(boom)

We can split 50/50 of sticka's, payin fo' bitches 
My lips is fo sippin strectly and ain't fo lickin

I'm sorry Ms.Jackson but cha' daughter's a hoe 

[Chorus]
