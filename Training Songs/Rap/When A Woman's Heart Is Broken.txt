When a woman's, woman's heart (Oh, oh)
When a woman's, woman's heart
When a woman's, woman's heart (Oh, oh)
When a woman's, woman's heart

You didn't have to tell me lies
You didn't have to make me cry
Never thought you were the playa type
So many lovers on the side
Don't want to hear what you got to say
Right now the feeling's gone away
So here's the price you gotta pay
Ain't gotta go home
But you can't stay

(Can I take you shopping baby?) No nigga
(What about dinner?) Forget it
(What about dollas babe?)
I don't want to see your face around here no more
This time all I wanted was you to be there
Instead you went and cheated

When a woman's heart is broken
Ain't no flowers gonna bring her back to you
No way
When a woman's heart is broken
She remembers it forever
When a woman's heart is broken
You can get on your knees
You can beg and plead
I ain't takin' your shit this time
Let the door knob hit you son
Pack your bags, keep movin' on

You didn't try to be discreet
Had all your business in the street
You took that trip to Tiffany's
And you bought a ring but it was not for me
I'm not gonna smash your windows
I'm not gonna burn your clothes
I just want to see you get the hell out now, now

(Can I take you shopping baby?) No nigga
(What about dinner?)
Don't want to hear what you say
(What about diamonds babe?)
Why am I talking to you anyway?
I don't want to see your face another day
I don't want to hear what you say
I can make my own way

When a woman's heart is broken
Ain't no flowers gonna bring her back to you
No way
When a woman's heart is broken
She remembers it forever
When a woman's heart is broken
You can get on your knees
You can beg and plead
I ain't takin' your shit this time
Let the door knob hit you son
Pack your bags, keep movin' on

So leave the credit cards, the Benz
No, no we can't be friends
Just keep moving on, moving on
Take the bus the way you used to
I won't cry, still got pride
Don't let the green grass fool you
Get your things and get them fast
I just want to see you get out now

When a woman's heart is broken
Ain't no flowers gonna bring her back to you
No way
When a woman's heart is broken
She remembers it forever
When a woman's heart is broken
You can get on your knees
You can beg and plead
I ain't takin' your shit this time
Let the door knob hit you son
Pack your bags, keep movin' on
