'Still Paying Dues' dropped, so I relapsed with some new shit
Got your crew sick
OD on these cruel hits
A humble nigga, so believe I get rude quick
With the music I'm a beast
F*ck what y'all think
On these mics baby boy's got a full clip
Double barrel, buck shells when this fool spit
I got a wife and three kids, so my grinds thick
And Dead Prez only cats that I'm cool wit
Mighty dollar
Brings the mighty power
To make some niggas sour
'Cause youâ€™re doing what some are proud of
Nay Sayers and doubters
Homie I ain't worried about 'em
I already set the bait, soon enough they'll follow

'Cause I ain't stopping homeboy, best believe I got shit to do
I've been rapping for a minute still these niggas don't get the clue
F*ck waiting on these niggas, I'mma go ahead and make my move
I keep winning on these suckers
Turning blue waiting for me to lose

Go ahead and chase hoes
'Cause I'mma run towards the pesos
Got shit on my credit that I got to pay off
Money never sleeps, so I can't take a day off
Making history is all that I came for
I'm chasing mills, crazy deals to sign my name on
And bring it back to the city and put my mans on
I work hard so the top is where I land on
Blowing haze, you can call that getting my Cam on, on
So they telling me to put the rap down
That's like telling G's who ride to put their strap down
That's like telling an addict shorty put the crackdown
I'm addicted to this shit I can't stop now
Me quit, how that sound
Never in a milli
What I'm dealing, I'm feindin' to make a killin'
Keep spitting 'til they tell me I'm one of the best whoever did it
Keep giving flocka flame, playing rap like Hunger Games

'Cause I ain't stopping homeboy, best believe I got shit to do
I've been rapping for a minute still these niggas don't get the clue
F*ck waiting on these niggas, I'mma go ahead and make my move
I keep winning on these suckers
Turning blue waiting for me to lose

'Cause I ain't stopping homeboy, best believe I got shit to do
I've been rapping for a minute still these niggas don't get the clue
F*ck waiting on these niggas, I'mma go ahead and make my move
I keep winning on these suckers
Turning blue waiting for me to lose
