You can find me in the streets, even in a drought my mattress is full
Why shouldn't I be out? Ay buddy I'm good
What that tell ya? I'm good, what they tell ya? I'm good
What she tell ya? I'm good, what you see?
Four hundred dollar jeans with my favorite patch
Pulling up my ride, hell yeah the rims match
What that tell ya? I'm good, what that tell ya? I'm good
What they tell ya? I'm good, what she tell ya? I'm good
What you see? Looking good

Man I'm killing it, riding in that brand new
Swimming through the streets, looking like I'm Shamoo
In that big body with the wet paint
I got some pocket change from selling wet weight
Today is a good day, ice cubes on my chest
Looking in my Blackberry, freak hit me on the text
Come and beat it up, I just need a minute
You can K ya ass, you ain't gotta lay in it, yes!
Niggas don't like it when you looking good
Hate it when you shining through the neighborhood
Brand new ride, niggas know the time
Hoes cut they eyes, we call them samurais
Fly as I could ever be
A level of success that you could never see
You jealous mane, we in propellers mane
Think about it, ain't shit you could tell us mane

You can find me in the streets, even in a drought my mattress is full

Crusin' on them 22's, got me sittin' pretty
You should hear that engine purr, here kitty-kitty
Ride through the city, everybody know me
And the sun is out, it's like it's shinin' on me
Shoutin' out the homies as I breeze by
I'm on cloud 9 and I ain't even high
Told my shawty I'll be back and I ain't even lie
Them V-V-S's be the best money can buy
I see you flirting baby, them jeans is painted on her
Mama looking right and I don't even want her
No need to take it personal but that just how it be
No disrespect to you, I'm just enjoying me
Finally I'm free, all my dues paid
Them yellow diamonds got the charm like it's Minute Maid
And I'm lookin' good and I'm feeling good
Try and stop my shine, I wish a nigga would
