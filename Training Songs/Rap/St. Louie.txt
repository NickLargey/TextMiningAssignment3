[Chorus: x2]
Mmm you can find me in St. Louie
Where the gun play rang all day(nanana)
Some got jobs and some sell yea
Others just smoke and f*ck all day

I'm from the home of Red Fox, Ced the Entertainer
Jettin off with Brian Cox, I'll see ya later
Maybe not 'cause got somethin hot
In the Navigata, waitin in the parkin lot

A Bad Boy, and I Ryde Ruff-er than The LOX
I keep 'em both cocked, need her ass to bring it
Now tell me boss have ya seen her
Have you seen her, nine millimeter

Makin niggas believa
Hop out the two seater, now Vokal wife beater
Levi's fresh from the cleaners
Heavy starch wth the cuff

Like f*ck it leave it to beaver
Catch me in the galleria, plaza, Chesterfield
Rollin down holly hills
In a black Sedan Deville

I used to love they when hit me for a rocker
Maybe a boppa, I kept it propa
A non-stopa, aound the clocka
Now its cool pul up the benz and helicopta

[Chorus]

Sunday mornin crack of dawn and I'm yawnin
Natural bridge and kingshighway is where I'm goin
Wake up man and start blowin
Gotta get these juices flowin

Now I'm gonna tell ya one more time
For you cats that just ain't kowin
Hey, you can find me in St.Louie
And the whole me fedy and easy gettin slow

Grabin the optmo, sharpin up my flow
Practicin for my show
That's usually how it goes
Baby ready to roll, the chronic already rolled

Swing through our valid sounds
Knockin out of control
Like a boom boom boom, who is it?
It's Jackie Fros, the one who's gettin where he at

And he told yo who's the boss
I'm like a human hot sauce
Thinkin I'll burn your thoughs
Your informatin was false

I'll show you just what it coss
In the M I crooked letter crooked letter O you are I
No one could do it better,

[Chorus]

Now in the middle we keep it crunk and jiggy
Love Pac and Biggie
The way that you love your sticky
Call Louie yeah you pissy

Mixed with hen and crissy
Bumpin Tim and Missy
With Slim he used to diss m
In the red Expdishy

That's Okay though
She can ride just for the day though
Can't even be house guest like Kato
I'm a dog I said it woof woof

Now call me snoopy
Wouldn't have me in a hooke
Now you see me in a coupe
In front of utopia, I'm hopin ya

Come down here chippin, man I'm toastin ya
Thanksgiving round these parts, yo we roastin ya
And when the heat come down
Get ghostin ya god bless us

Loax with us, just how he jokes with us
My daddy told me this said I'm supposed to bust
Don't be provokin us
It ain't no joke in us

Just the north south east west coastin us

[Repeat Chorus]
