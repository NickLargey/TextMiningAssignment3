Word-up A
I had the joint out
Nigga gon' ask me "what (I) want?"
Know what I'm sayin'?
I'm like
Gimme, just gimme, for the NYC
Gimme what you can't get back
Gimme, why don't you gimme the world
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five boroughs

Yo, it's hard to show resistance when money getting niggas
Need my assistance to stack figures, beyond non-existence
F*ck keepin' my distance, 'cause bein' poor produced persistence
Plus plea's, a hundred G's, I had me blockin' out of jail sentence
I'm recognized by the illest of individuals
Killers and criminals, even willies that's really into jewels
But still skeptic on who I cling to
'Cause every single nigga that swing through ain't my man just 'cause we mingle
Too much snake shit, even females be feedin' off that fake shit
Filled with envy and hatred but my high helps me escape it
Temporarily, though it don't worry me
The wise verbally nourish me, properly with that inner city, urban GC
I f*ck with those beyond my age bracket
'Cause they analyze and map it, get the papers and stack it
Leavin' no trace to track it, kingpin thinkin' tactics is accurate
That mack shit, livin' the lifestyle, we feel relaxed with

Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme (Rollin' trees, stackin' G's)
Gimme what you can't get back (True dat, I thought you knew that)
Just gimme (Money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world (rollin' wit us)
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five Burroughs

So in God I trust, I lust for a 850-deluxe
And until I touch a million-plus, ain't much to discuss
Diamonds and double-digits, Gianni Versace down with lizards
It's realism so I visualize it to live it
Movin' cleverly, with intentions of longevity
Strong pedigree got me touchin' papers, others would never see, G
So do the crest in my claw, flourescents
Symbolizes the essence, you're sailin' in a sweppervescence
Drug investments, a street thug's plug, the insurance, but informers
They had you wanted for warrants 'fore you get enormous
Life's a performance so players play with endurance
'Cause for more cents, any villain's willing to get more intense
They tried to break us but all it did was just make us
Travel across acres for papers, bonafide money takers
'Cause though we know somehow we all gotta go
As long as we're leaving thieving, we'll be leaving with some kind of dough
So

Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme (Rollin' trees, stackin' G's)
Gimme what you can't get back (True dat, I thought you knew that)
Just gimme (Money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world (Rollin' wit us)
Gimme what you can't get back (It's real, NYC)

Just gimme (QB)
Just gimme (B-K, VT)
Gimme what you can't get back (See me, AZ y'all, representin')
Just gimme (Yeah, the street life is trife life)
Why don't you gimme the world (Representin')
Gimme what you can't get back (Life's a bitch and then you die)
