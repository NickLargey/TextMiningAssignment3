Letoya,
Lets go.
Uh-hu,
C'mon.
Uh-hu.

Hello baby.
As I was walkin by,
Hesitated,
And then I realized,
There go David.
I was suprised to see you,
And I asked do you remember me.
Boy I'm so elated
To run into you here
Shadow faded,
With diamonds in yo ears.
The memories that go,
I dont wanna let go.
Here you say you gotta girlfriend,
But I know,

She don't even touch you like this, (no)
She don't even kiss you like this, (oh-no)
She don't even treat you like I do,
Boy you kno that...
She don't even touch you like this, (no)
She don't even kiss you like this, (oh-no)
She don't even treat you like I do,
Boy.

Hold up right quick.

Oooh, I see us makin' plans,
Me and you.
Forget your circumstance.
Don't be actin' like me and you don't go way back,
Late night tippin' in yo Cadillac.
See I'm no psychic,
But I can understand,
She's a psychic,
But I know all your fantasies.
She can't do it to you like I used to.
And you know,
That I know,
That she can't do you like I do.

She don't even touch you like this,
She don't even kiss you like this, (mmm mm)
She don't even treat you like I do,
Boy you know that
She don't even touch you like this,
(She can't kiss you, no no)
She don't even kiss you like this,
(She can't treat you, no no)
She don't even treat you like I do,
Boy you know that.

Look at me and tell me you ain't feelin' me.
Boy you know that I'm the one you need. (oh-oh-oh)
(You know)
She's a waste of time,
I can love you right.
Boy you know that.
I already know you wanna personal,
So there ain't no need to take it slow. (oh-oh-oh)
(You know)
You know your best is your first,
So tell me why you with her.

She don't even touch you like this, (ooh)
She don't even kiss you like this,
(She can't even kiss you baby)
She don't even treat you like I do,
Boy you know that
She don't even touch you like this,
(She don't even)
She don't even kiss you like this,
(She don't even touch you like I do, no)
She don't even treat you like I do,
Boy you know that.

She don't even touch you like this,
She don't even kiss you like this,
(She can't even come close, no)
She don't even treat you like I do,
Boy you know that
She don't even touch you like this,(oh-no)
She don't even kiss you like this,
(There's no room for question baby)
She don't even treat you like I do,
Boy you know that.
