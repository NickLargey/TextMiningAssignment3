Everyone around you suffocates, think I don't believe in God 
Every little pill that helps you think, makes my mind a social fault 
I can take a million fucking freaks, blow 'em up and make you pay 
All the plastic clowns have taken me, to the moon that wasn't grey 
I have gone insane and I'm the one to blame 
There's no one left but me and I'm not here 
All the plastic people live for me, but their hearts were made for doom 
Everyone around thinks I'm insane, but the path I chose was sore 
I can take a million fucking freaks, blow 'em up and make you pay 
All the plastic clowns have taken me, to the moon that wasn't grey 
Can you give back to God what brought you here 
Everyone around you suffocates, think I don't believe in God 
Everyone around you thinks I'm insane, but the drugs have made me grey
