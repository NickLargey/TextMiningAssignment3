A part of me wants to leave you alone 
A part of me wants for you to come home 
A part of me says I'm livin' a lie (and I'm better off without you) 
A part of me says to think it through 
A part of me says I'm over you 
A part of me wants to say good bye 
A part of me is asking why 

A part of me wants to leave 
But a part of me wants to be here with you 
And every time I think that we're over and done 
You do something that gets me back lovin' you 
And you got me just torn 

[Chorus]
Torn in between the two 
'Cause I really wanna be with you 
But something is telling me that I should leave 
You alone (leave you alone, leave you alone) 

You got me just torn in between the two 
'Cause I really wanna be with you 
But something is telling me that I should leave 
You alone (leave you alone, leave you alone) 

What hurts the most is when we started out 
It was cool; it was everything that love's about 
But something happened 
'Cause I'm feeling so burned out 
Because I can't understand you now 
(I just can't understand you now, no, oh) 
A part of me says it's all my fault 
A part of me says he ain't what you want 
A part of me says to get my bags 
A part of me says I can't do that 

A part of me wants to leave 
But a part of me wants to be here with you 
And every time I think that it's over and done 
You make me fall back in love 
You got me just torn between the two 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
So many times I, I was ready to go 
So many times I, had my foot out the door 
So many times I, I thought to give him a chance 
Thought he'd be a better man 
Now I'm sitting here, and I'm so confused 
'Cause I keep fighting myself for you 
I don't know how much more I can take 
But I can't feel this way 
You got me so torn! 

[Chorus]
