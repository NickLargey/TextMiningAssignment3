How many times
Are you gonna take it
Look in my eyes
Help me make this make sense

Night after night
You sat up and cried
Wondering when you're gonna see things clearer
You don't even realize
That at this very moment
You're talking to yourself in the mirror

It's true

[Chorus]
So you think I'm strong but you're feelin' that you're weak
Baby I'm you
But we're one in the same so you're just as strong as me
Baby I'm you
And we deserve better it's time for us to leave
You know what to do
Cause I'm not a fool
So neither are you
Baby I'm you

Oh you're not crazy
If only you'd realize
That you and I
Have all the help we need

So why are we sitting here on the floor
(listen to me)
We ain't cryin' no more
I am your soul
I am your heart
My strength is yours (Oh my strength is yours)

Baby it's true

[Chorus]

So pick yourself up right now
We've been here too long
We've overstayed it enough
That might have been
It's been a long time gone

So wipe away the tears
Ain't nothing for us here
The time has come to move on

Oh

Baby we deserve better
And we're far too strong
To let this go on
Baby I'm you

[Chorus]

Baby I'm you [x3]
