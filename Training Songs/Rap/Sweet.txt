Sweet, and still there's pain
If I would have grew up
To be a doctor
My nephews would have grew up to do the same
But since I grew up through the game
And my influence is the same
And my therapy is music
They ask if you ashamed
And though I wish I could separate
The two things, I can not
So my answer to you remains
I can walk down the hall of mirrors in Versailles
And be so satisfied when I look at myself in the eyes
No shame, no sir
Just big boats and tearing the coast up
Tight coup like I'm wearing the roadster
For any coup it hugging the holster

HOV alright alright
And that may not be what you call perfect but
But its my life
The life
The life the life
Once again its the life

So I make no apologies crooked policies
So a G a nigga gotta be
We playing for property no monopoly
So I'll pass go and let my nephew follow me
They say the child shall lead
So I take it far as I can
We then shall see
Shall we dance with the devil for a beat
I pray to God I ain't got two left feet
Do the hustle put keys in the street
Then I'm ballroom dancing
Ke-ke'ing in the suite
SWEET
Bb's on the feet
Tv's on the seat
Enemies on the creep
Its so corrupt
Soak it up its a lesson
Never f*ck up
One day you're up
Next day you're down
Long as you stay the same
It'll come back around

Hov alright alright
And that may not be what you call perfect but
But its my life
The life
The life the life
Once again its the life

I'm even better
I'm eating better
Best thing about it is
My niggas eating together
With each endeavor we reaching levels
Niggas ain't seen in like forever
I'm Hyman Roth I make all my partners rich
I can vouch for you
If you ain't a part of this
So pardon me as I pave my wrist
As I parlay my chips
HOV alright alright
American gangster gangster
Business like I'm white
But I'm not I'm just bright
So fly with no fear of the flight
So if y'all hear my plight
And if you think you can make it this far without fight
Couple mistakes here and there
Not always right
But I'm always real
That's how I sleep to night

Hov alright alright
And that may not be what you call perfect but
But its my life
The life
The life the life
Once again its the life
