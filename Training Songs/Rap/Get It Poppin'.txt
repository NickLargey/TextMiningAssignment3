Plus i got that all black phantom tinted on four sides 
Get a kiss so they can't see us inside
Momma tell me do you like it
I know you like it 
Its written all ova your face don't fight it
You like it
More than I like it 
So put it all ova your face don't bite it

From rags to riches club packing
Bitches hate the bag and ditch us
The hate game is vicious 
and we can get it poppin the the bathroom

And we can all f*** that
Its like a million on my neck
Got all these -- ball 
We p-- drunk on and these bitches screaming let me in
