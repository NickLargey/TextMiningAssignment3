Oi!
Ha ha ha ha ahaha ahahaha
Yea!

Stupid!

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just
I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat, Dizzee Rascal
I get on down rolling deep

I've heard the gossip from the street to the slammer
They're trying to see if Dizzee stays true to his grammar
Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me
F*ck the glitz and glamor
Hit em with the Blitz and Hammer
Because they're talking bout rushing
Talk behind my back but to my face they say nothing
Stand up in the dance, keep a firm steady stance
Keep the beanies touching, keep the beanies hot flushing
Flushing MC's down the loo
If you don't believe me bring your posse, bring your crew
Feel free to hate cos I ain't tryna be your mate
Be serious, you wouldn't last an hour in my shoe
It's an Air Force One
Trainers by the truck load, trainers by the ton
Don't be dazed when I catch you by your J's
Chump, best to act like Forest Gump, best to run

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just
I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat,
I get on down

I stay sweet as a nut, sweet like Tropicana
When the hammer hits, your head splits like banana
You're not ready for this boy
You better send your best soldiers, this is Captain Roscoe
More destructive and troublesome than ever
I'll probably be doing this, probably forever
Fellas wanna stop me they'll probably come together
Its probable they'll stop me, probably never
Yo topboy, topman, or top a topper
Come to me with an attitude, come a cropper
I'm old school like Happy Shopper
I fight old school, bring your bat and your chopper
And a First Aid kit and some antiseptic, this could get hectic
I'm a don accept it, you gotta bright future
Don't let my gun affect it

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just
