Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh
Oooooh
The name: All Saints
The year: 2000
Good or bad? 
Saints or Sinners?

Fast? Slow? 
Stop? Go?

I got the strangest feelin'
I refuse to believe in
I got the strangest feelin' 
Feeling you remindin' me
Deeper down you're desirin' me

I'll befriend you, (I'll befriend you)
I'll try to pretend to (Try to pretend to)
Have your interests at heart
Promise to take you far
Open up your mind
Are you ready for the ride?

Do you wanna go fast?
Do you wanna go slow?
Do you wanna stop?
Do you wanna go?
Are you ready?
Do you wanna taste me?

You can't waste me, love me, hate me
You can go up, but you gotta come down
Ain't no joke
I ain't foolin' around
Things some to test you
I'm about to let you
Make you have a good time
Make you lose your mind

Chorus 
Baby you can run
But you know you can't hide
Are you a saint
Or a sinner inside
I will take you by your soul
Make you lose control
If you're capable to see
I'll take you where you've never been

Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, (Are you ready for the ride?) Oooh
Oooooh
Please forgive me

Can I ask you a question? (Yeah, Yeah)
An irrelevant question? (Uh-huh)
I got a feelin pretty deep
Feelin' that I wanna keep, 
Feelin we won't get no sleep

I wanna let you (Want to let you)
Do what you want to (Do what you want to)
There's a million reason why,
You're gonna fry tonight (True)
Baby hold on tight,
Are you ready for the ride?

Do you wanna go fast?
Do you wanna go slow?
Do you wanna stop?
Do you wanna go?
Are you ready?
Do you wanna taste me?

You can't waste me, love me, hate me
You can go up, but you gotta come down.
Ain't no joke, 
I ain't foolin' around
Things some to test you,
I'm about to let you
Make you have a good time,
Make you lose your mind

Chorus 

You can go up, but you gotta come down.
Ain't no joke, 
I ain't foolin' around
Things some to test you,
I'm about to let you
Make you have a good time,
Make you lose your mind

Chorus 

Baby you can run,
But you know you can't hide
Are you a saint, 
Or a sinner inside?

You can go up, but you gotta come down
Ain't no joke, 
I ain't foolin' around

Chorus 

Fresh for 2000, let's go
