[Royce Da 5'9"]
Real niggaz only.. hah..
First of all, what's my name? Five-Nine!
Yeah.. I got somethin for you
I got somethin for you, yeah

They call me Royce 5-9 or, Mr. Always-Ice-Cold-Wrist-ed
Or Mr. None-Of-Your-Business
Mr. Consistant-In-Conflict, for so dope lyrics (harvest)
The hardest hittin nigga in show bid'ness
Came in this game with a pissy-ass attitude
Arrogant like, "Shut up!"  Laughin that you a trick
I wasn't happy before, but I'm happy today
I'm rappin today, lookin to get a plaque in my day
So I met this white boy one night
who turned out to be the illest human being I ever heard in my life
He took me under his wing, and showed me some things
and molded me into a pro until the flow was mean
Taught me not to do it like this, but to do it like that
Threw me all types of love and I threw it right back
Though we don't talk as much, we never let the game consume us
cause we too real, my nigga Slim, let's grow

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Let us grow up, now we got here
We can't stop here, we too far
All my niggaz, y'all my niggaz
and you all know who you are (let's grow)

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, Royce 5-9 or, twelve men in one
About as explosive as them shells in your gun
Mr. Quick-To-Pull-A-Thing-On-You just for your loot
Mr. Mr. Mr. Quick-To-Swing-On-You before he shoot
I'm the finest tuned rappin machine rappin a scene
since, way back when there was only rappin in Queens
Suck my BALLS if you competin with me homeboy
I don't dream, I'm the type to just be homeboy
Sucka free is like a religion I honor and serve
And more common in words, a song witchu, what's in it?
y'all niggaz is all punks and your jewels is rented
And your diamonds is all dark, like they blue but tinted
I would never kill none of y'all, I ain't that fool
But I will stomp the shit out you, I ain't that cool
You ain't even gotta greet me when you see, matter of fact
You better give me five feet when you see me, where you at?
Let's grow

[Chorus]

[Royce]
Royce 5-9 or, one sick nigga
Bitches know that with me that the cum gets quicker
Mr., Always-Got-Some-Cris'-Or-A-Pistol
Rather diss you than chill witchu and will hitchu
The insanest monster that came and conquered
a game that remains to be full of trained imposters
I will not let you niggaz talk to me (nope) no way
This is not what I'm here for, give me my money (uh)
Faggots only attract faggots, and that's that
You rap rat, you fuckin roaches and black maggots
Feelin my heat; I talk shit from the moment I wake up
Turn right around and talk shit in my sleep - let's grow

[Chorus]
