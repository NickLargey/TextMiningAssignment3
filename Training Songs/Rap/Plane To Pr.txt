Welcome to mi casa la melaza,
Donde las mujeres son una amenaza
La tumba del reggueton y la salsa
Jode con mi música a ver lo que pasa
Evil eyes I can see lookin' at me and it happens every day
'Cause I'm young and I'm brown and I talk this way
They might think I'm carlitos way man give me a break

Don't try to push me 'cause I feel this way (no te calles dile)
If you don't feel me your soul must beat it(c'mon)
