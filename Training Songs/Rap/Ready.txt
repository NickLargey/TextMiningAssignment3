Round town, I'm bound, shake the ground
Shake the town, wave the pound, laid you down

Round town, I'm bound, shake the ground
Shake the town, wave the pound, laid you down

And that's how we approach these faggots
Try an' gon be fly but they still maggots
I'm sure all I gotta do is call my man
.40 cal, watch yourself, I'll spoil your plans

I'm the up top gangsta, the star in the hood
One of the few muF'fuckas that ain't scared of Suge
Fam, that was 9-5, man, f*ck the pass
See niggas out there frontin' bodyguards up they ass, man

He's Black Rob, he's okay
Play and you'll get robbed today

Ya'll know how I'm comin' through the Source Awards
Somebody's jewels got jacked, man, it must've been yours
Ya'll dudes be talkin' out the side of your mouth
So I put the gem star on the side of your mouth

I ain't sell no records, made no cash yet
F*ck dude,' cause my niggas is goons in every aspect
And don't get beside yourself
A lot of shit gonna be fucked up beside your health, man

He's Black Rob, he's a thug
F*ck with him, you'll get fucked up

Fam, I don't threaten dudes, that's a promise
That's honest, you can kiss my ring and pay homage
Or get smart, read books by Nostradamus
Meanwhile, I'm deep-sea diving, oceanomics

I seen green, more green than the Sonics
More green than the Geico lizard, the grand wizard
The 9 mm scope, I walk up on a nigga
Put the 9 to his throat and watch him shake like the Pope

He's Black Rob, he's our friend
[Incomprehensible] Rob is back again

Aww man, ya'll niggas done got me hype
This is it, we fit the same stereotype
If a nigga wanna while we can do that too
F*ck the model bitches, well, we can screw that too

Yeah, man, notice I said "we"
She's a J-you-M-P
Man, off top, fam, I got figures in the game
She's fuckin' with all the top niggas

He's Black Rob, he's our man
If he can't do it, no one can

Yeah, 'bout to put the whole game on smash
Alumni, I put the whole name on smash
After this they gon' wanna lace me pretty
Who's your man 'cause they can't make it JC Penney

Who's your Bad Boy, BR, back with the nutritious
Black attacks like a pit bull vicious
It's goin' down, fam, I'ma bout to shake the ground
It's uptown, holla, at your man
