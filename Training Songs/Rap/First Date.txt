Big boy!
Just one night, two nights, could be three of us
Girl we can get it on, girl we can have a ball
Bring your girlfriend, come on
Life’s too short to not f*ck on the first date
No one knows if we’re promised tomorrow
But if we make love until the next day
We’ll have the best of our time celebrating

Four in the morning now girl I don’t wanna talk
We’ve been talking for hours, now you know I wanna f*ck
Look I don’t understand what is it you don’t understand
My watch a hundred grand, my chain a hundred grand,
I’m a wanted man, I say I run New York
'Cause I do what the f*ck I wanna do, they know what’s up
They say my school’s a loose, I say who dares, you know I’m rich
Look I don’t have time to blow it up stopped giving a shit
Now maybe you can loosen up and let me go to work
So I can whisper in your ear while pulling down your skirt
When I get this scope girl you don’t know what to say
We can come through, so go girl I’m gone right away
Yeah, you nasty girl, you nasty
And I’m into that, so get at me

I don’t want no good, good, good, good girl
Me, I want a nasty girl, come freak with me
Be a freak for me
Life’s too short to not f*ck on the first date

I said ew, I wanna f*ck you in the worst way
Hell yeah I wanna f*ck you on the first day
If I don’t, I say f*ck you on Thursday
'Cause then I won’t want you, watch how fast I dump you
But right now I’m infatuated,
You get to hang with me, girl you graduated
I take you out to drinks and get you tipsy
Then I pull my dick out and I say kiss me
You bout to laugh your little panties off
You only get one date, you better clear this roll
They wanna ride in fancy cars, that’s what babies do
They like to f*ck, then slurp and lick too
She’s a nasty little tramp
But I like that shit, so let’s f*ck

I don’t want no good, good, good, good girl
Me, I want a nasty girl, come freak with me
Be a freak for me
