A natural fact: 
That I pimp tracks and freak around 
The game got cracks in them pipes  
It's leakin' town 
My lines blow yo' mind  
Yo' senses remain puzzled 
Attacked by the weight of the bass 
In yo' chest  
Eightball  MJG  MC Ren  
Nevertheless 
'Cause we's the most 
My real ass lizards  
Let's make a toast  
And sing aloud to bustas  
And force 'em to get ghost 
And coast to coast 
We shows loves in Network, 
While some try to impress people 
And get hurt. 
Deep thoughts cloud my conscience 
As I curl, 
Up in the corner on hand, 
And then I hurl 
Call my girl 
Tell her I'm drunk 
And can't make it 
I tried to drink the whole damn bar 
And couldn't take it 
That's aiight! 
'Cause come sunrise, 
I'm still rollin' 
My nuts the only title I'm claimin' 
And still holdin' 

Now who in the f*ck 
Want to come and represent? 
You bitch ass niggaz, 
Y'all be too hesitant 
I, take my black ass 
Down to the south 
Bitches want to f*ck me 
While I'm in the Suave House 
Nigga, who in the f*ck 
Want to come and represent? 
Oh, I know you suck that dick, 
Acting too hesitant 
We, MJG, Eightball, Villain, 
Make that straight nigga shit, 
That's how these niggaz feelin', Uh. 

Guess wo popped up, 
Straight up out the cuts 
With lyrical buckshots 
Spillin' all a nigga guts 
Touch whoever witness, 
Strays when I displays, 
A thousand different ways to get paid 
With a phrase 
Days go by, 
I be hibernatin' gettin' high 
Dreamin' 'bout L.A. 
Penetratin' somethin' fly 
Down in H-Town, 
Or somewhere in the Mound, 
All eyes on me, baby, 
'cause I get around 
We be like, connected 
Weak-ass niggaz get ejected 
Ooze like slime, 
Dig this hines when we wreck shit 
Uncut, coast to coast, 
Slangin' audio dope 
Manglin' MCs, leavin' 'em, 
Danglin' from ropes 
Boast, tryin' to be doper than most, 
In my profession 
Me and the villain, microphone killin' 
No blood spillin' 
Phat raps with much cheddar 
In the tellers, 
Eightball and MJG and MC Ren, 
Foreva! 

Now who in the f*ck 
Want to come and represent? 
You bitch ass niggaz, 
Y'all be too hesitant

Out in Houston, Tex., 
To f*ck with them niggaz from Suave 
Who want to flex. 
Bitch niggaz got kidnapped, 
With dicks in they mouth, 
Fo' fuckin' Compton niggaz, and 
Niggaz from down South, 
Eightball, MJG, where you at, 
Space agent? 
Y'all prob'ly got all the bitches pagin' 
Suckin' 'casian. 
Writin' left nuts, 
Chapstick and lips, 
While bitch-ass niggaz spendin' chips, 
Just to see the hips

Bitches bow tha f*ck down 
F*ck how them other niggaz sound 
Villain be hated by niggaz because 
They bitches pussies throb 
Ready to slap that ho, 
Every time a head bob, niggaz be killin' me, 
Got that nigga T-Mixx, 
Pull the fuckin' remix

And some Compton-ass niggaz 
To make you fade to black 
With some crazy Houston niggaz 
In the cut in the back
