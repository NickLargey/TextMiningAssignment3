Gotti you know we got you nigga
Palm City
Milkwaukee Buck'ing Gang

Yo it's that boy they call Young'n
And you know I rep that gang
Them ink boys is at it again
Nigga ain't shit changed, I still got young'ins with them K's
And the Penn's is still sittin' on 20 inch blades
Candy painted Range
Money, Power, Respect, the Tec I flame with expert aim
The work get flipped, the change stack up
Tah murdered the Caddy, Caddy the 'Lac truck

And you know whenever we rollin', niggas is holdin'
Wrist so frozen, mommy want a golden
Let's go, she want a ride with the best
So I give her the death stroke
Knock her down, like a left blow
Not to mention I got a bottle of that XO
Runnin' out the Teterboro, waitin' on the jet show
What you expect hoe? That's how we fly
Mo' money, mo' murder mo' murder
Mo' life

Oooh
I can't wait to get next to you
Oooh
I just can't leave you alone

Boy you got me doing things that I would never do
And I can't stop the way I'm feeling if I wanted to
I'm crazy 'bout the way that you could make me say your name
And if I couldn't have you I would probably go insane

'Cause only you can make me feel (only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (only you can take me there)
Only you can make me feel (only you, only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (only you can take me there)

Oooh
I can't wait to get next to you
Oooh
I just can't leave you alone

Boy you stay inside my mind, ain't no denyin' that
And only you could do them things that got me coming back
It's gotta be the realest thing that I have ever felt
And I do what I gotta do to keep you to myself

'Cause only you can make me feel (only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (only you can take me there)
Only you can make me feel (only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (only you can take me there)

Yo, only you baby can make me (crazy)
About the way you shine, I'm great with eighteen, better with dimes
Plus I'm ('bout the)
Sex money and fervor
Black Child and my style is murder
(Way you)
Got more butt than ash-trays, mama how real is your nana?
'Cause you knows I hollers at the itch-bes
But only you can make me (feel)
I wanna sexual heal your sweet spot like I'm Marvin
I push you in a drop off through Harlem (or Holis)
Make your body hot like Impalas (on Crenshaw)
Regardless (you in for) menages (and then some)
Need some income?
I got it
You need to come on in, help a nigga spend up some of the profits
Black, tell her it's logic
It's more than one way out the projects
Get money and weigh your options

Only you can make me feel (only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (only you can take me there)
Only you can make me feel (you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (only you can take me there)

Oooh
I can't wait to get next to you
Oooh
I just can't leave you alone
