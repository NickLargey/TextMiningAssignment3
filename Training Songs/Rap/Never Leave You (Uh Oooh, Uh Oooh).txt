Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Honestly if I tell
Tell you what
What you want to know love

There ain't another I don't want no other lover
I put nothin' above ya
I kick them to the gutter

They tryin' to shake me, ya lovin' me crazy now
Look at us lately and tell em whose your lady

I never thought you'd be the one to make me shine brighter then the sun
There ain't no ups and downs, no in and outs
We're here right now

If you want me to stay I'll never leave you
If you want me to stay we'll always be

If you want me to stay love endlessly
If you want me to stay, if you want me to stay then I'll never leave you

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh

Now that your loving back
We're happy it's a fact
Can't nothin' hold us back
We got this in the bag

There ain't no maybe
No question of your baby now
Look at us lately and tell em whose your lady

I never thought you'd be the one to make me shine brighter then the sun
There ain't no ups and downs, no in and out
You're here right now

If you want me to stay I'll never leave you
If you want me to stay we'll always be

If you want me to stay love endlessly
If you want me to stay, if you want me to stay then I'll never leave you

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
