Joss, how much lovin' do you need?
Do you need it once a day? Twice a day?
Three times a day? Four times a day?
You gotta let me know

I need a little lovin? at least two times a day
So when I call you, boy, you better run here right away
Let's have a show of hands, who's addicted to their man?
If I could do the things I want to you you'd be changin' all your plans

You want to say I'm yours, I want to say get it
You want to say, so say, I know what you're thinkin', babe

So tell me, babe
(Tell me ?bout it)
Tell me how you feel
(How you feel)
And if the feelin?s real
(Feelin?s real)
Tell me what's the deal
(Hey, hey, hey)

Gon' tell you ?bout it
(Tell me ?bout it)
Tell you how I feel
(How I feel)
And if the feelin?s real
(Feelin?s real)
Let's seal the deal
(Hey, hey, hey)

What you think about me and you bein' together?
Could you break or shake my cold and stormy weather?
Hey, have you got this under control?
Show me you know about a woman?s soul

Gon' tell me ?bout it
(Tell me ?bout it)
Tell me how you feel
(How you feel)
And if the feelin?s real
(Feelin?s real)
Tell me what's the deal
(Hey, hey, hey)

Gon' tell you ?bout it
(Tell me ?bout it)
Tell you how I feel
(How I feel)
And if the feelin?s real
(Feelin?s real)
Let's seal the deal, seal the deal
(Hey, hey, hey)

I?ll make you feel the way you wanna feel
I love how it?s real, we're one in two minds
Maybe you'll stick, you'd better be quick
I hope that you heard me right

Tell me, tell me 'cause I won't wait
Suspense, I just hate, so spit it out now
If you feelin' like I do
Won't you come and do it to me?

So tell me, babe
(Tell me ?bout it)
Tell me how you feel

And if the feelin?s real
(Feelin?s real)
Tell me what's the deal
