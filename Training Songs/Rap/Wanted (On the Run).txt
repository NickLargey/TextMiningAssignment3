Excuse me, ma'am can you help me
I need to place an ad with you today
No ma'am tomorrow may be too late
I'd like to have it started right away

What's that, no this is personal
I'm not buying or selling anything
Yes ma'am, I know just what to say
I wrote it down, this is how it should read

Wanted one good hearted woman
To forgive imperfection in the man that she loved
Wanted just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough

What's that, no that's all I want to say
I just hope these few lines will get to her
Yes ma'am, she means everything
I hope she comes back when she reads these words
