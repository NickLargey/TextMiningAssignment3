I'm living for a fantasy
Something that could never be
'Cause all the love you had
To give was never
Never meant for me 
I see the way you look at her
She's everything your living for
And love is such a miracle
When it comes knocking at your door
But I don't know what to do 
I'm in love too can't see where I suppose to go from here coz

There's no way in
There's no way out
Your the one I'm living for
Your the one I have to live without
I can't hold on 
I can't let go
'Cause I have found the greatest love, 
The greatest love you'll never know
Never know
I'd love to make you cross the line
But I know your not the hurting kind
You wouldn't be the man you are 
If you broke her heart, 
Broke her heart for mine
So until I find my way 
Tomorrows just another day
And you are just a lonely dream 
That never ever seems to fade

Someone hear my prayers
Someone somewhere
'Cause I know I can't go on this way forever

There's no way in
There's no way out
Your the one I'm living for
Your the one I have to live without
I can't hold on 
I can't let go
'Cause I have found the greatest love, 
The greatest love you'll never know

I'll never laugh
I never cry
Our love can't live
But my love, my love will never die
Somebody hear my prayer
Somebody hear my prayer
Somebody hear it 

There's no way in
There's no way out
Your the one I'm living for
Your the one I have to live without
I can't hold on 
I can't let go
'Cause I have found the greatest love, 
The greatest love you'll never know

I'm living for a fantasy
