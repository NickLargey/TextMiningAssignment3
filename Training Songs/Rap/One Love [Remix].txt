What up kid? I know s*** is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
F*** it black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations you know you got a son

I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flip it, talk about he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff

I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
F***ing with the n****z from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jeromes niece, on her way home from joes beaches club

Plus little rob is selling drugs all the time
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry 9's
At night time there's more trife than ever
Whattup with Cormega, did you see 'em, are why'all together?

If so then hold the fort, now I represent to the fullest
Say wha**up to herb, ice and bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commisary
You was my n**** when push came to shove
One what? one love

Dear born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in new york the same s*** is going on
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking

The n**** you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' something
Word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block
Your man gave him your glock

And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'm a put it to a cease
When I heard you blew a n**** with the [???] for a phone piece
Whylin' on the island but now with [???]

Better chill ''cause them n****z will put that a** on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
I maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reels, all these crab n****z know the deal

When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next v I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks
Plus [???] flicks

Your brother's buck whylin' in four maine he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key
So stay civilised, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind [dies]

I hate it when your mum cries
It kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs
For one love

Sometimes I sit back with a budda sack
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, etcetera
F*** a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er

So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the week and hittin' nails while I'm sleeping
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home

You see the streets have me stressed something terrible
F***ing with the corners have a n**** up in belle vue
Or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim

So I comes back home, nobody's helping shorty
Do I roll them two phillies together and the friends we call them oowops
He said nas, n****z cold be bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce

He inhailed so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing when I peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these b****es where he pumped his loose cracks

I took an l when he pa**ed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted he starts talking mad s***
I had to school him, told him don't let n****z fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows a shot that's when a murder be the cool one

Tough luck when n****z are struck, families f***ed up
Could've cought your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
If the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed

Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes
Then froze only the bolder herb smoke through my nose

And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose
There's some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from nas try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for jake shorty what

One love
