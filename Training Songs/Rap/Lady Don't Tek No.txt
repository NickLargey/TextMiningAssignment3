Lady don't take no shit insist on respect
Insist to walk around like a woman
She won't speak less it's something worth sayin'
Don't play, the girl take herself so serious
People stare curious
She got a natural way, her hips sway furious, yet luxurious
Carries herself like the cutest most purdiest
Thing you've seen, this side of the bay
Go about her business so purpose-fully
She got razor sharp wit and she just won't quit
Flauntin' it, body built like a house made outta bricks
She got the smile, the style and finesse
And bounded with the blessed and profound intellect
Select few have ever seen her butt naked
And they too want to see the rep protected, 'cause

She don't like violence
But she can throw them things so don't let your guard down
Her thighs are soft but her eyes are
You can't just try tell her c'mon now
She did surgery with daisies
Alice Walker, Nicki Giovanni, o honey
Say she want to be a doctor,
And I'll be some damn sure she could be teachin' somebody
School to street smarts, girl ain't no dummy one
He can not make it back while then it ain't about the money
The boys and guys ? act funny whenever the queen's coming around the town yeah

Sweet top, London, Rome, outta sight, outta mind with the freaky shh
That she can't quite see, but she can't quite know
And it lies in the gentle, come better than that

Wherever you took my head baby send it home, send it on home
I really think I lost my head cause this females on
All the clerks want to offer your help, all the folks compliment your style
Little children want to jump in your lap, girl I want to do that myself
She ain't known ? she's committed since, and ain't finished shit
But, because of her dis-po-sit-ion, she ain't subject to crit-I-cizm
That's why the other women started mimicking,
She ain't tripping off no images,
Her interests are all limitless, she ain't limited by inhibitions lord
Bout miss imagination, she wants this ? of me jack
That had me out in space, somewhere just floatin' not knowing the way back
You know how I can't always rhythm, everything that you're saying 'bout have the time 
When I hear your voice you support your boys,
But all of that body language girl it's alright
It's alright, it's alright now, a little ride in your ?

How'd you get so neat
And just when I think I know your style, I notice some I ain't been
Don't give me no silent treatment girl
We tried to sing your name in Latin baby
Ain't that my obligation, no no no
