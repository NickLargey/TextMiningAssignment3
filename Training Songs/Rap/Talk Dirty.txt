(Get jazzy on me) I'm that flight that you get on
International
First class seat on my lap girl
Riding comfortable
'Cause I know what the girl dem need
New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps on my passport
You make it hard to leave

Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is when you
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on me

You know the words to my songs
No habla Ingles
Our conversations ain't long
But you know what is
I know what the girl dem want
London to Taiwan
I got lipstick stamps on my passport
I think I need a new one

Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is when you
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
What?

(Uno) Met your friend in Rio
(Dos) She was all on me yo
(Tres) We can m√©nage a three yo
(Cuatro) Oh yeah

Dos Cadenas, close to genius
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis
Gilbert Arenas, guns on deck
Chest to chest, tongue on neck
International oral sex
Every picture I take I pose a threat
Bought a jet, what you expect?
Her pussy's so good, I bought her a pet
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got it saved in my phone, under big booty
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got it saved in my phone, under big booty

Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is when you
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on me

What? I don't understand
