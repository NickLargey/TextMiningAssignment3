You know its goin down if I let you mash wit me
Baby can't you see
Can't you see that I'm feelin you everything about you
When sometime,you know you got the damn thing I like
Gotta a G straight trippin, up in the club
Wit your wrist iced up and your temps like what all right
Sometime you know you got the damn thing I like

And tell your boys that you just hooked up
