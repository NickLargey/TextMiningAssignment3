I know one day, I won't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'mma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine
And I know one day, hell it might be Monday

I remember thinking man I need a decent ride
And I would have to ask my momma for the keys to drive
With my brother riding in an old Cutlass
Black and Mild lit, whole hoof busted
Well who knows maybe one day we'll have a little more
We'll finally shop somewhere else besides the corner store
My little sister say she gotta have a pair of Dior's
But right now they'll probably stop us before we hit the door
My Uncle say that's how it is where we come from
And if it weren't for bad luck, we wouldn't have none
Hard to tell the good days from the bad ones
If I could catch a shooting star then I would grab one
I'd grab one for real

I know one day, I won't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'mma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine
And I know one day, hell it might be Monday

I remember feelin' trapped and no I couldn't get out
And when they laid my momma off no it just didn't amount
I still remember how she looked when she walked into the house
But still she tried her best to show what was Christmas about
And if we wanted hot water we had to microwave it
And everyday the power cut off but we tolerate it
The thoughts of all the beats I lost because I forgot to save 'em
I'm screaming at me in the mirror like "I gotta make it!"
My teacher tryin' to get through to me because of my behavior
I said "I got big dreams and I gotta chase 'em"
I never cared a damn thing about a college major
I only had one need, that was a lot of paper
But see I never had a thing but a lot of prayers
After school, open mic night, rockin' stages
It all started from a demo, to a limo
From a limo, to a Lambo
And all of this came up outta Decatur, 'cause

I know one day, I won't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'mma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine
And I know one day, hell it might be Monday

I used to dream about these days and the things that I'd do
Had to get a new life, 'cause the old just won't do
I used to dream shades of grey, now the sky's shinin' blue
And everyday it feels like there's no way I can lose

'Cause I knew one day, I wouldn't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'mma get those keys to that new ride
I knew one day I'd be fine
And I knew one day I'd get mine
Yeah and I knew one day, and not just Monday, yeah
