Whoa oh oh 
Ooh hooh
No No No

See I don't, know why, I liked you so much
I gave you all, of my trust
I told you, I loved you, now that's all down the drain
Ya put me through pain, I want to let you know how I feel

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
F*ck what I said it don't mean shit now
F*ck the presents might as well throw em out
F*ck all those kisses, it didn't mean jack
F*ck you, you hoe, I don't want you back

You thought, you could
Keep this shit from me, yeah
Ya burnt bitch, I heard the story
Ya played me, ya even gave him head
Now ya askin' for me back
Ya just another act, look elsewhere
Cause ya done with me

[Chorus:Repeat x 2]

Oh oh oh oh
Uh hun yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Uh hun yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Uh hun yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Uh hun yeah

Ya questioned, did I care
You could ask anyone, I even said 
Ya were my great one
Now its, over, but I do admit I'm sad.
It hurts real bad, I can't sweat that, 'cause I loved a hoe

[Chorus]

Oh oh oh oh
Uh hun yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Uh hun yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Uh hun yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Uh huh yeah

[Until the end]
