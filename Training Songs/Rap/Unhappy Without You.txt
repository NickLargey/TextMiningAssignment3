Girl we've really need to drop it out
Somethings I know I need to say out loud
And we talk about it
There are matters what you need to know
And how you act determines where we go
So here we go

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be all by my self
But I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you, out you
I don't want nobody else
But I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you, out you

I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
Without you, out you

I hate it when you turn it off and on
When the mornin' love is right then you turned of and the day is gone
It's like a cycle through what's going on
It almost like we don't want it
I'm losing you and I don't know why

Used to feel so good and
Used to be so right and
Used to make love to me every single night
Girl, how can we get back to
That blessful energy
You gotta give me everything
If you wanna be with me

[Chorus]

I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
Without you, out you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
Without you, out you

Used to feel so good and
Used to be so right and
Used to make love to me every single night
Girl, how can we get back to
That blessful energy
You gotta give me everything
If you wanna stay with me

[Chorus: x2]

I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
Without you, out you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
Without you, out you
