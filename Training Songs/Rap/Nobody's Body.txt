Alright!
Mmm, ahh

I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to
I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to

Let me tell you
I've been searchin' high and low
Tryin' to find somebody
Who really understands my flow
Don't want nobody
Who's somebody else's body
I just want someone
Who's all about me

I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to
I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to

Everyday and everynight
I often long for someone to treat me right
Lonely times are here again
But I have faith that better days will soon begin
And I get tired of somebody else's man holdin' me
I need a man who's single and free
Someone to call my own
To be there when I get home
To understand me and love me for me

I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to
I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to

I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to
I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to

I don't want nobody's somebody
Hey, hey
I don't want nobody's somebody
Hey, hey
I don't want nobody's somebody
Hey, hey
I don't want nobody's somebody
Hey, hey

I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to
I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to

I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to
I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to

I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to
I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to

I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to
I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to

I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to
I don't want nobody's body but for me
All I want is somebody to hold on to
