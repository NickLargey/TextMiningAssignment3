Throw down some money
The ice cream man is comin'

Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe 
Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched (the ice cream man is comin')
And scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up

Yo, honey dip, summertime, fine Jheri drippin'
See you on Pitkins with a bunch of chickens how you're cliquin'
I kept shootin' strong notes as we got close
She rocked rope, honey throat smellin' like Impulse
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God?
Attitude is very rude, boo, crabby like seafood
It turns me on like Vine's Cee Allah Rule
They call me Starky Love, hon', check the strategy
By any means, Shirley Temple cross was done by Billie Jean's
Black Misses America, your name is Erica, right, true
Lazy eyeball, small feet, six shoe
Caramel complexion, breath smellin' like cinnamon
Excuse me, hon', the Don mean no harm, turn around again
Goddamn, backyard's bangin' like a Benzy
If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spuds McKenzie
I'm high powered, put Adina Howard to sleep
Yo, pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week, but, uh
Back to you Maybelline Queen, let's make a team
You can have anythin' in this world except cream
So what you wanna do? What you wanna do?
Let's go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu

Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe (throw down some money)
Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched (the ice cream man is comin')
And scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up

Shaolin's finest, what up boo? Peace, Your Highness
Yo I'm loungin', big dick style, y'all niggas is the flyest
Moves you're makin', too fly jewels are shakin'
Not a rape patient, you're lookin' good fly-colored Asian
Ghettos, them is your hometown, we can go the whole round
After that, I'm shootin' downtown
I'm rockin' hats and your wig is all intact
Who's that queen bee chick, eyes pearly black?
Freaks be movin' in fly sneaks
Two finger rings and gold teeth, and ain't afraid to hold heat
So when I step in the square, dear
You better have cream to share 
Ricans, ven aqui, yeah

Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe 
Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched (the ice cream man is comin')
Scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up

Black chocolate girl wonder, shake ground like thunder
Politic 'til your deficit step, gimme your number
Your sexy persuasive ta-ta's and thighs
Catch my eyes like highs, I want your bodily surprise
Double dime some time, ice cream you got me fallin' out
Like a cripple, I love you like I love my dick size
Ooh, baby, I miss you
Your sweet tender touches
Take pulls off the Dutches 
Orgasm in my mindstate, masterbate in your clutches 
I want you for self
Like wealth, so play me closely
Bitches paranoia for the sting, who want the most of me
Only a hard dozen wanna be callin' me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby, shoppin' spree you're lovin'
Call me if you wanna get dug like the pockets
I jizz 'em like a giant, break wombs outta the sockets

(The ice cream man is comin')
Wu-tang in the cut, for real niggaz what?
It's the after party and bitches want to f*ck

Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched
Scooped in the ice cream truck, who tears it up

Ice cold bitches melt down when in my clutch
And what they titties sucked, ice cream
Yeah, in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched
Scooped in the ice cream truck, who tears it up
Ice cold bitches melt down when in the clutch
They want they titties sucked, ice cream

One love to my chocolate deluxes, keep your nails done
And your wigs tight, word up
One love to my butter pecan Ricans for callin' me papi
That's for real
One love to caramel sundaes, with the cherries on top
Yeah
And big up to my French vanillas
Parlez vous, francais, mi amor, merci, oui oui, bon bons
And all that good stuff
That good stuff
