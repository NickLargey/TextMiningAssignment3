I don't believe, we were put together not to be together
And I don't believe, there's anyone out there, that can love me better
I don't believe, that you know how much I miss seeing your pretty
Smile
Of course we had our ups and downs, but I gotta have you around
Me because

I feel it all over my body (feel it all over my body)
I dream about you when I sleep (yeah)
You're the one for me, you're the one
You're the one for me you're the one
All the signs say that ever since the day that we laid eyes on each
Other baby you're the one for me you're the one you're the one for
Me (hey)

I don't believe, that you know how much I melt every time I smell your
Scent boy and I dont believe (i don't believe), I got myself in this
Predicament I'm sorry ( I'm so sorry), for everything I ever did wrong
I'm sorry (i'm so sorry)
And I'm begging you begging you baby oh baby oh baby please
Come back home

I feel it all over my body
I dream about you when I sleep (yeah)
You're the one for me, you're the one
You're the one for me you're the one
All the signs say that ever since the day that we laid eyes on each
Other baby you're the one for me you're the one you're the one for
Me (hey)

When I lay in my bed at night
I'm hoping and pray that you feel the same way I do deep down
Inside inside and that feeling you just can't control it makes you
Wanna just call me and tell me how much you really miss me it
Makes you wanna call me and say that you can't wait to hold and
Kiss kiss me me all over

I feel it all over my body (hey)
I dream about you when I sleep (dreeeam, you're the one)
You're the one for me, you're the one
You're the one for me you're the one
All the signs say that ever since the day that we laid eyes on each
Other baby you're the one for me you're the one you're the one for
Me (hey)
