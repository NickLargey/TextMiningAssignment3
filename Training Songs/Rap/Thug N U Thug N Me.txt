Ayy come on JoJo 
'Pac, hahaha
Yeah, that type of shit (maybe it's the thug in me)
Yeah
You know what time it is 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, put your hands up (maybe it's the thug in me)

By age thirteen I was buckwild, good at my knuckle game
Made it through a tough childhood, never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man, had to shatter fools
That's 'til I put my eyes on you
Goddamn, sweetheart you got some thighs on you (say what?)
Now I can't wait to get you home 
Get you all alone in my bedroom 
Baby can we bone, and get it on?
Tell me, lady, how you like me
And if you want it harder, baby, come and bite me
But do it lightly, 'cause that excites me to lay the pipe
And if you lick me right, I'll do it all night
Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga (haha)
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin' me
I'm goin deep, it's the thug in me 
So whatchu sayin' girl?

A thug nigga like me (ooh yeah) (like me)
I need a thug lady like you (come on) (give it to me)
I got a lot of thug in me (maybe it's the thug in me) (in me)
That I wanna put in you (put in you)
A thug nigga like me (yeah)
I need a thug lady like you 
I got a lot of thug in me (maybe it's the thug in me) (in me)
That I wanna give to you girl (maybe it's the thug in me)

Moan, baby, when we bone it's on
It's so strong, niggas in the next room'll cum
I got ya head swingin' 
Tongue kissin' as I hit it from the back
With the bed ringin' (haha)
Give me space as I lick ya face, stick the place (show me how you want it girl)
Synchronize so I drive when they kick the bass (show me how you like it girl)
Love fuckin' in the mornin' (tell me do you need it girl)
I get ya wet and bust a sweat, then I'm gone (don't try to fight it, girl, come on)
Left you on yo' own 
Girl, tell me what you feel like 
Blindfolded, I'm cold do it real nice 
That's if it feel right
Maybe it's the thug in me
I pull ya hair while we fuckin in the chair, when ya lovin me
Up against the wall, you can have it all just try
Bet my kiss, can get you high, don't pass by
Grab me by my nuts when I'm lovin' you
Now open up and let me put the thug in you

A thug nigga like me (ooh yeah) (like me)
I need a thug lady like you (come on) (give it to me)
I got a lot of thug in me (maybe it's the thug in me) (in me)

A thug nigga like me (yeah)
I need a thug lady like you 
I got a lot of thug in me (maybe it's the thug in me) (in me)
That I wanna give to you girl (maybe it's the thug in me)

Say, baby, what's your phone number?
Be warned, I'm like a storm with my own thunder 
I make the room rumble
In and out long stroke, hold ya breath now
Close your eyes deep throat, did you like it?
Ooh, I'm excited
'Cause it's a party in my bedroom, you're invited 
Come on now let me see ya shake your rump,
Tell me how long will it take to cum 
Havin' fun do it one on one 
And we can all get involved
First y'all do me, then I'll f*ck y'all
When you call me the next day
To get sexed by a nigga in the best way
Yeah, baby, it's a price to pay 
Only play in the fast lane
When you a hustler, motherfuck a cash came
I gotcha goin' wild, 'cause I'm lovin' you
Drugged out with this motherfuckin' thug in you (yeah)

A thug nigga like me (like me)
I need a thug lady like you (a little thug lady) (maybe it's the thug in me)
