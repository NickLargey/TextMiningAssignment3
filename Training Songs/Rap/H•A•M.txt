It was all good just a week ago
N****s feel they selves
And then Watch The Throne drop
N****s kill they selves
What n****s gon' do Hov?
This a new crack on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that
N****s tellin' me "You back" (you back)
Like a n**** ever left up out this b****, huh?
And if life a b**** suck my dick huh?
And I bet she f***ed the whole clique, huh
By the way n****, you should f***in' quit, n****
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you mothaf***er and I get it
No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me
Or-gy, or are we, speakin' metaphorically
Historically, I'm kickin' b****es out like Pam n****
Goin' HAM n****, me and Jigga
And a n**** still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as s***
Had a few white girls, a**es flat a s***
But the head so good, damn a n**** glad he hit
Got 'em jumpin' out the building
Watch out below, a million out the door

I'm about to go HAM
Hard as a mothaf***er let these n****s know who I am
I'm about to go HAM
Hard as a mothaf***er let these n****s know who I am

F*** y'all mad at me for?
Y'all don't even know what I've been through
I play chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all mothaf***ers woulda been moved
I swam waters with great whites
Y'all mothaf***ers woulda been chewed
I hustle with vultures late nights
Y'all mothaf***ers woulda been food
F*** wrong with these dudes
Try to walk around in these shoes
See the s*** I saw growing up
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's
N****s fantasize about the s*** that I do daily like
These rappers rap about all the s*** that I do really
I'm like really half a billi n****
Really you got baby money
Keep it real with n****s
N****s ain't got my lady money
Watch the Throne don't step on our road
Bad enough we let you step on our globe
When my nephew died, daddy dead
N****s took the price on my uncles head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread
Bow down, brother pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Commes Des Garcon, f*** your fresh
Head shots n**** f*** your vests
F*** the pig, no pork on my fork
Peace God 'cause you know a n**** just went Ham

Hard as a mothaf***er let these n****s know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM
Hard as a mothaf***er let these n****s know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM
