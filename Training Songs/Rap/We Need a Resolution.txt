Did you sleep on the wrong side?
I'm catching a bad vibe
And it's contagious, What's the latest?
Speak your heart, Don't bite your tongue
Don't get it twisted, Don't misuse it
What's your problem?
Lets resolve it
We can solve it, What's the causes?
It's official, You got issues
I got issues, but I know I miss you

Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Who should be blamed?
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed?
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Will we remain?
You need a resolution, I need a resolution,
We need a resolution, We have so much confusion

I wanna know, Where were you last night?
I fell asleep on the couch, I thought we were going out
I wanna know, were your fingers broken?
If you had let me know, I wouldn't have put on my clothes
I wanna know, where'd you go instead?
It was four in the morning, when you crept back in the bed
I wanna know, what was in your head?
Or what was in my head? Am I supposed to change?

Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Who should be blamed?
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed?
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? And will we remain?
You need a resolution, you need a resolution
We need a resolution, we have so much confusion

Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? and who should be blamed?
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed?
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Will we remain?
You need a resolution, I need a resolution,
We need a resolution, we have so much confusion

Baby let me know, you'll let me know (I will)
You'll let me know, you'll let me know (I will)
You'll let me know, you'll let me know (I will)
You'll let me know, you'll let me know (I will)

Girl holla!
You give me bits and pieces
You tryna blame me when I don't even know the reason
I think it's just the season, maybe the month, maybe the building
Now tell me what's the reason? Stupid yo? Looks are deceiving
So, cut the crying, cut the coughing, Cut the wheezing, girl
Quit the blaming, cut the naming, cut the sleeping, girl
I think you need some prayer, Better call the deacon, girl
So, get your act right or else we won't be speaking, girl
So, what's it gonna be? Fikifiki, me and you?
Or is it gonna be who blames who?
I'm tired of these things, I'm tired of these scars
I think I'm gonna get me a drink, I'll call you tomorrow, oh
