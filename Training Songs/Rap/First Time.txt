See, normally a brother wouldn't talk about his first time
But I'll just be real wit' y'all and say what's on my mind
Now I remember like yesterday, just a little man
I had no clue, just quite didn't understand

Looked up to big bro for a little advice
He said, â??Young bro, whatever you do, just make sure you're strapped twiceâ??
I was a little nervous about it, bein' my first time
But I said, â??What the hell, this girl is too damn fineâ??

My very first time
In the house, on the couch, in your parent's bedroom, remember
My very first time
I can't wait till the day when I see you again, remember

My very first time
It was just that special (Special to me) to me as it was to you (Oh), girl (Yeah)
My very first time
I will never forget my first time

It was Sunday afternoon, moms and pops were gone
We had to be on the low â??cause they were on their way home
We started kissin', then it led straight to the bed
I can't believe this happened, so I'm thinkin' in my head

Lasted like a minute, but it seemed like forever
We almost got caught, but I'm just too damn clever
Her parents came home from church and I was outta there like a drop of a dime
Man, I will never forget my first time

This goes out to my folks, do you know
And you know I will see you again (See you again, no, no)
And no matter how far, people get no regrets
I will never forget (My first time)

My very (Oh, yeah) first time
In the house, on the couch, in your parent's bedroom (Remember ), remember
My very first time (I know you remember, girl)
I can't wait till the day when I see you again, remember

My very first time
It was just that special to me as it was to you, girl
My very first time
I will never forget my first time

See, some of you might have started early
Some of you started late
But I know when I started
That I thought it was great

This goes out to all my little brothers of the world
I'm sure your first time was with that special girl

Clap your hands if your remember (Clap your hands now)
Your first time (Your first time), your first time (Your first time)
Clap your hands if your remember (Clap your hands, baby)
Your first time (Your first time), your first time, baby

My very first time
In the house, on the couch, in your parent's bedroom, remember
My very first time (Oh, oh, oh, )
I can't wait till the day (Yeah) when I see you again, remember

My very first time (My first time, my first time)
It was just that special to me as it was to you, girl
My very first time (And I will never forget my first time)
