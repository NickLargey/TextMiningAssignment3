Ooh I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the n****s you've been leading on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feeding on
Got a feeling that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
You ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a f***ing read-along
Ain't a f***ing sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju' (OK I got it) then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put The Beatles on
All that s*** you talkin' bout is not up for discussion
I won't pay to make it bigger I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a n**** I don't know then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head then muhf***a' get to bustin'
Yes Lord I don't really say this often but this long dick n**** ain't for the long talkin', I beast!

Say she's from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vacate in Atlanta, then she going back to Cali mm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony I f*** 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a n**** don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick!
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar mm
AKA Benz is to me is just a car mm
That mean your friends need to be up to par
See my standards are papered by threesomes tomorrow mm
Kill 'em all dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back I'll do ya, beast!
