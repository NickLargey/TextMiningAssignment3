Young love, love, love
A teenage love
Young love
A teenage love
Young love, young love
Everything I need, I got, my young love
Young love
A teenage love

Tell me, what's the definition of love?
It seems like everybody thinks they done figured it out 
But every time they fall up in it
They fall out; in and out it again
Tell me, how they gonna know about us? 
Telling me and you that we ain't even been around long enough
We can prove 'em wrong, show 'em how it's done
I know that we can do it

'Cause it's wil'n out (we got that)
Forgiving (we got that)
If it's talkin' 'bout what we feelin' (we got that)
Just hanging out, keeping it real (we got that)
Me and you know what the deal is

[Chorus]
Since we ain't twenty-one, they be trying to say it ain't love
'Cause we can't hit the clubs, they be trying to say we too young
I ain't saying that we trying to be grown
I'm just saying that we old enough to know
We got that young love, young love
We lucky 'cause we got that young love

It's crazy how all our friends say that we gone
They still tryin' to figure us out, babe
'Cause we always together, and we don't gotta front
We ain't pretend, girl
And you know a couple of them gone hate
Talk behind your back, smile up in ya face

Girl, we can prove 'em wrong, show 'em how it's done 
And, girl, I know we can do it because

We wil'n out (we got that)
Then forgiven
If it's talkin' 'bout what we feelin' (we got that)
Just hanging out, keeping it real (we got that)
Me and you know what the deal is

[Chorus]

We can hit a show, kick it on the block
Everywhere we go, we know that we got that young love, young love, young love
Just talking on the phone, laying at the spot
No matter what we do, they know they can't stop that young love, young love, young love
(You're my young love)

[Chorus]

Young love, young love 
Everything I need, I got, my young love
Young love, young love 
Everything I want, I found in my young love
Young love, young love 
Everything I need, I got, my young love
Young love, young love 
Everything I want, I found in my young love
