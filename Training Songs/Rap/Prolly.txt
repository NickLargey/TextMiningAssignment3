(Sevyn, Gucci)
Prolly, prolly

Did I go too far tonight?
I don't know, prolly
Did I almost start a fight?
I don't know, prolly
Did I spend too much tonight?
I don't know, prolly
All these niggas tryna f*ck?
I don't know, prolly
Prolly, prolly, prolly
I don't know, prolly

Snapchat be so lit yo
Feelin' bent like a limbo, oh my
Careless hands on whips, boy
Cup filled with liquor
He roll his Swisher
She owe me like Twista, oh
Falling like that
Flirting with disaster, huh, you prolly cum fast
Hm, ha-ha-ha-ha
Get up out my face, I don't like that
I won't apologize for nothin'
I'm on the edge like a rectangle
Thinkin' outer lines or somethin'
Prolly, prolly

I'm in a 4 AAGTB, with my shooters right behind me in a SRT
AK’s, AR’s, 223’s, I’d rather hear Free Gucci than RIP’s
Neck full of stones, RIP to Pimp C
Drunk so many pints damn near OD'd
Now the feds, ATF, and the local police
Say I'm a career criminal, ACC
Party-party-party hard little nigga
I tear the club down then I shut the mall down nigga
That's your girl? That's your word? I could prolly get her
We in Californ', then I'm prolly with her
Yeah you gettin' money but I'm prolly richer
Think Chanel Blue 'cause I'm prolly bitter
The way she think about it and the way I figure
Ain't no prolly, I'm that nigga

Oh-ohh, did I go too far tonight?
I don't know, prolly
Oh-ohh, did I almost start a fight?
I don't know, prolly
Oh-ohh, all these niggas tryna f*ck?
I don't know, prolly
Oh-ohh, did I spend too much? Did I spend too much?

Where my freaks at?
Where my freaks at?
I got one bottle, two bottles
Three bottles, what's one more?
In the club now, no work tomorrow
So I ain't even turning down now
I'm already out of body
I'm already out of body
Don't blame me for my desire
When you find me, you'll find a good time
Prolly
