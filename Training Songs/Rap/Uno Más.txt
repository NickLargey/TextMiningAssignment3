Part 2

Come have a drink with me, baby
Uno más, one more
Just fill, don't think with me, lady
Singin' all night, all night 'til we go
I'll be the shrink you need lately
Just one more clink with me, baby, oh

Yo, she don't want war, we all want more
More hardcore drinks before I'm on tour
Got the kush in the cones, you know I stuff Raw
For an encore, big balling wherever I ball
I'ma keep bragging 'bout how I got here
20 year career it's always sincere
These dudes are just one hit wonders
You don't know who I am? Go ask your mothers
You got OG's, you ask your brothers
They will tell you what I did to these summers
And they gon' tell you that N.O.R.E. came to play to win
2018 feels like '98 again

Come have a drink with me, baby
Uno más, one more
Just fill, don't think with me, lady
Singin' all night, all night 'til we go
I'll be the shrink you need lately
Just one more clink with me, baby, oh

Talk so cheap, my pockets so deep
Grind all week, I hardly ever sleep
Shit ain't ever sweet, 'less it's the hotel
Top notch freak, top me off please
Talking 'bout legendary, talk about me
Talk about P and N.O.R.E.
I play the game just like I been here before
Left the team now she ain't winning no more

Come have a drink with me, baby
Uno más, one more
Just fill, don't think with me, lady
Singin' all night, all night 'til we go
I'll be the shrink you need lately
Just one more clink with me, baby, oh

I peep what you're goin' through, baby
You don't know, but it is in your eyes
I think you need a 180
The total opposite'll be nice

Come have a drink with me, baby
Uno más, one more
Just fill, don't think with me, lady
Singin' all night, all night 'til we go
I'll be the shrink you need lately
Just one more clink with me, baby, oh

Otro trago mas, y enciende
Otro trago mas, otro trago mas
Que viva mi gente

Baby conmigo pásala bien
Sabes que te voy a tratar a cien
Hagamos travesuras
Sin perce, que locura
No se ven
Soy el crema en el caldero y el sartén
Barbie yo soy ken
Fuego pa’ la hoja, te toco y te moja’
Llegamos y el lugar se desaloja
Te doy hasta que termine, escoja baby

Si no es Ferragamo es Valentino
Mami somos gangster pero finos
La mesa con DJ y botellas
Y de camino tomate otro Red Bull si mañana
Nos morimos
Da te otro trago (Uno mas)
Y vamos a viajar sin que lo notes (Uno mas)
Y que tus labios
Quiero que pidas que yo te controle (Uno mas)
