Do whatever you love and you will be free
If you can't buy happiness try to lease
Or buy a better mirror stare a little longer now

One thousand reasons to cry out
Is that a life?
A thousand reasons to smile, I tell you why
Consolation to you tears I'ma light up your way

For what its worth
You're my warrior
And I'm your worrier

Do not be confused by the murderers
Goodness is bigger than us you can't see it cause
It is silent yeah but it's feeding this world

You are not depressed cause you fell out of love
Everything is a test maybe you´re better off
What you call a problem I just call them lessons of love

For what it's worth
You're my warrior
And I'm your worrier

Come on let's take a walk
Shh don't say a word
Let's not talk
Let the silence do all the communicating tonight
Life is not just a walk in the park
I know that
But its a start right
They say silence is gold
But its kind of hard when so much remains untold
You looking the other way me kicking up dust
Blocking the sun still got shades on
Blocking our point of view
Yeah we differ a lot about what and what not´s
What we ain't and what we could have got
Thinking our arms ain't to short to box with God
This ain't a midnight stroll in Paris
More like a careless walk through a field of land mines
I cherish you
Though you are a warrior too
What are we to do

God never promised you days without pain
Laughter without sorrow
Sun without rain
But He did promise strength for you every day

Still in Tears!! Oh how can I not be sad
For my guidance was
Was upon your hands
Wrapped around, I pray, I pray you understand

For what it's worth
You're my warrior
And I'm you worrier

Te falta el aire (Do you need air?)
Te compro el viento (I'll buy the wind)
Soy tu dinero (I'll be you money)

Si yo te quiero (Now that I love you?)
Porque te vas ( Why are you leaving?)
Mi fusilero (My executioner)

Soy lo que veo (I'm what I see)
Soy lo que das (I'm what you give)
Tu prisionero (I'm your prisoner)

Lo que me diste (What you gave me)
Lo guardo adrentro (I keep it inside)
Soy tu guerrero (I'm your warrior)

From my mother I learned
Never is too late
That's its always possible to start out again
You may feel you've stopped but you're just on your way

You are not depressed
You just unemployed
This is all we got, don't you kill it boy
Everybody is in love when things are going well

For what it's worth
You're my warrior
And I'm your worrier
