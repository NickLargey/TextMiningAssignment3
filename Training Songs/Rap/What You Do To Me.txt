You don't know, hey, what you do to me (what you do to me)
Now all I see, yeah, is new to me (new to me, yeah)
Just 'cause dolla bars and Barrett Strong
Said you had done me wrong, but we'll see (we'll see), yeah
What you do to me (what you do to me)

In the meantime, in the meantime
They won't bother me

They don't bother you, well they don't bother me
Engine too loud in this brand new Ferrari V
So we couldn't hear the haters anyway, pardon me
Girls say I'm one of the biggest heart breakers arguably
Cupid shoot arrows but this girl make my heart bleed
I swear to God if I die she could make my heart beat

Beat, please resuscitate a G
Give me mouth-to-mouth or even give me south-to mouth
Damn 'cause you don't know what she do to me
She could kill my soul only thing left is a eulogy
She so hot and ain't another brother cool as me
To get her cold as me I think I gotta buy her jewelry

What she do to me you don't know, hey, 
What you do to me (what you do to me, hey)
All I see, yeah, is new to me (is new to me, yeah)
These strange colors and all the others, no, they cant see
(Done me wrong, we'll see, we'll see)
Oh mama, (oh) what you do to me (what you do to me, yeah), yeah

In the meantime, in the meantime
They don't bother me

I'm from the hell hole, the total opposite of Melrose
Is where the homies get the money through the steel doors
If you don't know me I suggest you ask your ten-four
Tell them the man here, Billy Danze here, Black Keys here
Mo-P's here, you say its poppin' if its rockin' listen we there
(You don't know)come on be clear (whatever you do to me)

You could never ruin me
I'm good, I flooded the hood like A.C.
I'm modest, so you ain't really gotta praise me
I'm the artist, that's ghetto-ly known as O.G.
With the (magnum), with forever kid (swagger) 
You could never get

You don't know, hey, what you do to me (what you do to me, hey)
All I see, yeah, is new to me (is new to me, yeah)
These strange colors and all the others, no they cant see
(Done me wrong, we'll see, we'll see)
Oh mama, (oh) what you do to me (what you do to me, yeah), yeah

In the meantime, in the meantime
They don't bother me
In the meantime, in the meantime
They don't bother me

In the meantime, in the meantime
They don't bother me
But in the meantime, in the meantime
They don't bother me

Oh in the meantime, in the meantime
They won't bother me
In the meantime, in the meantime
Don't let them bother me

In the meantime, in the meantime
They won't bother me
They won't bother me
In the meantime, in the meantime
They won't bother me
