I said we the best at making this green
I swear Mountain Dew ain't got nothing on my team
F is for the family that's holding me down
I think niggas know who run this town
A is for the action I'm all about
Blow a nigga head off, kill all the doubt
B is for the big boys with the grown money
And bad bitches who ain't gotta spend their own money
Shots of 'Tron at like four in the morn'
It ain't over til it's over, Loso I'm gone

The lights stay on, they don't fade
Take my last call, don't hold your breath
Everyday make something outta nothing
Move a mountain and still keep running
Never come down, make no mistakes

They can say they do and my eyes on the horizon
When I wake, all I see is the sun rising
Just when I thought I said all there was to say
I get the last word,
It ain't over till it's over
Just when I thought I did all there was to do
I give my best to you
It ain't over til it's over

Ooh-oh ooh-oh ooh-oh
It ain't over til it's over
Ooh-oh ooh-oh ooh-oh
It ain't over til it's over

I smoke weed, you sip on lean
People always sayin' what the hell is that mean
J is for the justice I did to the game
Lot of these niggas that's on is lame
A is for the way I airs 'em out
Coupes by the two's I pairs 'em out
D's for the dope that a nigga still pumpin'
Twelve hour shifts got the spot still jumpin'
Rockin' on til the block is gone
Thirty eight is snub nose but the choppers long

You can never chase time so they say
Well its been on my side everyday
Every second gone is another way to come up
Bend the corner, crash into the jackpot
Twists and turns I can take

They can say they do and my eyes on the horizon
When I wake, all I see is the sun rising
Just when I thought I said all there was to say
I get the last word,
It ain't over till it's over
Just when I thought I did all there was to do
I give my best to you
It ain't over til it's over

Ooh-oh ooh-oh ooh-oh
It ain't over til it's over
Ooh-oh ooh-oh ooh-oh
It ain't over til it's over
