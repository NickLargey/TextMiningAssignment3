As we approach the current time frame of 1997
With approximately two and a half years before the year two thousand
Repeatedly it has been reported that there will be
A time soon approaching
That major disaster will be striking
All levels of existence
It has also been reported that this disastrous thing will be
Approaching in the form of
Many, many as in squad
Squad as in Flipmode squad

It has also been reported that
Everyone out of the many will strike
But this particular motherfucker
Will strike with an unmeasurable blast
That will f*ck up everything
Within his 360 degree radius
Warning, prepare yourselves
Store your food, stamp your paper
Because when this motherfucker gets here
It's about to get real fucked up for
Everyone and everything, everywhere!
