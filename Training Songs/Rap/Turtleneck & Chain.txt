Turtle neck n' chain (sippin' on a light beer)

My turtleneck fat and my chain so thin,
N' I'm sippin' light beer, n my crew right here
Chain razor thin like beer in my cup,
And my sweater on turtle with the neck on puff
Huge turtle neck and my chain so skinny
Beer light all night, stand up get dizzy
Light cup, beer drink, thin so chain,
Neck turtle fat, man I won't say it again

Turtle neck n' chain
Turtle neck n' chain
Turtle neck n' chain (sippin' on a light beer)

Turtle neck (check) with another on deck
In case I spill something on it (like some light beer, yeah)
We be braggin' bout who's chain be the thinnest
Turtle neck thicker than Delta Burke
Swimming in a Guinness (now bear with me)
But they can't see my chain,
Metal so thin it dissolve when it rains
Got more chains than the snow patrol
Everyone razor thin like an insect stripper pole

Turtle neck n' chain (sippin' on a light beer)

Chain so light when police roll by, I made it flow (I made it flow)
And my beer so light you could see right through it, like a ghost
And I also wear turtle necks
Sweaters swallowing my chain like it's stuck in the couch
Looking like cookie monster flossin' his mouth
Find me coolin' on the corner sippn' light beer foam
You can tell by my turtle neck and chain that I bone
Turtle neck, light beer n' a thin ass chain, n' that's it
Turtle neck, light beer n' a thin ass chain, n' that's it

The rabbit kicked the bucket, dog said f*ck it,
Get my two step on, with my turtle neck on
Thin ass chain, light beer in my glass
Mackin' at the bitches, the ones with the ass
Girl you know it's true, tell me what it do
Oh you like my style, say you like my crew
Say you wanna' be under my chest, this turtle neck is like one of my best
Say you wanna' be under my chest, this turtle neck is like one of my best
So I guess your dress, no stress, stayin' fresh as my bandanna
Ima crook, so my look, Ima game go getta
The fatter the puppy, get the fluffy, get the bigger the turtleneck,
The more gangster it is
