[Chorus: x2]
My words are weapons, I use them to crush my opponents
These words are weapons, I never show no emotion
My words are weapons, I use them to kill who ever's steppin' to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

The rage I release on a page, is like a demon unleashed in a cage
Lunatics soon as i hit the stage, my mind is like a fuckin' stick of dynamite
Once I get behind a mic its like the wick is lit 
You bitches die tonight, my nine inch dick shinin' bright
My fuckin' grip is tighter than my wifes vagina
These cock suckin' cops got my Smith and Western
I guess its time to pick a different weapon, man this shits depressing.
But swift gettin' me a new one for a Christmas present
Come on slim lets go and teach this fuckin' bitch a lesson
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I ?
But the plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage.
Shady stay creative baby, hold your head up don't you let ?
One bit on these motherfuckin' suckers, your a soldier get up 
Stand up for what you believe in, as long as you breathin' 
They jealous of you man that the only reason they beeffin'

[Chorus: x2]

Its that Dirty dozen renegade, who done pulled the pin outta my grenade
38's so move your shit up out the way, you niggas won't forget about Mcvay 
You got summit to say let it out today or watch these bullets spray from these ten black fingers Huggin' these deadly mm's make Jeff domers think he caught a mistameaner,
See I'm dirty so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater don't lemme see you wid your heater you gets wet wid it,
Tell the motherfuckers Swift did it, packin' summit special in your crib, bitch get it,
Physically fitted to run your digits, I'm pastel with this rascal pointin' up your nostrils
You can split it and guess what we blowin' up the hospital
We wouldn't give a f*ck if you a cop or a hoe, I'm Hannibal Lector
This vinal cord disconnector findin' whores to lock them up in motels to inject her

[Chorus: x2]

I'm eatin' crews like I'm Hannibal 
There's no way I could be the gay rapper (why not) I only f*ck animals
Stupid trick got my dick startin' to itch
Went to my mothers grave site and called her a stupid bitch
One on One in this blunt sport
I'm in divorce court 
Suein' my bitch over a pack of newports
Six times I've been arrested 
How would you feel if you were a Jehovah's Witness and always gettin' molested
I'm smokin' dank and drinkin' drink, I can't have any kids 
Cause I'm fuckin' shootin' blanks
Don't you know Bizzare don't give a f*ck
Nicole's a whore I'm glad OJ murdered a slut, responsibility I'm negligent
Bill Clinton's a fag, how could Richard Simons beat the president
Call me a weirdo, call me bizarre, I stick it up your ass while you shit diarrhea

[Chorus: x2]

(yo)
