U wanna be a Grip

If U wanna be a grip and enjoy this trip 
Buy a tool belt, wear it on your hip
buy the grip book ,study real hard 
soon you'll be given out your grip card x 2

So you wanna be a grip you think that's the way
you work real hard just to earn your pay
travel the planet you work many days
carrying sands bags and setting c-stands.
You make a lot a money even write a book
maybe write a song grip as the hook.
Its hard work that I can say
by the end of the year you earn a 100K.
Its a job you can do you get free T-shirts
and expensive tennis shoes.
If this is the kind a work that appeals to you
become a grip and make movies too.

It don't matter if  you 're big or small
Black or white short or tall

And say listen kid you look real strong 
How'd you like to work on a flick of mine 
I can see that you ready for the really big time. 
Gimme a break on the rate this time 
I make it up I promise the very next time. 
You're the best grip I ever worked with, 
you're my first call and that's no trip. 
Let's do lunch. the checks in the mail, 
our accountant's out sick but what the hell.
Some words you hear day after day 
I tell you man there's work to pay . 
I'll make you huge , the distant may squeal 
Just remember dude it's a three picture deal.

Learn this Job and make your stand work
If that can't happen there's a great health plan
I'm available for work I'll be right along
Professor has to finish my grip song
So this is the song you hear so many times
Seem so easy and most of the words rhyme
Slow down don't move to fast 
You've got to make this overtime
Last time I finished before the day
Got to go home proud cause I shown the way 
But remember buy Uva's grip book
If you don't you might just look like a snook
Now I'm finished this grip song
You work hard it won't be long
You too could be just like me, who knows
You might just break a 100g
