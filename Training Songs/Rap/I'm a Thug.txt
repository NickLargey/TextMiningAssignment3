I don't know
What this world's gonna bring
But I know one thing
That this is the life for me

Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
All day, every day
Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
Wouldn't change for the world

Uh-uh, ‘cause I'm a thug
That's right you heard
Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, check it out

Could it be my baggy jeans or my gold teeth
That make me different from ya'll
Ain't trippin', dog, but listen, dog
I was raised a little different, dog
Just doin' my thang usin' my ghetto slang
And I represent thug s***
This who I roll with, watch them n****s that don't love this
N****s who out on bond, on the run and got 10 years on parole
Since you can't say it dog, I'mma say it for y'all
Motherf*** the po-pos
F*** the judge and CEOs, f*** the DA and POs
F*** the family of the victim
Witness that snitchin' a*** h**s, n****

I don't know
What this world's gonna bring
But I know one thing
What this is the life for me

Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
All day, every day
Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
Wouldn't change for the world

Uh-uh, ‘cause I'm a thug
That's right you heard
Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, check it out

See I'm so tight, n****s be like
That n**** got so many h**s
And I know he got clout, kook at his mouth
That n**** got so many golds
N****s be tellin' they h**s
To set ‘em up with that n****
B****, I've been watchin' you watchin' him
You must want to f*** this n****
My name alone been known to break up happy homes
No disrespect, dog, but you ain't had no business even answerin' her phone
If your a** was home
Then me and her, kid, been gettin' it on
And you couldn't have been hittin' her right
‘Cause ever since the night she been hittin' the phones
She want a thug

I don't know
What this world's gonna bring
But I know one thing
That this is the life for me

Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
All day, every day
Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
Wouldn't change for the world

Uh-uh, ‘cause I'm a thug
That's right you heard
Baby, why ‘cause I'm a thug
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, check it out

Since y'all n****s want to smoke the blunts, tote the guns
I'mma show you how to thug it, dog
Give me half a pill and some Zinfandel, and I'm like, “F*** it, dog”
As long as my ecstasy got the best of me
And none of you n****s ain't stressin' me
I got one request in this b****
You can have the rest of this s***
If a n**** drop some s***, it's whack as hell
And don't make no damn sense
Take it back, talk about it and tell your dog don't even buy that s***
And I don't care who he is or where he from
I represent thug s***
And you ain't gotta give me my props or nominate me
‘Cause damn it I love this

I don't know
What this world's gonna bring
But I know one thing
That this is the life for me

Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
All day, every day
Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
Wouldn't change for the world

Uh-uh, ‘cause I'm a thug
That's right you heard
Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, check it out

I don't know
What this world's gonna bring
But I know one thing
That this is the life for me

Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
All day, every day
Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
Wouldn't change for the world

Uh-uh, ‘cause I'm a thug
That's right you heard
Baby, ‘cause I'm a thug
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, check it out
