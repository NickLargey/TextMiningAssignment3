[Patra] 
Yeah, this is the real vibes, okay? 
To all the man and the 'oman dem out there 
This the word 
The original jazz and the reggae vibe 
Yeah, watch this

[Big Shug] 
Young ladies, fly ladies, young ladies in the house

[Patra]
Yeah, this is Patra, the Queen of the Dancehall 
Teamin' up with Guru, of course

[Big Shug] 
Young ladies, fly ladies, young ladies in the house

[Patra]
Bad, bad by law, you no say you're da numba one 
Trust me
Watch dis!

[Guru] 
Come on, take a ride with the lyrical five foot eight 
And three-quarter warrior; I saw you pass me in the corridor 
P.O.W. - the eye to eye contact was all that
I dug your little steelo; fine, you dug mine
You want my digits?  I'm with it (take it)
You could ring me up whenever; whatever's clever (One time)

[Big Shug]
Stroll your way; you know you want me (Bo!) 
So bring your game over here to the bar 
You know you want to sit and hang with the star 
Maybe get a new house, and a brand, new, car! (a-hah-hah) 
But the price ain't right
'Cause I ain't your size, baby, and I ain't your type 

[Kool Keith]
Check it 
Your honey's fly, but she wants me; I'm all that 
She's perpetratin' like she never even heard the record 
Or saw the video, or heard the loudspeakers 
You got the TV; your whole family did see me

[Big Shug] 
Young ladies, fly ladies, young ladies in the house

[Kool Keith]
Cool Keith in the house with Shug and Guru 
Primetime jazz and limousines gettin' to you

[Big Shug] 
Young ladies, fly ladies, young ladies in the house

[Patra]
Okay, check dis, baby, way up top 'bove

[Guru] 
Baby, you look good in that dress 
Let's get out of here and take it back to my rest 
I don't think I'm bein' too forward 
Would I like to break out right now?  Yeah, I sure would (ah-hah) 
I dig the way you be lookin' at me 
Dig your confidence; you want me, it's evident (trust me)

[Big Shug]
My man told me that you like me 
You want to write me, 'cause you heard I have a wifey 
But I'm on some mo' straight up stuff 
I get witchu and probably spend a little while 
Somewhere in the park after dark 
Incognito; that's how I flow

[Kool Keith] 
Well, I'm here for you
Are you there?  Where? 
Takin' peeks, and sneakin' winks; whatever brotherman thinks 
You on a mission for famous people in position 
Holdin' in your love, admirin' what I'm doin 
Gettin' through in time and time 
She follows us backstage, yeah
 
[Patra] 
First day, guess what Guru said to me?
Dark and lovely, how could you be?
It is right for me
Because, whiny, whiny, me whiny sexy
All de man - dem just-a rush me

[Guru] 
Check it out 
The time is right; you hold me tight (my love) 
In the twilight, away from the spotlight 
We can explore mysteries that last all night (trust me) 
Nobody has to know but us 
Honey, you know I'm the man 
Baby, for you I got big plans (eh, eh) 

[Big Shug]
You say I'm just a lonely man (no more) 
But tomorrow I'll be your king; the ruffneck swing 
You know me from my name on the streets 
You want to be with me; it's easy to see 
Since you kissed me on the cheek 
Now you want to be my everyday freak (hah hah!)

[Kool Keith] 
Lookin' at me, my man and him, my man and him 
Champagne pop; don't waste time; you can get with him (meow) 
We got some drinks; you lookin' at the fine wine 
Eye contact is on; all I see is sihlouette 
Sheer plastic; freaky so fantastic (it's like dat) 
I want to touch it, see if it's real 
True at heart, I want to see how you really feel 
Take off your mask and reveal...

[Patra] 
Tell dem come wind 
Only if you can make her feel fine 
Y'know, because,
Eyes are watchin' me 
Every single step I take 
Eyes are watchin' me 
They are countin' my mistake, jump! 
Him up, and now dey flip the script 'pon cha chill 
Steppin' to you like medicated thrills 
Dey can not wait; come in from it his eyes 
Anything not lay ya to smile ya analyze, Bo! 
I was born in a ruff neighborhood 
Steppin' up in light, now it feels good 
No one is gonna stop me, no matta what dem say 
An' if I'm da rockin', then I must DJ, 'cause 
Eyes are watchin' me 
Every single step I take 
Eyes are watchin' me 
They are countin' Guru mista-ake 
Eyes are watchin' me 
True me nice, and me love come wind 
And me both love mashin'
Eyes are watchin' me 
They love Queen Patra, 'cause I earn it an' 
Guru and all-stars, ya large, in a dance 
And the stars of reggae music, they large! 
The original niceness 
And Patra never the one to front, okay?
