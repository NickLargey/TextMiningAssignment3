I just wanna ball in the wraith
With your broad in the way
And I wanna, I'ma take my shot
I pray to God, is it all in a day
Leave your daughter with the papers
F*ck a hater 'til the day I die
F*ck what them bitches saying, f*ck what them niggas doing
Before you were getting going, I was getting to it

Put it down, bankrolls in the neighborhood
Was catching cases, before I got to get some paper good
Lil homie asked me 'On God do you know you came up?'
I said you deal with every bitch who wearing lace front
I don't like her, feel that way about a lot of rappers
I don't talk about 'em
Most these niggas ain't gon' bust a grape, and, they just talking loud
Godbody, got a problem, nigga go to war about it
Hm, having problems understanding your logic
Man, for four hundred, I'll take your honey and tour London
Get some more money
Don't believe it well you a dummy
Ain't no pun intended
Military guns in the mansion
Ain't no runnin' in it
A rebel when I fucked that bitch
It ain't no coming in it
Since my first album, I been serious
Ain't no funny business
Bitch, ain't no funny business
No weapon, against me shall prosper
But it's welcome to form
Knew from the day I was born I'd perform in the Forum
Ringing bells and blowing horns when my name called
I'm just a self-made nigga in the wraith though

Street form reppin'
Not a stone in a watch, no charm on the necklace
They say I'm reckless, yeah, I might be
Don't give a f*ck about no nigga who don't like me
Know If I go to jail today, that bitch gon' write me? No
She gon' f*ck me? No, if a nigga go broke
I bet a Wraith on the super bowl
In the kitchen, super cold
Six ounce, four pints, that's a super stove
I always had a plaque and a hit
Boy, I bet I had a MAC and some bricks
If it's stars in the wraith, got the titles in the safe
Got the lawyers on deck, got the money for the case
Truck, truck, Lambo
Guns, guns, ammo
Me and Black Youngsta, back to back cause that's my fam-o
He a white man, kill him
For his shit, she want a check for the pussy
That's that out the North shit

Presidential swag
In the slum with the hairnet
Running up a bag, do it for 'em just to pass out
Dab in my bag, give it to her, wear her ass at?
Dick game great, give it to her till she pass out
This the real caine, add B12, pour baking soda
Stretch a quarter out a whole, and no details (No!)
Shout to all my niggas, who legitimized they figures
Now they rich and you just get it out the Blue
Now he ridin' in the Rolls Royce
Came out the bottom, now he making more ain't no boy
Always been a hustler, not a robber, I never stole nothing
Trappin', flippin' work till they come up on a whole one
Huh ok, K-I-N-G, can't deny me
Niggas still rhymin' 'bout what we did in the 90's, nigga
Yeah, see it on my face, dawg
I'm just a real nigga riding ridin' under Wraith stars
