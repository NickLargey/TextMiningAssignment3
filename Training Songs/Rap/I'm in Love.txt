As the day goes by I'm always thinking of your face
Your hair, your eyes, your sweet lips, and the way they taste
You got me going on a high that I have never felt
A beautiful thing (Not like the same thing)
This thing we've got it so amazing what I love the most
It's how we can talk and how we laugh and the fact we're so close
It's illusion but it's magic 
No tricks involved 
With you I got it all (With you I got it all)

[Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love
Do you hear me?
Was so scared
Not prepared 
But it just hit me
Glad it's us now I'm good
I'm so in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
And it's a good thing
Many miss out on things
Real lovers bring
Glad it's us now I'm good
I'm so in love

In my mind I'm in a world alone just you and I
You're my Eve and I'm your Adam so let's start new life
It's the way you make me feel like a new beginning girl
In all different ways (So many different ways)
You was still strong and had my back now the foundations laid
And I wanna spend the rest of my life just fulfilling you
With everything you want everything you need

[Chorus]

It's one of those things and
It's real hard to explain but
It's real and fills your heart
And hearts just don't lie no
You will know real love
Cause nothing feels like it and
It touches things inside
It's a real experience

Oh [Repeats]

[Chorus]
