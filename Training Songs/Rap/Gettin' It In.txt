Yo, you know me I'm with the ghetto diva, stiletto fever
Jello shots, yellow reefer
Same rules apply, I'm back on top,
You can't drink or smoke if you not gon' pop.
See me in the popcorn drop, not gon' stop
Takin' shots of Patron, gettin' top on yachts.
The medallions are mountin' rock on rock
The whole world want to know when this lock gon' drop
Without a doubt she acknowledge the wealth
Since she ain't get brains I told her, let me get knowledge yourself
I told be proud of yourself and dig deep,
And try and see what you can get out of yourself
After all that, I told her to fall back 
The Ferrari truck parked in the back is all black
Next time, bring some friends and more 'gnac
It depends how I feel in the morn if I call back, what

Now is it just me or do them Uggs have girls feet lookin' like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme with a name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try an treat me like I ain't famous.
My apologies are you into astrology 'cause, um, I'm trying to make it to Uranus 
See that's a little Don Juan game,
All across your chest like Sean Jean name
Niggas tryin' to figure out, since kan' came
Who's the rookie of the year, me or Lebron James
They say whoa, don't get caught up in the hype.
Ain't no tellin' they gon' love you after tonight.
Well if tonight's the night, pop bottles f*ck models
Spend money til your broke, my nigga live your life

She see me roll up the bud, then thug out the club 
'Cause I got my men's with me
She said she leaving her friends for me, they ain't gettin' in with her 
'Cause she goin' bend for me
Her tongue spin like a rim for me, do what she can for me, 
Look like a 10 for me
Now shorty is out with me using her mouth for me,
