Yes love may I respond, to the train that you came on
I know I said some things but I was wrong
Laying in bed thinking about it
I never knew you’d get a hold of my soul
Maybe we were lovers in a different life
I’m sure we were loving in a different time
I can hear the message I can see the sign
Must be brail I read it in your touch
The God of lust had a laugh on us
We tried but couldn’t get enough
Sitting here pressing rewind, hitting replay, the way we laid
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again

I’m with it babe, baby 
I’m with it babe, baby 
I’m with it babe
I’m with it baby
I’m with it baby

Cupid got me shot me with the 45v
Big insurgent anytime we inside
Soon come lover and know a no dat me no lie
Check the time, gym status
I think I like what we creating
Monet would say, ey ok.
Mummy would say go baby
I know why Cee Lo crazy
Sitting here pressing rewind, hitting replay, the way we laid
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again

I’m with it babe, baby 
I’m with it babe, baby 
I’m with it babe
I’m with it baby
I’m with it baby
