Verse One:

People often see me in jams, and be thinkin I'm high
No that just be my lazy eye
What's your reply to the evidence against you
Your girlfriend found one hand just one loan credit
Exclaimed you was fuckin you claim downtown
where Fred can beat that, win that, quick nigga wins the ballgames
Tailwind nose is a must on any con any truck
When riding on luck you catch an empty
Riding on the wave is real good, suave bola
You be playin the low low, while your girlfriend be like, "Oh no!"
I seen it with my own eyes and I know that it was him
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
Episodes of Free Willy bring strife in your life
You can flip and use the gift of gab, but don't waver
If you love your girlfriend, then you better save her
Cause the next man is eager, to run up in yours
Be in her drawers, put your girl on her fours
Sometime's the girls game's tighter than a sloppy ass nigga
I got my girl locked down hey that's the truth nigga
She gone away for the weekend, man she right uptown
Runnin around with my man Boogie Brown
I keep your arms in the air, your feet on the floor
While you're over there frontin with these kids
your girl's givin jaw

Chorus:

I been doin my own thing (2X)

Verse Two:

Oh you got your own dough, from where I don't know
You hold degrees from two universities
Girl you're worth cheese in the nine-seis
Sadat owns apartment keys, is it Alize for Dolo
You got a mind on top of that spine plus the lump lump
Highly educated and highly motivated
Workin girl skirt tight love to hurt
What to exert, I break your next man's pocket
Smell of freak fragrant, unlike the vagrant
You can pay the rent always, and don't be gettin hallways
In the bed girlie and at work by nine
Put on the work force ridin on a iron horse
Bring it home to dad, the one piece cause I'm here
Workout baby doll and keep yo' career
No chiggedy, no diggedy, not you
Glad that I got you, when I did
Cause you was runnin wild with this out of style kid, no class
Light in the ass, white enough to pass
Shotproof glass for the midnight mass

Chorus

Verse Three:

I have seen this chick at the bar, furiously she was searchin
She want to wet her whistle with the glass of bubbly
She want the Willie Dom not the cheap sherry
Tryin to front with the outfit that's goin back tomorrow
Now she's makin me dream, if she played to force it
Dom she want to toss it, back in that
Jet when the bottle's gone and that's a fact
Give you the wrong number knowin it's the wrong number
Front on a nigga never that, not I
If you see me at the bar it's dry throat
because I'm keepin these hoes dry
Hey lookie there there's Harlem Slim!
Lookin at me, but then you're walkin with him
I be a little old for them young girl games
I know a lot of tricks but I ain't namin no names
One burnt my man, left his beef in flames
Actin ill wild like the untamed dames
Just came to mingle where I flowed the river Thames
When I was young in the clubs they played Cool James
Get rich without jail, is one of my aims
You remember Good Times, with courderoy jeans

Chorus (repeat 2.5X)
