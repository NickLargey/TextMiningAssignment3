My buddy and kid sister
You and me, 
Get down like two slacks on the side of the street
First I gave my heart
Then I gave you the key
Then I stepped up to the plate
And gave you all of me
You had me fallen like some leaves in the summer
You had me fixin' things like I was a plumber
You do the math, man around the house
I did it all for you, baby what you talkin' bout
I started out talkin' to your best friend
Next thing I knew you was my girlfriend
Now I got beef wit your ex boyfriend
But its all good because, your my baby
It ain't no problem baby blu can't solve,
Cause I relieve headaches without Tylenol
With you on the sideline, ya boy goin' ball
I'll give you my all

You'll be my girlfriend
And I'll be you boyfriend
Lets make it official,
Cause I want you girl
You'll be my girlfriend
And I'll be your boyfriend
Lets make it official
Cause I want you girl
(your my baby)

I know you used to me being slick and slimy
Comin' home late
When I'm with the boys I'm shining
Baby girl, what's wrong
We started like a nappy head to a hot comb
One minute I'm dead, the next I'm gone
I gave you a shoulder to lean on
A team to be on
I got your head spinning like a bottle of rum
Lets get it on,
Beat the ? while I'm in the zone
I'm ready to come home
To see my queen on the throne

You'll be my girlfriend
And I'll be you boyfriend
Lets make it official,
Cause I want you girl
You'll be my girlfriend
And I'll be your boyfriend
Lets make it official
Cause I want you girl
(your my baby)

I really want you baby(want you baby)
I need you in my life(in my life)
I got to have you honey
I want to spend some time
Girl I want you like the new j's
Your sweeter than candy
Your fine like wine
Girl your one of a kind
So fine, I think about you all the time
Your always on my mind

You'll be my girlfriend
And I'll be you boyfriend
Lets make it official,

You'll be my girlfriend
And I'll be your boyfriend
Lets make it official
