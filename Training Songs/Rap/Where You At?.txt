[verse 1]
Sister ain?t down for that stay up in my room 24/7
Yeah I stay in da lab w/ a pen and a pad
Cuz music was all I had
So God gifted my music God be gifting
Yeah they be tripin on all the music that I be mixin
It can be hip hop or r&b and I can rap the mic you see
Got any questions go head and give me a ring
I can make a beat for you and damnit it?s best
I?m the best and I?ll have you stress go head and give me a test
Cuz it?s right here I guarentee that I can prove it
I don?t need no one to make my music
Cuz I write it produce it
And to those who had money but wouldn?t bring me up
Now you stuck so can you tell me wut
Wut wut tell me

[chorus 6x]
Now what where you at?
 Now what where you at?
 Now what where you at?
 I?m way in the front you way in the back
Now what where you at?
 Now what where you at?
 Now what where you at?
 Huh huh where you at?

 See everything I do is with my blood sweat and tears
Give you what I feel make you love what you hear
That no one in this world would ever bring me down
Five years from now still be in town breaking it down
Nothing but grand material bump this shit in your sterio
Got you wanting sterical cuz my shit so lyrical
To all the men who said they put my foot in the door
Just took my music now it?s me they ignore
Tell everyone they didn?t know what wasn?t so
They told me I was worth much much more
They said I deserve my big chance
So I signed that contract and now I?m set 10 years in advanced
To those who didn?t give a suck I wish you luck
Now can you please tell me what wut wut tell me wut

[chorus 4x]
Now what where you at?
 Now what where you at?
 Now what where you at?
 I?m way in the front you way in the back
Now what where you at?
 Now what where you at?
 Now what where you at?
 Huh huh where you at?
