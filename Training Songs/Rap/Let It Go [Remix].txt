[Keyshia Cole & T.I.]
You need to get if he don't wanna (Aye, Aye, Keyshia Cole)
Love you the right way he ain't gonna (Aye, Aye, Grand Hustle)
It ain't where he's at its where he (you know me it's the King!)
Where he wanna be (Young Dro, alright now, remix)

[Young Dro]
Face it
I'm racin' around wit lil shawty
See me at the mall bustin' it down wit lil' shawty
I took her out to Cabo and shot that Balenciago
I showed her how them four tangles looks up in the Gallardo
Why tho
My girl she be makin' me feel right
I mess around wit shawty she be makin' me feel like
I can have somethin' so we bond and let it go
But after while you gon' have to go on and let it go

[Keyshia Cole]
I understand why you wanna try
Make him stay home late at night
But if wanna go he'll be gone no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinkin' about mine and where he might be
Remember when I gave everything I got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How ya love someone who didn't love me

But now I get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at it's where he
Where he wanna be

[Chorus: x2]
If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go (If he ain't gonna)
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go (If he ain't gonna)

When this song come on in the club
They goin' be like
Damn that's hot
And when they play it in they car
They goin' drop they tops like
Damn that's hot
They goin' mix it wit Biggie "It was all a dream" like
Damn that's hot
Me and Keyshia won't stop
Til the tick don't tock like
Damn that's hot (remix)

[Keyshia Cole]
See you been trying to make me feel like
You don't love me anymore
And you been trying to make me feel that
You don't need me anymore
But baby I won't let you play games
You wanna leave then you can go
I know ya heard (Grand Hustle)
It ain't where he's at (Grand Hustle)
It's where he wanna be (Grand Hustle)

[T.I.]
(Aye, Aye, Aye)
My phone stay ringing
Even though my girl got a ten-carat ring and the stone stay blingin'
Them hoes stay schemin'
I see it in they eye when I'm leanin' in the ride cuz the chrome stay blingin'
See 'em champagne wishing
Cavaiar dreamin'
To kick it with the king they all really are feenin'
So they lie for no reason
Drops all hatin'
Wishin' they was in ya situation
So that's why we take two vacations
One wit all the kids
Then one with all the strippers that ya crew stay chasin'
Chillin' in the cane
Far away from fame
And all the other situations weighin' heavy on the brain
And now we margarita drinkin'
Champaign poppin'
All night pool parties
Got big things poppin'
6 G's in the pool
Just get naked 'fore you hop in
Topsand bottles
Hoes spots just holla, Aye

[Chorus: x2]

(Hands up in the air)
When this song come on in the club
They goin' be like
Damn that's hot
And when they play it in they car
They goin' drop they tops like
Damn that's hot
They goin' mix it wit Biggie "It was all a dream" like
Damn that's hot
Me Kim and Keyshia don't stop
Til the tick don't tock like
Damn that's hot (that's hot that's hot that's hot)
