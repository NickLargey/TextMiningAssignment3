Hey, you could smoke a spliff with a cliff
But there's still no mountain high enough, or wide enough to touch
The naughty nappy nasty nigga the nasty trashy hoe happy pappy
That's Happi to be Nappi
Me and Vin rock when spots hit flocks
And groups and troops with Timbo boots and jail suits
That's how I'm rollin my hair-do don't
Win I will I got wanting competition ain't dope
Beat ya break ya broke ya smoke ya take ya
Send you to your little group on mute, sooner or later
When want to flip, tell em full semi half with a dip
And all that other Ringling Brothers shit
Sporty naughty hi bye greater than nature while I
Shin slam the film filmg and then jam
You can run but you can't hide, you can't go far
No matter where you go, there you are

We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash

Here we go yo
Hit a nigga kill a nigga will come back
See a sucker stretch a sucker guard your naps
Cussing wasn't nothing til a black man rapped
See a forty suck a forty guess who's back

You're chilling with a Teddy filling villain
Stepping to the puny puddy punks catching fillings
I hit so many guts, call me gutter, I'm the bread and butter
Punk motherfucker I'll cut up, working from the gut up
Brand new steady, heavy as a Chevy
Ready for the piddy peddy, I'm Friddie Freddie
Place your bet on a vet, the three man threat
What you see is what you get

We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash

Coming round your corner with my uptown bunch
I bet your bottom dollar that you're bottom buck chumps
Give it up, it's a juice thing I'm stepping for the rep and
Wrecking all the rest and, weapon testing on who's stepping
Ain't no bluff for the niggy 'nough, for the rugged ruff stuff
Nigga if you're tough knuckle up
I'll cut your ass like class, then blast you by the trash
After I laugh then I'll dash
You can't handle the scandal of an uptown vandal
Shooting up your toes making sandals
Somebody told me that you owe me, but can't nobody hold me
I do my dirt all by my lonely

We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash
