(Cannon, Cannon)
Yeah, doughboy, this is the official hustler's anthem (ayy)
You gettin' money? Throw it in the air 

Guess who's bizzack? 
Still smell the blow in my clothes
Like Krispy Kreme, I was cookin' them O's (cookin' them O's)
Like horseshoes, I was tossin' them O's
Time to re-up, gotta recycle the flow (recycle the flow)
I'm emotional, I hug the block (ayy)
I'm so emotional, I love my Glock
Cash rules everything around me, so what's realer?
'Bout the skrilla, call me a Ghostface Killa (yup)
It's kinda hard to be drug-free
When Georgia Power won't give a nigga lights free
Switched hustles, been killin' 'em ever since
Get paid to tell the truth, dog, it only makes sense

When they play that new Jeezy, all the dope boys go crazy (yeah)
Now watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar, then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club, pimpin', doin' my thang, ayy (ayy)
When they play that new Jeezy, all the dope boys go crazy (yeah)
Now watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop your collar, then you swing your chain
For all the gangstas in the street that be doin' they thang, ayy (ayy)

Buy eighteen the hard way (let's get it)
And have a humble nigga thinkin' 'bout gun play (yeah)
Now who the f*ck wanna play with guns?
A lot of holes, a lot of blood, dawg, the shit ain't fun (nope)
So I suggest you don't play with my chains
I'll send these hollows at ya, let 'em play with ya brains (that's right)
The streets is watchin', the name is warm
The product's white, a star is born (yeah)
Pimpin', I'm so fly 
If I take this parachute off, I might fall and die (damn)
Wrap the work like spandex with the latex (yeah)
Then we ship it out of town, call it safe sex (ayy)

When they play that new Jeezy, all the dope boys go crazy (yeah)
Now watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar, then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club, pimpin', doin' my thang, ayy (ayy)
When they play that new Jeezy, all the dope boys go crazy (yeah)
Now watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop your collar, then you swing your chain
For all the gangstas in the street that be doin' they thang, ayy 

Uh, more than a hustler, I'm the definition of it
Master chef, lord of the kitchen cupboard
More than a street legend, homey, it's Hova
More than a relief pitcher, I'm the closer
The Mariano of the Mariott
If money talks, the whole world's about to hear me out
See, I'm a hustler's hope, I'm not his pipe dreams
So when they speak of success, I'm what they might mean
Attract money, my worst color is light green
My favorite hue is Jay-Z Blue
Don't follow me, youngin', follow my moves, I'm not a role model
A bad influence, got the world drinkin' gold bottles
When Puff was in that tub spillin' Mo'
I was at my video, Cris' on the speedboat
In My Lifetime, nigga, go do your research
St. Thomas, my nigga, that was me first
Chrome-shoe'd the GS, I came feet-first
In the game like a baby born to breach birth
I got the keys if you need work
I can kingpin you a line, a dime at a time, uh
My niggas love it when I talk like this
My corporate people start buggin' 'cause I talk like this
The corporate thugs is like, "Nah Hov, talk that shit
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy Jay-Z"
See I'ma '80s baby, master of Reaganomics
School of Hard Knocks, every day is college
You ain't did nothin' I ain't did, nigga, pay homage
Or pay the doctor, I sprayed llamas
Still, the time'll reveal, you know I'm bein honest
Y'all ain't pull my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check
They say the truth shall come to the light
So everybody grab your shades cause your boy that bright good night

When they play that new Jeezy, all the dope boys go crazy (yeah)
Now watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar, then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club, pimpin', doin' my thang, ayy (ayy)
When they play that new Jeezy, all the dope boys go crazy (yeah)
Now watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop your collar, then you swing your chain
For all the gangstas in the street that be doin' they thang, ayy
