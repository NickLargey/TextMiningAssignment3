Johnny played the rebel - huntin' for a cause 
Sh-sh-sh-short fuse fused dynamite hungry for a spark - ooh yeah 
His 9 mil. Loaded with borrowed time 
Bad boy swore he couldn't die 
'Till he faced a man a little bit quicker on the draw 

He tried to steal his destiny 
He bragged of immortality 
Now he ain't that tough six feet deep 

Short rides on the glory train 
Through dead end streets of no escape 
Lyin' in the bed you made on a ship 
That came in too late 
You're running out of time 
You're running out of time 

Jenny came home from the ritzy side of town 
D - drove her mommy's Benz - 
Lived in Daddy's great big house - ooh yeah 
She hawked her gold to feed the spike 
A great escape on the pony ride 
'Cuz Mom and Dad wouldn't let their little baby out 

When China White`s your lyin' friend 
You've sold you soul when the party ends 
And you're dancing blind on the razor`s edge 

You and me are victims of our blood 
Haunted by the ghosts of who we loved 
Our parents sing that same old song 
"Where the Hell did we go wrong?" 
Just take a look in the mirror Mom and Dad! 

Don't look back it burns your eyes 
You can't win if you don't try 
Only you control your life 

Don't you know you're runnin' out of time? 
Wake up! Wake up! God dammit wake up! 
You're running out of time 
You're running out of time 
You're running out of time time time
