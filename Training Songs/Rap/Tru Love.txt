Six Years five months
That's how long we've been havein' this thing
We've got every moment hasn't been perfect
But still when it's perfect it feels
Like we're the only people who have somethin' real
Now 3 years two weeks
That's how long we've been raisin' our family
And I wouldn't go tradin
The love we got
So don't go changin'
I love you just the way you are

[Chorus]
It's true love
When you say I need me like the way i need you
And you can't be without me
Like I can't be without you
It's true love
When we spend time talking on the phone
Cause when we're not around each other you don't want to be alone
It's true love, love, love, love
Don't you know it's good to be in love, love, love, love
Just believe me truthfully cause
Love is never ever makin you cry
Before I tell you a lie
I'll give you my life
Cause that true love

Now when the love is right
Somehow you just know
Because you hold it tight
And you don't want to let it go
And it's so deep inside of you that
You just can't take it cause it fills up your heart
And you just, you can't replace it alone
Somebody's makin love
Non-stop tonight
And And they can't make enough
I know what it feels like
Grab your lover by the hand
Say that you understand
How love really works
So good that it hurts

[Chorus]

Cause I don't need nobody but you in my life oh baby
Those of you who understand what I'm sayin'
Sing along with me say
Cause I don't need nobody but
You in my life oh baby
Those of you who understand what I'm sayin'
Let me hear you say true love

[Chorus]
