Yes
Don't close the door
Listen, I've been waitin' to tell you this
You are more than a man could ever want
Wait a minute, just let me
Listen

Bomp, bomp-bomp, bomp-bomp-bomp, mmm
Bomp, bomp-bomp, bomp-bomp, mmm
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah
Bomp, bomp-bomp, bomp-bomp-bomp, mmm
Bomp, bomp-bomp, bomp-bomp, mmm
Yeah, babe

I stepped in the club in your hood
I slowly turned left and there you stood
You and your friends talkin'
But when our eyes connect, I knew then
It was just like two-ways on beam
I'm your king, be my queen
And what do you wanna do tonight?
My truck is parked out front, so let's ride

I can read your mind, babe (oh)
I know what you're thinkin' (I know what you're thinkin', babe)
It's alright (with me, baby)
It's alright, yes
I can read your mind, babe (I can)
I know what you're thinkin' (I know what you're thinkin', babe)
It's alright (with me, yeah, yeah)
It's alright, yes

So, baby, take a ride with me
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
And when the rain starts pourin' down
Then all the love that's lost will be found
I'll make your mind lose control
Over your body, that's my goal
So, baby, just come and down here
Just let the gravity pull you near

I can read your mind, babe (I can)
I know what you're thinkin' (I know what you're thinkin')
It's alright (can you feel me? Yeah)
It's alright, yes (ooh, baby)
I can read your mind, babe (just me and you right now)
I know what you're thinkin' (I got an idea, babe, yeah)
It's alright (oh, yeah)
It's alright, yes

I know you wanna rub
I know you wanna touch
I know you wanna feel
So, baby, keep it real
I know you wanna see
I know you wanna be
In my B-E-D, grindin' slowly
I know you wanna rub
I know you wanna touch
I know you wanna feel
So, baby, keep it real
I know you wanna see
I know you wanna be
In my B-E-D, grindin' slowly

I can read your mind, babe (I can read it)
I know what you're thinkin' (and I know)
It's alright (you see, I know that you know, 'cause I can feel it too, babe)
It's alright, yes
I can read your mind, babe (just me and you, yeah)
I know what you're thinkin' (I know, yeah)
It's alright (oh, oh, yes)
It's alright, yes

Wanna love, baby
(That's what I wanna do to you)
Wanna feel you
(If you come, if you come)
Wanna love, baby
(Oh, oh-oh, yeah)
Wanna feel you 
(I wanna feel you, girl)
Wanna love, baby
(Come on and go with me)
(I want you to stay with me)
Wanna feel you
('Cause it's alright with me)
(Listen, baby)
Wanna love, baby
(Come on and go with me)
(I want you to stay with me)
