Once she grin, I'm in, game begin
Man, I met this bitch one time
I mean man this chick so fine
I just had to f*ck this bitch one time

I caught her at the mall goin' shoppin'
Shorty had six bags, strugglin' and still coppin'
Cute face, slim waist, body proper
Hair fell short to her shoulders, I had to stop her

I had to add that to the roster
And me leavin' without that there was not a option
Excuse me miss, please take no offense
But I'm shoppin' for a lady friend about your size

I saw somethin' that could be a 4, if you could try that on
Shit, I could peep the fit before I buy it for her
She smiled and tried it on with no problem
Stepped out lookin' like the next top model

Damn, I told the salesclerk to give me two
And told ma for all your work, this one's for you
You keep it, that'll be our little secret
Now peep it, to make this long story shorter
I ain't get shorty name 'til the next mornin'

Once she grin, I'm in, game begin
Once she grin, I'm in, game begin
Once she grin, I'm in, game begin

Man, you know that chick that time
I said I had to stick that time
I fucked the bitch about six times
Now she on my phone every hour

Cussin' out her man, talkin' 'bout he a coward
Bitch please, she said that I'm all that she need
Indeed, I showed her that I was built for speed
I'm heavy, I'm somethin' like a '55 Chevy

And now I'll make my class no more, I'm quite sure
I'm somethin' she never had before, I'm that boy
'Cause once they grin, I'm in, game begin
Y'all dudes spit that same lame to them

Please, you niggaz ain't nothin' like Sig'
Man, I run through these chickens like fresh white tees
Keep 'em in check like fresh Nikes
And once again when they grin, I run 'em in

Once they grin, I'm in, game begin
Once they grin, I'm in, game begin
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind
Once they grin, I'm in, game begin

I'm the master, I'm somethin' like a pussy connoisseur
Faggot, you somethin' like a pussy kind of whore
Chit-chattin' at bitches, yip-yappin' with niggaz
About this and that, how your chips be stacked

I keep a bitch on her back, put her face in the pillow
You give a bitch all your trap, keep your face in the middle
Of her puss, while her mouth full of cupids
You useless, I abuse 'em then I lose 'em

I'm ruthless but nothin' like Eazy
I keep a pocket full of Magnums, believe me
I keep these whores chasin'

Short money, long conversation, they gets nothin'
You know the rules, a whore gets none
Hard dick and bubblegum
And I just chewed my last stick is where I'm comin' from

Once they grin, I'm in, game begin
Once they grin, I'm in, game begin
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind
Once they grin, I'm in, game begin
