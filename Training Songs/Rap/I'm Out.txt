Ladies, it's your song
So as soon as this come on
You should get out on the floor
Gon' and get your sexy on
If you know that you better
Then the new girl that he on
Go 'head and tell him now
"You gon' miss me when I'm gone"

Aye yo, Ci Ci
Let me show you how to do a singin' bitch, greasy
You was by Lennox, yeah the one on Peachtree
I was with Demetri
Seen you on your Love & Hip Hop, Mendecees
"F-f-f-f*ck these petty niggas" is a bitch motto
If I say it on wax, every bitch follow
If I'm sippin' in the club, Myx Moscato
I got a big fat ass, big dicks follow
Hit him with the back shots
Hit him with the ass shots
Take him to the bank then I hit him with cash shots
I do it big, I hit him with the caps lock
I'm gonna ball, I hit him with the mascot
No, I never been there, but I like to Bangkok
Big fat titties when they hangin' out my tanktop
You gon' play me
On Instagram niggas tryna shade me
But your bitch at home tryna play me
I'm Nicki M Weezy F, baby
Man, f*ck you and your lady
Gun butt you, 'cause you shady
Now which bitch want it?
'Cause that bitch get it
I gave him to you bitch
Don't fucking forget it

Celebratin' our breakin' up, oh whoa
Bartender go 'head and pour me a little more
Tonight we gon' have us a good time
Let's have a toast to our goodbyes, oh whoa
Ladies, it's your song
So as soon as this come on
You should get out on the floor
Gon' and get your sexy on
If you know that you better

"You gon' miss me when I'm gone" (I'm out)

We standin' up on all the couches (Ooh yay-yay-yay)
Tomorrow you gon' hear about this (Ooh yay-yay-yay)
This is what you hearin' through your speakers (Ooh yay-yay-yay)
That's why we dancin' til our feet hurt (Ooh yay-yay-yay)
See I found out he was my problem (Ooh yay-yay-yay)

Wishin' you could get it get it (whoa)
No-o-o-o-oo, No-o-o-o-oo

When you see me, see me
You got your hand out, talkin' 'bout "gimme, gimme"
No-o-o-o-oo, No-o-o-o-oo

Ladies, it's your song
So as soon as this come on

Say "f*ck these petty niggas"
If these niggas did you wrong
If he got a new bitch
Then tell that bitch meet you outside
And pop her like a molly
Tell them bitches recognize
Winnin' (I'm out), I'm winnin'
The end and the beginnin'
I send them on an errand
Then I send them like my children (children)
You couldn't get a fan
If it was hangin' from the ceilin' (I'm out)
