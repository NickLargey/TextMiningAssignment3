All the boys want to know my name
When I don't tell them, they get upset
Breakin' hearts ain't my claim to fame
And if I had a dime for all they tried, I'd be a millionaire yet

When I'm out hangin' with my friends
People say we think we're cute when we're together
Yeah, we play to win and if you're gonna stare
What do we care so what's it mean to you

No half steppin', ya gotta do it right
In the middle of the day or in the middle of the night
No half steppin', show just what you got
And don't give up for nothin' if you think you're hot

I'm not about playing games
I got too much that I wanna do
Don't have the time to sit down and explain
And if you're gonna try and figure out, here's what I say to you

No half steppin', ya gotta do it right
In the middle of the day or in the middle of the night
No half steppin', show just what you got
And don't give up for nothin' if you think you're hot

When I sing, I do my best
To let you know what I feel
When on the stage, I'm put to the test
Ya better believe after you leave, you're gonna know the deal

No half steppin', ya gotta do it right
In the middle of the day or in the middle of the night
No half steppin', show just what you got
And don't give up for nothin' if you think you're hot
