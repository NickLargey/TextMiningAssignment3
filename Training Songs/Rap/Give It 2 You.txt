One for the money
Two for the bass
Three to get you going
Cause Da Brat's in the place

It's me, the OG funk bandit
The be	 to the are-a-t and in fact

If you ain't heard of me
Take a seat, lay back and listen
As I bust for your ass on
This funkdafied mission

Just kick off your shoes
And relax your feet (that's right)
Party on down with Da Brat
And her beat

Now it goes like that
And that's how it goes
I'm gonna give it to
All you niggas and hoes

So listen up
Make sure you listen up well
And don't miss shit cause
This bitch be bad as hell

Truth of the matter is
I splatter kids that talk shit
In a gangster's way
That's how them fools
Get dealt with

So, what you want to do, bitch
Don't even trip
Step up, step up
And I'm-a bust your lip

Now I know that you know
That I know you don't want me to
But keep on tripping and
I'm-a give it to you

I'm gonna give it to you, aah

Brat is the fantastic, romantic
Single handed bandit and damn it

Don't get no better
Better, it don't get no more
Than the flow that I flow
For you niggas and hoes

Devestating, captivating
Elevating as I (smooth)
Operating and I love to get high

Well, nigga, fire it up
Say what, nigga, fire it up
At your request, I guess it's time
For me to get fucked up

It goes one puff, two puff
Three puff, four

From the bottom to the top
Top to bottom, I go
So now you know

What I ain't and what I is
It's the baddest new bitch
In this hip-hop biz

OG is what I am
A brat is what I be
Blunts are what I smoke
And you can't see me

So let it go
Cause my shit is tight
Take it how I give it
And enjoy the night

Yeah, it's like that
It's like that

For the nine fucking four
It's Da Brat and you don't know
You better ask some motherfucking body
