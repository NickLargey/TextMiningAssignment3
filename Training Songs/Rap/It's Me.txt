Hold up, love
I know I'm not the one that you've been speakin? of
Rumors start
But all the time I was the one who gave you so much
love

You came along
I was already in they ear before I picked you up
You broke my trust
?Cause I thought you loved me, you just cashed in

Now I'm through with you (With you)
You don't know what to do (To do)
Now who's playin' fool
(You loved me now it?s ugly)

'Cause I'm not checkin' for you (No, no, no)
Your hatin' day is through (So through)
Without me there's no you
(But now you're through 'cause I'm done with you)

It's your world made easy
Now it's you tryin' to front and run game on me
It's not like you can hang and sexy
'Cause you wouldn't be known if you didn't know me

Hear me, Mami, take it easy
If you hate Jojo, you're hatin' K-Ci
Speak up when they ask you, Shorty
Who's the one that made you, then say that it's me

Now you think
Every thing that I done for you came so easy, uh
And now you seem
To be actin' like it really was you that made me

But you don't see
When you step out on the scene that they really see me
And no one seemed
To even really notice you 'cause you're not with me

Now I'm through with you (Through with you)
You don't know what to do (What to do)
Now who's playin' fool
(You loved me now it's ugly)

'Cause I'm not checkin' for you (No, no, no)
Your hatin' day is through (Said it's all through)
Without me there's no you
(Now you're through 'cause I'm done with you, you)

It's your world made easy
Now it's you tryin' to front and run game on me
It's not like you can hang and sexy
'Cause you wouldn't be known if you didn't know me

Hear me, Mami, take it easy
If you hate Jojo, you're hatin' K-Ci
Speak up when they ask you, Shorty
Who's the one that made you, then say that it's me

Do you comfort you (Ooh...)
Baby, I can't believe that I'm hearin' 'bout you
Just comfort me (Hear me)
Baby girl, you're crazy
Baby, girl, it ain't cool

Do you comfort you (Ooh...)
Baby, I can't believe that I'm hearin' 'bout you
Just comfort me
Baby girl, you're crazy
I love you, baby

It's your world made easy
Now it's you tryin' to front and run game on me
Its not like you can hang and sexy
'Cause you wouldn't be known if you didn't know me
