Troublesome nigga
Troublesome 19-motherfuckin' 96 (Westside!)
Let it be known nigga
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

Menacin' methods label me a lethal weapon
Makin' niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Outlaws motherfuckers die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, f*ck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block
Without my my heat or Glock got me a dog and named her my bitch nigga eater
What could they do to me and lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
'Cause they fear me in physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

(Troublesome nigga)
(Outlawz)
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullet
All you niggas die

Troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troublesome (all you niggas die)
We troublesome

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
A guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, better bomb on 'em first
Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry bustin off freely
Screamin', "F*ck, all ya'll niggas" in Swahili
Pistol packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care, of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drivebys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died
'Cause I'm troublesome

Young, strapped, and I don't give a f*ck
I'm hopeless
I live the thug Life, losin' my focus baby (all you niggas die)
I'm troublesome
Bad Boy killa
There is no one realer
What you saw was the rough rugged and raw (all you niggas die)
Outlaw!

Murder murder my mind state, shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen 'cause he yearned to bang
Sniffed a lot of flowers, but how could I cry
Tried to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep, I'm havin crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God to forgive me 'cause it's wrong but I plan to die
Either take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell 'cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nuthin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life
I'm troublesome

In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me
(All you niggas die) I'm troublesome, I don't give a f*ck
I'm troublesome like my nigga Napoleon said nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit (all you niggas die)
I'm troublesome
You know what time it is, the Outlaw clique
Young rugged and sick
Makaveli the Don the boss of all bosses (All you niggas die)
Musolini, Edi Amin
Hussein Fatal
Khadafi, Kastro
Napoleon, Khomeini (all you niggas die)
We ain't f*ck around
We troublesome (bye bye, bye bye, all you niggas die) aiyo
We troublesome
I ain't goin' (bye bye, bye bye, all you niggas die)
Young Kastro, the first to blast the last one to dash
Goin' for the hoes and the cash
F*ck you niggas, Outlawz!
Khadafi, trump tight never sloppy
Them motherfuckers try to copy
But they can't mock you nigga, you're too strong (all you niggas die)
Outlawz keep it goin' on
You know whassup
Outlawz, Outlawz (all you niggas die)
(Bye bye, bye bye, all you niggas die) Outlawz, Outlawz
This is dedicated to the real niggas
All the real troublesome soldiers on the streets

(Bye bye, bye bye, all you niggas die)
