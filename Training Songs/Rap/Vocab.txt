Yo, this is the Fugees 
Refugees 
About to take you on a journey 
Into the dimensions of the Booka basement 
The basement, word 

Hey yo, one two three! The crew is called Re-Fu-Ge-ee-es 
An if you come fa tes the rap style 
Stop the violence and just bring it on, wild 

Hey yo I, feel kind of melancholy people think they really know me 
I keep a wrap about me while I'm driving daddy's Audi 
I pay the toll fighting for my own soul 
Cause the bourgeois type of mental sucks like a flat comb 
But I be baiting the rebel base to bass distort the EQ 
The devil's wishing they could send me back to Mogadishu 
Cause I've been wild since I was a juvenile 
Afro-centric profile, back when righteous rap was your style 
Now kids are whyling so I ask the bad black 
Boogie bandit, what's the damage, gimme the estimate then 
Pray tell me when's the revolution will begin? 
I turn on my TV I check out Farrakhan on CNN see 
I'm like the phantom that's flying like the bird do 
And things you never heard plus I come from the suburbs 
Word to God, I heard you're acting kind of hard 
And you got your skin scarred when they was shooting on the boulevard 

(You got the vocab) I got the vocab 
(On the real got the vocab) You know we got the vocab 
(All my peeps got the vocab) Yeah, we got the vocab 

Hey yo Praz, grab the mic and show you got the gift of gab 

[Prazwell]
Then cast off from here to Mexico 
You see my four-five-six a-be my Celo 
And when I rest my head is on a pillow 
You see the skills I manifest is very tho-rough 
And if you don't believe me ask Freres Ja-cques 
Freres Jacques, Freres Jacques 
A dorme vous? A dorme vous? 
Watch out now! When I choose to speak 
I'm forming the cipher fly East to the Five Percenter 
Knowledge is born, to all beginners 
Cast the first stone, if you feel you ain't a sinner,
Say o-you're father, who art in heaven 
Forgive the foolish rapper for he not know how Fugee be stepping
Correct and, stopped and kept in, 'nough respect to the 
DJ, that be selecting, the type of record 

(You got the vocab) I got the vocab 
(On the real got the vocab) You know we got the vocab 
(All my peeps got the vocab) Yeah, we got the vocab 

Hey yo Clef grab the mic and show you got the gift of gab 

Check it out, here we go 
Back in Eighty-tree, no one wanted to be nappy!
I turn on my TV, it's a dreadlock for free!
Kill the gimmick 
It's nonsense, it's no sense or value 
A rapper, disaster, nobody ever told me that 
"Roxanne, you don't got to work for money no more!" and
Back in the days I used to listen to cool G Rap 
Way back when before guns became gats and 
Run-D.M.C. used to ask Mary was she bugging? 
I loved P.E., they kept me conscious of what I was saying 
Afrika Bambaata, Poor Righteous Teacher 
Got within myself so it made me a Five Percenter 
Say La-Di-Da-Di, UHH! we like to party but 
My jam was BDP, with My Philosophy 
Say Grandmaster Flash, MC Melle Mel 
Then LL Cool J came with Rock the Bells! 
See I'm the one for the crew, like a Jew is a Jew 
Like Apollo got the moon, like the men who got the blue 
Like the Fu got the Manchu, Chaka got the Zulu 
Hawaii got the Honolulu 
I got the rap lieu, so skippedy-de-bop-bop you don't stop 
You do the rock-rock from hip-hop through be-bop 
From be-bop to bee-bee 

(You got the vocab) I got the vocab

(All my peeps got the vocab) Yeah, we got the vocab
