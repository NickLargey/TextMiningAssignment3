Throw it high, make you and George Washington head butt
OG's never fed us, now young niggas fed up
Ballin' so hard, I deserve a and one
Baking soda marketing, I'm getting it ain't I? Obviously
You a bitch, you a ho, that's just my philosophy
And I'm known to kick it like the captain of a soccer team
Billie Jean red leather same color Red Lobster

I'm raw, talking California Rolls
Smoking California weed with California hoes (true!)
Sending flicks to my partners in the state pen
I just got some pants made out off snake skin
See them shades you got on call Ray-Bans
And the shade I got on cost eight bands
