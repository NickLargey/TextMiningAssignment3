[Chris Lowe]
Shoo-wop shu-wow, bring back the old style
of eighty-three, a part of me y'all don't see
I woke up this mornin and I blessed my life
Blessed the beats, struggled to my strife
Then figured it out, the Lowe don't slack
Lookin in the mirror sayin - damn, glad I'm black
The greatest discovery I once first found
Yeah run it in the ground, punk Lowe so bound
And I don't care what you freestylin about
With money all up in my pockets {niggaz} runnin they mouth
But free {shit} talk {that shit} to me, we gon' see
The big breakdown, {niggaz} is outta gas G
I used to cut the record down to the bone
Now they got me hurtin this microphone
You slipped up once, you slipped up twice
Give up them records and the mic device

[Chorus]
I see rap goin round and round (round and round)
Rap goin round and round (round and round)
Rap goin round and round (round and round)
Rap goin round and round (round and round)

[Chris Lowe]
Too hot to trot, too old to get cold
Blast beats, 'til I got y'all losin control
Chris Lowe, kinda like I'm crackin ya code
At last, blast with a whole lotta soul
It's hot, even though you may think not
Who that scary cat tryin to block my shot?
For what I'm in the cut like I can't come out
to bust down the back door like {?} did shout
Told y'all {niggaz} I'm last to fold y'all
One man street team, the ill street soldier
So bust this like we in it at 6
And snatch off his ice chain with a slick mix
You the best DJ with mad fly tricks
You got the kinda style they just don't fix
You got the kinda style they just don't fix
You got the kinda style they just don't fix

[Chorus]

[Chris Lowe]
Yeah I seen it before, it happened just like this
The legends, be comin back from out the midst
They be hauntin the game, things ain't the same
y'all know the {niggaz} that was real at first, they done changed
over the years, I still got my ears
See the same old re-rocked ideas
Stop, hold up, I'm back in time
My future was yesterday, the best came to play
For y'all the fans, feel free, clap your hands
A {nigga} stand still in a be	-boy stance
And take this here, cause you can play it ten years from now
Rap goin round and round

[Chorus] - 2X
