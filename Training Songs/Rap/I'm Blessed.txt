Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed, yes
Living every moment, no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh yes
I'm blessed yes, I'm blessed yes

Waking up thanking god, every day is feeling just like Sunday
Wifey fly, by my side, green light
Everything is going my way
Riding clean, living dreams
Just left the barber and I'm feeling like Midas
Heard 'em say give 'em praise
Face in the water got 'em acting like this

Ain't a day go by, that I don't try
To thank the Lord up above
And if you wondering why, I'm loving life
Come close and I'll tell you what's up

Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed, yes
Living every moment, no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh yes
I'm blessed yes, I'm blessed yes
Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed yes
Living every moment no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh yes
I'm blessed yes, I'm blessed yes

Playing cards, laughing hard
Barbaquein' waking up the whole block
Music loud, turning loud
Feel the keys, I'm breaking out the bus stop
Life is good, really good
And every moment, no I can't forget
I got to say, I won't change
You're the reason that I am like this

Ain't a day go by, that I don't try to thank the Lord up above
And if you wondering why I'm loving life
Come close and I'll tell you what's up

Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed, yes
Living every moment, no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh yes
I'm blessed yes, I'm blessed yes
Ask me how I'm doing ,I'm blessed yes
Living every moment no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh yes
I'm blessed yes, I'm blessed yes, I'm blessed

I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed

If you got a roof over your head
Bringing home the bread
Got your family fed
Oh, oh, oh you're bressed
Sunshine, I'm so free
Living out my dreams
God's been good to me
Oh, oh, oh I'm blessed

Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed, yes
Living every moment, no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh yes
I'm blessed yes, I'm blessed yes
Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed yes
Living every moment no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh yes
I'm blessed yes, I'm blessed yes, I'm blessed

I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, y'all
Oh, oh, oh I'm blessed
