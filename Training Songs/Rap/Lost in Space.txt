Blast full at ten, Keith still solo with no manager 
Them lock out, studios, need to block out 
Here's my number call me direct, get no feedback 
No interviews, channel four, see me on the news 
Erase your message walk streets with my cellular phone 
Address you wonder, don't try to catch me home alone 
Up seven o'clock, while you trying to find me on my block 
I'm at the airport, you think I'm strange, boardin' the plane 
Turn off my pager, then quickly, relax my feet 
Hotel Onion drinkin' brew watchin' Sesame Street 
You thought you saw me with a wig on, at 7/11 
Disguised like Shakespeare with blue chrome behind your ear 
My George Washington robe, I still travel the globe 
On Pan-Am air flights, I roll in cities after midnight 
Stand in your lobby unsuspected, you get neglected 
Traffic was hectic

Order room service, transfer quick to Holiday Inn 
Check out time nine o'clock, coat on, I'm on again 
You comin' so wack you sound like the Bulworth soundtrack 
I'm in the mall steady shoppin' while you tryin' to call 
It's on my answering machine, to speak to me as a dream 
Pacific Bell know him, the phone is off, and I'm well known 
1-800 number, castle code see to summer 
Extreme complicated businessman, can't be reached 
No type of headquarters, deserted land, by the waters 
Target my focus on, internal thinkin' by myself 
You catch the treatments hiatus like Sam on the shelf 
Move out your zip code with you-Haul, watch you fall 
Obtain five boxes callin' Mayflower, every hour 
You scratch your brain askin' neighbors what, now you wonder 

While you search lookin' deep in your Rolodex, I flex, I tell the truth 
When I'm serious you think I'm mysterious, drop rap in minutes 
Become your problem like Dennis the Menace 
Hold up your meetings papi, let's ? to the paparazzi 
Unseen heard of your magazine got the nerve of a two-year old crayon writing 
Talkin' to y'all I'm decidin' 
Communication leads one step to aggravation 
I got my ears closed, back to bookin' my own shoes
