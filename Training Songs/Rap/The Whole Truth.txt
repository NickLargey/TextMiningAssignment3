When I was dead, revived my soul
Takes the broken makes them whole
Takes the bound makes them free
Takes the weak and makes them strong
All of my sins been erased
He has lifted my disgrace
I'm overjoyed, overjoyed
That Jesus would make me fall whole

I ain't tryin to be hot just tryin to be relevant
I ain't a candle I ain't trying to wax eloquent
I'm runnin from my life, now I'm tryin to fight hard
These ain't just lyrics but a contrite heart
Yeah, feeling it like the heat in the summer
We know better but the flesh be keeping us running
Back the leeks and onions that's the recent discovered
If it's in the dark it's impossible to keep secrets covered
Who would have known that my indiscretions would reach my cousins
I apologize to Mimi my niece and others
Should have been able to trust but I breached the covenant
I knew you all before you was able to reach the cupboard
Now when I preached in public it's all out the window
Cause sin contradicted a lot of what my pen wrote
Especially when I wrote an open book
Apparently there was something in me I overlooked

[Chorus]
When I was dead, revived my soul
Takes the broken makes them whole
Takes the bound makes them free
Takes the weak and makes them strong
All of my sins been erased
He has lifted my disgrace
I'm overjoyed, overjoyed
That Jesus would make me fall whole

Check my records I got some prize 
They call em nights surprise like Harlem Knights
I need Jesus David's son like a holly Harley bike
Wasn't hardly right what I did was wrong
And it ticks me off and sets me off
And I hate the consequences cause death is
But I know I reap what I sow like Betsy Ross
He ain't tempt me but He let me fall
Now I carry all that pain, sin left me scarred
He let me fall but He ain't let me go
And now I wouldn't stray, sin left me broke
Yeah the life in me ain't no crystal stair
But I keep climbing cause the diamond is crystal clear
At times I'm quiet, I get a chair
Sit and stare think about the ways the sin affected my fiscal year
Yeah the tide is turning now, shifting gears
The weak is given strength in midst of tears

[Chorus]

Felt dead and lonely
Only God knows
That Jesus came to breathe life on my dry bones
I know a lot, knowing a lot's not wrong
But now it's all about application like the iPhone
I got hang-ups like dial tones
Yeah but Jesus hung up and died so
No condemnation, that's my consolation

Am I still guilty? 
Not a conversation
Now I just wanna proclaim it in the congregation
God is good and Doctor Jesus got a lot of patience
I wanna operate and take the heart palpitate
And look at what the bride is shaping
God I thank the body, cause y'all came behind me
When my foot slipped and I sank in the valley
Something supernatural happened when the saints rallied
My true friends held me up like a bank robbery
And that's foolproof, I can't even front like a gold tooth
I hate what I had to go through, 
But I love the fact that I got to know you
So what you are witnessing now is the whole truth

[Chorus]
