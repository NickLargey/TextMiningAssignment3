Maybe love what can I do you're killing the trust that I gave to you and took 
 me for granted so sad to see you're running around town playing games on me 
 every day and night I'm thinking of you call me a fool just so confused after 
 all that I been through I'm still in love with you and I can't 
 (chorus) I can't get you out of my mind, (just can't get you out of my mind) 
 your love is one of a kind, (your love is so hard to find) you've givin so much 
 of yourself (don't want nobody else baby, no) I swear don't want nobody else 
 Baby girl, what could I do, I told you once before your girl playa hatin on you, 
 she played me close once to many times, I had to put it on her, she was so darn 
 fine, I don't know what she told you, ut I bounced upon a love one time, i took 
 het to my house, laid her on my couch, standing afraid, and threw her a$$ out, 
 (So what about the girl in the 64) she didn't mean a darn thang to me baby, she needed 
 a ride from the jam and being the man that I am I said you can (And what about 
 the girl in the drop top, with the lollypop at the light by the bus stop) you 
 must have been fooled then to think and the kid was siked, girl I feel my pain 
 when I go to bed at night, girl I, 
 (chorus) repeat 2x's 
 darn it's been a long time I've found someone since the time you left me, up 
 until this moment I just couldn't get you off of my mind, I know if we can start 
 all over again, I know things won't be the same (can't get you off of my mind) 
 I'll make it better, I swear, I swear 
 (chorus) repeat say I ei,I ei I ei, I ei until fade
