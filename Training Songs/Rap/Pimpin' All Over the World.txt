[Chorus]
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar, 
You know who we are, cause we pimping all over the world,
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar, 
You know who we are, cause we pimping all over the world

[Ludacris]
Sing it hoes,
All over the world baby, it's only right that I share my experiences with y'all, 
Cause I've been places where you'll never imagine, but I'ma start at home, 
I walk straight up to them and I'm like (ugh), Hey girl how ya doing, 
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin, 
I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name, 
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange, Hey!
See I'm the man of this town, 
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around, 
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinking of me, 
We got people to meet and many places to see, Hey!
I'm really digging ya lips,
But be careful where you walking when you swinging them hips, 
I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causing a crash 
Wit ya traffic jam booty, heads pausing so fast, Hey!
I wouldn't trade you for the world I swear it, 
I like ya hair and every style that ya wear it,
And how the colors coordinate wit ya clothes, 
From your manicured nails to ya pedicured toes

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
You hear the song so dance, 
Don't always think I'm trying to get in your pants,
Cause see me my pimpin's in 3-D, 
I'm taking you places you only see on T.V., 
Trying to show ya that living is trife,
How many guys you know that can bring the travel channel to life, 
One day we on the auto-bind swerving driving, 
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands, 
If you with me ain't no time to sleep, 
Especially at wet willies on Miami Beach, 
But I drive you off and pay you no attention 
If I make it to Atlanta's Brina Brothers convention, 
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours,
Making sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard, 
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see, 
So if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me, Hey!

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican day parade, 
Than at night I'm in New Orleans drinking hand Grenades, 
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest, 
In Mardi Gras all the women trying to show more They chest, 
Hey I'm in Jamaica spending massive bucks, 
While the ladies all begging me to masha tucks, 
I had sad Beginnings when I rap wit no fans, 
Now it's all happy endings in my lap in Japan, Hey
I used to think that it was way too cold 
Til I went to Canada and say some beautiful hoes, 
Now I Hit the Caribbean every year in Toronto, 
Then fly t Illinois to get a taste of Chicago,
Oh Yet and still you wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil, 
Ain't no need of even asking Brah, 
The best women are reside in Africa, and that's real

[Chorus]

Pimpin pimpin pimpin, 
Ladies and gentlemen as we ride out, 
Could we have all the real pimps,
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air, 
Now ladies look around wit me, 
Lets see if We can weed some of these niggas out, 
Cause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin', no
If you happen to see a nigga wit two sweat patches up under his arms, 
Look like he been swimming In shoulder height water, 
Please tell that nigga, put yo hands down, 
If you smell like you been At work all day and your car, 
Please put your hands down, 
Now look up at the pinky fingers that Are still in the air, 
If you see him ashy around the knuckles, 
Like the nigga wash half of his
Hands and lotion three quarters of his body, 
Please say put yo hands down, 
If yo spinning rims Spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin, 
If you are dancing on the dance floor and you look to Yo left and yo right 
And you do not see a woman in sight, 
Guess what you guessed it you are not
Pimpin, if your Vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood, 
That's because you didn't Order Vodka buddy, 
That's why it's three dollars a glass, 
Put your hands down, now look down, 
I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time ok, 
You see the nigga with the white socks not pimpin'! 
Sorry unless you trying to do the Beat It entourage, if your shoes have a buckle
On, your not pimping
