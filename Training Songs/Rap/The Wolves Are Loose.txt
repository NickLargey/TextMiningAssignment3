Rampage life sets the tone.
Everybody's on it's own
All that's safe and all that used to be clear.
All security disappeared.
Fear and stress make their claim.
Right and wrong are lost along the line.

Fear and stress make their claim.
The Wolves are loose and they're out for blood
Remaining faceless
Lurk in the dark waiting still
Remaining faceless
Lurk in the dark to kill at will
