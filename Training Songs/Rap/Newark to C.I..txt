featuring Keith Murray 

[Shaq] 
before anyone gets upset 
we're only sayin funkin' 
f you n  k i n 
ah ha ha ha 
ah ha ha ha 
ha ha ha ha 
that's right boy 
George The King Village 
watch this seven footer spit rhymes like a loogie 
funked up like some doogie warrior  just like sazuki 
ah  Twism  man of steel organism 
combined with phat rhymes comin' from my wall prism 
in my league hoopers don't act their age 
you might be another dead boy front page 
I make more cash than the president 
find a bigger residence 
Shaq is the man and that's evident 
irrelevant, what them critics say 
until they come rhyme, come act, come play 
get out me way 
or come trip into this rhyme funk 
I'm nut-rageous, outrageous, like the Buddha monk 
it's about where you're from not where you went 
Newark, New Jersey, represent, represent 
to the fullest, you messin' round, you's a dead man 
prepare for the Redman 

[Keith Murray] 
oh yo yo yo, hold up 
due to certain circumstances, Redman will not be performing tonight 
but we got Keith Murray from the Def Squad up in here 
so, you know what I'm sayin', check it out 
never question who I am, black 
I slam jams with Redman, Erick Sermon, and the Shaq 
I wreck this with wreckless emotionless 
above any beyond the depths of physics 
with bio feed back techniques 
I speak over the beat 
so peep a true thug from the streets 
of New York 
where you get outlined in chalk 
and the herbest person gets foul like pork 
you walk and talk into tripizoid 
boy I can flipizoid, trapizoid on record 
all these MCs out here is a big dissapointment 
so I refuse to lose and ooze like ointment 
into a deconcentration 
I scrape you and your scab-ass crew up like vaxitration 
and if you're 6-9, 280, tryin' to get ill 
I'll have my man Shaquille O'Neal push your grill 
and that's real 

[Shaq] 
some choose to pack a mack, I choose to pack my Shaq 
twenty twos 
I wonder how you'd act if you was in my shoes 
this is how I take the old from the new 
all my nines down the line kick and lead it too 
rugged never smooth with this move as I flow 
on and on this track, my papes stacked in the back 
step up to get funk in your face 
'88 was Runs house, but '95 is Shaqs place 
cracked up like Boogie, from New Jack City 
high with the clowns, but down with the nitty gritty 
fool, child, with the high profile 
style kind of hoop-hoppa-listic wild 
come, get some 
from the one that freaks the fees, the foes, the fies, the fums 
I flip my style like a pancake flipper 
dive-dive dipper 
let me pull up my zipper 
I'm sick and tired of pissin' on this track 
Newark represnts lovely 
Redman and the Shaq 
for the '96, '97 
Jersey is representin' 
always and fo'ever 
fo'ever and always 
Prince Street, where ya at 
George The King Village, where ya at 
Naughtyville, where ya at 
can't forget the brothers in Chilltown, J.C. 
Oakstreet representin' 
ha ha, and I'm out
