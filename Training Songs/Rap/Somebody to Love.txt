Oh ooh

For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin
It's time to sink or swim
Watch him play for you

For you I'll be
Runnin' a million miles
Just to stand where you are
Step to the beat of my heart.
I don't need a whole lot
Coming from you I admit I
Rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
Know that I won't be the first one
Given you all this attention
Baby listen

I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much
Just somebody to love.
(Somebody to love)
I don't need nothing else
I promise girl, I swear.
I just need somebody to love.
I need somebody I-I need somebody
I need somebody I-I need somebody to love/

Everyday I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds.
Smile for me (Smile for me)
I would take
Every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime.
Step to the beat of my heart.
I don't need a whole lot
Coming from you I admit I
Rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
Know I won't be the first one
Given you all this attention
Baby listen

I just need somebody to love
(Oh, no no no no)
I don't need too much
Just somebody to love.
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else
I promise girl, I swear.
I just need somebody to love.

I need somebody I-I need somebody
I don't need too much
Just somebody to love.
I need somebody I-I need somebody.
I don't need nothing else
I promise girl, I swear.
I just need somebody to love.

And you can have it all
Anything you want I can bring
Give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want
I can't find 'cause, money can't find me.
Somebody to love.

Find me somebody to love (Oh)

I just need somebody to love (Yeah)
I don't need too much
Just somebody to love.
Somebody to love.
I don't need nothing else,
I promise girl I swear,
I just need somebody to love.

I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I don't need too much
Just somebody to love.
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I don't need nothing else,
I promise girl I swear,
I just need somebody to love

I need somebody
I need somebody
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody love,
I need somebody love,
I just need somebody to love
To love
To love
To love
To love
To love
