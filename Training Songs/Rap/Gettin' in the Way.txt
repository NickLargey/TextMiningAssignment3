You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'

Sister girl, I know you don't understand
But you gon have to understand,
He's my man now
What you had is gone
Our thing is sweet
Our thing is stronger than any lie
You can tell on me
He knows my heart and that's the part
Your moves are dug up
So you might as well give up
I see your intentions
You can't handle the truth
He let you go a long time ago
Now it's time to turn him loose

You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'

Sugar honey girl, fly, fly away
I been a lady up 'till now
Don't know how much more I can take
Queens shouldn't swing
If you know what I mean
But I'm 'bout to take my earrings off
Get me some Vaseline

You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(Chill, and I mean it)
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'

You better back down before you get smacked down
You better chill
You better go on
Be out my face now
You better chill

He's my man, girl.  Nobody else's

You better back down before you get smacked down
You better chill
You better go on
Be out my face now
You better chill

Everything was beautiful between me and him
And here come you
And your big mouth
Talkin' about me
Tellin' him that you seen me
On 24th Street
With some other Cat
But you know that's a lie
You keep lyin' to my man,
Girlfriend, I'm goi'n take you out
In the middle of the street
And whip your tail
For all it's worth
$5.99 or sump' I'm like that

You better back down before you get smacked down
You better chill
You better back down before you get smacked down
You better chill
