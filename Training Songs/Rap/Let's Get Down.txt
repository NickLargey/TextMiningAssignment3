The stores is all empty
East-coast, New York, my up town chic (wow)

Hop in the whip!

[Bow Wow]
I know this girl named Keisha
She's no groupie
Be far from the stars
22's made her choose me.
Like
Telling all her friends in the Benz
"He don't really look 16 do he?"
112, youngest thing on tha scene
Couldn't believe when I seen 
How she squeezed in them jeans
Looks like a tight situation
Make a young man make flight reservations
Just step, no intimidation's
I'm bow wow boo
Accept no imitations
Should have seen the looks on they faces
The Ice plus light, makes for good conversation
You telling me
It's a felony, to yell at me
I blew her mind she was dazed momentarily
But luckily
She stayed for some therapy
I stay pimping heavily
My game spitting thoroughly(ha ha ha)

[Chorus]
