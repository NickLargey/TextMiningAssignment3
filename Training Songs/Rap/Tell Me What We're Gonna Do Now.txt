[Common]
Yes, we have arrived
Joss Stone, Common
Uh huh
It's for the world, world, world, world
Uh

[Joss Stone]
You don't have to make your mind up
I just wanna take my time with you
(Yeah)
If that's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Oh, forgive me if I get to shy, but
Maybe you're the reason why
I'm feelin' butterflies
(I feel it too)
Somethin' 'bout the look in your eyes
Oh, it just makes me feel so right

[Chorus:]
Well, you're my boy
You're my joy
You're my dream
I'm for ya 
I adore ya 
You're everything that I need
I love how you love me
If I'm made for you
You're made for me
It's too good to be
So tell me what we're gonna do now

Funny how my world keeps spinnin'
Sometimes you can be so silly
You know just how to make me laugh
Yeah
Oh, you're skin is so lovely
When you touch me
I know that you got my back
(Sure do; yes, I do)
I feel so safe when you hold me
It's already like you know me

[Chorus]

Oh, right now
See, baby, I love how you make me smile
Don't leave
Please stay awhile
Let's make this happen
I don't care how

[Common]
Right now, let's stay in the present
Can't worry 'bout tomorrow 'cause today is a blessin'
The world in a state of aggression
I find calm in you
I see my mom in you
It's like a feelin' in a nigga's stomach
When you want it so bad
If you keep keepin' it fresh
It ain't gonna go bad
I been through the valley of love
Rolled the shores of Cali
Just to find peace of mind
Lookin' to the sky
Askin' for at least a sign
Beautiful, you came at such a decent time
When we combine
It's like good food and wine
Flavorful yet refined
You remind me of the divine
So easy
Love can be lost and then found, like Stevie
I just love havin' you around
You wearin' a gown
I'm wearin' a crown
Pound for pound
We the freshest couple in town

Well, you're my boy
You're my joy
You're my dream
I'm for ya 
I adore ya 
You're everything that I need
I love how you love me
If I'm made for you
You're made for me
It's too good to be
Tell me what we're gonna do 
Tell me what we're gonna do now
