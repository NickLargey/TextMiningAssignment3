Tic toc never the glock just some nuts and a cock

And wave the motherfuckers like ya just don't care

And watch your step (why?) cause Doggy's on the gank
My bank roll's on swoll
My shit's on hit, legit, now I'm on parole, stroll
With the Dogg Pound right behind me
And up in yo bitch, is where ya might find me
