My style can't be dupilcated or recycled.
This chick is a sick individual.
Sick tape, volume 2! 
Believe it! 
Oh! Oh! 
Let me switch up the game

I drink that cognac
Step back cause I might put it on ya 
I go deep so deep till you sleep
Count sheep wake ya up from fucking all week 
You don't want me to show ya 
How freak bitches act when I ain't soba 
Word up, I'm tore up, sure 'nough
I ain't scared to take it off(tell the freak to take it off)
Tipsy and it feel good
Black dudes got big woods 
Into it, I do it, I did it 
If you really, really want it then nigga stop fronting (stop fronting)
Hey boy you know I'm your type (your type)
5'2 and wear my jeans real tight
My curves they swerve so superb
My word is my word and I came to serve

We run this (run this)
We run this (run this)
We run this
Oh, oh, oh
It don't matter where you from
It's where you at 
And if you came to freak-a-leak better bring your hat
East coast, west coast, down south 
Represent your coast 
Yeah we run it
Yeah we run it
Y'all don't want it 
Cause my coast run it
Oh 
We run this shit
We run this shit

Wanna pull my hair
Break my back
For the right money might sit in your lap 
Back to back I can't even keep track
It's a fact the freaks love to get slapped
Suck my toes, I need a back rub
I don't come to do it
I just wanna be touched 
Look at how y'all making me blush
I'm enough to go around so people don't push
Wanna run that tush in the bush
Don't my diamonds look real good? 
And they shine so hard that he glittas 
So many karats they look like crittas 
And we can do it all night 
Take a flashlight to see up in my windpipe 
I like to keep a nigga hype 
I wanna know can you handle my mic

We run this (run this)
We run this (run this)
We run this
Oh, oh, oh
It don't matter where you from
It's where you at 
And if you came to freak-a-leak better bring your hat
East coast, west coast, down south 
Represent your coast 
Yeah we run it

Any hustler's in the party y'all? (hell ya) 
If you's a pimp let me see ya party hard (hell ya) 
Oh strippers take yo clothes off (hell ya) 
Y'all superstars
Y'all don't need no bodyguards (hell ya) 

Nigga I bow guard
A lot of rappers fake way to hard
Pull up to the club in a rental car 
Where the freaks at
Freaks at da bar where da hard drinks are 
Don't start 
If you don't want beef don't take it that far
With a superstar 
I got my foot on the clutch, see me bounce my butt 
Misdemeanor too much and I don't give a f*ck

We run this (run this)
We run this (run this)
We run this 
Oh, oh, oh

Represent your coast and act like you know
Know how to act before you step your two feet in the do'
