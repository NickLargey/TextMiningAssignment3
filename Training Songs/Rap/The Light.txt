Uh-huh, alright, alright, alright, okay, uh-huh, a-yeah

It was like the earth twisted around her
She shifted the ground I was like, "oh, shit!"
She's off the hook, I would dress her decently
But look her body is immaculate I'm attackin' it from all positions
Of thinkin' inside my mind-ah
Hopefully it won't be too inappropriate if I walk over there and say
"Excuse me, can I have your number please?
I'll get on my knees if I have to"
She'll laugh through, the whole episode
Just then I knew I had her locked (Down)
No cock-blocking please this one's mine (Uh)
Dimepiece and shit son, shorty was fine
Every line of mine was like a rhyme I wouldn't lie I swear
Sparklin' the whole time as I whispered in her ear

And I know you will see the light
Baby, once you
Understand, what you
Mean, to me, darling

And I know you will see the light
Baby, once you

Now some say I'm a little bit a thug
Slash b-boy gentleman but, let me introduce myself
Also begin, so that you can further understand what I say
I took this last swallow of the Grand Marnier
And slid her to the dance floor, now she like "wow"
Oh, damn, money got style
Funny how things change when you got a liquor in ya
You're quicker with the tongue, givin' me rhythm now huh
Block the music and the people out to admire the love
The nerve of us, impervious to the entire club
And like marijuana shotguns let's blow this joint
It's pointless to say here, so let me annoint

And I know you will see the light
Baby, once you
Understand, what you
Mean, to me, darling

And I know you will see the light
Baby, once you
Understand, what you
Mean, to me, darling

We kissin' and we wrestlin', sexual confessions
I never lack to pack prophylact', I learned my lesson
First impression, to be discrete, use discretion
Back of the cab undressin', uh-huh
I'm here witchu, sorta like our bond spiritual
All night, all I could do, is stare at you
Cracked the window and the Alize on the Palisades
Right before she told me her name was Valerie
Her crib was just a mile away, nothin' to my salary
She could serve me pain all night and I could tolerate
I'm her horizon right, but in the night though
Night glow type shit (And I know you can see the light)

And I know you will see the light
Baby, once you
Understand, what you
Mean, to me, darling

And I know you will see the light
Baby, once you
Understand, what you
Mean, to me, darling

And I know you can see the light
Baby, once you, understand what
What you mean to me girl what you do no doubt check it out now
Now I know you can see the light
Baby, once you
