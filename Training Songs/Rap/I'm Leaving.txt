[Chorus]
Let me tell you why
Why he can't be with you no more
Everytime that you talk, you lie
(And I'm not taking it no more)
He won't be a fool for you
(All the things you put me through)
I know it sounds crazy to you baby
(But I'm leavin' you, I'm leavin', leavin')

[Trina]
I know you're thinkin' you're the bomb and your game is tight
And usually I'd give you props, but not tonight
And I know you're thinkin' this really don't concern me
But I'll tell you what, you're messin' with my family

At the club (club), at the show, at the mall, we know
The look on your face said it all
Raisin' your voice ain't somethin' you want to do
But we can take it there, girl if you want to

[Chorus]

[Jesse]
Wasted my time, puttin' up with all your games
I'm not a toy, so why you tryin' to play with me?
Had me believe that you was out with your friend
Until she called, askin' me where have you been

The clothes, and the G's, and the truck, it was me
Girl, you had it good but you just couldn't see
Ain't tryin' to hear your explanation
I'm leaving you in this situation

[Chorus]

[Jesse] (Trina)
You know I gave you everything
(Yeah, so did Cory, Trey and Steve)
You said that you'd be true to me
(She don't know what the word true means)

Girl, I want to know why
(But you know she just gon' lie)
You said your love was mine
(Like in another life)

Time to step, get on, be gone, goodbye
[Trina]
Let me tell you why
Everytime that you talk, you lie
He won't be a fool for you
I know it sounds crazy to you baby

[Jesse]
But I'm leaving you
I'm leavin', leavin'

[Chorus]

[Trina]
You think that you're the bomb 
And that your game is tight
And usually I'd give you props
But no no, not tonight
I know you're thinkin' that this really don't concern me
I'll tell you what
You're messin' with my family
Oh, oh, oh
