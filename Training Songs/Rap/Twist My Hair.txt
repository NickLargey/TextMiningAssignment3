Sometimes I need ya
Sometimes I don't
Sometimes I take the time to have ya
Sometimes I wont...
See I'm just the kinda girl who, loves her space
But you always take it to heart when I pull away from your embrace
A-Ring-Ring
No I can't talk now
Knock-Knock
Uh ah..No ya can't come in!
When the day is done I'll tell ya just where I stand-stand

I just wanna think about it while I twist my hair,
Later on I'll let you know if its more, if its more than I can bare.
(repeat 1x)
