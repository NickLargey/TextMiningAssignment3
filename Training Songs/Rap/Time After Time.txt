If your lost, you can look
And you will find me (you will find me)
Time after time
Ohhh, nah nah nah

Cassandra
I'm lying in my bed
I hear the clock tickin'
And I think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new

Charisse
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase full of memories
Time after time
Music intermission
Ohhhhh, oh yeah, uh huh yeah

Cassandra
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
Your calling out to me
But I can't hear a thing you say

Charisse
And you say (ooooooooo)
Go slow and I fall behind (ooooooooo)
And the second hand unwinds (oooooooo)

[Chorus:]
If your lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I will be waiting
Time after time
If your lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I will be waiting
Time after time

When you're lost (whenever you're lost)
I will be your guide (let me be your guide)
When you fall (whenever you fall)
I'll lift you up (I'll lift you up yeah)

Charrise
After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through the windows
Your wondering if I'm okay

Cassandra
Sleepless stolen
From deep inside
The eight-0-eight is right on time

[Chorus]

Time after time after time (if you should fall just call me)
Time after time
Time after time after time
Time after time (it's your love right here)
Time after time after time (you know you are my, my my my man, my my man yes you are)
Time after time (ohhhhh yeah)
Time after time after time
Time after time
Time after time after time (time time time time time)
Time after time
