I don't need you to
Tell me I'm pretty to make me feel beautiful
I don't need you to 
Give me your strength to make me feel I'm strong
I got all of the strength that I need here inside my own two hands
All that I want is your love and respect for who I am
What I really need
Comes from deep inside of me

Don't need you to tell me I'm pretty to make me feel beautiful
Don't need you to make me strong 
Cause I'm strong on my own
Doesn't come from outside
This beauty I know 
Comes from inside my soul
[Don't need you to tell me I'm pretty]

I don't need you to 
Believe in me to let me know I'm worth believing in
I don't need you to
Hold me up, I know I can stand tall
I can stand tall
I can stand my own ground
I can stand tall upon my own two feet
Don't need to be part of somebody else to be complete
What I really need comes from deep inside of me

[Chorus]

Don't need to come to you for confirmation
Because I've finally come to this revelation
What I really need
I'm gonna find inside of me
Not in somebody else
Respect comes when you respect yourself 

[Chorus]

Don't need you to tell me I'm pretty 
To know I'm beautiful
