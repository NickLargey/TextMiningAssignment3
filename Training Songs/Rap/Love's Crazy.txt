Let me tell you how I feel about you girl
You're my friend, my lover, my world
Your the air that I breathe
Your what I need like a car needs gas
Girl you mean so much to me
When I'm out on the streets at night
You don't have to worry it's alright
Eventhough we argue, we fight
We kiss we makeup
We always work it out 'cause
You mean so much to me and
I love the way that you walk
Your smile your sexy talk
Make me wana act out crazy thoughts
O lord I can't stand but it ain't your fault
Anything you ask for you got it its yours
The keys to the crib and all of the doors
I hate to be away from you for too long
So I gotta hurry up so I can get back home
'cause I'm so gone
I'm so gone (im so gone)
So gone over you
I'm crazy over you baby

I'm so gone
You ain't gotta tell me 'cause I already know
Take the burden off your shoulders let the pressure go
You don't owe me an explanation
We're in uh situation that gave us the inspiration to grow 
I see you say a few things that I don't like bu I can say a million things that changed my life 
Changed my life

Now we just gotta hold on 
And go strong 
I love the way that you walk 
Your smile your sexy talk

Anything you ask for you got it its yours the keys to the crib and all of the doors hate to be away from you for too long so I gotta hurry up so I can get back home
