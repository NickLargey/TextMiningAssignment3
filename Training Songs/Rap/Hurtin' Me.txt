What you know about goin' out, big jet, big check?
Don't care, die for my respect
Life, we gon' live it up
Neck, we gon' glit' it up
Dice game, get 'em, girl, gon' bet it up
Grind and invest it
Invest play the main role not the ex shit
X-rate movies like Netflix
Never domestic, watch and a necklace
Young and I'm restless, you know who the best is
Three-quarter, Gucci mink with the fur shoe
Got a girl, and my girl got a girl too
Hit me with the fab like, put it in the bag
Pull up on my new ting, like I knew she mad

I heard you got a new girlfriend

Me, me, me, me, me

And I cry, I cry, even my eye cry
But who cares?
Who cares?
And I cry, I cry, even my eye cry
But who cares?
Who cares?
