C'mon
Dance with me baby girl [Repeat: x2]
C'mon
Dance with me baby girl [Repeat: x2]

[Nate Dogg]
Man I was dancing, prancing, laughing, bouncing, swinging
Moving, grooving, cause the music's booming
Macking, trying to get some action, packing, acting
Manish, drinking, tweaking, winking, peeping
Seeking a freak for the evening, really feeling way too horny
Reaking from the weed I'm token, choking, smoking, real doping, hoping
My nights wide open, knowing that my girls at home
Snoring, boring, ignoring, warning that my girl was coming
Sudden mood interruption, busted my girls in the club

[Chorus]
Ring the alarm (oh oh)
Your woman has just been sighted (uh)
Ring the alarm
How'd she get in if she wasn't invited? (I dunno)
Ring the alarm
She's headed this way like lighting (yeah)
Ring the alarm
I'm not trying to be ducking and dodging (c'mon)
Ring the alarm

[Nate Dogg]
Headed, top speed for the exit
Dammit don piece can't grab it
Habit like chasing my cabbage
Magic, time to disappear fast with
This chick, who I slept last week with
Real trick, I like her cause she real slick
Let's dip, I don't care who you came with
No lip, got no time for some bullshit
She went, that she all in the backpen
Time spent, now it's time to hit the pavement
Two sense, got no time for your comments
Don't trip, do you know where my girl went?

[Chorus]

[Jermaine Dupri]
Listen, I'm in the club, no where I ain't even suppose to be
Drinking with a girl all close to me
I'm all up in the air, telling her some super fly shit she need to hear
Thinking can't nobody see us cause we in the rear
All I'm trying to do is get a number then I'm up out of here
Cause my girl ain't home, she out with a friend
It a be just my luck this the spot they in
Not the place for her to spot me in
You know specially when I'm suppose to be at the studio
I take one step, what do I see my girl coming threw the door but she don't see me
Now I'm ducking, now I'm dodging, hiding, praying to god that she don't come find me
What was I thinking of, I should of never parked my car in front of the club damn!

[Chorus: x3]
