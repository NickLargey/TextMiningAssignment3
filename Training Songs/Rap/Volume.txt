[Chorus]
I'm so motherfuckin' turned up right now (volume)
Someone please turn Gucci mane down (volume)
Bricksquad thugged out we don't give a f*ck (volume)
We hit the club,shoot the club, tear the club up (volume)
So you should hit the floor get low and shut up (volume)
Hit the floor get low and shut the f*ck up (volume)
Yous a bitch yous a snitch you a motherfuckin' scrub (volume) 
Yous a bitch yous a snitch you a motherfuckin' scrub (volume)

I pulled up in a 4 door Porsche set trippin'
3 young dread head niggas ridin' wit' me
I don't think they like me and I don't like em neither
But if they move wrong I'll red up they white beater
I do it for da hood I do it like no equal
I do it for the red black yellow white people
I just bought a kay Just the other day
And I don't play with grown men I don't like to play
I'm so motherfuckin' turned up right now
Niggas hang on me I don't give a f*ck right now
Well you niggas keep on trying like the lil engine that could
You think you can you think you could I think you pussies should

[Chorus]

Call me Gucci flocka flame I den changed my name
Call me frenchie mane la flare gucc the kid its all the same
I be runnin' gunnin' stuntin' with 100 killers ridin'
You snitchin' bitchin' tattle tellin' scared to stand beside me
I just bought another house just to house my goons
So icy entertainment boy we just like a platoon
The colors in my chain ?
I'm with ? baby find that boy the June
I wish they found him August so that's like tomuch too soon
His face was swoll and puffy bout the color of a prune
Bricksquad movement and no your not apart of it
Me waka and woo juice and frenchie mane started it

[Chorus]

Iced out bar got me ballin' like the Lakers
Homicide around the corner where you in Jamaica
My volume on max you boys better run
I'm a nigga with an attitude holdin' on the gun
17 niggas I left 16 hit last nigga hit the corner got his whole head split
Told you your a goner ima leave you dead quick I'm like 
Wooh the kid thugged out we don't give a f*ck
Let your soul meet the sole of the bottom of my chucks
Black car black tint with the baby tags stay low to the floor
My midget out bag. My midget out the bag

[Chorus]
