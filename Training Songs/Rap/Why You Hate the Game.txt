[Marsha Ambrosia]
To everybody who knows my story
To all of those who came before me
My time is now I'm goin' do it all over again
Ain't nothin' new ain't 'bout to change
I'm still gonna do it my way
Yeah I still remain
So tell me why you hate the game?
So tell me why you hate the game?
This time I do it better just because

[Nas]
Yall know what it is
The streets named me Illmatic but yet I'm still at
Yeah haters

[Verse 1: Nas]
Felon, fights behind me on the intersection
Sex and drugs my anthology on perfection
Dress superb admired by conspirists
Who wanna try me but ain't high enough to 4-5 me up
Child of the 80s, y'all niggas is lazy
Complainin' 'bout labor pains nigga show me the baby
And my nigga Game light another L pass the bottle
Pro-black I don't pick cotton out a aspirin bottle
Yeah I learned my lessons and heard y'all snitchin'
Witnessin' you rockin' with narcs confirmed my suspicion
Green fatigues on my niggas I'll bleed for 'em
I can show 'em the water but can't make 'em drink it
And I can show them my fortunes but can't force 'em think rich
And still I'm out on the boarder wonderin' if they sink quick
Ignore the ignorance I rep the brilliance of Queensbridge
And pray the feds let Murder Inc. live

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosia]
To everybody who knows my story
To all of those who came before me
My time is now I'm gon' do it all over again (so how?)
Ain't nothin' new ain't 'bout to change
I'm still gonna do it my way
Yeah I still remain
So tell me why you hate the game?
Oh no I never lost I do it just because
So tell me why you hate the game?
This time I do it better just because

[The Game]
I don't talk about my guns nigga I Just Blaze

[Verse 2: The Game]
'Pac is watchin' B.I.G. is listenin'
While Pun talkin' to us Jam Jay still spinnin'
To every nigga listenin' I was supposed to be
Amongst kings my mom shouted out at my christenin'
And while you still listenin' Shyne locked in a manhole
And Cam got shot inside his Lambo it's ample
Life is a gamble, 15 years old red rag around my head
My sisters used to laugh and call me Rambo
Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle
I rekindle the flame Dre created The Game
Nigga Wit a Attitude from the cloth I came
Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain
Keep the crown clown I rock a L.A. Dodger fitted
Showed my ass at Summer Jam but New York was down wit' it
Now the ball's in my court never dribble out of bounds wit' it
Behind the back to Nas he alley oop to Jigga nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: The Game]
Check it, Me and Nasty puffin it's a classic trust me
How he gon' pass the dutchie to them niggas that don't love me
I'm talkin' niggas that never wanted to see me on top
Same niggas that never wanted to see The Doctor's Advocate drop
Flop I think not, I f*ck you rap niggas like virgins
Dre took my trainin' wheels off it's curtains
I don't need no encore no claps no cheers
The Game ain't over this the beginning of my career
The endin' of yours the endin' of his
Like Flavor Flav's clock I'm back to handle my biz
Nigga it's Game time that was Dre's favorite line
Back when Proof was in the booth and I recited his lines
And I still think about my nigga from time to time
Make me wanna call 50 and let him know what's on my mind
But I just hold back 'cause we ain't beefin' like that
He ain't B.I.G. and I ain't 'Pac we just eatin' off rap
One love

[Chorus]

[Just Blaze]

Of the one and only, Just Blaze, I got a couple people
In the house with me, Usually we do this at the
Beginning but we gon' do it at the end this time, I wanna
Take you to church real quick, So I'ma need some help
