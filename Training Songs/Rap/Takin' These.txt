Get it up, I mean give it up fool,
Now give me those minerals and those jewels
Because its me, the E on the attack and I'm back with this jack, and
Coming up on some products that I'm lacking

Well I'm that other ruthless type of brother
Oh, you ain't heard about my antics?
Shit, I ran cliques throughout history
That left the U.S. frantic
Get us all romantic
Before they fucked us I got a hand trick
With the Glock for these busters

Four hundred years ago fool where is my dough?
The year is 94 black folks ain't taking it no more
We on the rise, the Coup is not the bad guys
You know, taking from the rich giving it back to the poor
So, yo, put your two faced ass on the floor and get real
I can't feed my family with a Happy Meal

To the rescue but not Lone Ranger with the lasso
I got the 9mm pointed at your ass, yo
So Mr. IBM, give it up smooth (Smooth)
'Cause this time more than your bowels gon' move
See, it's a family thing, so don't even trip
My cousin J.D. got the nine
And my mama got the extra clip
So please oh please oh please give me them Nikes and free cheese
And while your on them knees break me off of my gees 'cause

We are taking these if you please (Cheerio)
We are taking these if you don't please
Check it out

Knock, knock, knock, motherfucker let me in
I just wanna kick it in your big ass den
And if you don't like it, take two to the chin
And show me to the kitchen 'cause my kids is getting dizzy
I don't have to talk shit about packing a gat, in fact
You could get bucked by any other motherfucker
Where I live at
Hear that? Money here is crystal clear punk
F*ck that fiscal year junk
Meet the pistol grip pump
Pistol grip pump, meet Mr. Rockefeller
We finna take him out, do him like Old Yeller
It's been too damn long, his profits ain't been mutual
That's why today it won't be business as usual

Call me the Repo Man
I'mma make you equal and
I'mma get you, if I can't my little sequel can
I know you're down with the Klan
But you must understand
You did the crime
So now its time to put this 9 in my hand
So put the money in the bag and 86 the tricks
Don't forget to add grits with those afro picks
And free licks on that ass
'Cause my ass ain't living fat
Boots you got my back? Where the f*ck you at?

I'm getting ammunition out the Pinto hatchback
Refer to this as "Operation Snatchback"
'Cause I got the fat sacks hollow tips to distribute equally
So who's the niggas, thugs, and pimps you mention frequently?
Gank me with frequency, now I know you got mail
And if my Glock fails
Take a sip of this molotov cocktail
Oh, is that your Rolls Royce?
Come off up them keys 'cause we are taking these
Even if you don't please

We are taking these if you please (Cheerio)
We are taking these if you don't please

How does it feel when you got no food
To go to supermarkets so the people wouldn't feel the move
How does it feel when you got no cash
How the f*ck you think it feel when your pocket's singing "Make it last"?

I choose to rock the boat instead Rock the Vote
And threw the mayor's body in the bay
To see if it would sink or float
You try to be the Mack to me, you can't we got agility
We taking factories, production plants, and all facilities
We got a gang of motherfuckas who done ate their Wheaties
No peace treaties, you swimming in your own feces
Screwed us now you are through with us and don't need us
Shoulda used a rubber 'cause this shit develop like a fetus

Sixteen carloads packed full of chicken
I'm riding shotgun and my trigger finger's itching
This shit is real we got the Infamil
Finsta to drop it off at the spot at 23rd and Foothill
I gives a f*ck if you the Army, Navy, or Marines
Ain't shit to lose 'cause you broke and packing Uzi magazines
I seen the po-po (pull the trigger) and flipped him the bird, 6 feet in the dirt
'Cause I guess he hadn't heard that
