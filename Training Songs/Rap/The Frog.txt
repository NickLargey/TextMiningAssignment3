She's waitin' for me now, man, don't wanna blow the move, man
'Cause you know I gotta go to her place
I go to another space when I look at her face

And look at her eyes they're deep like pools of water
I'm really turned on now and I know that I oughta
Hold her hand, let my love pour dance on the dance floor
If you can't dance, baby, I can show you
Jus' clap yo' hand and let the music take you

And put your foots in, and let it all shake ya
And take yo' head and put you hands up, ah
And shake your waist, ah, and you can tip it up
Just move your hands, eh, and move your waist, eh

You're looking in my eyes and in my face, ah
And then I feel you when I keep pace, ah
And then we dance, and we let the music happenin'
We fall in love all over again, again, again, we say

No time to waste when you're up in the spout
'Cause there's too many boppers that make my cock block

So I git myself together, make sure I'm looking smooth, man
Walk up pumpin' it as, and what you do, man

So I said maybe later we can get in the sun

We can skip to a diner and sip a little coffee
And talk about hip hop stars and astronomy

She said, 'Virgo', I said, 'Pisces mine'

And this was her favorite dish
And I never met a virgin pretty like this
