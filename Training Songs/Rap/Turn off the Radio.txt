Woo hoo
Crank up yo' speakers!

To all my (niggaz)
Every hustlin (nigga)
Strugglin (niggaz)
Revolutionary (niggaz)
Gang-bangin (niggaz)
Chain-gangin (niggaz)
Tune yo' frequency

I refuse to be a stereotype in ya box
Never want to try to be somethin' I'm not
I'm just a nigga from the block, if you got it twist it
Stay blowin' on green, if you got it, twist it on up
DP's givin' a f*ck, R-B-G'd up in some gangsta chucks
Throw ya fist up homie if ya know what's up
All my comrades puttin' in soldier work
We rollin' dirty wit it, fully dedicated
So real that the radio'll never play it
But that's cool, the enemy supposed to hate it
Freedom ain't gon' come til we regulate 'em
That's why I'm in the dojo, not just for the video
Really though, we really got beef with the po-po
Never know when they gon' put you in a choke hold
This is for you new niggaz, holdin for the radio

Turn off the radio!
Turn off that bullshit! (Freak-freak y'all)
Turn off the radio!
Turn off that bullshit! (Freak-freak y'all)
Turn off the radio!
Turn off that bullshit! (Freak-freak y'all)
Turn off the radio!

People's Radio
Yo hang up, that's the police

What's on the radio, propaganda, mind control
And turnin' it on is like puttin' on a blindfold
'Cause when you bringin' the real you don't get rotation
Unless you take over the station
And yeah I know it's part of they plans
To make us think it's all about party and dancin'
And yo it might sound good when you spittin' your rap
But in reality, don't nobody live like that
You want to know what kinda nigga I am?
Lemme tell you 'bout the nigga I'm not, I don't f*ck with the cops
Platinum don't mean that it gotta be hot
I ain't gotta love it, even if they play it a lot
You can hear it when you walk the streets
How many people they reach, how they use music to teach
A "radio program" ain't a figure of speech
Don't sleep, 'cause you could be a radio freak (freak-freak y'all)

Turn off the radio!
Turn off that bullshit! (Freak-freak y'all)
Turn off the radio!
Turn off that bullshit! (Freak-freak y'all)
Turn off the radio!

People's Radio, you on the air
I got a phat chain, I got a phat whip
I got a
Nigga get off that bullshit!
