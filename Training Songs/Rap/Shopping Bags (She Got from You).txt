[Random talking in the background]

Woman talking: We not going to JC Penney's, we not going to Macy's either

[Chorus]
Shopping bags they weigh down her arm
Popping tags and collars her charm
All them things she got, she got from you
All them things she got, she got from you
Manolo and Prada's her style
Louis, Burberry by the pile
All them things she got, she got from you
All them things she got, she got from you

Yo she know you come to do it, so what you want
Candle light might flick you
Put your credit card to it, she know what to flaunt
Her handle tight like a master

She used to taunt on the runway, yeah she's down to tree
The avenue like her catwalk
Struck a bit to the gun play, that housing street
looks to die for, ask that chalk man for yo' hand

Spend it, you live to show
All the cash that you can burn
What you need is to end it, cause you give the dough
But get no ass back in return

Stay laughing, straight at you dog
Best believe, you wasting time
Don't deny what's happening, just clear the fog
And achieve you a peace line, yo it goes like

[Chorus: Only half of the chorus]

She got from you, she, sh-she, she got it
She got from you, she, sh-sh, sh-she got it

Her frame goes beyond thick, she got you stunned
Living it up off the pop hits
Like a dame on a Bond flick, she's not the one
To give it up 'til you cop shit
J
ust because she's stacked right, she got your soul
Her every wish you now obey
You should be on that act right, but she got control
She say jump you scream, "Okay! I'm reloaded!"

Nigga you shooting blanks
Trying to front like you got game
Her crib is sugar coated, like she looting banks
But it's your wallet she done claimed

When the limit of your plastic, reaches the end
You start paying for your time
She'll be in it for the last bit, of money to spend
And you'll be left with dimes
While she filling up

[Chorus]

She got from you, she, sh-she, she got it
She got from you, she, sh-sh, sh-she got it
