I Wont
I Wont
I Wont
I Wooont
Cause i Came to Far

[Verse 1]

Tryin to Know whats goin on
Echoes on my celluar phone
I noticed a couple items missing
Could it be the FEDS still listening?
See i outa' beat those cases
Dead time for the missalanious
And they proceed to keep on watching
Cause i outa seen them lately
Interigated my mom
Locked up half of my crew!
But i can guarantee one thing that i wont let you DO!

[CHORUS]

I Wont let you lock me down
I Wont let you push me 'round
I Wont Let you stop me now
I Wooont , Cause i Came Too far

I Wont let you ruin my day
I wont let you stop my pain
I wont , Noo not today!
I woont, Cause I came too far

[Verse ]

Devil's Always wathing me(wathing me)
Evil's always stocking me(stocking me)
God has been protecting me(protecting me)
And thats how i got this far
Cause when you look at me you see an ANGEL
cant belive i been throught half the things that i went through
Cause everyday i see your face( my face)
Keep gettin screwed by the human race( my race)
So, Please dont you judge me unless you know me
Cause I wont let you. . .

I woont, Cause I came too far

Came To far to turn back now( too far)
Came To Far to turn back now( too far)
Aint no body gonna stop me( cant stop)
Aint no body gonna stop me ( cant stop)
