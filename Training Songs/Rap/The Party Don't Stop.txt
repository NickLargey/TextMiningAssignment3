I got the ghetto grooves guaranteed to make your shoes move 
Through the dance floor 
What you came for? Actin' like ain't know 
That I flows everything over knocks 
With the peep by the pound 
And the ice cream shop 
They finally drop the first lady off that No Limit tape 
And I'ma act a plum fool baby think I ain't! 
You can't see even if you had a bird's eye view 
Or bifocals, these mind vocals just goes 
On and on, you know you can't resist 
So let your head knock back and look forward to this, Miss 
Biggest Momma with the Drama and Prada 
Fly known rigotta and my ice just gotta 
Light up the room like Vegas 
Been by my papa,ever since my flight that China white 
Peelin' wit' the steel, recognize the real 
Better rimes and bring skills I will 
Keep it locked,word to my moms dreadlocks 
Some nights I just want to set the party on top 
Wit' P and the Ill Na Na,unified hip hop 
Mo' chedda as long as the party don't stop 

[Chorus]
We don't care if the party don't stop 
Got nothing but time so let the beat knock pop 
Bangin' to the east 
Shakin' it to the west 
Throw it up Northside 
And the south gonna handle the rest 

There ain't No Limit to this game I spit 
36's on 55, I got money to get 
It's the I'll na na wit' the Big Momma 
Now I'm the Big Poppa,I mean a Big Dada 
I used to make my money husting' and bustin' wit' gats 
Now a days I get money for bustin' rhymes and raps 
I got the cocoa and cream, not the kind that steam 
'Cause it's crispy and clean 
Cristal and green, uh! 
600 wit' that 28 inch wheel
Word is 50 wit' no dollar bills 
Pearl presidential wit' that big and best
Tears on our backs but they still can't handle 
Independent black owned and I'm 'bout it 'bout it 
That's why No Limit is rowdy rowdy! 

[Chorus]

Uh, you know that na na don't fake none 
Millions by the Mason 
Shit, money I'ma take some 
Ask P, he know that Fox gettin' nasty 
Little sassy ass, 'bout it 'bout it 
Hoes know I don't play that free shit 
Make 'em lick my shit hard 
Then leave that nigga with his dick hard 
Huh, you got to work me to hurt me 
And when I'm bored f*ck around on how you jerk yours 
From NY to NO, niggaz know they my hoes, bringin' my doe 
want to floss wit' me in the front seat of your 3 
Hundred Benz-do, watch us work them ends though 
Baddest bitch with that multi platinum clit 
Peep this, don't let a trick f*ck you when I know you lick
Ice Cream Man 

Wit' the ill na na and this Big Momma 
That's why the party don't stop 

[Chorus]
