I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in brooklyn
Observing the crookedness as it mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had
Good friends we've lost along the way
In this great future you can't forget your past, so dry your tears
I say and to my peeps who passed away

No woman, no cry, no woman no cry, say say say
Hey little sister don't shed no tears
No woman no cry say say say

I remember when we used to rock in a project yard in jersey
And little georgie would make the firelight
As stolen cars passed through the night
And then we'd hit the corner store for roots, paper, and brew
My drink's my only remedy
For pain of losing family, but while I'm gone shorty
Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be alright
Fugees come to the dance tonight, everything's gonna be alright
O everything's gonna be alright
The gun man's in the house tonight
But everything's gonna be alright

Oh ah oh ah

No woman, no cry, no woman no cry, say say say
Hey little sister don't shed no tears
No woman no cry say say say

I remember when we used to sit in a government yard in trench town
The hypocrites as they mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had oh good friends we've lost
Along the way hey
In this great future
You can't forget your past so dry your tears I say
And no woman no cry. no woman no cry say say say
Hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman no cry and to my peeps who passed away

Oh ah oh ah
