Dark and lovely, no one above thee,
Girl you really got it goin' on
I wanna spank, I wanna thank ya.
you're the reason why I sing this song.
Are roses red, are violets blue,
who cares as long as I'm with you.
Sugar, let's just run away 
where only the two of us can play.
Let's run away.
You're sweet as honey and just as sunny 
as a nice and warm afternoon
Your smiling face, your loving grace
could light up any room.
Now I won't flinch but I need a pinch
to make sure I'm not dreaming.
'Cause loving like this doesn't come ev'ry day
and I've got a couple of words that I'd like to say
 
There's a little something that you should know
I'm in love, ooh ooh
I got a thang for ya baby
 
Ms. Good Stuff, aw you're so tuff
You put some things on my mind
Now don't desert me but, Girl, just hurt me
With all the love you could find, aw, Baby Girl
My lemon drop, my lollipop
Girl, candy must be yo name
'Cause yo sweetness is my weakness
And I'm damn sure nothing can beat this
 
Girl, I bet cha that since I met ya 
The sun just shines everyday
The dreariness of loneliness
Has done my own way
I never want it 'cause my heart has found us
Thinking when we're apart
That we must have hit the spot
Sending an arrow straight to my heart.
 
There's a little something that you should know
I'm in love, ooh ooh
I got a thang for ya baby.
 
Some folks are just old fashioned 
but I know that other folks just want some action
tell me who is looking for a in the heart
'cause you and I keep love alive 
and Baby, you know we should never ever let it die
 
There's a little something that you should know
I'm in love, ooh ooh
I got a thang for ya baby.
There's a little something that you should know
I'm in love, ooh ooh
