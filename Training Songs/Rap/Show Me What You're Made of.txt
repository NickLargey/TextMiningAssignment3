I don't wanna give you up
I just wanna give you love
I don't wanna make it tough
'Cause you don't wanna do too much
I don't wanna say goodbye
I just wanna stay the night
Show me what you are made of
Can you show me what you are made of

Yo, making out on my tour bus
So fresh probably thought it was a Corvette
And if you are wondering why your girl ain't making plans with you
Well mothafucka she ignored them (f*ck her, she ignored them)
Hashtag She was hanging with a rapper now
Remember when you were the shit, Manny Pacquiao
Things change so fast nowadays
'Cause you used to front hard now you are super good at backing out
One shot, two shot, now you are blacking out
Think you fucking with the king, what's your rationale
I'll be coming for the title, tell your girl to come over
She will be missing all the finals (she be missing all her finals)
I'm gonna teach you a thing or two
What's a fling for me, it's probably a ring for you
I got Mary, Megan, Mandy, Morgan, I'm a smash em' Billy Corgan, shwoop

I don't wanna give you up
I just wanna give you love
I don't wanna make it tough
'Cause you don't wanna do too much
I don't wanna say goodbye
I just wanna stay the night
Show me what you are made of
Can you show me what you are made of

And you don't gotta to turn me down
I'll come in when no one is home
Baby let me turn you on
I treat you like a new iPhone
Girl you could be a star
F*ck that you 'cause already are
Show me what you are made of
Can you show me what you are made of

Yo, Ray Allen in the 90s 'cause I got game
Two girls in my hotel and I'm not paying
She wanted to know my occupy
I said, I make money money make money money, hey
Like I rob banks, Uncle Phil Dough
Come to my place if you want a real show
She got me feeling like a Magic Mike
You're a beauty girl, tell me what the pageant is like
Skinny chick with a booty and got an appetite
If she catches looking I just act polite (like, like)
Yo what a conundrum, bitches are punch drunk
Love like Floyd Mayweather, just pumped em, full of some Russian vodka
Said she out of my league like the Brooklyn Dodgers
Everyone tryin' to be the MVP
I take your girl from court-side to show her the lockers, ugh

I don't wanna give you up
I just wanna give you love
I don't wanna make it tough
'Cause you don't wanna do too much
I don't wanna say goodbye
I just wanna stay the night
Show me what you are made of
Can you show me what you are made of

And you don't gotta to turn me down
I'll come in when no one is home
Baby let me turn you on
I treat you like a new iPhone
Girl you could be a star
F*ck that you 'cause already are
Show me what you are made of
Can you show me what you are made of

I do whatever I want
I say whatever I want
I live however I want (ever I want, ever you want)
I steal whatever I want
I kill whatever I want
I f*ck whatever I want (ever I want, ever you want)
