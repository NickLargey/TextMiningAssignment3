Yo tone what we need?

{Chorus}
More gum, less hate, more real, less fake, more come, less wishing
Less stuntin more famous talking more changes rushing _________

More franchising less sanitizing
More uprising less downsizing
More enterprising less sympathizing
More buildings less destroying
More jobs less unemployment
Lets get the devil less enjoynment
More originality less biting pocket off big
More community activism less pigs
More blacksmithing, def jux less geffen
And the rest cause the rest suck the got the shit all messed up
More marijuana less coke
More countability for politicians before we shoutin lets vote
More schools less prisons
More freestyles less written
More serious shit and less kidding
More history less mystery
More Beyonce less Brittany
More happiness less misery
More victory less losses
More workers, we all bosses
Of course its reflection....
What we need?

{Chorus}

God bless the hood where my money always good
I can get you take it now thinkin couldn't when I could son
I live above the rim and pay the full like my nigga would
Crack is old niggas wish, we all wish a nigga would
Crack a joke like he wanna battle for the mic
This is Brooklynn, the planet
Y'all niggas is just satellites
Revolve around my every word
I address the crowd like Lincoln at Gettysberg
Surrounded by the heavy herb
The crowd is more or less
War to war here for the pure
Hip-hop how im rockin got them dropin they jaw
Fire marshall blocking the door
Theres a crack like they chopping the raw
This the shit the cops stoping us for
This the reign of the tek and them motherfucking b nuts
Slice like the nip-tuck
Specialize in deep cuts
Its the music that you ridin to
Provided to you by Kweli and Hi-tek the livest two...
Yeah, what we need?

{Chorus}


The more I put into it the more it, the less it sounds like nonsense
The more natural the less conscience,
At the same time the more bomb shit
The less the devil got a grip
I get it loose we gotta slip away, the ghetto gotta get
More for a dollar
More fresh goods for purchase
Less liquor stores
Less churches that be lookin like corner stores
More rap songs that stress purpose with
Less  misogyny and less curses
Lets put more depth in our verses, till they left on the surface
While we stomp through the underground
The cop don't come around
You sort of hoping for that reflection
You sort of open I'm ma heed call him chosen
I don't play with your emotions,
Stop acting so god damn emotional
I give you these bars for free like they promotional,
This ain't no marketing strategy
It had to be from the heart in order to be reality
Reflection...
What we need?
