Baby, you know you mean the world to me
That's why I can't keep you in this situation
Where I can hurt you, can I talk to you? (Ok)

First of all, I want to tell you, that all I do, is have love for you,
No matter if we go separate ways, I'll still ride for you,
Cause you're the truth, can't be replaced,
You the type of girl that make a nigga go out and get the ring,
But the problem is, I'm not positive,
That I can give the commitment, that you're asking for,
Cause right now I'm young, and though you're the one,
I can't guarantee, that I can be the one (you want someone who is faithful)
I'm not admitting I can't do it,
Just don't want to put you through it (If I may happen to see one)
She may holla, I may holla, but I wouldn't do that to you, no.

Girl I feel that I'll be cheating you,
If I continue to see you, 'cause you're ready to get serious,
I'm not 'cause I'm still curious,
Said I'd rather keep it real and tell you how I feel,
Cause I think you're beautiful and I don't want to hurt you, no.

See over and over again, I keep saying to myself,
I must be goin' out my mind, to not want to spend all my time with her,
Cause I love you more (I love you more)
Then to game you're heart (To game you're heart)
Cause I know that I'm not ready,
(To lock it down full-time, settle down with one dime, spend the rest of my life with you)
It's better to cry now, then to hate me later,
Trust me I've had a broken heart before and I (I know just how it feels)
And know in time it will (In time it will reveal)
If our love is real.
