Killa
This my man Jim Jones
You know we been through a lot of devastation, larceny
Defeat, misconceptions
Man, f*ck all that, I don't know what that's about but f*ck all that
Jim, I'm in the building
Dipset, it's your turn, you up nigga!
Let's go!

I'm puffin' my weed and these niggaz, they mad
I'm frontin' this season
As far as they hoes, they want me to see 'em
I f*ck 'em and then they don't want me to leave 'em
An addictive obsession, I twist 'em, I sex 'em
My dick's an obsession
They call me, they miss me, they stressin'
I call 'em, they miss me, they stressin'

These hoes, they sayin' that shit that'll kill ya
I'm rich now, this kid look familiar
As far as my Dips, we rich the cars and the whips
We spent what you spent on your car on my wrist
Don't bother me bitch
In the midst of this grind, I'm twistin' my lime
I'm 'bout to get cash, and you can kiss ass
Dipset got this shit up on smash

This is Jim Jones, he's breezin' on chrome
Ya best bet is leave him alone
O.G. in them stones, spent G's on them stones
Now mami just send me the tone

These are true stories, I used to live poorly
And now man I live in two stories
Get suited in Maury, the coupe is Ferrari
The coupe cost 140, you don't wanna race, I will move on you shorty
Look good on them cameras
They love me, I put my whole hood up on cameras
They bloody, niggaz in hood with them blamas
Tell me, so do it for grandma

We did it from druggin' and [Incomprehensible]
We did it from hustlin' and comin' up wrong
We did it from strugglin' and comin' up strong
Still runnin' with cons, with guns in their palms
You front on Dipset, we will dump on your moms
Or come through with bombs and stop and park
And set off them bombs

This is Jim Jones, he's breezin' on chrome
Ya best bet is leave him alone
O.G. in them stones, spent G's on them stones
Now mami just send me the tone

You got to admit I'm hot when I spit
Like a summertime's tropic's eclipse
Like a drop on the strip with no top on the whip
A block it yeah I put with them cops on the strips
With glocks on their hip
Like shells when they drop when them shots get dismissed
The pain in my heart been my aim from the start
We started when we came from the star

Now we all gainin' on charts
With back to back hits, like Yankees an' shit
Dipset, we gangsta as shit but I credit my ghetto
'Cause now we rock platinum, the preciousest metal
Don't press us, we'll press on this metal and blow you apart
Shoulda known from the start
My jewels, they glow in the dark
You fools, keep playin' ya part

This is Jim Jones, he's breezin' on chrome
Ya best bet is leave him alone
O.G. in them stones, spent G's on them stones
Now mami just send me the tone
