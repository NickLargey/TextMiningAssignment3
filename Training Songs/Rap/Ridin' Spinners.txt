This for all my players out there ridin',
Spinners I don't care where you at, the club parking lot the expressway
Whatever what I want you to do right now is just stop
And let 'em keep spinnin' baby

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, it's rollin'

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, I'm rollin'

Pedal to the metal then stop
Take another sip from the syrup then stop
Let my seat back, drop the top then stop
See me something sexy, spot that ass I gotta stop

My rims so shiny they clear like flat screen plasma
Gals faint when they see 'em it's hard to breathe, like they got asthma
Older people trippin' 'cause they think they seein' thangs
My car sittin' still but my rims still rolin' man, they off the chain

Everybody let ya spin wheels spin like a spin mill
Juicy J on certain pills, cruisin' down to Knoxville
See them thangs shinin'
Sparkin' like a diamond, bumpin' the Alpine, why you's a lyin'

Eyes like a Chinese, I'm drinkin' on the heiny
I'm ridin' on the strip, any party you can find me
You rollin' with the finest the north Memphis highness
You ball till ya fall, till a player aged ninety

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, it's rollin'

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, I'm rollin'

I got twenty inch spinners on my drop
Nothin' but white and yellow rocks in my watch
I'm doin' one fifty so I'm watchin' for the cops
Since I'm in the Lamborghini I ain't gon' stop

I'm packin' a Glock believe it or not I'm ready to bust
And down here we drink purple and we drink that, trust
So grab a cup juice so I can pour it up
And if you represent yo hood, go on throw it up

It's the L-I-L, F-L-I-P
If I ain't smokin' trees, I'm pokin' freaks
So throw the row of keys and let me roll
'Cause this the way we ball, I'm just lettin' you know

We like our music slow but our cars go faster
I'm in the V-12 with my cousin Big Shasta
I'm Lil' Flipper and I'm a top ten seller
Everybody slowin' down 'cause my drop is yellow

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, it's rollin'

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, I'm rollin'

I saw my dog with the center circles so I
They spinnin' like a saw so don't touch 'em when I
I saw a shanky broad that owe me money so I
See me choke the hell up out my broad when I

When ya stand by the blades you can feel a slight breeze
Stop by House of Dubs just to keep 'em on clean
Fell up in the Peabody, the most expensive suite
Them thangs still spinnin' when I filled out the receipt

I used to be clean in my expedition
A girl see me and she'll be wishin'
That I'd stop and spit some pimpin'
It's mackin' in me baby, I just thought I would mention

She got hot like in the kitchen
You see my kin folks, cars and glisten
Ain't nothin' like Sprewells 'cause they spinnin'
It's CB baby I'm just in it to win it

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, it's rollin'

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, it's rollin'
