Verse One: Everlast

Johnny was a bad boy, he was juvenile delinquent
He had his picture on the wall of every precinct
He had a rep of hanging out with his homies
Puffin on the blunts and sippin on the forties
But when he spoke, nobody would listen
And when he was home, yo, his parents they would diss him
They called him a bum a worthless piece of shit, so over this he had a fit
And now he grabs his bag and heads for the door
And walks to the neighborhood liquor store
Pulls out a gun tells the old man "Hit the floor!"
Then breaks open the register drawer
Pulls out the money stuffs it in his pocket
Points his pistol then he starts to cock it
The man panics and gun goes off
Stupid old fool made Johnny blow his head off
But he don't care cause Johnny was thought
It ain't a crime if you don't get caught

Chorus: Everlast

It ain't a crime if you don't get caught (repeat 3X)
That's how it is homie like it or not

Verse Two: Evelast

Now coming out store Johnny shot two Haisidic Jews
And when he got home his face was on the news
His mom freaked out told him get the f*ck out
That when the pigs rolls up, so yo he ducked out
He hit the backdoor like his name was Carl Lewis
Skipped to the payphone to find out where his crew is
He called up his homeboy Jose, "Word up!"
"Can I come over my man?", he said, "No way 
a cop was here he was looking all over for you
but I told the pig that I didn't know you"
He said, "Cool meet me up at the school
I need a ride cause I'm wanted for homicide"
Johnny got a gun and now he's on the run
But he don't care to him this shits fun
Now that he's an outlaw sorta like Robin Hood
The hard rock hero of the whole neighborhood
If they catch him he'll wind up in court
But it ain't a crime if you don't get caught

Chorus

New Chorus: Everlast

It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
It ain't a sale if it don't get bought
It ain't a show if I don't get paid
She ain't a hoe if you don't get laid
