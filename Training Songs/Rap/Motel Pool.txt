Babe, I can tell that you need to get away
Don’t say a word, it’s written on your face
I know that you are going through it
One of those lonely summer nights

I know it’s hard
Don’t mind the heat, just hop into my car
And I got the space, I’ll take you to the stars
Girl you don't, don’t have to talk about it
I’m gonna make everything alright

She said I can’t be
Here right now
I told her come with me
I slow your whole world down

‘Cause we drove way too far
Now it’s just you and me in the dark
Baby I take the weight from your heart
Wash the worries off your mind tonight
Lets dive into the motel pool
Into the motel pool
Let me fall into your the motel pool
Wash the worries off your mind tonight

We got all night
Layin' with you under the neon lights
Floating together suspect getting time
They probably looking for us
But girl there’s nothing to find
We won’t get caught
Keep your voice down, we don’t want them to hear
Whisper all your troubles in my ear
And I’ll make 'em vanish for ya
But tell me where is your mind

She said I can’t be
Here right now
I told her come with me
I slow your whole world down

‘Cause we drove way too far
Now it’s just you and me in the dark
Baby I take the weight from your heart
Wash the worries off your mind tonight
Lets dive into the motel pool
Into the motel pool
Let me fall into you’re the motel pool
Wash the worries off your mind tonight

And when you see the moonlight falling on your skin
I know I would do, anything, for you
So don’t you be afraid of nothing, just have it
I’m going to make you see that you’re safe with me
‘Cause baby we drove way too far
Now it’s just you and me in the dark
Baby I take the weight from your heart
Wash the worries off your mind tonight

‘Cause baby we drove way too far
Now it’s just you and me in the dark
Baby I take the weight from your heart
Wash the worries off your mind tonight
Then I will dive into the motel pool
Into the motel pool
Then I will dive into you’re the motel pool
Wash the worries off your mind tonight

Motel pool, to the motel pool
Let me fall into motel pool
Wash the worries off your mind tonight
