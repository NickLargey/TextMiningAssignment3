[Featuring De La Soul] 
INTRO 
What's up  world? 
Goin' give you a little love right here 
My man  DJ Honda blessed us with a joint 
Word up  De La up in here  ha 
We goin' to spread a little love 
To some folks who up in my hair right now 
Ah'ight? Check it out 
Verse One 
It was a big deal moving my big wheel to L.I. 
Had a back yard  tho' shit moved slow 
Caught a cat on the humble  wassup  wassup  kid? 
Ya'll be memorizin' flicks of the wild things we did 
We was brick-ball niggas, six small niggas 
And they knew it, and wasn't no-body runnin' through us 
Steppin' in the backyard parties was a blast 
Fucking up our sneakers on the wet grass 
Remember getting stabbed in ya ass? 
Your Moms sat us all down 
Said we was niggas and clowns but it was just love 
And plus love showed me that she was a diamond 
Findin' out God, took a hit me dead on my heart 
And made the eye water start 
But you was strong, can ya hear me Huggy? 
Keep your mind crystal clear when your thought gets muggy 
We them easy street kids from Mr. Bryant's basement 
Wishin' for the Apollo, tryin' to get dough 
Now my time moves slow, ain't it all full circle? 
A dove cry makes the whole scene turn purple 
Remember that night you had to hide in the freezer? 
For real, see them kids were real, we still ?slear? 
But now we grown niggas, and we handling kids 
We been since day one, and the days ain't over 
Gotta share a back seat, push with the chauffer 
My Pops said he's waiting for your ass in the zone 
So we can fly to the land, and welcome you home 
Rob-O see we good to go, you know the rest... 
Don't stress, love-love baby. Ah'ight? 
Chorus 
If you got time to give, I got time to think 
See, it could all change in one eye blink 
While you in the trouble water I hope ya don't sink 
Don't sink, don't sink, don't sink 
Verse Two 
Check it out 
Some rarely saw the negative cause 
From the depths of one's blurred everything's now 
Cleared by laws 
Mad for mere seconds, in the span of dying 
Trying to tell you don't go, I'm about to blow 
No mo' innocence, it's about the dollars 
And events of fame 
Aren't you? Search your name 
From the group? Search your name 
On the dotted line, back before the rhyme I had reasons 
To punch the kid who tried teasin' during lunch 
It was a matter of pro-mo-ting de-cen-cy 
But the 'de' and the 'cy' fell off, so I sinned 
Again and again, until Jesus came down 
Wait, I'm still sinning! I guess he hasn't reached the ground! 
Thoughts of me, before my voice could 
Even recall, couldn't afford the physical peep 
How then was now, but now is not 
Yo, I'm a minute wiser but it seems, kid 
I got some beef, can't take or shake off the wrong 
Accept my apologies to Bob, pass the horn! 
No need for false alarm 
Word up! 
The Nuyopian charm is for show back again 
It's rememberin' the was that is now gone 
For the access of the now so I can move on 
For the access of the now so I, so I 
Chorus x2 
Outro 
G'night world, g'night world 
De La, yo 
My man DJ Honda is on the beat like this 
Don't sink, don't sink, don't sink, don't sink ya'll 
Just letting ya'll into the fleeing moments 
Of the memories of mine 
And about like this, one time, one time
