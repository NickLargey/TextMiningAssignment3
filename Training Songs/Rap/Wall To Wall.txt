My nigga Raekwon talkin', uh-huh
Everythin' you want you don't need
And don't believe everythin' you read
And only have what you see

I said I won't, I don't need it, yeah
Don't believe everythin' you read, yeah
Only have what you see, yeah
Man, this shit is what it is, yeah, ooh

It's "Hello", oh, Lord
When you're tryin' to bail out, who to call?
Your bitch turned down, this shit is love
Me and my niggas feel love, we're goin' to walk
We're goin' to walk, wall to wall
My money's stacked up, wall to wall
My shows' packed up, wall to wall
Her ass stepped up, wall to wall
Got my money up, we, we're goin' to walk

Clear view, dark tints
Hustle by the park bench
White top, blue tops
Niggas I don't call friends
('Til they called it love)
Called my niggas, grabbed their hammers
('Bout to go to war)
Prices on your head, I'm a spend it
Everythin' in that showroom, nigga, I was in it
On my son, I was in it, I was in it
Dirty money, ten chains, I be shinin', I ain't meant it
I'm shinin' every minute
Soft to the hard rock, Hard Rock Casino
Me and shorty watchin' Nino in the hardtop
I done counted ten mills whenever I drop
Me and Chinx poppin' bottles out on ?

I don't need it, yeah
Don't believe everythin' you read, yeah
Only have what you see, yeah
Man, this shit is what it is, yeah, ooh

It's "Hello", oh, Lord
When you're tryin' to bail out, who to call?
Your bitch turned down, this shit is love
Me and my niggas feel love, we're goin' to walk
We're goin' to walk, wall to wall
My money's stacked up, wall to wall
My shows' packed up, wall to wall
Her ass stepped up, wall to wall
Got my money up, we, we're goin' to walk

Frozen fish scale, you better go to Ishmael
Tiger-skin hammers sittin' by the Benz grill
Not's a hundreds, it's lunch, kid, play fair
Stay here, feed your brother, be's a one, shit
Enough money to slum kids, kings will pillows
Leave your body, yo, under the dumpsters
Take money suitcases, bracelets and cake mix
Come out the hole, this is weight flakes
So much bread, we build lead houses
Run in the shed, seen dead thousands
Faces, we call 'em big noses
Flashin' in the farmer shit, grubbed up niggas is wasted

I don't need it, yeah
Don't believe everythin' you read, yeah
Only have what you see, yeah
Man, this shit is what it is, yeah, ooh

It's "Hello", oh, Lord
When you're tryin' to bail out, who to call?
Your bitch turned down, this shit is love
Me and my niggas feel love, we're goin' to walk
We're goin' to walk, goin' to walk
My money's stacked up, wall to wall
My shows' packed up, wall to wall
Her ass stepped up, wall to wall
Got my money up

Yo, whip my feet up
Gettin' manicures in a zap and spectacular visuals
Niggas be camera phonin' up my movement
Everythin' we do to sit and take precedents
While we go stackin' procedurals
Niggas starvin' to know just how we do it
Absolutely be stayin' the money every night (Dracula)
Niggas, stay up in it like Jamaicans and stay in the maximum
Difficult to predict, I'm calculated like algebra
'Cause the money traced back to them diamond mines out in Africa
We in the future with it though, closin' my eyes for pictures
Phone'd have me speak with holograms when I'm buildin' with bitches
And then I bang 'em like body slammin', one-handin' 'em ishes
Like I was sellin' warheads and I'm baggage handlin' missiles
F*ck it, decided to blow and Em just bein' silly
With a bob and a step and a charisma like I sit on a billi
And for the five percent with the signs and 'em ones that really get me
I got a lot to do with civilizin' account and I'm busy

I don't need it, yeah
Don't believe everythin' you read, yeah
Only have what you see, yeah
Man, this shit is what it is, yeah, ooh

It's "Hello", oh, Lord
When you're tryin' to bail out, who to call?
Your bitch turned down, this shit is love
Me and my niggas feel love, we're goin' to walk
We're goin' to walk, wall to wall
My money's stacked up, wall to wall
My shows' packed up, wall to wall
Her ass stepped up, wall to wall
Got my money up, we, we're goin' to walk

Salute, salute
Yeah

Montana, what up, baby?
Word up, you know what it is, my nigga
Louis Rich right here, baby
Yeah, get it
You know what this is, nigga
