Yeah

Girl why do I suffer
Just because another
Selfish kind a lover, did you wrong
Baby I'm so sorry
He got there before me
It's another story now

I won't let you, I won't let you down
I won't let you, I won't let you drown 
Ooh baby

I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
Lean on me 'cause
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
Down, down, down, down

Boy that's what they all said
Sounded real good until they all left
You told me what makes you the one and only
But show me for a change
Don't take me on a night out
Just to say let's take it back to my house
That's not what I'm looking for right now
Gotta step up your game

Oh, I swear I won't let you down
You never hit the ground
You never have a doubt

Oh, I would love for you to be
The one that's meant for me
Come sweep me of my feet, oh

I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
Lean on me 'cause
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
Down, down, down, down

We could have everything
Love is all we need
Gotta take the leap
If we wanna make it last
Forget about the past, ooh
Ooh, ooh!

I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
Lean on me 'cause
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
I won't let you down (boy, you let me down)
Down, down, down, down

I will never let you down
