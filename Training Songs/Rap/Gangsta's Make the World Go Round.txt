[Ice Cube]
I am getting dizzy as the world keeps spinnin like a Frisbee
Gangsta's and girls make the world twirl
No hesitation I can run a nation from incarceration
30 years is what I'm facing
But give me 7 seas and 11 gees
I make enough cheese to bring wall street to its knees
Nigga please I got enough guns
To fill the empire state building full of 1's
Go to school is what you tell us
But nigga's in school is scared of the Good fellas
We got the Yayo you can just say no
But nobody makes a fucking move until I say so
That's how it is and that's how it's gonna be
Kids when you grow up who the f*ck you want to be?
Like me ya black superhero
Got enough zeros to hire Bob Shapiro
Ya honor I'm have to get rid of ya
Because it ain't no trivia about my house in West Bolivia
Blew the jury a kiss they rather dismiss
Them swim the big fish
You fucking guppies!

[Chorus]
Gangsta's make the world go round

[W.C.]
Not just sagging waving my flag and never will I ease up nigga
So stop asking see I was taught as a tiny loc on the set its all
About the pussy and money f*ck the rest nigga this tech is quicker
To collect when I'm seeking all the jewelry and the money so miss
Me with that preaching teaching f*ck all that bullshit I want to
Slang yea like Noriaga sit back watch my paper collect like the
I.R.S. as I kick it with 50 bitches all on my dick just like the
President & like the police I want a gang of killers all on my
Side that's down to lie more crooked that St. Ides rip ride on my
Behalf as I call shots as if I was Saddaam Hussein
Jacking mother- fuckers for Dana Danes hated by many bit I don't care because I
Rather be feared than loved with a pocket full of dubs because
Gangsta gangsta's make the world go round & if you want a piece
Then you best to be down so quit chastising me analzing me 
&like the escorts look over your sholder nigga its
Plain to see crooked ass cowards

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]
360 degrees like my D's the world be spinning
Nigga's been sinning since the beginning
History's a trip so I peep when I am reading
Nigga's probably grew weed in the garden of Eden
Before big balling sex cars and loot
Its like bitches been scandalous biting forbidden fruit
But gangster's don't deal with that shit, on the Westside
And since they regulating hoes I roll with the Best side
So check it as my lifetime is ticking
Coming up strong  licking and flipping chickens
Need cheese in amounts of G's
I gave up sports to slang Key's
But blamed it on my Knees
Make sure I got what I need
To make your order
Everything to baggies triple beams to jugs for my water
Like a snitch life's a bitch a world full of drama
Drug paraphernalia being found by my momma
Trauma brings the sad song on your way to killer king nigga
So now I stand with heat in my hand for my whole life span
Cause evil lurks the land
Plus I got a packet with this gang-bang jacket
Gotta hold it keep it loaded devoted since quoted
Fo sho One-0 got the ups on these prankstas
While the world keep twisting as a Westside 
Gangsta
For life nigga

[Chorus]
