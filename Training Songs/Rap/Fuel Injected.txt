[Chorus: x2]
Swollen Members gunna make us stop
Take a minute and remember who takes the top
To the critics and the civils your time is up
Just admit it everybody knows this crime is up
Its hot shit

Perfected but not invented
Rhymes from the ego driven self centered
Entered the fast lane and never gut dented
Life in a flash hypes blunts and hash
Three of my favorite word has made this
More hits than the majors up from the minors
Bust from the top dot cops and sirens
Fresh out the shop poppin' n' stylin'

Madchild, wildin' nonidentical
The cynical is medical condition is critical
Unforgettable Swollen Members beautiful
Language unsuitable tention n' onic
Coastal Chronic track got Moka on it
Independent with a different perspective
Select effective next (scratch sound) on exit
The young and the restless fool fuel injected

[Chorus: x2]

Y'all ain't got it so don't even think about it
'cause I'm tough if ya know the top
Swollen Members, Moka Only gonna take the shot
If you think you betcha know you better press for why
You can mop it in your song and repossess your mind
If you front it you can blow or you can testify
Someone else was about what it takes to climb
Whenever battle axe warriors come out to play
You can bet we gonna do it in a thousand way
And we sweating off the duel we resuscitate
Members only rock, shit, motherfucker bait, its hot shit

How many albums bought n sold
Triple ghetto gold rocked and rolled
Sound, mixed and mastiff
Stick with the program, get payed after
TV shows, zeens and magz
Positive feedback, jeans still sagged
Hands still knocked, Prevails gets props
The same as always rising to the top

With the sworm of excitement
Fighting form we invite criticism
Rhyme shine like prism
Spit flames we see in 3D vision
Even my people play CD in prison
Bad decision, fatal error
Get scars from bars and bomb every terror
We own label never get dropped
Now the crew combined and we can't be stopped

[Chorus: x4]
