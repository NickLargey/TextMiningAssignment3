Sweet thing, stay with me tonight
Take me into love
Whispers, wine and candle light
Baby, we can feel so good

So won't you come to me
Lay down in meticulously
Let me show you my secret side

Oh, baby can't you see
We're there for together it seems
We got pleasure in our stars tonight

Let me be the tutor that keeps you sweet
Let me be the lover your body needs
Wanna love you morning, noon and night
Baby, never stop

Gonna be the fantasy in your dreams
Wanna feel the thrill of your body heat
Baby, don't you realize we're so good together
Ain't no sin, baby givin' into love

Oh, baby rock me softly in a kiss
Make me lose control
Heaven never felt like this
Perhaps the only place I know

So baby, hold me tight
Tell me what you're dreaming of
Lay it down how a night should be

Come on and light my fire
No doubts, baby give it up
Are you ready for the way I feel

Let me be the tutor that keeps you sweet
Let me be the lover your body needs
Wanna love you morning, noon and night
Baby, never stop

Gonna be the fantasy in your dreams
Wanna feel the thrill of your body heat
Baby, don't you realize we're so good together
And it ain't no sin baby, givin' into love

Let me be the tutor that keeps you sweet
Let me be the lover your body needs
Wanna love you morning, noon and night
Baby, never stop

Gonna be the fantasy in your dreams
Wanna feel the thrill of your body heat
Baby, don't you realize we're so good together
It ain't no sin, baby givin' into love

Oh no, I'm giving into love

So baby, hold me tight
Tell me what you dreaming of
Oh, lay your loving down for me
The way it ought to be

Come on and light my fire
No doubts, baby, give it up
Are you ready for the way I feel?
