Or, lett-uce pray, tomato cheese pickle 
Mustard, ketchup, two black olives man 
Mayonnaise your hands off of it 
Punk, you understand? 
I don't think so 'cause these freaks keep on bothering me

But I don't want that, so I should go where LL stay, huh 
To find that cutie with that nice fat booty 
So I can do my duty, and she will smile like Tudy 
From the Facts of Life that used to be on NBC 
However recently you've got to catch the repeats G, uh

It's kind of tempting please don't feel I'm condescending 
I'd like to touch you in a place that makes you uncomf-ortable 
Uh, that rapper's full of bull 
C'mon with Bass because I've got lots of pull 
Don't fabricate, he ain't straight, I'm an is, he's an ain't 
I'm full of oil, he is just a water paint 
Never de too much, never de too much 
Never de too much, never de too much, such, and such 
Type of words bein spoken 
When you ride the train you must have a token 
Four o'clock in the mornin', I was awoken 
And there ain't no jokin', when the pussy hoes are open 
The previous rhyme I told him, was stolen 
Lick my colon, sell you out like Colin, Powell 
Whoa ha hah, like that and 
And I rip shit ah, rip shit ah
