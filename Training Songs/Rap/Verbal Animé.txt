Like, uh, this is your lucky day, see
I will uh like, you know, fill you in how come
Suppose you like didn't, uh
run up to a couple of sweet guy like us
Heavens no!
Oh yeah well we wouldn't want that to happen
So I tell you what we're gonna do
Oh let's just dispense with formalities
And uh, get down to like business

This is verbal anime, graphic animation

I've seen ghosts in the shell, ninja scrolls, and a curer
But the illest character I've seen was in the mirror
Open up the world, people lend me an ear
It's a family affair and let me make that clear
Raaka, I keep my propaganda proper
In circles I'm high, swing blades like helicopters
In this stage of my life I choose to develop shock words
While cats look lost without the teleprompters
Federado tour duty, medal of honor
Since life is a battle your best bet is betting on it
Check the conference, we on stage with weapons on us
Microphones, straight Robin Hoods, its economics
Yes yes, it all starts with a sketch
Snapshots, motion pictures and special effects
We stretch the game out, we expand the nation
And this is verbal anime graphic animation

Funk imagination
Come to illustration
Then we bring pictures to life
We call it animation

You got to know the time like the grand verbalizer
It's time, Iriscience with The Herbaliser
A light this bright might burn through your visor
I know you want to squint, but, open your eyes up!
I jump up and let the earth spin round
And don't come down 'til I'm floating over your town
Nothing to prove, making the people move
Whether double-decker bus, taxi or the tube
Mind the cap, we did crime now we climb the map
Check how I spit rhyme to rap
Yes yes, it all starts with a sketch
Snapshots, motion pictures and special effects
We stretch the game out, expand the nation
This is verbal anime graphic animation
Oh, Herbaliser, U.K, CA, LA, all day

Funk imagination
Come to illustration
Then we bring pictures to life
We call it animation

I trade money at the Combio, dollars for pounds
Massacre, musical murder I'm killing your sound!
But hardly softly, how's that feel to you now?
I chew raw iron and I spit steel to the crowd
Magnetic attraction don't repel
I attract retail, underground rebel
Dilated Peoples: the few, the proud, the brave
Nice in the studio and +Live On Stage+
Drop so many bars I leave the beat in a cage
Some are courageous, some afraid to turn the page
Rappers stacking rhymes, you can take a quick look
And animate my lyric sheets like a flip book
Thoughts in effect it all starts with a sketch
Snapshots, motion pictures and special effects
Stretch the game out, expand the nation
This is verbal anime graphic animation

"I know you would see it our way because we explained it very fully"
"This is verbal anime" Iridescence
"I'm not gonna get neutralized but few except what I said"
