You're necessary, you're very necessary, I need you like the air I breathe,
I need you near me, just gotta have you near me, wanna feel like a heartbeat,
You keep me going, 'til morning keep me going, you put me in overdrive,
Try not to show it, try my best not to show it, but boy you stay on my mind

I can't ignore my body's reaction, when I'm close to you (to you)
And this ain't just your basic attraction, I know you feel it too,

Take my hand, take a chance, feel the rhythm of love, love,
Close your eyes, let's get lost in the rhythm of love, love,
Rhythm of love, love, love, rhythm of love, love, love
Close you eyes, let's get lost in the rhythm of love, love

Think I'm in heaven, if this isn't heaven, it's the closest that I'll ever be,
I'm trynna tell ya, the longer we're together, it's messing with my sanity,
It's overrated, it's really overrated, f*ck waiting we should do it now,
You're hesitating, quit hesitating, don't be afraid I show you how, afraid I'll show you how how...

I can't ignore my body's reaction, when I'm close to you (to you)
And this ain't just your basic attraction, I know you feel it too,

Take my hand, take a chance, feel the rhythm of love, love,
Close your eyes, let's get lost in the rhythm of love, love,
Rhythm of love, love, love, rhythm of love, love, love
Close you eyes, let's get lost in the rhythm of love, love

Lost in the, lost in the, lost in,
Lost in the, lost in the (the rhythm of love)
Lost in the, lost in the, lost in,
Lost in the, lost in the

I can't ignore my body's reaction, when I'm close to you (to you)
And this ain't just your basic attraction, I know you feel it too,
(Lost in the, lost in the, lost in,
Lost in the, lost in the [x2])

Take my hand, take a chance, feel the rhythm of love, love,
Close your eyes, let's get lost in the rhythm of love, love,
Rhythm of love, love, love, rhythm of love, love, love
Close you eyes, let's get lost in the rhythm of love, love
