Violent J And Shaggy 2 Dope: 
Always uninvited f*ck off unrespected, sometimes he creeps other times he's expected 
He hangs out in bad neighborhoods up at the park he will strike in broad day light but prefers the dark 
Three little kids caught inside a burning home he'll just sit there and wait for 'em leave 'em alone! 
As sure as we're alive today and death is inveitable he's waitin' there watching through the eyes of a crow fo' sho' I know yo 

Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope Chorus: 
Death is always a shitty time 
Don't bother trying to run and hide 
Take his hand cross to the other side (Step to the other side) 

Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope: 
Freeway intersections when the bars close, he loves 'em 
Blew out traffic lights? He hovers above him 
And he loves the motherfuck out of crackheads and heroin 
Rehab centers and caring mothers always scaring him 
Sharing them needles? 
He encourages and raw sex? 
They got him working and steady collecting soul checks 
Then again 
What? 
Nine times out of ten, I wish he's take me 
Instead of some of these poor children we see 
I'm sayin 
Skwo 
What 

Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope Chorus: 
Death is always a shitty time No where to run 
Don't bother trying to run and hide No where to hide 
Take his hand cross to the other side 
Step to the other side! (Step to the other side) 

Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope: 
He remainds nameless but we call him the Wraith 
He is the 6th Jokers Card of the Dark Carnival faith 
That's it, now your clock is ticking, every second counts 
And everyhting you do that right or wrong, it all amounts 
And whether you going to heaven or hell he doesn't care 
He's only here to give you the death touch and send you there 
Most people fear him because they don't understand 
That once he finally touches you with death eternity can begin 
That's what the f*ck I'm talkin' about 
Lotus 
What 
Mother f*ck 
Yea yeah 
Woop Woop 
Hoe 

Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope Chorus: 
Death is always a shitty time No where to run 
Don't bother trying to run and hide No where to hide 
Take his hand cross to the other side 
Step to the other side! (Step to the other side)
