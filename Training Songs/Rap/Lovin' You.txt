Lovin' you is easy 'cause you're beautiful
Makin' love with you is all i want to do
Lovin' you is more than just a dream come true
And everything that i do
Is out of lovin' you

La la la la la

The colors that you bring
Stay with me while we grow old
And we will live each day in springtime

Lovin' you has made my life so beautiful
And every day of my life
Is filled with lovin' you

And every time that we
Ohh, i'm more in love with you
