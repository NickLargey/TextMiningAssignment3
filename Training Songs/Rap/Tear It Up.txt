Sick with it nigga, yeah
Ninth Ward, should of never woke me up
Bad nigga, can't stop
Can't f*ck with me, look here

Popping pistols at random
When the smoke clears, I'll be the only nigga standing
I won't leave a witness, I'm a thug what you don't see the killa in my eyes
With this fire arm, sitting on my side
Been patiently waiting, for a victim to step out of the crowd
So I could prove, why they label me wild
I'm sick and psychotic I got a problem, I'm addicted to thugging
F*ck what you say, cause I ain't wanting for nothing look here

This for my gangsta ass niggaz, in the club
Throw up your set, if you a mo'fucking thug
You got a thug nigga wit ya, I'm hoping you get the picture
We could tear this mo'fucking club up
This for my niggaz that's, still on the grind
Nothing but pussy, and money up on your mind
You got a thug nigga wit ya, I'm hoping you get the picture
We could tear this mo'fucking club up

I'm sick with mine, you could feel the heat in the flow
You see the crowd start to bucking, when I walk in the do'
I'm real with mine, nigga I ain't the one you should beef with
I keep's my bitch and, that ain't the one that I sleep with
Am I still a soldier, nah you could keep it
I'm a ninth Ward nigga, and that ain't no secret
Want me, to cross over
Understand, I still lay that I'm over
I'm use to capping the hood, on my shoulders
Ghetto representative, here's nothing colder here's nothing boulder
I was kept in the shade, didn't want me to shine
But I done broke the chains, and I'm back for what's mine
I done ditched the tank, and replaced it with a nine
If I die I'ma die, amongst my own kind
Nigga I'm from the Crescent, I'm bout whatever you thought
Make a move, and I'm blasting with no question

This for my gangsta ass niggaz, in the club
Throw up your set, if you a mo'fucking thug
You got a thug nigga wit ya, I'm hoping you get the picture
We could tear this mo'fucking club up
This for my niggaz that's, still on the grind
Nothing but pussy, and money up on your mind
You got a thug nigga wit ya, I'm hoping you get the picture
We could tear this mo'fucking club up
This for my niggaz that's, still on the block
F*ck safety, keep the mo'fucker cocked
You got a thug nigga wit ya, I'm hoping you get the picture
We could tear this mo'fucking club up

And to my niggaz locked down, Mac-A-Don and see
I can't wait for the day, that they tell me you free
So until your lawyers tell me, that your cases are won
I'ma keep the fire burning, like it's 'spose to be done
F*ck my past, you better keep a eye on my future
Bringing the competition, that these rappers ain't use to
Making the type of statement, that these rappers'll work from
If you think I'm scared, you don't know where I come from
I'm use to getting packages, by the lump some
I ain't hard to find, I'm in the 9 if you want some
Teflon Don, pistol grip pump
Crazy glued to my palm, better sound the alarms

Tear it up (come on, tear it up nigga)
Tear it up (come on, tear it up nigga)
Tear it up (come on, tear it up nigga)
We could tear this mo'fucking club up

Tear it up (come on, tear it up nigga)
Tear it up (come on, tear it up nigga)
Tear it up (come on, tear it up nigga)
We could tear this mo'fucking club up

Look here, who gon' keep you rocking like I do
Who gon' keep you bobbing like I do
