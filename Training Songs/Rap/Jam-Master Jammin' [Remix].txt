Couldn't wait to see the Master Jam
Couldn't wait to see Jam-Master Jammin'
Couldn't wait to see the Master Jam

He's a one man band, in his own right
Jam-Master jams to the broad daylight
No instruments needed, just two record players
A stage, a crowd and two rhyme-sayers
The creed is to hear, so have no fear
Definition defined, the position is clear
You couldn't be late, hesitate to debate
Jam-Master is here, and you could not wait

Couldn't wait to see Jam-Master Jammin'
Couldn't wait to see the Master Jam
Couldn't wait to see Jam-Master Jammin'
Couldn't wait to see the Master Jam

Now he's the Jam-Master, and we're the MCs
Like lightning and thunder, we're knocking down trees
While sucker DJs are busting out seeds
My man Jam-Master scratching hard crossings
So why don't you listen, or you'll be missin
The cuts and the scratches, bass, treble and the mission
The force and the power, coming hour after hour
So get up off the wall, don't you be a wall flower

The alert is red, this is what we said
The meaning of Master means he's our head
The meaning of Jam is a big party
The records that he plays for the crowds of plenty
And when he comes on, the crowds go off

It's all hard rock, there's nothing soft
Couldn't wait to see Jam-Master Jammin'
Couldn't wait to see the Master Jam
Couldn't wait to see Jam-Master Jammin'
Couldn't wait to see the Master Jam

He has a little soul, to rock n' roll
Every record that he touches turns to gold
He's well conducted, self-instructed
His styles were plied, heavily constructed
Mechanically inclined, and if you don't mind
We add spice to your life, time after time
And think about times, where he's a long laster
We rock our rhymes for the Jam-Master

His name's Jam-Master, call him Jay
The crowd goes wild when he starts to play
Everything is correct, and A-OK
Jam-Master's on a move, but his sounds will stay
Couldn't wait to see Jam-Master Jammin'
Couldn't wait to see the Master Jam

From end to start, start to end
Not only does he scratch, but he's our friend
We could not wait to let you see
The things that he does for D and me
