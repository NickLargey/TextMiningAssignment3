Rack after rack, I got the sack,
Geeked up of beans, pack after pack (yeah ho)
Stay with the nina' two cups and a zip,

Next time car he ride in, stretch limo hearse

Stuffed in a Louie bag nigga, Juicy J be that nigga
Big bag of that stank killer, codeine in my drink killer
Mostly niggas be lyin' sayin' they is but ain’t killers

My diamonds sing like Ray J homie, every day’s a payday
Rollin up that KK, now it’s going down like mayday
All my niggas be chilling, stacking money to the ceiling
Used to smoking out the parking lot, now we owning a building oh
Used to tell niggas I was gonna here but they ain’t really understand
Now they see me in that brand new Rari and start to think I’m the man
Now my jeans cost a grand, now my shows fill the stands
Now they see that I’m ballin' 'cause of how they bring in them bands, ooh
Now when niggas be tourin', now my money be foreign
All my niggas be scorin', section very important
I’m cakin up, you fakin' up, I’m rollin weed when I’m wakin' up
Instead of talkin' shit and try to hate on us
Just grab a joint and come bake with us

(Look, okay, okay)
Front page, I’m on the news, nigga call me a dropout
Real nigga, 100, never needing no copout (nah)
Diamonds on my chain just pop out, you already know what I’m bout
Got bad bitches from overseas but I need a big ass from the south
Look at us, we made it, bottles up in the air now
25 racks a night, give a f*ck bout sweating your hair out
Getting trippy man with some frisky things; I am the shit and you niggas anus
‘Cause if I mention yall I’mma make you famous
But you still ain’t nothing, I’m stainless
We famous, anything you want right now, baby girl just name it
And I’mma get real deep in the pussy;
The number one nigga, ain’t no need for replacement
Getting in my spaceship, I’m high as a bitch, fly as a bitch
Okay Juicy and Wiz, every day we do this shit

I’m loadin up and I’m ridin' out, they talkin' shit but they hidin' out
