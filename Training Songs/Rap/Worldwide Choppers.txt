(Turkey)
Sen kalk, bir minik mikrofonunu getir bak jak
Burada mikrofonuna tak kagit
Kalem bir de ilham alinacak gam gaz choppers,
Havada düsman avina çikalim akalim, haydi bu battle'i kazanalim

(We started in the Midwest)
(Now we 'bout to take it)
(All over the world, baby!)
(This is the pinnacle!)
(Yeah, Tech N9ne!)

Follow me, all around the planet, I run the game with no Sickology
They could never manage, we do damage with' no apology
Pick 'em out the panic, a little manic 'cause I gotta be
Frantic, I'ma jam it 'cause I'm an oddity
Down for the trackin' like I'm grabbin' at my binoculars
I could pop at you, papa, 'cause I'm partners with' Waka Flocka
Gimme the top of hip-hop and watch 'I'm make 'em rock
With a show-stopper, chakras poppin' off the (Worldwide Choppers)

If you anybody, you notice it
Take as the pinnacle, now the ideal nickel solos it
Little coders to pull again, wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo, when it exposed, the flow be hold it, 'cause when that motor spit
A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a, never to get free of the rear
Better to get just near the mirror, ready to get near my heels
Gimme the knock and I'ma chop it, he came and it went tomorrow
But I'ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas

Hit 'em up and get 'em up, I ain't done, I ain't did enough
Trippin' when I rip it, I be the X when I split 'em up
Sorta like I was liquored up and backin' up in the cup
Everybody be knowin' I be actin' up when I buzz
From Missouri to Canada, I be keepin' the stamina
If you never been a fan of the man, the planet's unanimous
Killa Kaz'll f*ck anybody, Tech is calamitous
Leave 'em in the dust, anybody, Tech when I'm standin' up

Tech is hostile, he's awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with' it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinkin' he can give it the Poe and toss it Picasso
Killin' everybody off is the motto
And I be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco
I sped and you bled and you in the convo' when I go

I'm light years
Ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
(worldwide choppers)
Can't clown me
Don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

(K.C.)
Check it, I'm ahead of 'em, chop it up with the veteran
A legend developin', they gotta tell 'I'm it's evident
Gotta notice an elephant, none of you niggas relevant
You delicate, I'm lovin' every second of this

(Denmark)
De vil alle tjekke nar vi ligger det
Kommer ind og smaekker det beatet jeg vaekker det
I ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund
Hanger med de vildeste gutter
Det minder mig om vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle vild worldwide chopper

(Alabama)
What if I ran into you with' a Pogo stick?
Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness?
With' a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more tracks like I was playin' Hamlet?
Syllable burnin', that internal damage
Swing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock
Under an oak tree, like I was peelin' pecans
But instead, I'm peelin' rappers' heads, makin' a sam-a-wich
Pick up a twenty two
And put a bullet inside a motherfucker
From a side of a 1987 box
I'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks
F*ck 'em all, make 'em feel my dread like I had a head of locks
Feelin' rebuffed, like you had dead shots
When I hopped on the fuckin' beat and I worldwide chopped
When I f*ck with' Tech N9ne, with the piranhas
I smoke a beat with' Mr. Busta Rhymes, well, sure, why not?
Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat with' the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go
But I'm a dump truck, just send another load
Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throats
With' an alien probe

I'm light years
Ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me
Don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

Twista! (Chicago)

Like I gotta focus up in my rhythm
Or loosen the venom and hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-ma-tism
And then I'ma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
That everybody'll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies 'cause of cannibalism
Breakin' 'em off into particles, they get in a predicament
That be never reversible 'cause a nigga be too versatile
Makin' you nervous, you could never compete with the colonel
I burn you, I'm an immortal, and that's the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya, then ya best pick a better habit
'Cause I'm an anomaly, able to give a lobotomy
To any motherfucker challengin' my astronomy
Hoppin' out, I don't stop when the flame stone
Now one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
Throwin' it up in the air, takin' it there
We W-W-C, if you can't keep up, shoulda stayed home
My-my-my alien knowledge be makin' other astronomers
Welcome to Los Angeles, a discovery of palentology
So play me and I'ma be shinin' on them haters
I'm finna be usin' it as energy, watch how radiant I'ma be
Like a helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way out to you girl die
If I catch you fuckin' with the most intricate lyricists
Or even try to stop us 'cause we choppers and we worldwide
And I'm

I'm light years
Ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me
Don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

(New York)
See how they ask when I'ma stomp on my dude
And when I'ma cock it and pop it, and what I'ma drop on my dude
Inevitably, instead I'ma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude
And then they ask "What in the world is you provin'?
What, when you already the best? And what the hell is he doin'?"
Well, I'ma be choppin' and cuttin' and breakin' and beatin' and shakin'
And fuckin' everything up 'til there ain't no further mistakin'
And bustin' everything up like a fuckin' angry Jamaican
And shuttin' everything up, 'specially the ones who be hatin'
They lovin' everything until I got 'em stutterin' stupid
You hear 'em now? "D-d-d-d-don't do-do-do-do it!
P-P-P-Please? Wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us?
W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest!"
And now I'ma come and kill 'em, get 'em, hit 'em, and finish 'em
And bang 'em in the head and diminish 'em, and then I'll
Hit 'em again at a minimum, repeat comin' to kill 'em
Then he be gotta be drillin' 'em, thinkin' "They gotta be feelin' 'I'm!"
Spittin' lithium, see the way a nigga be spillin' 'em?
And gettin' 'em stupid to the point where there's no forgivin' 'I'm?
Hopin' you're listenin' and you're payin' attention
And you're witnessin' the way that I be crushin' on the mic
And gettin' in the zone, I be flattenin' and packin' in
People from the front to the back and
They got me actin' a fool, I'm blackin', nigga
Now I'm home!

I'm light years
Ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me
Don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

(Kansas City)
Make (something) retire instantly
I'm choppin', don't call me Michael Myers in my vicinity
The way I be killin' 'em with rhythm, it get illegitimate
The Yela will finish and end any predicament
And the enemies in the vicinity, I gotta mack up
They know they can never get with' me whenever they mention me
The hands of a lyrical criminal, more deadly than chemicals
Check my resume, they say that your boy's biblical

(California)
I dead 'em, I set 'em, and you can feel me
Diggin' up in your brain and bringin' the pain, and y'all fin' wanna kill me
Fillin' 'em with that fury, get up and hurry, you can feel the Remy
Comin' in with' that shit, I'm havin' a fit, and you will never pe
