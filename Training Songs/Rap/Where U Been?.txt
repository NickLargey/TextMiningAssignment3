2 Chainz!

I keep my hoes in check, you buy Nike for yours
Say they want that loud, I'mma bring that noise
Check my watch on a flight
Yeah, I call that airtime
Murk 'em in the middle of the street
That gon' be his deadline
Yeah, you gon' respect mine, got a body on my Tec-9
Say you nobody 'till somebody gon' body you, flatline
Pocket full of dead guys and you know I'm anti
Anti-social, anti-lame
But ain't I cool n****, ain't I?
You looking at a star that's spaced out
They try to take my style and then take off
I go to work with no days off
Everything I own paid off
Shawty p**** hair shaved off
And she did it just for me, n****
Would skip you like a spacebar
But I much rather delete n****s

I've been getting money, where the f*** you been?
I've been getting money, where the f*** you been?
I've been getting money, where the f*** you been?
I've been getting money, where the f*** you been?
Bought a new crib just to f*** you in
Bought a new crib just to f*** you in
Bought a new crib just to f*** you in
I've been getting to the money, where the f*** you been?

Gucci hat (Gucci hat), Gucci belt
If you wrote a autobiography
You'd have to sue yourself
Your lying a**, codeine in my wine glass
I know you had a wild past
I ain't f***ed you in a while with your wild a**
I get high and I fly past
I don't know nothing 'bout iChat
I work in this iPhone they need an app called iTrap
I trap, shining like a night lamp
I just hit my girlfriend and asked her where her wife at
White cup, white hat, laying on a white couch
Got that presidential and a residential white house
N**** saying "who?" (who) like a white owl
You can see me shinin' (shinin') with the light out

I've been getting money, where the f*** you been?
I've been getting money, where the f*** you been?
I've been getting money, where the f*** you been?
I've been getting money, where the f*** you been?
Bought a new crib just to f*** you in
Bought a new crib just to f*** you in
Bought a new crib just to f*** you in
I've been getting to the money, where the f*** you been?

Turn five to a ten to a twenty to fifty to hundred
My n****s get money, I want it (Beep!)
Ride through the city my n****s got choppers
My b**** she's so pretty that's my Pocahontas
Everything on me I shine like a trophy
Run up a check while they watch out for police
Versace my pinky, a brick on my Rollie
The Cali Ferrari I'm feeling like Kobe
Tru' that's to the death of me, n****
Killers on the right and left of me, n****
My destiny n**** to get all this money
I can't share that whole recipe with you, n****
My n**** told me "get 'em" did it I got 'em
Stand on that couch, drink out of the bottle
That .40 got hollows, that b**** she gon' swallow
Get to that money, I'm king of Chicago
Bought a new crib just to f*** you in
Bought the Benz just to f*** your friends
Giuseppe's 900 with that gold boss
Everything 'bout me raw like a dope charge

I've been getting money, where the f*** you been?
I've been getting money, where the f*** you been?
I've been getting money, where the f*** you been?
I've been getting money, where the f*** you been?
Bought a new crib just to f*** you in
Bought a new crib just to f*** you in
Bought a new crib just to f*** you in
I've been getting to the money, where the f*** you been?
