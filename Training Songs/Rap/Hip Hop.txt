[Royce Da 5'9"]
I know my streets, I know my sounds
y'all know my beats, how I get down
I take my steps, and leaps and bounds
Nigga it's, hip hop!

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, yeah, we started from nothing a couple MC's
Beat-boxin, the crowd in the lunch room (yeah)
Me and Prem', both names go together
Like they ain't supposed to be separate, like "D" in the D
I said it before, I rep in records beats
At the headquarters, rest in peace
Nigga I'ma hold shotty, and knock you out
And I ain't gotta know Karate like Afu-ra
It's, hip hop!, strong or not
This is rap basketball, stats all you got
Long as you hot, and your flow could hold up
To knowin all of your short goals is long shots!
Ninety percent of you niggaz ain't hard
Here +Just to Get a Rep+, you not +Gangstarrs+
The finest flow will amaze, rap without me
Minus The Source, minus the Quotable page

Hip hop! is everything around you
("No competition")
Back to the voice, of today
("It's real in the field)
What's realer than, hip hop! (yeah)
I know my streets, I know my sounds
y'all know my beats, how I get down
I take my steps, and leaps and bounds
Nigga it's, hip hop!

Rythmic, league c'mon wit it, I'm long winded
I will diss you, from long distances
You will not get the chance, like Choppa
Ness and Dylan, to dis-respect, who you don't listen to
Egg in the skillet brain, nigga, diss is you
Smarten up, every person in the earth, be harden up
But the only target is us
It's, hip hop! cars and trucks
I be dreaming about shit, like having a hard time swinging
On a nigga, or squeezing a trigger or falling
If I land, I won't wake up (yeah)
My six shot model, ya crew
I'm leaving ya mommy faces blue, just like a Hypnotic bottle
They feel you the realer, you spit
This killer shit is hearing us
Healing you if you ill or you sick mentally

More venom, 5'9 is like a G5
Illest lyrics is stored in him
Chorus is killing, any warrior feeling
That I ain't God, Lord willing
Trust me, after I crush ya building
You will just hush, you won't restore the village
We look toward wit killing, real
Though this album is morbidly feeling to steel
Hip hop! F*ck your feeling's
More rappers dying, much more killing
It's no feeling, realer than gambling ya life
Everyday, and waking up to more dealing's
Fourteen killing's, compared to offshore millions
Equals, I got a lot more villains
You know that you easily lose, you be on MTV News
For the first time, because you died over
