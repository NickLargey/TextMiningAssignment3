I just met you, yet I'm feeling
It's just like somehow, we've met somewhere before
I think I love you
In my dreams, one hundred times or maybe more

Oh, sweet sensations, the vibrations
You know it's got my imagination running wild
I'm gonna hold you
I'm gonna love you like it's going out of style, oh

What a connection
I just can't conceal it
There's a kind of magic in the air
Oh, I can feel it

Something special is gonna happen tonight
I want you to know that
Something special is gonna happen tonight
I promise something good for you

I think you're coming, I keep you going
You'll have kisses overflowing just like wine
You ain't had nothing
Until you've had a little indication of mine, oh

You got a home girl
And I am gonna feed it
I've never had this kind of love before
I guarantee it

Something special is gonna happen tonight
I want you to know that
Something special is gonna happen tonight
I promise something good

And if you're thinkin'
This is as good as it can get
Boy, I need to tell you
Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet

What a connection
I just can't conceal it
There's a kind of magic in the air
Oh, I can feel it

Something special is gonna happen tonight
I want you to know that
Something special is gonna happen tonight
I promise something good for you

Something special is gonna happen tonight
I want you to know that
Something special is gonna happen tonight
I promise something good for you

Something special is gonna happen tonight
I want you to know that

I ain't gonna turn you loose
I ain't gonna turn you loose
I ain't gonna turn you loose

Something special is gonna happen tonight
I promise something good

Special, special, special tonight
Special, special, special tonight
Special, special, special tonight
Special, special, special tonight
