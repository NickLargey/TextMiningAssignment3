I fiend for, who f*ck wits, inappropriate
Fill em with so much lead I'll call
Berger and associates
This rhyme, will remain in the minds of my foes forever in infamy
The epitome of lyrical epiphanies
Skillfully placed home we carefully plan symphonies
Who would be ignorant enough to have the audacity
To f*ck wit the likes of I and my tenacity?
This is, what you, get when, you f*ck,
With the, likes of, the magnanimous flows
