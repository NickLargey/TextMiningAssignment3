As we proceed to give you what you need. 
Ray J, Raz B, J- boog, Lil' fizz.
It's the official remix!

Shorty, shake that ba-dunk-a-dunk-dunk
(keep your eyes on my ba-dunk-a-dunk-dunk)
Do it when the beat goes rump-a-bump-bump.
(As the dummer boy goes rump-a- pump-pump)

Tonight ain't no reason to be lonely cause you know up in the club it's on.
You never sleep cause you gettin' that money, 
I know they got you working all day long.
The potrone in the trunk will get you perking. 
Henney shots will get you hot your thongs.
Then I know you'll be ready for the night girl, 
When the DJ plays this song.

[Chorus]
Shorty, shake that ba-dunk-a-dunk-dunk
(keep your eyes on my ba-dunk-a-dunk-dunk)
Do it when the beat goes rump-a-pump-pump.
(As the dummer boy goes ba-rumb-a- pumb-pumb)
Shorty, shake that ba-dunk-a-dunk-dunk
(keep your eyes on my ba-dunk-a-dunk-dunk)
Do it when the beat goes rump-a-pump-pump.
(you think you can handle this ka-dunk-a-dunk-dunk)

You shake it, girl.
You shake, ah
You shake it, girl.

You shake it, girl.
You shake, ah
You shake it, girl.

Bump, bump, bump, like B2K, drinking and smoking with my nigga, Ray j.

Mami, im not you, so just lend me your time. 
Lend me your mind, be my desire.
I make you numb like I run in your blood.
I can't say I love you but I can show you love.
Lay your head on my chest, feel my heart beat.
I (unclear), shopping sprees. 
Mami, bump the swap meat.
You remind me of magic.
I see your girl, Nikki.
I'm a millennium man so forget about me, GIRL!

Chorus

You shake it, girl.
You shake, ah
You shake it, girl.
You shake it 
You shake it, girl.
You shake, ah
You shake it, girl.
You shake it

I don't want you to stop girl.
I want you to shake that thing.
I want you to shake it for me
I want you to shake it for timbaland.
I want you to shake it for the whole knockout.
