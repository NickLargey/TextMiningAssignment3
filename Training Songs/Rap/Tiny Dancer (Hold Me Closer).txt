You're my star, my light, my whole entire life,
Without you it's blurry, and I can't see why, 
My friends say James are you feeling alright? 
And I just think that I'm dreaming all night, 
When I'm with you I feel I've been saved,
And I want to thank your Mum and Dad for what they made.
So I just want to say I'm going to keep you,
For life, 24/7 I hope to.

Hold you closer and don't let go,
I need to know how you feel too, 
So hold me closer and don't let go,
I'm falling so please girl don't let go,

Hold me closer tiny dancer,
Count the headlights on the highway,
Lay me down in sheets of linen,
You've had a busy day today.

You're my perfect dream, we're the perfect team,
I'm the King, you're the Queen, you're the book that I read,
Without you it feels like there's no me, 
And that's why its you that I just want to keep,
How many times have I told you that I love you?
So many times you know I want to hug you,
So come and show me what love means,
Coz I don't really know I just seen it in my dreams

I swear hold you closer and don't let go,
I need to know how you feel too, 
So hold me closer and don't let go,
I'm falling so please girl don't let go,

Hold me closer tiny dancer,
Count the headlights on the highway,
Lay me down in sheets of linen,
You've had a busy day today.

It's crazy, I don't think you recognize how strong the feelings are,
So I dedicated this song to you.

Look I hope you recognize now what you really mean,
Without you I couldn't do this song I sing
And I hope you like it too, coz it's nothing but the truth
Your not number 1 but you will be soon

Believe hold you closer and don't let go,
I need to know how you feel too, 
So hold me closer and don't let go,
I'm falling so please girl don't let go,

Hold me closer tiny dancer,
Count the headlights on the highway,
Lay me down in sheets of linen,
You've had a busy day today.

Hold me closer tiny dancer,
Count the headlights on the highway,
Lay me down in sheets of linen,
You've had a busy day today.

Please I hope your ticking all the words man, it's Ironik
