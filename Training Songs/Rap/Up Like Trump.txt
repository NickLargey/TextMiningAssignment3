Up like Trump, all of a sudden
Solo cup when brought to the public
Balmain's clean as a whistle
Green ain't the issue
Lil bit of money make a difference
Nothin' is somethin', it's so hard to function
With all of these hoes in the house
F*ck y'all social, my blood still rushin
My hearts still thumpin'
Up like Trump
Kickin' like Ike
Got bitch twerkin' on Skype
MGM every night
Sremm at the door
King of the swipe
Mu'fuckers worry bout' lice
Only bitches, they ain't got a single dollar, or a nickel
They ain't even got a penny, for the strippers
And they wanna pop bottles, like winners
Check my pedigree I always been a money fiend
All these fuckin' rings I'm shinin' like a fuckin' king
Breakin' down the kush, don't it look so plush?
Take a couple puffs, I'm like Donald Trump, up!
