Verse 1:
Dim the lights
Grip on you from behind
You know you mighty fine
Let's intertwine
In your vines
Say that you'll be mine
So rare your hard to find
I had to jump the line
went through bout' 99
But when I get to you. ( W,W,Wine up)
Hook:
I want you to wine down pon it
Wine down pon it
Sit down pon it
Gal sit down now
Wine down pon it
Sit down pon it
Gal sit down now
Gal sit down just
Wine down pon it
Sit down pon it
Gal sit down now
Wine down pon it
Sit down pon it
Gal sit down now
Gal sit down now.

So come show me the truth yea
First place you in first place
Girl your First place in the first place
Hold that body like a trophy baby

Verse 2:
Girl I got the keys to your heart
And I got it lock
Push it on me just a little
I ain't asking for a lot
All of these girls in the place
You the one I want
Grip my arm we can skate
Rollin up the clouds
We get lost in a wave , aye
I want you right now
