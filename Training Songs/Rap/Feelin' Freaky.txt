[Nick] 
Yo put the kids to bed 
Yo Shawty, I know you ain't scared 

[Omarion] 
B2k and Nick Cannon
Track masters, the Pied Piper 

[Verse One: Nick] 
Yo' the freaks come out at night 
I'm like Houdini with the magic stick 
When you turn out the lights 
Shawty grippin' my stomach tighter 
When I burn out on the bike 
Holla at the young thugs 
What we doing tonight 
I'm in the O.J. throwback jersey 
Dressed to kill,Bridget won't get it 
But Vanessa will,Vanessa's real 
Shawty got sex appeal 
You can hear this beat banging from the exit still 
Pied Piper, we need something for these chicks to dance
So look Mami I'm trying to grind 
I'm not trying to romance you 
I'm just trying to get them pants loose 
Lets get private, 2 way text me 
T-Mobile sidekick 
One-on-One lets talk and neglect the gossip 
I'm as real as they come,Baby girl I got this 
My wrist all numb, you can watch the watch gliss 
We already bubbly we ain't gotta pop Cris' 

[Chorus: Omarion] 
I come through 
My style is powder blue 
T's and Nike shoes 
Plus chicks by the deuce (uh huh) 
Ain't no telling what this man might do 
Cause tonight this man ain't playing by the rules 
So tell me,
Anybody feelin' freaky? [Repeat: x3]

[Verse 2: Nick] 
We tearin' the club like them boys did in the roxy 
Million dollar thug like I'm Ted D.B.I.C 
Crack game on the plain 
Probably think its Yahtzee 
Wrist on rocky, How you gone stop me 
Shawty like, "Papi", Crib like "Ozzy's" 
I'ma show you how to ball girl just watch me 
I'ma never quit like Whitney and Bobby 
Tell them chicks,either want to get wit me or rob me 
Either way I let them strip me, 'cause this is my hobby 
After tonight, Shawty will you miss me? Probably 
But now I want to see you shake your little body 
Lookin' for a shawty that's freaky & naughty 
Cause after the party you don't have to call me 
Cause Cannon is the prodigy and I mobs deep 
If you rolling wit a playa, Mami c'mon 
Cause I'ma keep it goin' 'til 6 o'clock in the morning 

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Nick] 
We make hits like the mafia (mafia) 
After the club hit the lobby, oh (lobby, ooh) 
Girls always say "Nick you so cute, 
How you flipping rapping and acting too?" 
Well I do, what I can do, what I can do, when I can do it 
It ain't algebra baby, its pimping in my fluid 
Why them cats saying that Cannon should stick to acting 
Kill you in two bars, Daddy its quick to happen 
won't know what caused it, But Nick will get you dancing 
You dudes in the closet, you know you think I'm handsome
Yeah, the kid's real attractive 
Even pull hella chicks in a thriller jacket 
Now, Thriller's back, And I'ma make you clap 
Oh that spot y'all had? Yeah I'm taking that 
And them chicks y'all dreaming about 
We cleaning them out,One on the block 
Two in the car, three in the house 
Now that's a real six pack, daddy even it out 

[Omarion] 
Hey, yo B2k

[Chorus]

Anybody feelin' freaky? 
Anybody feelin' freaky? 

[Omarion] 
B2k and Nick Cannon, 
Trackmasters, the Pied Piper 

[Lil' Fizz] 
Excuse me what's ya name?

[Omarion] 
B2k and Nick Cannon, 
Trackmasters, the Pied Piper

Excuse me what's ya name?
