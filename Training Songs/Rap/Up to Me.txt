Look, where I go from here?
Just lost my father last year
But I still, remain to keep it real like dollar bills
I drop tears, can't believe my daddy's gone
Rabbit come home, why ya left us all alone?
But I'm coming man
Just wait at the gates, I'ma be running man
Arms open, eyes wide, full a love
You watched me come up from a scrub
Now ya see ya son riding everyday on dubs
But I wish, I could share them times wit' you
It got me pissed, this family and my momma, too
But please brah, won't ya come back for Lil Wayne
And see Cita, Mrs. Rose, Sheryl, Kemp and plus Sinetra
Dog, we really miss ya
And it ain't all that cool living off pictures
Ah man, visit while I'm sleep, write a note or call me
Can't believe you left me to be a small man
But I know it wasn't meant to be
That's why I suck up all the game that you sent to me

[Chorus: x2]
It's up to you, Wayne, nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel
Just be strong, cause everything gon' be alright
I know it's hard trying to make but it's gon' be alright

Alright I know it, see I got a child
I know I'm young, but when you left dog, things got wild
I know you probably saying 'damn, you raisin children now?'
But it's all gravy I'm with Baby making millions now
So I still smile
I'm taking care ya wife bra
Ain't nothing changed, if I still come home late at night she fuss
But it's still the ol' same ol', same ol'
Things go, up and down like rainbows, we maintain though
So you know who paying the bills now,
Still flossing, give my audience the chills,
I got all my game from you, man I ain't gon' lie
But I'm still thugging nigga, player you think I ain't gon' ride?
But Slim and B done slowed me done and brought the talent out me
Yeah Slim and B done showed me 'round, all a the Jags around me
And I ain't goin' no where, that nigga stuck wit' me
And make you and my people happy, man it's up to me

[Hook]

I know you know I'm thinkin' 'bout ya, you be on my mind
I know ya see me every time watching the boys shine
And I know that ya see I put out my own CD
And picture this, your little boy even on TV
But I swear it's off the heezy, Weezy
Say it's cool, you can believe me, I like how they treat me
I'm doin' what ya say, don't let a nigga try me
And I don't let a fine, pretty broad get by me
Don't let nothin' pull me off track from my hobby
Oh yeah, and I don't leave my room sloppy
But the same thing make ya laugh, make ya cry
And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die
I pray to the Lord everyday and ask him why
And ask him to bless your soul every time I pass by
I know he doin' it, and leaving all the love to me
And I'ma prove it, and show ya daddy it's up to me

[Chorus: x3]

I mean it's up to me man
Just watch over me
And it's gon' be all gravy man
Leaving big, treating me all good
Everything else be all good
Rest in peace ya heard me
I'll be there
