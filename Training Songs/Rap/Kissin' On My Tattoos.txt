Baby I don't blame you
For being in the club
Getting all that love
'Cause you're so beautiful
God made you to show that off
Now I ain't ever been the jealous type of guy
But I want you to myself, I can't lie
I know we ain't on no one on one thing
But baby, it should change
'Cause when I be out with other chicks I be thinking 'bout you
And when you be out on dates you be texting me too
Telling me to come pick you up when he drop you off
I pray to God he ain't breaking you off

I don't want nobody but you
Kissin' on my tattoos
I don't want nobody but me
Talkin' to you
Until you fall asleep
We better stop playing (We better stop playing)
Before we mess around and someone gets hurt
I don't want nobody but you (Nobody but you)
Kissin' on my tattoos

Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me

All my homies wanna know what's up with us
They can't believe that I'm kicking it with just one girl
But I'm cool with that
Them pretty eyes and that smile
Girl I'm a fool for that (yeah I'm a fool for that)
'Cause when I be out with other chicks I be thinking 'bout you
And when you be out on dates you be texting me too
Telling me to come pick you up when he drop you off
I pray to God he ain't breaking you off

I don't want nobody but you
Kissin' on my tattoos
I don't want nobody but me
Talkin' to you
Until you fall asleep
We better stop playing (We better stop playing)
Before we mess around and someone gets hurt
I don't want nobody but you (Nobody but you)
Kissin' on my tattoos

Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody but you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
