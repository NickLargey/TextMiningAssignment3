[Hook - 2x]
Still tippin' on four vogues, wrapped in four vogues
Tippin' on four vogues, wrapped in four vogues
Tippin' on four vogues, wrapped in four vogues
Pimpin fo' hoes and I'm packin four fours

[Slim Thug]
Now look who creepin look who crawlin still ballin in the mix
It's that six six long dick slim nigga stickin yo' chick
Pullin tricks lookin slick at all times when I'm flippin
Bar sippin car dippin grand woodgrain grippin
Still tippin' on four vogues, wrapped in four vogues
Pimpin fo' hoes and I'm packin four fours
Blowin on that endo, Game Cube Nintendo
Five percent tint, so you can't see up in my window
These niggaz don't understand me cause I'm Boss Hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit a big glock nine handy
Pieced up creased up stayin dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade
When I'm ridin Sprewells, slidin like a escapade
I got it made the big boss of the north
Ain't shit changed I still represent Swishahouse, ha!

[Mike Jones]
Four vogues I'm tippin', woodgrain I'm grippin
Catch me lane switchin with the paint drippin
Turn yo' neck and yo' dame missin
Me and Slim we ain't trippin, I'm finger flippin and syrup sippin
Like +Do or Die+ I'm "Po' Pimpin," car stop rims keep spinnin
I'm flippin drops with indvisible tops, hoes bop when my drop step out
I'm shakin the block with four 18's, candy green with 11 screens
My gasoline always supreme, got do-do the brown with a pint of lean
It takes grindin to be a king, it takes grindin to be a king
"First Round Draft Pick" comin, "Who is Mike Jones?" comin
Slab shinin with the grill and woman
Slab shinin with the grill and woman
I'm Mike Jones (who) Mike Jones the one and only you can't clone me
Got a lot a haters and a lot of homies
Some friends and some phony
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me (I Said!)
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me

[Paul Wall]
What it do it's Paul Wall I'm the people's champ
My chain light up like a lamp cause now I'm back with the camp
I'm crawlin similar to a ant cause I'm low to the earth
People's feelings get hurt when they figure out what I'm worth
I got eighteen vogues pokin out at the club I'm showin out
I'm a player ain't no doubt hoes want to know what I'm bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth, princess cuts all in my chain
Woodgrain all in my range, drippin stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name It's still the same Swishahouse or Swisha Blast
Mike Jones he runnin the game and Magnificent bout his cash
Michael Watts he made me hot, hard work took me to the top
G. Dash took me to the lot and he wrote a check and bought a drop
I got the internet goin nuts
But T. Farris got my back so now I'm holdin my nuts
It's Paul Wall baby, what you know 'bout me
I'm on that five nine south lead baby holla at me
