As I walk in da shadow of death 
Sixteen men on a deadman's chest 
Your host is heat, Mr. H-O-T 
And I get ya get splashed with da Tec 
Nobody go till da God say so 
You got a second or mo' 
To run for da door 
Before I blow back off da Meth contact 
You didn't know Stat 
Cook you down like that 

And when I get that feeling (Yo, Yo)
I can no longer slide, I can no longer run no no no
And when I get that feeling (Yo, Yo) 
I can no longer hide,
For it's no longer fun no no no(All day, every day)

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same, about you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same, about you

See my pinky, see my thumb
See that kid with da pump shotgun
Mr. Meth hold da four most death
Cats is that wrong, songs too long
Mr. Bigmouth could that be trout 
You need to diss out, ya style no doubt
Shaolinstra, to da Shaolin slum
Rum- Pom- Pom on my Shaolin drum... Yeah 

And when I get that feeling (Yo, Yo)
I can no longer slide, I can no longer run no no no
And when I get that feeling (Yo, Yo) 
I can no longer hide,
For it's no longer fun no no no(All day, every day)

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same, about you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same, about you

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same, about you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same, about you

I've said goodnight try to sleep tight
(M.M.: 1 time for ya crooked ear, 2 times for ya crooked ear)
Just dream of me
Go close your eyes cause I've closed mine
(M.M.: 3 times for ya crooked ear, 4 times for ya crooked ear)
When you dream of me
