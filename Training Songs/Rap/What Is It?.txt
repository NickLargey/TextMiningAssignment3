So what is it about me, can you feel it tell me
Time you get nasty baby
Do you think you can handle this boy
Oh yeah...
It's crazy how I feel when you touch me girl
I get a feeling like no other so deep inside
Your body's driving me crazy
I like what you doing to me lady
Don't stop don't stop don't stop turning me on
Oh baby yeah...
What is it about me girl that you like [4*]
I like it when you call me 10 times in a day
And when we making love girl you let me do it my way
Don't stop baby don't stop you keep turning me on
I can't get enough of you baby 
That's why I sing this song
What is about me boy that you like [4*]
Lady if you making love to your man tonight on this song
Going on and freak him freak him freak him freak him freak him 
Man if you making love to girl tonight on this song
Going on and freak her...
What is it about me girl that you like
What is about me boy that you like
