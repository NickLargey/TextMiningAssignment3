I loved you
When there was nothing
And now look what you've done
To me

It's amazing how
You hurt me so
How could you do this again?
It's amazing how
You hurt me so
Over and over again
You never cease to amaze me, man

It's a, amazing all the shit I done
Such examples I've been setting for my son
All she did was stay down and have my kid
All the time just to realize I ain't shit
Such audacity that I must have
To get in mint company and slap on ass
Damn, if I must say in my defense
I think should get credit for the asses I resi—
What? Goddamn, now she get upset
Huh, hang up in my face and block my number and shit
Thinkin', 'you fucked that up again, man, why don't you just apologize
For all the time you done got caught out in all the lies
For all the time that shawty put in on this long ride
I'm 'posed to show her compassion, I show a lot of pride'
Then when she looked at me, told me, "You runnin' out of time"
But this gon' feel different on the other side, it's gon' feel amazing

It's amazing how
You hurt me so
Yeah
How could you do this again?
It's amazing how
You hurt me so
Over and over again
(Ay) You ain't shit, you know that, my nigga?

I—I say
It's a, amazing how far I've come
Homicide, fed time, auto-gun
I used to take girls gettin' work on the run
Cut to the day and, man, I get in trouble flirtin' with one
Goddamn, like the one we love, hurt you the most
Broken promises and broke your heart, fill up the boat
Make it too heavy when the water deadly
(?) tried to tell you but you're hardheaded
They all meddlin' in your bini, 'cause they all messy
And I don't let them bitches stress me then be your headache
Got all my life to make you happy, this a small delay
Don't sweat the small shit, said I'd be dead in my twenties, I bet they all pissed
Drippin', spendin' eighty in Venice, same at the dentist
Hopin' the gifts'll change your perception of me
Look how I went from kissin' and lovin' her
To bein' just a nigga that she suffer for, damn, that's amazing

It's amazing how
You hurt me so
How could you do this again?
It's amazing how
You hurt me so
Over and over again
Round of applause for Mr. F*ck Up, please, everybody stand up

How could you, how could you hurt
How could you, how could you hurt
Me
How could you, how could you hurt
How could you, how could you hurt
Even a motherfucker who show you exactly what not to do, you know?
Anybody in life, man, you know what I'm saying?
How could you, how could you hurt
How could you, how could you hurt
A role model just playing a role, you know?

Give me back my necklace!
No
Give me my damn necklace back!
Why should I?
'Cause it's mine, and it means something to me
