Girl, I'll house you
Girl, I'll house you
Girl, I'll house you
You in my hut now, don't you know?

Girl, I'll house you
Girl, I'll house you
Girl, I'll house you
You in my hut now

When you're in my hut
You know what's up
Let your mind be free
Relax your body

Jump, jump a little higher
Jump, jump until you get tired
House your body
House your body

House your body to the bass
House it all over the place
Don't let nobody in your way
Tonight's your night, today's your day
Afrika won't steer you wrong

(Say what?) house music all night long
(Say what?) house music all night long
(Say what?) house music all night long
(Say what?) house music all night long

I'll house you (don't you know?)
I'll house you (don't you know that?)
I'll house you
You in my hut now (don't you know that?)
I'll house you (don't you know?) (he will)
I'll house you
I'll house you
You in my hut now (check this out)

Girl, I see you (I see you)
Do what you do
Go on, girl, and act a fool
There's no need to play it cool

Everybody, shake your body
(We got's to make this a real house party)
Come on, come on and stick with me
I'll keep things the way they should be

Keep your house until you sweat
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet
House is food and you need it
If I feed it, you should eat it

Say, "house your body, house your body"
Say, "house your body, house your body"
You know, Mike G won't steer you wrong
House music all night long
(Say what?) house music all night long
(Say what?) house music all night long
(Say what?) house music all night long

I'll house you (what?)
I'll house you (what?)
I'll house you
You in my hut now
(I'm just sayin') I'll house you
I'll house you
I'll house you
You in my hut now (sweet dad bring it all down)

Round and round and round and round and round and
Hear the house music steady steady poundin'
Feel the energy rush up to your face
Feel the vibe, feel the vibe, feel the bass (come on)

(Check this out, check this out, check this out)

(Check this out)
Too black
Too strong (check this out)
(Can't you feel it?)
(Can't you feel it?)
