She can't do what I do to you, 
I know she can't love you the way I love you. 

Right here looking in your eyes, 
Thinking about what we did last night, 
& How you suddenly blew my mind, 
Your touch to your tender kiss couldn't take you breathing in my ear, 
Just being with you made me realize. 

[Hook:] 
& Everytime I see you baby I fall in love over again, 
So proud that you were my man, 
& I still can't, can't get you outta my head, 
Your all I've ever wanted and you just gotta know that... 

[Chorus:] 
She can't do the things I do to you, 
No one is loving you the way, the way I love you, 
She can't be everything you need and what you need is me, 
'cause its the way I love you. 

The way that I love you, 
Love you the way I do, 
The way, the way, the way I love you. 

When you smile my mind goes spare, 
Can't imagine life without you here, 
Someway somehow you've completed me, 
Thankful you came my way, 
What we have can't be replaced, 
You make it easy to be in love. 

[Hook:] 
& Everytime I see you baby I fall in love over again, 
So proud that you were my man, 
& I still can't, can't get you outta my head, 
Your all I've ever wanted and you just gotta know that... 

[Chorus:] 
She can't do the things I do to you,(She can't) 
No one is loving you the way, the way I love you, 
She can't be (no baby) everything (every little thing baby) you need and what you need is me, 
Coz its the way I love you. 

The way that I love you, 
Love you the way I do, 
The way, the way, the way I love you. 

Don't waste your time baby, 
You know that your mine baby, 
She can't satisfy the way that I do 
Cause She can't love you like I do. 

[Chorus:] 
She can't do the things I do to you, 
No one is loving you the way the way I love you, 
She can't be (she can never be baby)everything you need (coz she knows that you need me) 
And what you need is me,(she can't do what I do) 
Coz its the way I love you(it's the way that I love you) 

She can't do (oooo)the things I do to you (please listen to me) 
No one is loving you the way the way I love you,(the way I love you) 
She can't be everything you need and what you(you baby)need is me, 
Coz its the way,the way I love you. 

The way that I love you, 
Love you the way I do, 
The way, the way, the way I love you. 

The way that I love you, 
Love you the way I do, 
The way, the way, the way I love you.
