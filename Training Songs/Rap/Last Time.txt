I love when my bitch get drunk 'cause she talk greasy to me
Nigga with an attitude, this shit gettin' easy to me
The last time I drunk some lean I was out of my mind
Tried gave me 20 years and that's a whole lotta time
A married woman divorce her husband to spend the weekend with me
He think it nasty when she squirt but that shit sexy to me
The last time I took some molly, took a gram and a half
Niggas think they know 'bout Gucci but they don't know the half
See I'm an ex-X popper and online shopper
Niggas thought I was a clone, they heard me speak proper
Convicted felon worth 10 million, I'm a well known robber
Like Shawty Lo I got 10 children, yeah, Lo my partner
Wop

Last time I took drugs I just took half of it (Hah)
'Cause last time I took pills I had to smash a bitch (Geek)
And last time I smoked gas I almost crashed a whip (Skrt)
Last time I took drugs I just took half of it (Half)

Last time I took drugs I just took half of it

Last time we took drugs you just took half of it (It's lit)
Stretchin' out my jeans just to make cash fit in (Yeah)
Wake up every morning to some ass and grits
Raw dog all my birds, Iâ€™m tryna have some chicks
Fi-fie-fie-fo (yeah) Zone 6 to the Mo
La Flame linked with La Flare, yeah, that's heat and snow
Goin' in all year, 300 plus days long (Straight up)
Makin' money all year, talking 52 weeks strong
Better back up, give me space (Yeah)
I'm with ice cream on the face
Goin' Pharrell Williams on the case (Oh my God)
Ohhhh, then we skate-skate-skate away
720 with the grind, landed, landed all fine

The last time I went to Onyx man I ordered a dub
Tried to leave with every big booty bitch in the club
I bought a Rolex and a Lambi' when I went to Miami
The last time I seen little mama she wasn't wearin' no panties
Last time I went to Vegas, spent 200k gamblin'
I'm just an east Atlanta nigga servin' junkies in Chamberlain
The last time I tricked out I brought 4 hoes to my place
They call me Gucci Mane Picasso 'cause I painted they face
Guwop
