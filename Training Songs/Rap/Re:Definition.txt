What what what, what what, what what, what what
Whoa
One two three, Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Best alliance in hip-hop,
I said, one two tree, Black Star shine eternally
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
And Hi-Tek make the beat drop

RE DEFinition, turning your play into a tragedy
Exhibit level degree on the mic, passionately
Niggas is sweet so I bet if I bit I'd get a cavity
Living to get high, you ain't flyer than gravity
We Die Hard like the battery done in the back of me by the mad MC
Who think imitation is the highest form of flattery, actually
Don't be mad at me, I had to be the one to break it to you
You get kicked into obscurity like judo, no Menudo
Cause you pseudo, trying to compete with reality like Xerox
Towards destruction you spiraling like hair locks, wipe them teardrops
Chasing stars in your eyes, playing games with your lives
Now the wives is widows soaking up pillows, weeping like willows
Still mo' blacks is dying, kids ain't living they trying
"How to Make a Slave" by Willie Lynch is still applying
Regardless, the Mos is one of my closest partners
Rocking ever since before Prince was called The Artist
Rocker before Funkmaster Flex was rocking Starter
When 'Pac and Biggie was still cool before they was martyrs
Life or death, if I'm choosing with every breath I'm enhancing
Stop, there comes a time when you can't run

What, lyrically handsome, call collect a king's ransom
Jams I write soon become the ghetto anthem
Way out like Bruce Wayne's mansion, move like a phantom
You'll talk about me to your grandsons
Cats who claiming they hard be mad fag
So I run through em like, flood water through sandbags
Competition is mad, what I got, they can't have
Sinking they ship, like Moby Dick, did Ahab
Son I'm way past the minimum, enter a millennium
Where cats will hold a gat to your back, like Palestinians
Ancient Abyssinian, try to ? the ?
Official b-boy gentlemen won't turn off at the interim
Born inside the winter one, day after December 10
These simpletons they mentioning the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon or danish rings by entammen
Rush up on adrenaline, and get they asses sent to them
(Gentlemen) you got tenement, well then assemble it!
Leave your unit trembling like herds of moving elephant
Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element
From Flatbush settlement, SKIN possess melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddlin, making 'em woop
Like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington
Broader than Barrington Levy, believe me
The hot oppression rent who burn down your chief tepee
You see me?

One two three, Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Best alliance in hip-hop, wayohh
I said, one two tree, Black Star shine eternally
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Because we rulin hip-hop, yes we is rulin hip-hop
Talib Kweli is rulin hip-hop
Say we Black Star we rule hip-hop-ah-ahh-ah-ahh-ahh
Whoah!
