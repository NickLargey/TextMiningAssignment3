MN8---I've Got a Little Something For You 
I got a little somethin' for ya 
(I got a little somethin' for you) 
Na na na na na na na na na 
I got a little somethin' for you 
I got a little somethin' for you 
Ain't that thoughtful of me 
Ya know I been wanting 
I been really wanting 
To give this to you 
1 - I got a little somethin' for ya 
And I'll give you just three guesses to figure out 
Just what it is 
'Cause I've been holdin' back so long 
And my love rolling strong 
So take this tag 
Tear it off your wrap 
'Cause the gift that I got ain't goin' back 
2 - I got a little somethin' for ya 
(I got a little somethin' for you) 
Na na na na na na na na na 
(Baby you know that I adore you) 
I got a little somethin' for ya 
(I got a little somethin' for you) 
Na na na na na na na na na 
(Yes I have) 
You deserve somethin' special 
And most of all, somethin' from me 
It's the kind of gift, that you I enjoy 
It's a gift that says that you are on my mind 
(Repeat 1) 
(Repeat 2) 
I got a little somethin' for ya 
(I got a little somethin' for you) 
Na na na na na na na na na 
[Rap] 
I little somethin's what I got, let's take a slow ride 
Maybe then go ???????? honey's kickin' 
It's love she's inflictin' 
It's mentally addictin' 
Addicted to the love a lady that is so fine 
Want to know my secret? Then you gotta get mine 
Really gotta get mine 
Son, over lover, mista lova man is here 
With a little somethin' for ya 
(Na na na) No I don't think so 
Let's take a long ride, girl don't let go 
(Na na na) Mmmm, I don't think so 
Let's take a long ride, girl don't let go 
(Na na na)
