It's murder loveâ?¦ 

It was a lonely, breezy, coolin' afternoon 
The day I remember, how did it end so soon 
And when they chat up a that girl 
When they chat a with a group you know me girl 
Oh my God, Oh Lord her baby laid so still 

[Chorus]
No one ever touch her cause they know that they be mine 
All I got is, Oh my God it's murder love 
It's got to be Murder Love. 
No one ever touch her cause they know that they be mine 
All I got is, Oh my God it's murder love 
It's got to be Murder Love. 

If name come follow, come follow me come 
follow me, come, come, come quick 
If a boy come to test him have him get one lick 
Don't want no trouble and nobody gets hurt 
If a boy comes to test he's going to wind up in a hearse 
Blah, blah, blah that's what he did say 
But look pon the joker man me say look at him today 
Six foot six me say yes ja ja land 
because I cut of his back, cut of his head 
and cut of his hand lord 

[Chorus]
No one ever touch her cause they know that they be mine 
All I got is, Oh my God it's murder love 
It's got to be Murder Love. 
Can't get rid of the feeling as she quickly deny it 
Oh my God it's, Oh my God it's murder love 
It's got to be Murder Love. 

It was a lonely, breezy, coolin' afternoon 
The day I remember, how did it end so soon 
And when they chat up a that girl 
When they chat a with a group you know me girl 
Oh my God, Oh Lord her baby laid so still 

[Chorus]
No one ever touch her cause they know that they be mine 
All I got is, Oh my God it's murder love 
It's got to be Murder Love. 
Can't get rid of the feeling as she quickly deny it 
Oh my God it's, Oh my God it's murder love 
It's got to be Murder Love.
