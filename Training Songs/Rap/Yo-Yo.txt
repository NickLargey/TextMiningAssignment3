Baby played me like a Yo Yo
All this time is was she mackin' me
Yo Yo! Yo Yo!
Random! UOMO!
Yo Yo! Yo Yo! 

My girl said she gonna to chill tonight
That's cool because I worked up an appetite
Called up my boys and said let's get together
The time couldn't be any better 
Let's hit the club and do whatever
Stepped in, straight to the V-I-P
All good, all the honeys were up on me
But then, I looked across the room
Saw my girl working her groove 
Dancing with some other dude

All of this time, she's been playing with my mind
And now I know, what you reap is what you sow 

I thought I knew what I was doing
Didn't stop to think but it was just so plain to see
That she played me like a Yo Yo
All this time it was she mackin' me
I thought I was on top of my game
Everything was running smooth, It felt so easy
I thought I played her like a Yo Yo
But all this time it was she mackin' me 

She said pick me up at eight o'clock
Drove up, damn she was looking hot
Took her to this spot that I knew in town
Where no one would be around, and where we could get down
All good, spending all of this crazy dough
Thinking she would go were I want to go
Next thing, she started to give the eye
Smiling at this other guy, that's when she said bye bye 

All of this time, She's been playing with my mind
And now I know, What you reap is what you sow 

I thought I had her spinning like a Yo Yo
On top of my game, doing all the things I wanted to
I thought I had her spinning like a Yo Yo
But all this time it was she mackin' me
But all this time it was she mackin' me 

I thought I knew what I was doing
Didn't stop to think but it was just so plain to see
That she played me like a Yo Yo
All this time it was she mackin' me
I thought I was on top of my game
Everything was running smooth, It felt so easy
I thought I played her like a Yo Yo
But all this time it was she mackin' me
