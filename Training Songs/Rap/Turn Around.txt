Turn around, open your eyes, look at me now
Turn around, girl I’ve got you, we won’t fall down
We can see forever from up here
So long as we’re together have no fear, no fear

So turn around, floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now, listen baby
Turn around, floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around,
Together nothing can stop us now, turn around, turn around

Turn around, outta space, we can go there now
Turn around, there’s no limit, to what we’ve found
Music up, I wanna feel it all, and baby we’ll stay up
Cause’ there’s no way for us to fall, to fall

So turn around, floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now, listen baby
Turn around, floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around,
Together nothing can stop us now, turn around

Baby we’re so high now,
Tell our worries and our pain goodbye now
Our home is the sky now, and we’re never coming down, down, down

So turn around, floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now, listen baby
Turn around, floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around,
Together nothing can stop us now, turn around

Turn around, turn around, nothing can stop us now
