Got to be God's favorite.
A what's up all the people in the world "all the people in the world".. 
Everybody across seas.. 
Everybody, everywhere, that love N-O-are-E 
"I know why'all love me" 
I know my fans been sitting around waiting
They looking... 
Said damn it's summertime n-o
Ain't drop one 
I know I drop one four summers straight"four summers"..
Had to pause this summer though "had to pause" 
Learn how to be a motherfucking man 
"learn how to be a man" 
You know..
Spend sometime with the motherfucking kids and shit.. 
Be a man on my motherfucking own "be a man" 
Still got the crew, still roll with my niggaz.,. 
But I just had to focus... focus as a motherfucking man as a solo 
artist..again..

I know last time I dropped one 
It's not that I let the people down.. 
I let myself down.. my mind wasn't there.. 
Just wasn't focused but ain't none of that shit no more "no more"..
None that stress..
I dealt with all that shit.. 
I know niggaz is sitting around like damn.. 
He named the album God's favorite...God's favorite.. 
What the f*ck he mean by that.. 
I mean with all this drama we be going through... shit on the street.. 
Nigga hating niggaz from my same origin, fucking with niggaz 
They not supposed to f*ck with "foul man".. 
Shit is just to much "too much" 
Jail calling "jail calling us" 
Like we still fucking hustling "police"..

And now as a man "a man"..
