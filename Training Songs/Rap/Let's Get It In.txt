I wish I had time to get to know you but I don’t
I wish I could be here in the morning but I won’t
So let's get it in girl
So let's get it in girl

I bet to you it may feel like I’m in a rush
Give it to you how you want it until you’ve had enough
Bottles of champagne, I’ll have us all in this position
Grown ass man now I’m needing intervention
We can make tonight the night baby if you just listen
Started out slow, yeah we could get to kissing
'cause all I need is, just a touch of your love
(A little bit)

The spotlight on us ain't bright enough baby
Thinking bout you is driving me crazy

I do what I gotta do to get it
I admit it, the way you move it is making me lose it
Let's get into it

So take my hand don’t fight that feelin’
It’s alright to roll with me we just chillin’
The wildest dreams is ’bout to leave the building
Don’t you wanna roll with me

I wish I had time to get to know you but I don’t
I wish I could be here in the morning but I won’t
So let's get it in girl
So let's get it in girl

Hey girl I’m picking you like let’s go
You gotta be the baddest in the club that’s all I know
Tell your friends I see you tomorrow
And tell em that young Lloyd taught you the backstroke
Now wait a minute there’s something you must know
I’mma blow it up but in the morning you must go
Come as fine as you are, fine as you are I can’t make you my girl

So take my hand don’t fight that feelin’
It’s alright to roll with me we just chillin’
The wildest dreams is ’bout to leave the building
Don’t you wanna roll with me

I wish I had time to get to know you but I don’t
I wish I could be here in the morning but I won’t
So let's get it in girl
So let's get it in girl

Hey hey I said let's get it in girl
Let's get it in
Let's get it in
Let's get it in
Let's get it in

I wish I had time to get to know you but I don’t
I wish I could be here in the morning but I won’t
So let's get it in girl
So let's get it in girl

I gotta go baby
So what's up baby, what you tryin'a do
I mean take a chance for once in your life
Yeah, zone 4, young Lloyd, 50 Cent
