(I'm wasted)
Ha, ha, ha, ha

Ha, rock star lifestyle might don't make it
Living life high everyday click wasted
Sipping on purple stuff rolling up stanky
Wake up in the morning ten o'clock dranking
Party, party, party, let's all get wasted
Shake it for me baby girl, do it butt naked
I'm so wasted, she so wasted shout the bartender
Send twenty more cases

Geeking like Whitney, geeking like Britney
Gucci no hippie but it's on like Jimmy 
X Pill poppers geeked up crazy whole click rolling
Everyone wasted purple codeine Sprite pink don't waste it, 
Mix up, grandma drank it and didn't taste it, 
Now grandma sipping syrup leaning wasted 
Walking 'round f*ck up
Twisting her finga home gurl
Slipped up drunk got wasted now
She back stage an she tryna get famous
Hit me up the drinky, drinky Gucci Mane shake it, 
Club night, damn right, Gucci Mane wasted

Rock star lifestyle might don't make it
Living life high everyday click wasted
Sipping on purple stuff rolling up stanky
Wake up in the morning ten o'clock dranking
Party, party, party, let's all get wasted
Shake it for me baby girl, do it butt naked
I'm so wasted, she so wasted shout the bartender
Send me twenty more cases

I don't wear tight jeans like the white boys
But I do get wasted like the white boys
Now I'm looking for a bitch to suck dis almond joy
Said she gotta stop sucking 'cause her jaw's sore
Gotta bitch on the couch, bitch on the floor
Party just popping up but now he rolling more
Rolled on, three pills now, he on four I don't know, why?
But that Remy turned into a whore
Walked in the club, pocket full of big faces
Got the forty on my waist and it's off safety
'Bout forty goons wit' me and we all wasted
Only Remy straight tonight dog no chasing

Rock star lifestyle might don't make it
Living life high everyday click wasted
Sipping on purple stuff rolling up stanky
Wake up in the morning ten o'clock dranking
Party, party, party, let's all get wasted
Shake it for me baby girl, do it butt naked
I'm so wasted, she so wasted shout the bartender
Send me twenty more cases

Whole click faded we geeked up crazy
Big boy bracelet we white boy wasted
No shirt, f*ck it unless your arms tatted
We slopping trunk disgusted the liquor keep wasting 
285 east side me and Plies wasted
Racing seven big booty broads chasing 
Spring break fifty thousand white girls shake it 
Some dancing naked
But everyone's wasted 
Magic city Monday
Ball players wasted 
This one for yo' uncle drinking Thunderbird wasted 
Twelve pack wasted
I need more cases 
And Gucci not a racist
All my diamonds Caucasians

Rock star lifestyle might don't make it
Living life high everyday click wasted
Sipping on purple stuff rolling up stanky
Wake up in the morning ten o'clock dranking
Party, party, party, let's all get wasted
Shake it for me baby girl, do it butt naked
I'm so wasted, she so wasted shout the bartender
Send twenty more cases
