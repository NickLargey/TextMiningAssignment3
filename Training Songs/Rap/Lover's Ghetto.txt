Through the thirty years and all the years between
You never turned on me
And you opened my eyes to see
That you were the one for me
And the value of you is
Beyond what money can buy
Your kiss is so refreshing
My heart is never dry

Even though we're still in the struggle
Life is so beautiful
Heaven in the ghetto
I could never let you go
Blue days and dark nights
You'll always be apart of my life
We're inseparable
Love overflows

[Chorus]
All I see is you
In the sky, on my mind
Whispers in the night
Your sweet tone
In your arms is where I call home

I remember when we had no furniture
Just a color TV
And a carpet and some pillows
And we both were so happy
And we stuck it out together
And now it's more than what we had
Which ain't much, but things could be worse
Thank God I can't be mad, no

Even though we're still in the struggle
Life is so beautiful
Heaven in the ghetto
I could never let you go
Blue days and dark nights
You'll always be apart of my life
We're inseparable
Love overflows

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Always, no matter what (no matter)
You are my baby (you're my baby)
I'll never give you up (oh)
I'm still you lady (I'm with you)
I know we'll make it through (I know)
I'll be here by your side (by you)
Baby, I'm here for you (I'm here for you)
My arms are open wide (I love you, I love you, I love you)

[Chorus: x2] 

[Bridge: Repeats]
