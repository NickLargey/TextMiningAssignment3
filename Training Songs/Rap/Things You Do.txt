DJ ENVY & RED CAFE - Things You Do lyrics
(feat. Nina Sky)

[Intro: Nina Sky]
Oh-ho, oh-ho, ohhh... Nina Sky-why-ighhhh...

[Red Cafe:]
DJ Envy, Red Cafe, The Co-op!

[Chorus sung in the style of Gina Thompson's "The Things That You Do": Nina Sky]
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

[Verse 1: Red Cafe (Nina Sky) {Red Cafe in parenthesis}]
Uh, you remind me of hard liquor
Feel like I overdosed on hard liquor
Now you got a G leanin (Jodeci)
You got a G Feenin woe is me
Is are Dot, the fresh and the flyest (Yeah)
The thighs in that dress could start a riot
{UH OHH!} It's the lovin like that
Like a round-trip flight, I be comin right back (Right back)
Shakedown got me thuggin like that (Like that)
All night, I'm out chasin that trap
It's like every thug's dream
To have a down chick or a thug a** queen
Face in the pillow, a** in the arch
Legs done had a divorce, they split apart (Split apart)
I do it slow, til you scream (Do it faster)
Red Cafe, I'm back the Trackmaster

[Chorus: Nina Sky (Red Cafe)]
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you (Yeah, It's The Co-op, OK OK!)
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you (ok ok

[Verse 2: Red Cafe (Nina Sky) {Red Cafe in parenthesis}]
It might be wrong but it feel so right, yes yes this is life
Love is so hood you could bottle that stuff
If it wasn't Cafe I would gobble it up
Yep! No longer thinkin 'bout them R&B girls
Like, Ciara (Uh Uh) Nivea (Who that?) Teairra (Nah) Olivia (Whatever!)
All them names seem trivia
You look mean in them painted paints, do that dance, do that dance
I ain't no backyard n****
But my workout plan will make your backyard bigger
{I like} To see you in my favorite jeans
{And I like} The way you don't hold your screams
{I like} The way you make your body rock
And you ain't scared to lick the lollipop

[Chorus: Nina Sky]
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
OK! OK! I know you like the finer things
Designer names like Vera Wang
Necklesses and diamond rings
Bling blaow shirts with the shiney things
You could get all that plus a rover
Put my chain on the arm give you the cold shoulder
And the hood respect it man
I bring the pain that's the Method Man
What's 'gon top that? Who 'gon knock that?
We a tag team girl they can't stop that
The world feelin your fella, on the road to the riches let's get it together

[Verse 4: Nina Sky]
I see you sippin slowly (Slowly) I can tell you want me (You want me)
Like that drink so tasty, there's no need for chasin, no no no

[Chorus: Nina Sky]
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

[Outro: Nina Sky (Red Cafe)]
Uh huh, oh oh (Yeah! It's The Co-op!) Oh oh oh
