I ain't tryin' to walk into an empty house
And end up on the couch by myself no
And I ain't tryin' to be starin' at the t.v. feelin' hungry
With no home cooked meal
And I ain't tryin' to be callin' your name wonderin' where you at
Cause I know that your right upstairs
I ain't tryin' to be wreckin' my brain
Goin' back and forth thinkin' bout how I gotta change
This ain't no game
Cause I ain't playin' girl
Its you and me girl
That's how we be girl
And I'm goin' change
And I'm for real girl
Cant do without ya girl
Cause baby your my world

[Chorus]
I ain't tryin' to be without you
And I don't care what I gotta do
Girl I'll do anything and I'll go anywhere
Cause ain't nothin' workin' without you baby
I ain't tryna be without you
And I ain't tryin' to be the one who's makin' you unhappy
Cause if you unhappy then I know I ain't tryin' hard enough
Gotta try harder for you

I ain't tryin' to be all out in the street
Or up in the club sippin' on Patron
Wit my flirt on
And I ain't tryin' to be sneakin' home
Wonderin' what to say
When you ask why I smell like fresh soap
And I ain't tryin' to be lyin' and hidin' the truth
Decievin' you
That's that old shit I used to do
And I ain't tryin' to be scared of my own cell phone no more
I don't wanna piss you off

This ain't no game
Cause I ain't playin' girl
Its you and me girl
Thats how we be girl
And I'm goin' change
And I'm for real girl
Can't do without ya girl
Baby you're my world

[Chorus]

If I don't get it right the first time
Baby please believe me I will try it again
And I don't care if it takes me a lifetime
I swear to God I will try to the end
As long as I'm on earth
I'm gonna keep my word
Girl I'll do whatever it takes
To prove to you that I'm a changed man
Did some foul shit
But I won't do it again

[Chorus]

Gotta do better girl
