Yeah
I would be your man, You would be my girl
Oh yeah
I believe, I believe

If there's any justice in the world
I would be your man, You would be my girl
Oh yeah
If I found you first you know its true, 
He would be alone I would be with you

When you decide, Don't let me down 
Cause there's nothing to be certain in my life And you've seen a thousand times 
There's not much justice in the world
Oh No, Uh

If there's any justice in your heart
You're love really changed
Is it in too hard, Oh n
Why don't you remember how it feels, not to give a damn for anyone but me, yeah

I can't believe
You'd be deceived
Changing memories from truth to fantasy
When there's nothing left but tears
And there's not much justice in the world, oh

Just because its wrapped around your finger
Don't fool yourself with dreams that might appear, oh
If in time you stop and trust your feelings
The truth is out there somewhere
It's blowing in the wind, Oh

If there's any justice in the world
I would be your man, You would be my girl
Oh yeah
If I found you first you know its true, he would be alone and I would beeee with yoooou
Yeah

When you decide
Don't let me down
Cause there's nothing to be certain in my life And I've seen a thousand times
There's not much justice in the world
No

If I should lose you girl you know
That there's not much justice in the world
No No

If there's any justice in the world
