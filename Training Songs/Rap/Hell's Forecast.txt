Something has woke my a thump on my roof, it was followed by crashing, more thumping ensued 
I jumped out of my bed thinking I'd been invaded, heard smashing, more pounding, the sound escalated 
Looked out of my window, blood dripped down thy glass, I see bodies lay twisted and mangled on grass, 
I ran into thy main room and Shaggy was dead, so was Nate the Mac, Jumpsteady and ABK 
Bolted out of thy house to see if it's a joke, I heard hundreds of car alarms, saw flames and smoke 
And thy sky above red, I see dead bodies fallin' it's raining with corpses thy blood is appalling 

Mama told me when it rains 
IT POURS, but never mentioned Dead Bodies,
DEAD BODIES 
Mama told me when it rains
IT POURS, La de da da de la da de  
DEAD BODIES 

I never seen so many,
Horrified looks on people's faces
(Thy blood is appalling) 
I hope I never see what all them people saw
And put them in there places
(Thy blood is appalling), 
The sun was so hot, 
So hot
I was burning,
Yeah 

Dead bodies lay randomly some stack in piles, on all of there faces pour horror, no smiles 
I see children, and ciders, and ninjas my age, all lay naked and mangled, most withered for days, 
I found safety a shelter I'm under a tree; only fingers and organs come falling on me, 
I lay sleepless for days as thy raining continued, thy heat of thy sun baking corpses like food 
Then it finally stopped I walk knee deep in blood, over piles of bodies threw what was my hood 
It was right azt that moment thy Wraith had appeared, and thy message it left me might sound kind of weird 
But take all that I'm seeing and opposite that, truth is I'm thy one dead and this is my Hell's Pit
