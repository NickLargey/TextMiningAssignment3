[ VERSE 1 ]
Excuse me, baby, haven't I seen you before?
I don't forget faces, and I'm pretty sure
That I know you from a long time ago
I was in the 12th grade, you were a grade below
I used to see you in the halls, goin to class
And when you saw me pass, you switched that as-
tronomical butt from the left to the right
And you would give me letters sayin (call me tonight)
Now your face was pretty, and your body was hot
So then I thought to myself, and said, why not?
You can be the skeezer, I'll be the skeezee
I knock the boots, and you're strung on me
But I have to admit, you were a whole lotta woman
You had to be good, cause you kept me comin
Then I graduated, and I left town
That's why you haven't really seen me around
But after all these years, you're still lookin good
And if we got together, I know you would
Reminisce and miss this Def Jef kiss
I respark the flame, and I knew you'd just
want to give it here

Give it here
(Give it to me, give it to me)

I got a fat bank account, I'm pretty comfortable
But hey, I'm very picky bout the girls I pull
Because nowadays you never know
If girls like you, or they like your dough
They always say, "Buy me that", and I say, "Buy you what?
You better keep your mouth shut and do the butt strut"
Cause I'm not spendin a dime until you spend some time
Givin me what I want, cause I'm in my prime
And you know what I want, so don't even play dumb
Girl, give me some, and I can make you come
Back to my house at all times in the mornin
You won't have to say, cause I know what you be wantin
You know the routine, so assume the position
I'ma take my pole, and I'ma cold go fishin
Like a tootsie-pop. you know that I last long
And if you can't sing. you be singin this song
Give it here

(Give it to me)
(Oh)
(Oh, you gotta give me some now)

Because you promised me the day that you quit you boyfriend
You'd let me in, so tell me when
Because you had me waitin and waitin for such a long time
You keep tellin me that it's the wrong time
You're makin it harder and harder
For me to control, and hold back that part of
Me that needs you, and wants to please you
Cause I know what you like, and I'll do more than HE do
So stop trippin, too late to start flippin
Before you start lippin, you need to go slip in-
to the neglig√© that I got you for your birthday
And don't be scared, cause I came prepared
So if you're old enough to give me shot
And if you're bold enough to take all I got
Don't say that you're ready if you really are not
Cause - mh, when I get hot
I'll give you more than anyone before
I'm not Prince, but I'll do you like you never been done before
Let's get together, I know we fit together
Like a hand and glove, come on and get this love
Just give it here

Give it here
(Give it to me, baby)
Yeah baby
You know I like it like that
Of course I love spendin time with you
You know you're my one and only
Ehm - ehm - hold it
What was your name again?
