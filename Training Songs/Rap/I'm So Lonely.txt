I'm so lonely, I just got to let you know
And I got to let you
If you'd only look, you hold the key to show
I've got to let you, I've got to let you know

That, I'm so lonely, I've just got to let you know
And I've got to let you
Take me to the places that I need to go.
I've got to let you
I've got to let you know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know

If you don't know
If you don't see my face - calling you back
If you don't hear, you hear my voice
If you don't see my face - calling you back
Calling you back

I'm so lonely, I just got to let you know
I've got to let you
If you'd only see, you'd let the feeling grow
Just let the feeling
Just let the feeling grow, grow, grow, grow, no, no, no, no, no


Calling you back 
What can I do
