Blood curdling truth
Working the word in as proof
Besides mine the guidelines of righteous paths taken
Tremendous speaking, fresh out the kitchen
And never switching from the homegrown
Hole it down like the ozone
This is for the playa playa
Make ya holla holla
The kid with no morals
Sell his mama for a dollar
They all fall down
They all fall down
They all fall down
They all fall
I've compiled this alongside with bone
So you can file this under for the opposing a nihilist
Doubt what you know nothing about reactionary
Belief in the scripture's fulfillment are contrary
To popular belief
Hell-bound in a basket
Sucking on their teeth
Wound up in a casket
At close, you froze
Already chose the doors you go trough
The life you chose to lead
Determines the place you go to

To the naked, untrained eye
Who can't see time fly by
Revolving on a carousel
Living life like a modern day fairytale
Slow mo', urgent message gets a no-go
What fo'
Can't nobody tell you
Everything is lovey dovey
Till your plans fall through
They all fall down
They all fall down
They all fall down
They all fall

Lay it down flat
The ins and outs of this business
Oral with my morals
Things I say seem pretentious
Show change
I ain't deranged
To be looked upon strange
Like the dames in the verbs joint (shoot, we the factors)
You ain't know yeah
Rally all my troops in GI Joe gear
Arsenals and weapons abundant
Stop me if I sound redundant

Sound redundant
Man please appease me
Repeat yourself
Most folks scared of the truth
Living lies
Fooling themselves and everyone surrounding
Deception of perception blind
To what self did deep down
Deep down beyond the black hole
of the soul in control

They all fall
They all fall

I was surrounded by the darkness
Of the hearts of men's
Plots for spots to roll rovers
Controlling blocks and lots on top
Where I was charted to be
But failing to see truth
Behind the lies of eyes
Handling G's
They squeeze until my soul was unloaded
Holding to nothing
But folded bills
Concealed like weapons looking to kill
My mind filled
With thrills and pleasures
Life could offer
Walked amongst the dead
Laid to rest in a coffin
Nocturnal destiny
Leading to my eternity
Hourly concerning me
Yet I wasn't yearned
To be all of what
His calling said to be
And bred to be
Actually I thought it was all about me
Took for granted what was handed by the unseen
Invested all my time and effort
Building see
Appealing to my desires
And lustful feelings
Thinking I could make it by the grace of God
Straight disgrace the face of God

They all fall
They all fall
