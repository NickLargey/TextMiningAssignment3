It’s the sound, the hip and hip and now
When I hip you, hip you hound
Get down or get tied up and twound
Let me twist you, twist you pal
Ya shyer, sh-shy how can I get you, get you out?
Let's have a listen in, Rottweil(er)
Let me hit you hit you owww
A flight, a tryst, night owl, when I whistle, whistle-howl
Pick up when I get into town, tell me if you’ll

Be around, to ride with Miss Camaraderie
A sight to see, a sound, what up-what iz you with Rottweil lemme get you

Ayo hound
Be mild oh listen, lord I mean
I might've seen I swore
I saw ya looking, looking all at me
Admiring amor
Be idol in my heart
Oh be inspiring and more
What kind of wizard ?
What-what a dream!
A night a scene a town
A ride with Miss Camaraderie
An odyssey, oh, wow

Hip you hound, get down or get tied up and twound

A pistol, pistol pow
Let's have a listen in papa

Be around to ride with Miss Camaraderie
An odyssey a sound
