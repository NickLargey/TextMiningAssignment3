One two three, uh huh
Yo yo

I wake up in the morning it's six o'clock
They say there may be rain but the sun is hot
I wish I had some time just to kill today
And I wish I had a dime for every bill I've got to pay
Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as the times your in
So I jump back in there where I learned to swim
Try to keep my head above it the best I can, that's why

Here I am,
Just waiting for this storm to pass me by
And that's the sound of sunshine
Coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine
Coming down
(Down down down)

One two three, uh huh

I saw my friend Bobby I said "What's up man"
You got a little work or twenty to lend
I opened up my hand he said "I'm glad to see
They can take away my job but not my friends, you see"

And here I am, waiting for the storm to pass me by (Pass me by)
And that's the sound of sunshine
Coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine
Coming down

Yo yo here we go

I wanna go where the summer never ends
With my guitar on the beach there with all my friends
The suns so hot and the waves in motion
And everything smells like sun tan lotion
The ocean, and the girls so sweet
So kick off your shoes and relax your feet
They say that miracles are never seizing
And every single soul needs a little releasing
The stereo bumpin' 'til the sun goes down
And I only wanna hear that sound

And that's the sound of sunshine (of sunshine)
Coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine
Coming down
(Coming down down down)

And I said you're the one I wanna be with (yo yo)
When the sun goes down (uh huh)
You're the one I wanna be with (I really wanna be with)
When the sun goes down, singin' you're the one I wanna be with
When the sun goes down
You're the one I wanna be with
When the sun goes

That's the sound (that's the sound)
Of sunshine (of sunshine)
Coming down (uh huh, uh huh)
And that's the sound of sunshine
Coming down

When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
(When the sun goes down)
