Let's get this on, let's get this on

We can get this pimpin'
Roll the dice
We can get this mackin'

From P H I L L why
All the way to L be see, that be me
The boy F are double the E play with mouths
I will dot your I's, blaze your T's

No, no, I'm not related to are
I don't play with kids, I check ID's
If a chick under the age under the wig
Then she don't get none of the kid makin' her bleed

I'm gone with the breeze, out with the wind
In Miami, tryin' to win two mamis out in the beach
They say I'm frontin' my Spanish, I think you prob'ly
A mulato, papi culo, I spotted you from the beach

She eat I like a melon
Tryin' to ride to my telly, chicks move when the playa speak
Them freaks tryin' to meet the Roc
An' those chicks wasn't shocked when I said

You can get this pimpin', baby, you can get this mackin'
All around the world we do it big, you know what's happenin'
Like the way you work it, baby, so sexy
It's all good, gimme *** on your knees

Can I hit that ***, baby? Yo, you know what's happenin'
Big F are double E, I keep it crackin'
All across the wizzorld, we doin' trizzars
With my *** Dizzogg

I've been all around the wizzorld, I met a lot of gizzurls
Shaniqua, Kanika, Pizzearl, Shizzirl
Look, I can go on an' on
'Cause my game is strong, word is bond

Leave me a zone, no, leave me alone
See, I'm up in the clizzub, bangin' the pizzubs
Tryin' to get some skizzirts 'cause you know how I dizzoes
I'm real this this crippin' 'cause it's all in my blizzood

A lot of suckas wanna get us but can't *** with us
'Cause we some real heavy hitters
'Nuff of that, cuff your ass, stuff your sack an' bounce
Roc-A-Fella's in the *** Dogghouse

So you know, blow for blow, toe for toe
Chauffeur dough, matter of fact we can go
An' I bet you, I beat you
'Cause I keep a bundle of 'em that'll greet you
See you, then freak you

You can get this pimpin', baby, you can get this mackin'
All around the world we do it big, you know what's happenin'
Like the way you work it, baby, so sexy
It's all good, gimme *** on your knees

Can I hit that ***, baby? Yeah, you know what's happenin'
Big Snoopy D O double G, you know I keep it crackin'
All up in your hizzoes, do it the G way
With my ***, Freeway

After the show, take them chickens to my room
Makin' the moves, smellin' the fumes, sparkin' the
She gotta roll after I'm done hittin' her off
Man, I smash with my kicks off, live on the road

I get around, Free stay round the coochie
I come around an' round, up all the groupies
Me an' Snoopy swerve in a Coupe DeVille
Pick up a couple chicks an' we get the dough

Watch, I show y'all chumps how to work the skills
Man, the heat go
Then I reload
Through your people's peepholes, then I gotta roll

From around, free stay round the hood strapped
Come around an' round up all the hood rats
In your town, P wish he could that
Roll up a couple words, tell 'em
Tell the hood that I get around

You can get this pimpin', baby, you can get this mackin'
All around the world we do it big, you know what's happenin'
Like the way you work it, baby, so sexy
It's all good, gimme *** on your knees

Can I hit that ***, baby? Yo, you know what's happenin'
Big F are double E, I keep it crackin'
All across the wizzorld, we doin' trizzars
With my *** Dizzogg

Can I hit that ***, baby? Yeah, you know what's happenin'
Big Snoopy D O double G, you know I keep it crackin'
All up in your hizzoes, do it the G way
With my ***, Freeway
