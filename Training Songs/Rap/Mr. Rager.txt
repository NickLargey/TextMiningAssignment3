I'm off on an adventure
This song is dedicated to all the kids like me
I'm on my way to heaven
Wherever you are, now

Birds sing, flyin' around
You never see them too long on the ground
You wanna be one of them, yeah
You wanna be one of them, yeah
You might hear the birds singin', flyin' around
You never see them too long on the ground
You wanna be one of them, yeah
You wanna be one of them, yeah
Whoa now

Hey, Mr. Rager, Mr. Rager,
Tell me where you're going
Tell us where you're headed
Off on adventure

Tell us of your travels
Hey, Mr. Rager, Mr. Rager,

I'm on my way to heaven
Mr. Rager, can we tag along
Can we take the journey?

Knocked down round for round
You're feelin' like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end?
When will the heaven begin? Yeah
You might be knocked down round for round
You're feelin' like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? Yeah
When will the heaven begin? Yeah
Whoa now
