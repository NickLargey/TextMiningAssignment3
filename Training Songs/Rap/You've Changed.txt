Sounds like a love song, sounds like a love song
I already heard your side of the story, hear mine
I'ma tell you why, cause you changed, (baby you changed)
When you got dough (you got dough and changed), 
Nah nah nah nah nah,no you listen, (what was I to do)

I remember like yesterday,the very day I met you
You were looking fly, I was acting shy,
So when you walked on by I ignored you
But then you turned around and asked my name
And in an instant my attitude changed,
Swept me off my feet,you were so sweet
Full of comedy, you amused me
Gave you my number, next day you called
Asking if you could see me
So I said alright, you can stop on by
It gave me butterflies,
30 minutes, knock, knock its you
I'm glad to see you, but I keep my cool
From day one I fell in love with you,
But now I ask myself who are you
Because

[Chorus]
You've changed, you've changed
You got dough and changed (and I don't)
You got dough and changed (baby you changed)
It wasn't the same, you got dough and changed
You got dough and you changed
What was I to do

You were never there, why should I be there
There's no one there to hold me
I'm young at heart and age and these are the days,
When a girl like me needs loving
If hes not then someone else is
Getting what he calls his
Wasn't taking care of home, left me there alone
So whats a girl to do when she's feeling in the mood
We were together but we grew apart
Thinking with my mind and not my heart
Packed up all my things, left the engagement ring
Cause from the looks of things, I cant do this
Live this life that I call my life
If this is what its like being your wife,
I'd rather be a friend than through the thick and thin, 
But now is the end of my suffering

[Chorus]

What was I to do? sit around and wait for you to call
When I wanted to be in your arms
Missing you every minute you were gone
You were gone too long
Doing who knows what, who knows where
You act like you didn't care,
When I told you, I wouldn't be here
Cause you changed

[Chorus]

No it ain't about the cars, with the rims or the rings
No it ain't about the lies, or the houses, and things
Perpatratin' with the clothes, broking promises please,
No it ain't about the life that you giving to me

No it ain't about it, no it ain't about it [Repeat: x2]
