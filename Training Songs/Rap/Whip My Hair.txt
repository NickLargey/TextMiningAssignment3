Hop up out the bed turn my swag on
Pay no attention to them haters cause we whip 'em off
And we ain't doing nothing wrong
So don't tell me nothing, I'm just tryna have fun
So keep the party jumping

So whats up? (yea)
And I'll be doing what to do
We turn our backs and whip our hair
And just shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off

Don't let haters keep me off my grind
With my head up, I know I'll be fine
Keep fighting until I get there (yea)
When I'm down and I feel like giving up
I think again
