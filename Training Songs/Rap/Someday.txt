[Intro] 
I got something to tell everybody out there 
Sometimes you may feel like life have you in bondage 
You don't know which way to turn 
And you just feel like deep down inside 
God, you have to help me 
But take it from me, someday 
It may not be your day or the day that you want it to happen 
But someday we'll all be free 
I got a message to tell y'all 
I want y'all to listen to me 
Listen very, very carefully 
'cause it's a short story, with a big message 
Someday, someday we'll all be free 
Listen 

Even though right now you may be going through 
Somehow you wear a smile 
Rainy days don't wash away the pain inside 
No, you can't hide 
Lift your hands to the sky 
In our life we all need some relief 
We all need peace to fulfill our destiny 
I don't know what tomorrow may bring 
But all I know is someday we'll all be free 

Someday we'll all be free 
Someday we'll all be free 
Someday we'll all be free 
Someday we'll all be free
