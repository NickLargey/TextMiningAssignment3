No more eatin',

All started when I was eight,
First time I ever got ate,
What a Piece of cake,
Mans eatin' off me like I was a plate,
Now I'm in the estate,
Walking the streets of Gate,
With eyes immersed with tears streaming down my bloodshot face
Because some Irish kid just took my bike away,
Now my step dad's pissed,
And he's looking for this pikey breh,
Asking me what he looked like,
I told him his clothes were Nike make,
I felt so ashamed,
When he asked me why
I let him take my bike
Without putting up a fight
All I could do was turn away,
Turn the page six years later
Now I'm fourteen years of age,
Life's a daze so my brain
Smoking too much purple haze, haze,
High is how I spend my days,
Still I feel to snap,
'Cause though I'm holdin' it down at school,
At street I'm still gettin' jacked,
Still gettin' attacked and ask why I can't find the balls to hit them back,
Hit em back,
Eat up these cats like I eat up a track,
It's only when I turned sixteen that I start facin' facts,
Saw how the weed made me act,
Kicked the habit like it was laced with crack.

No more eatin' for them now,
No more eatin',
No more eatin' for them now,
No more eatin' for them now,
No more eatin' for them now,
No more eatin' for them now

No more thinkin' too deep,
I ain't who your crew eats,
'Cause now I do peeps,
And it's worse than when I slew peeps,
Hit em hard like new beats,
Straight out the studio,
Got a dangerous mind that is spitting more dangerous rhyme than Coolio,
As I walk through the Valley,
Of the shadow of death,
Now I'm eighteen years of age and I'm shottin' the zest,
I still ain't got no bucky or no bulletproof vest,
Just a world full of pain for the next cunt who tries test,
I'm nineteen years to the day,
And it's been three since someones tried it,
As soon as they do I'ma knock their lights out like they ultraviolet,
They got their eyes on my stash,
But try to stand,
They know I'm makin' cash though I look brass 'cause try to keep it quiet,
But I shot the choongest peng it ain't no secret,
And given half a chance yo half these cats would wanna eat it,
Plus they know I don't get high so my supply builds up their appetite,
And now they wanna feed it,
Take me for a fuckin' eji,
I always new it was gonna happen,
So when it did I beat the kid til he was blue n black n told him who you think your jackin'?,
Packed a punch yes a punch yes that's what I was packin',
Hit the fuckin' cunt so hard he already started blattin',
Before he hit the floor like a sack of potatoes,
Face plant- knocked the teeth right out his cake hole,
Then sent him on his way yo with somethin' to say though,
Thought I was somethin' to eat up you made a mistake bro,
You made a mistake bro,
You just made the biggest fuckin' mistake of your sorry little fuckin' life bro
