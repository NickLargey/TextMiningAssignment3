Check it, I got styles, all of 'em sick
Niggaz ain't fit to walk a mile in the dead man's kicks
I make 'em shit about a pile, of bricks to show
He ain't nuttin' but another, a lone John Doe
That want to flow, here it is, comin' up shit's creek
I come to throw monkey wrenches in your program, sleep
and I'ma grow, like a rash on ya nasty ass
In a whip, with no breaks and I'm hittin' the gas
It's a bird, it's a plane, take a look in the sky
Method Man on some shit, niggaz call me The Fly
'Cause my style, dates back to hoppin' turnstyles
Make ya fear, if ya cutie in the chair, you can bet I'll
get severe on the double I harass it
I don't look for trouble, I'm already trouble
Ya bastard, check the wicked flows that I crafted
Open up a deadly venom style to be mastered
By a psychopathic, way beyond an average
Joe, with a hellafied flow, there ya have it

What's that shit that they be smokin?  Tical, tical, tical

What's that shit the niggaz smokin?  Tical, tical, tical

One two, uh, one two one two

What goes off?  What goes on?  The Meth shit
that we got is to stay high, no question
Lethal weapon, ain't no time for half steppin'
When brothers start wettin' everything in ya section
Move that, niggaz came strapped, shoulda knew that
Do dat, pussy cat rap, boy, I'll screw that
To' up, from the flow up, don't even show up
To the battle, I heard you rattle now hold up
Is there a fuckin' snake in my garden?
Starvin', for a rap treat, steppin' on my feet
Pardon yo delf, before ya find yo delf
In a fucked up situation, without no help
I'm not playin', 'cause I don't play with nobody
God damn kid, know what I'm sayin', I'm peelin' niggas wigs
I be sprayin', brother with words
'Cause I got a spit problem

Tical, tical, tical
Pass it over here, tical, tical, tical
What's that shit the niggaz smokin?  Tical, tical, tical
