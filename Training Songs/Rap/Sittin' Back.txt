Sittin' back in the cut 
Looking fine
Look at that nigga what
this shit is mine

So they call us stars 
I guess not all of us are chosen 
I drive a car with the top back 
Cause my vanity's my token 
Now all this talkin' ain't my style
About responsiblities 
Like this here nation is my child like it's direct humanity 

Sittin' back in the cut
Looking fine 
Look at that nigga what
This shit is mine

You talkin' 'bout white children 
Who kill their parents before school 
I'm talkin' Lexus' with rims black
So when I drive back I look cool
Goodness the President's human 
And you're all hypocrites
I think I'm jaded make a sport of it
Now I'm numb to the shit

Sittin' back in the cut
Lookin' fine 
Look at that nigga what
This shit is mine 

I just want to blow up
Then baby who knows who'll win the game
When I close my eyes it all looks the same
I don't want to know nobody's name
'Cause I'm going for dough when I go for game
'Cause I'm going for... that's why
