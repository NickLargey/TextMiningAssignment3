What's up you've reached Ashanti leave me a numeric message or a
Voice message and I'll get back to you lata [beep]
Hey girl what's up it's me, yo man remember
Your friend and I've been calling you for the past three weeks
You've never returned any of my
Calls, what happened I thought I was going to see you
At the spot last night yo everybody's
Askin' for you, and you know who be looking for you like crazy,
Man what's going on, what's come
Over you?

[Chorus]
I don't know what's come over me I don't know,
I don't know what's come over me, I don't know
What's come over me, I don't know I don't know what's come over me

Because I never felt like this, (I don't want to be wrong cause I like it)
Thinking about the way you kiss,
(I don't want to be wrong but I like it)
I think you stole my heart from me, (See I don't want to be wrong cause I like it)
Cause I belong to somebody (even though it seems wrong I
Can't fight it)it almost feels as if I'm not myself,
I'm nervous bound from someone else I think
I'm falling for somebody else and I can't control myself
It's like some kind of hex is on me
Controlling who I love and how I speak
And when it's gone my heart won't beat tell me what's come
Over me. 

[Chorus]

Because I never felt like this, (I don't want to be wrong cause I like it)
Thinking about the way you kiss,
(I don't want to be wrong but I like it)
You got me thinking I should leave, (see I don't want to be wrong cause I like it).
But I belong to somebody (even though it seems wrong I can't fight it)
I know that I already have a love, he's all I know and all I trust but lately
I've been falling out of love I find myself so deep in lust
And every time he's here with me I
Look into his eyes so desperately but now it's not his face I see,
Tell me what comes over me

[Chorus]

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
(I just don't know) I don't know (what's come over me),
I don't know, I don't know , I don't know, I don't know, I don't
Know, (it's like something is taking complete control over me)
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,
(I can't function I'm not me) I don't know, I don't
Know, I don't know what's come over me, I don't know, I don't know
What's come over me, I don't
Know what's come over me, I don't know, I don't know,
What's come over me, I don't know, I don't
Know what's come over me.
