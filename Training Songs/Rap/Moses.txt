I told her hold it down
She fucking with the plug, told her “Come over now"
Where are all my bitches tonight?
Bring me some more bitches tonight
Yeah, I bought a hunnid rounds
She asking for fifty, threw a hunnid thou
Where are all my bitches tonight?
Bring me some more bitches tonight, yeah
I'm feeling like Moses, I'm all in the ocean, I'm parting, divided up in it like Moses
She switching the motions and making them faces just like an emoji
Pineapple Fanta, it mixed with the Xanax, she loving the codeine
All of my killas, they ready to follow me, I feel like Moses

Got a hunnid bitches with me, feel like Moses
Got a hunnid killas with me, feel like (Moses)
Got a yacht on the water, feel like (Moses)
Got a hunnid bad bitches, feel like

Feeling like gold, sipping and drinking, I'm feeling like Kobe
Sipping and drinking that yellow and purple, I'm mixing that codeine
Look at the top of my Audemar, look at them bitches, they wall to wall
Look at my niggas they all in, you know them niggas don't call a lot
Look at the Benz, look at them niggas, they looking depressed
Came with her friends, throwing them bags, that Mitchell & Ness
Young cold nigga, mouth full of gold teeth
F*ck nigga talking 'bout nigga? You don’t know me, huh

Look at the presi', f*ck with the Rollie and move like the president
This shit depressing, feeling like Moses, I'm giving them lessons
Skinny, tatted with the blue hair and the gold teeth
I don’t run from woop woop, shit f*ck the police

I told her hold it down
She fucking with the plug, told her “Come over now"
Where are all my bitches tonight?
Bring me some more bitches tonight
Yeah, I bought a hunnid rounds
She asking for fifty, threw a hunnid thou
Where are all my bitches tonight?
Bring me some more bitches tonight, yeah
I'm feeling like Moses, I'm all in the ocean, I'm parting, divided up in it like Moses
She switching the motions and making them faces just like an emoji
Pineapple Fanta, it mixed with the Xanax, she loving the codeine
All of my killas, they ready to follow me, I feel like Moses

What you feel like? Moses
What you feel like? I feel like Moses
What you feel like? Uh, yeah, Moses

Feeling like Moses, pipe with the water, I 'cause a commotion
Lil mama said she wet, she wetter than an ocean
I pull up on you, rub up on you like some lotion
You might call me Sniper way a nigga scoping

(Offset) When she get on her knees it’s phenomenal
When it come to trapping, give you the formula
Cuban links hang on my neck like the ornament
F*ck on your bitch, I give her back, don’t want the bitch

(Takeoff) Dabbin' in fashion it’s magic
Two snow bunnies call 'em Mary Kate & Ashley
Keep it on me, quick to shoot a three
Like Dirk Nowitzki from the Dallas Mavericks

(Quavo) She said she wanna f*ck with a real nigga
She said she wanna go to war and kill with him
50 bottles in the VIP, 50 models
Momma told me watch for the snakes and koalas

I told her hold it down
She fucking with the plug, told her “Come over now"
Where are all my bitches tonight?
Bring me some more bitches tonight
Yeah, I bought a hunnid rounds
She asking for fifty, threw a hunnid thou
Where are all my bitches tonight?
Bring me some more bitches tonight, yeah
