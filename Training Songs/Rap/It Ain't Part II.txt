I got a problem how you do that there
It's been thirteen years and ain't went nowhere
Still, one of the coldest ever done this shit
And ain't no motherfucking question know who run this bitch
I got my nigga Erick Sermon gon' supply the beat
And I'll be in the vocal booth, supplyin' the heat
I spit the game, for the street, these blocks and thugs
With a pistol grip shotgun, boxing glove
And it's a thin red line between what was and ain't
Got a $50 sack, plus I love to drink
I'll be a southside nigga 'til it's said and done
And I was always taught to take the bread and run
Here it is, the motherfucking moment of truth
I came in one deep now what you hoes wanna do

All these Rolex watches
It ain't shit to me
And the Cristal poppin'
It ain't shit to me
Bitches out boppin'
Ain't shit to me
It ain't shit to me, ain't shit to me

Man, hold up, I got too much beat in my truck
I silence niggas like gag orders
You a motherfucking powder puff I just add water
I blow you punk bitches out the frame
And I'ma make you hoes remember my name
I'm the J-E-S-S-E J-A-M-E-S
I'm shuttin' niggas down, H-Town is mine I bet you know now
So hush with the talk, talk
Claimin' you gon' put it on the map
Well I done already done that
So follow in the footsteps of the gangsta shit's finest
Since 1987, Mr. Scarface
Gosh, I'ma stop you at the moment of truth
The last man standin', now what you wanna do

So you got tight flows
It ain't shit to me
Money, hoes
It ain't shit to me
Brand new clothes
It ain't shit to me
Yeah right, see this Ro
It ain't shit to me
Finna get a record deal
It ain't shit to me
Build a house on the hill
It ain't shit to me
Brand new Benz, big wheels
It ain't shit to me, ain't shit to me, it ain't shit to me

Now the moral of this story here is simple and plain
Next time you mention southern rap remember the name
All you magazine niggas gettin' caught up in the new shit
Just remember what the truth is
My mind playin' tricks on me, Scarface is back
Diary of a man made, nigga come and ask
The wall, the dead, lettin' niggas know I ain't a prankster
Damn it feels good to be a gangster
Smile for me now, I see the man died today, my fuel
I'm still up in this bitch, what they wanna do

Ay, ay
It ain't shit to me
All that talk it ain't shit to me
Big money ain't shit to me
It ain't shit to me
Publishing
Ain't shit to me
Management deals ain't shit to me
Money, cars, jewelry
Ain't shit to me, ain't shit to me
