Lately every morning when I wake
Tired of lookin' at this lazy face
Sleepin' in the bed that I paid for
Used to have a job but he don't no more
Said that he got big plans for me
Can I move in till I get on my feet
But it's been a year and 3 months passed
Gotta show me somethin' 
'cause I don't want to give up on you, man

I don't want to give up now (no no no no)
I don't want to throw the towel (no)
I don't want to waste all of this time 
That we've been together now (together now)
I don't want to turn my back on you (my back on you)
Don't want to do what my girls say do (what my girls say do)
I don't want to
I don't want to (I don't wanna)
I don't want to (no)

Work all day then when I get home
I want to spend some time with my man alone
DVD or some BET
Dinner for two, just you and me
Honey's at the gym playing basketball
Cellphone rings now he's at the mall
Shoppin' is a must when the bills are paid
So I don't need to tell you baby just hear me when I say

I don't want to give up now (oh no I don't)
I don't want to throw the towel (man I don't)
I don't want to waste all of this time (this time) 
That we've been together now (together now
I don't want to turn my back on you (on you)
Don't want to do what my girls say do 
(don't want to do, don't want to do)
I don't want to (oh oh)
I don't want to (no)
I don't want to

Now baby you know that I love you 
More than anything (you know I do baby)
And yes I know that in your heart 
You love me just the same
And together we can do better 
Just like we talked about (yes we talked about it)
But you need to keep the words that you said
Or I can do just as good by myself

I don't want to give up now (don't' want to give up on you)
I don't want to throw the towel (all I want is you)
I don't want to waste all of this time 
That we've been together now (ain't nobody else for me)
I don't want to turn my back on you (oh no)
Don't want to do what my girls say do 
(they don't know what we've been through baby)
I don't want to
I don't want to 
I don't want to 
(I ain't gon' give up on you)

I don't want to give up now 
(oh no no no)
I don't want to throw the towel 
(don't want to give up on you baby)
I don't want to waste all of this time 
(don't want to waste)
That we've been together now 
(so many good good times)
I don't want to turn my back on you 
(always been together baby)
Don't want to do what my girls say do 
(always stay together baby)
I don't want to
I don't want to 
(and I want to stay together baby)
I don't want to
