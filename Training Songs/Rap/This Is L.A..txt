[Verse 1]
It's time to amount an enormous amount of muscle
Move in like 5th batalian while woofers gonna bring trouble
Que quieres a mia moving to make me a little somethin'
Won't catch me chasin' the dragon adrenelin got me pumpin'
Stop take a breath collect my thoughts
Release defenses and check senses
Pull jacks in dope spots
Puff boom muthafucka I swirve and hit the center
Hit it silver star style while others afraid to enter
Bravery in the battle homes I ain't no doubt
We stand alone usually we left the third click out
That's why we moved on cause mental spirits was gettin' broken
By some leech muthafuckas best kill em because we chokin'
Send a heat seeker to take a section of the industry
Not paranoia you really think they feelin' me?
I cut their finger from hand and cut their hand from wrist shit
Light another joint time to get lit

[Chorus 8X]
It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans

[Verse 2]
Now everybody checkin' the lingo you know I bringo
(Strong arm tactics) represento fresco raw through the weso
why digo trucha con tususia cuando entro con el latin lingo
Collecting masa across the map like Desperado steelo
Now you can bust and I can bust but
Who got that gold in they clutch?
And I'm tremendo cuando prendo lenos down to the crutch
So if we hittin' la botella then let's gulp it all down
And if we hittin' yerba buena then let's smoke the whole pound
The LowerEast is back up in this muthakilla for realla
Los Delinquentes rifan todo Sur Califa I figure
My DNA is everlasting

[Chorus 8X]
