Pull up, back home, flag on, tats out, what the f*ck is that 'bout?
I'm home-bred, hometown, been around the world, I'm back now
I'm Mr. Miyagi with wax in the sake
And I'm running the streets to the city like Rocky
Who da champ? Who da champ?
Diamond fangs like a vamp
Where's the package with the stamp?
Bust it open by the Lamb
Roll it up 'till I cramp
Uh, four rings on my hands, uh
Smoke rings from the grams, uh
