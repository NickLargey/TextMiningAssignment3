A revolution never come with a warning
A revolution never sends you an omen
A revolution just arrived like the morning
Ring the alarm, we come to wake up the snoring

They tellin' you to never worry about the future
They tellin' you to never worry about the torture
They tellin you that you'll never see the horror
Spend it all today and we will bill you tomorrow
Three piece suits and bank accounts in Bahamas
Wall street crime will never send you to the slammer
Tell all the children in the arms of their mommas
The f-15 is a homicide bomber
TV commercials for a popping pill culture
Drug companies circling like a vulture
An Iraqi babies with a G.I. Joe father
Ten years from now is anybody gonna bother

Yell fire, yo, yo, yo
Here we come, here we come
Yell fire, yo, yo, yo
Revolution a comin'
Yell fire, yo, yo, yo
Put em up, put em up
Yell fire, yo, yo, yo
A revolution never come with a warning
A revolution never sends you an omen
A revolution

Everyone addicted to the same nicotine
Everyone addicted to the same gasoline
Everyone addicted to a technicolor scream
Everybody trying to get their hands on same green
From the banks of the river to the banks of the greedy
All of the riches taken back by needy
We come from the country and we come from the city
You play us on the record, you can play us on the cd
All the shit you given us is fertilizer
The seeds that we planted you can brutalize them
Tell the corporation you can never globalize you
Like peter tosh said "legalize it"
Girls and boys hear the bass and treble
Rumble in the speakers and it make you wanna rebel
Throw your hands up, take it to another level
And you can never, ever, ever make a deal with the devil

Yell fire, yo, yo, yo, yo
Here we come, here we come
Fire, yo, yo, yo, yo
Revolution a comin'
Fire, yo, yo, yo, yo
Put em up, put em up
Yell fire, yo, yo, yo

Throw your hands up
Put em up, put em up
Throw your hands up
Put em up, put em up
Throw your hands up

A revolution never come with a warning
A revolution never sends you an omen
A revolution never come with a warning

Yell fire, yo, yo, yo, yo
Here we come, here we come
Fire, yo, yo, yo, yo
Revolution a comin'
Fire, yo, yo, yo, yo
Put em up, put em up
Yell fire, yo, yo, yo
Throw your hands up

A revolution never come with a warning
A revolution never sends you an omen
A revolution just arrived like the morning
Ring the alarm, we come to wake up the snoring

Fire, yo, yo, yo, fire
Here we come here we come
A revolution here it come
Put em up, put em up
