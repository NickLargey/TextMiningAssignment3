Once upon a time
We swore not to say goodbye
Something got a hold of us
And we changed
And you sat alone in pride
And I sat at home and cried
How'd our fairy tale just end up this way?

We went round for round
Til' we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring
Not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you
Break you down so low there's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you, ooh

This was all a phenomenon that no one could explain
And I wish I could press reset and feel that feeling again
I sit and press rewind
And watch us every night
Want to pause it but I can't make it stay

We went 'round for 'round
'Til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring
Not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you
Break you down so low there's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you, ooh

No need to call my phone
'Cause I changed my number today
And matter fact I think I'm moving away (away)
Sorry the frustrations got me feelin' a way
And I just keep having one last thing to say
And I just want to hold you, touch you, feel you
Be near you, I miss you babe babe babe (babe babe babe)
I am tired of tryin' to fake through
But there is nothing I can do
Boy I can't wait to hate you

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you
Break you down so low that there's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you baby ooh

I can't wait to hate you
But right now I need you
I can't wait to hate you
I can't wait to hate you
But right now I need you
