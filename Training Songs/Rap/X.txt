[Ja Rule]
See man, let's get
Pop in love
I know you popular
Admitted the club
But I just want to toss you up
Before I
Swallow you whole
I need to wash it down
Tell your girls
Avion indulge you to hang out
Intoxicate me
Free your mind
Free my mind
Freak all night
It's evident
When two worlds collide
Your twice as hot
Wet through
The new extras
Get you by in life
High on life
I wonder what
Life would be like
If no more
Women were dykes
And trick hard at low prices
It's a cold, cold world (Yeah)
How do we relieve that stress (Ex)
You know
Pop them things
To get extra horny baby girl
You on one
You can't ignore me
Rule and Missy-E
How you love that
With I-G
It's Murder I-N-C, nigga

[Chorus: Tweet]
Hey (Hey boy)
Get me high tonight
Take me away (Take me)
Come inside my world
Come ecstasy (Ectasy)
Let me show you love
Between you and me
Let me love you boy

[Missy Elliot]
You want freak
I love a lot of excitement
I excite men
I make 'em dirty and trifling
I, been known to leave 'em frightening
Stifling all in love
By the end of the night
And I, want a big "Don John"
To pop a few woodies
And make the john last long
Ex, now you can serve that
Cause no doubt it's murder
Ya heard that

[Chorus]

[Ja-Rule]
Now that you got my feeling
High to Heaven, knows
Tight as the pussy holes
So, Lord knows
It stick to your ex-o
Them hoes
To freak shows

[Tweet]
You know how it goes
Coming out of my clothes

[Missy Elliot]
I'm coming outta my clothes
You better, dick me down
Then uh, turn me round
Then uh, lay me down
Cause uh, You got me high a kite (Ja-Rule)
Yo, I scream your name tonight

[Tweet: x2]
You got me high as a kite
Feel like doing something freaky tonight
When I think about you and me
Feels good when your sexing me

[Chorus]
