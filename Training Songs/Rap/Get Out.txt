So what's it gon' be? Women, whiskey, weed
(Dope, coke, or all the guns you need, nigga)
You could get them things for a lesser fee
(Yeah and with the right amount of pressure, them things look free)
I'm on my way now, desperate need of a lick indeed
(Believe I got a vick if it's a brick you need
My nigga for sheez
(Right back at you, holla after you land we get it before you leave)
Is you for sure? Them niggas out there still got cheese
Cause my niggas in the drop bounced back to slanging OZ's
(Man them niggas raping the town without breaking 'em down)
(Them bastards making a killing slanging half of buildings)
For real man, I'm on my last nine thousand
Ain't got no money, I'm fighting cases with this ho money

[Jay-Z]
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the f*ck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the f*ck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the f*ck out the house

I caught a northwest flight to NY, on the buddy pass
Sitting at the exit row, by the do'
(I got a hoopty from this doofy nigga around the way)
(I had the fo'fo' under the rug, weekend ago)
Three hours, I landed in the city of dreams
With tall buildings, flooded with cabs and limousines
Where the f*ck is Jay-Z
(God damn traffic is getting on my nerve)
(I see your face by the curb)
Goddamn dog I been sitting here thirty minutes
(You know these motherfucking cab drivers)
(Like they own this motherfucker)
Open the trunk
And then I'm thinking, Jigga let's get this motherfucking cash nigga
(Well if it's a money thing let's get this motherfucking money man)
And then I said to Jigga, let's get this motherfucking cash nigga
(I got a dope house scoped out)
An escape route?
(No doubt, let's hit the highway, load up, lock)
Let's do this shit
(Hold up, cops)
Tripping, it's eight million stories in this naked motherfucker
(Yeah, and ten million under covers)
(We goin' get this raw, we goin' kick in the door)
(They got guns in the couch, they got shit in the floor)
Niggas is gon' shit they drawers
(They got a bitch at the door)
Bullshit, heard that stupid shit before

[Jay-Z]
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the f*ck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the f*ck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the f*ck out the house

(I hit the buzzer, Mita, Manny)
(Let me up it's Joey motherfucker)
Taking the steps up with only one thing on our mind
Wipe this motherfucker clean, everybody gotta die
(Up the steps, got closer)
(The voices got louder, you hear it?)
(Death's approaching we coming for that powder)
Then I knocked four times, I hit the hoe wit clear polish
Well she couldn't see shit, now what's it gonna be bitch?
