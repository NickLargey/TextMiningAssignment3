Straight to the whole world

Scoe Montana
Scoeldie Montana, remember my name

[Hook: Mr. Kane]
I'm just a ballin ass niggaro, you best to get ready
Straight out the penitentary, to makin all this feddy
We gangsta rock steady, Bang this in ya Chevy
We pushin weight heavy, even if they won't let me

[Roscoe]
Scoe is chillin, makin a million
Stackin his loot till I touch top ceilin
Miraculous, toothless, but top notch women
Acura roofless blastin my music
Adelle on my right, He done got me for my life
I'm a star like Tri
Crazy youngster livin the Hard knock life like Jay the hustla
I'm a professional mic clutcha plus a dope rhymer
Ghetto potent, perfect timing I"m an opportunist
Takin advantage of my youth, fresh when I do it
The homie Kokane, tighter than choker chains
Soakin up the game with dreams of Roscoe's name being a houshold name
We ballin, ghetto fabulous, just trying to do my thang
In this dope game switchin four lanes

Scoe is chillin, lyrical villain
Straight up outta Philly, West Coast feel me
I pack Mac millies, Daz with Daz Dillies
Dippin through LA where it don't get chilly
I got a attic where I stash my scrilla
Keep a automatic mini heata by the attic
Homie my gat blast, speratic blast
(I'm) Young Scoedizzle, (I'm)keepin it rizzle
(With)Heaters that sizzle, Me an young bizzle
Hit the cypher up and stand in the middle
Puttin MC's in the Rap Hospital
Hospitable, Roscizzo my flizzo not spitable
My dizzo not get-able, anything digital
Un F-with-able, we incredible and that's inevitable

Scoe is gettin, in where I fit in
Splittin bad rubbers, keep it thuggin keep livin
Keep givin all I got, takin what I want
Breakin down the sacks, and crack open a blunt
Crack the window to get some fresh oxygen
This little Porche we hot boxin in
I'm a G to the fame low key in the game
I got the key to the game DPG is the gang
