Runnin', runnin'
Lookin' for that love I once knew
Runnin', I'm runnin'
Trying to find my way back to you

I've been runnin' since understandin' confiscated my globe
Stuttering since expression stole the key to my soul
Struggling since victory presumed control
Battling since the truth infiltrated my mould
Seeking to find a life in invisible hold
Traveling down the path of a difficult road
Runnin' without a clue of being laid astray
Swearing I'm getting closer but really further away

Runnin', runnin'
Lookin' for that love I once knew
Runnin', I'm runnin'
Trying to find my way back to you

Don't you sometimes sit back and look at yourself
Examine things in life you hate but you've become get sick of yourself
The very images you claim lack worth
Then with uncontrolled labor pains them very images you gave birth
This topic got me ceiling walkin', I'm so beside myself
I'm lookin' at me like I'm someone else and I don't feel I'm talkin'
I'm tryin' to spit it best I can atcha
We gonna grab your attention grabbers that keep you from runnin'

Runnin', lookin' for you
Said I'm runnin'
Runnin', lookin' for you
Said I'm runnin'

In desolate times I wrestle at times
Feeling so neglected at times rejected at times
Hard to try to get out my mind hold to the soul
Believing that it's gonna be fine, he's in control
Letting go the walk in the know forgetting the how
Strong enough to wait for the when to weaken the now
Put aside the question of why, this is allowed
Running to the back of the line, looking for mine, looking for mine

Runnin', runnin'
Lookin' for that love I once knew
Runnin', I'm runnin'
Trying to find my way back to you

If dead men tell no tales, how do you account
For the platinum rappers with millions of record sales
Then tell me I ain't good 'cause my record fails
With a standard that's set to first-quarter sales, the truth shall prevail
If I let you dictate it life would be stale
But I follow my Lord who's been proven with the scars and nails
Everybody busy funnin' number one stunnin', what else you get
From yo mama, nothin' but heartache from all the runnin'

Runnin', my desire's lead me right to
The very thing that has me runnin' back to you
Runnin', runnin'
Runnin', my desires lead me right to
The very thing that has me runnin' back to you
Runnin', runnin'

Runnin', lookin' for you
Said I'm runnin'
Runnin', lookin' for you
Said I'm runnin'
Trying to find my way back to you

Runnin', runnin'
Lookin' for that love I once knew
Runnin', I'm runnin'
Trying to find my way back to you
