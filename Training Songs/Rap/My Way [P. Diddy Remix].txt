Yes yes y'all
To the beat y'all
Rock rock y'all
And we don't stop

Special
You think you're special
You do, I can see it in your eyes

I can see it when you laugh at me
Look down on me
And walk around on me

Just one more fight about your leadership
And I will straight up leave your shit
'Cause I've had enough of this and now I'm pissed

Yeah! This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way, or the highway

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way, or the highway

This the remix, this is the remix
Bad boy, Limp Bizkit
Let's go

Yes yes y'all
Rock rock y'all
To the beat y'all
And we won't stop

Yes yes y'all
Rock rock y'all
To the beat y'all
And we won't stop

Just one more fight about a lot of things
And I will give up everything
To be on my own again, free again

Yeah! This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way, or the highway

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way, or the highway

Some day you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know
No you never know
When you're gonna go

Some day you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know
No you never know
When you're gonna go

You never know
When you're gonna go
This is the remix
Remix

Yes yes y'all
Rock rock y'all
To the beat y'all
And we won't stop

Yes yes y'all
Rock rock y'all
To the beat y'all
And we won't stop

Just one more fight and I'll be history
Yes I will straight up leave your shit
And you'll be the one who's left missing me

Yeah! This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way, or the highway

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way, or the highway

My way, highway
My way, highway
My way, highway
My way, highway

Some day you'll see things my way
It's my way
My way, or the highway

My way, highway
My way, highway
My way, highway

Some day you'll see things my way
It's my way
My way, or the highway

My way, highway
My way, highway
My way, highway
