You need to go
Don't look so surprised (You better sing girl, sing, sing, sing)
'Cause we had love
That will be immortalized
Say you need me now
So alone without me now
But our little romance is through
Because basically boy, you
You just don't know what to do oh

I can give it to you, but what you gonna do
With it, if I hit it? I bet you stuck stupid
Sucking your teeth, don't f*ck up my mood
I'm trying to give it all to you
I can understand it's things we go through
Put C's on your bag, let see this here through
And we can be a size receipts from Nobul
But I gotta get it out of you
She said "'Le throw a ring on it!"
She don't love you unless she put your whole name on it
Gettin' money, yea this age is hard
Not the datin', I act a way
When all the pretty bitches love you but you'll stay precious

I miss you almost half as much as you miss me
You used to act so tough, bringing insecurity
Now that I found myself, your eggin' to be mine
Can't even help yourself from playing the fool each night

Ooh, how I loved you
Ooh, how I needed you
Ooh, boy I feel brand new
Ooh, since you turned me lose

Baby, you don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

'Cause you wanna leave
And you never go
I'ma set you free boy
Baby, you don't know

You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

You love me more than you love sunny summer days
And even more than you love floating in a haze
Boy when you lost my heart, you lost everything
Now all that you can do is listen to me sing

Ooh, how I loved you (how I loved you boy)
Ooh, how I needed you
Ooh, boy I feel brand new
Ooh, since you turned me lose boy

You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

She wanna leave (She said she wanna leave)
Then you never go (Then you never go)
I'm a set you free (I'm a set you free)
'Cause baby you don't know

You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

I can give it to you, but what you gon' do
Win it, if I hit it, I bet you stuck stupid
A model that I got, no class in this school
Take your bags and go boo
Never mind all of the flexin' I do
Balenciagas, got me two steppin' on a smooth
Never will I lower my standards my boo
I could show you we're attendants like Sampras on Que
That's kinda funny 'cause love still mean lose
Unless we kill the record and back-and-forth moves
Somehow you keep showing you act I see through it
Um, did you catch it? Ah screw it
All the girls need is respect and I do it
Never catch feelings 'cause Jet's is my fuel
Giuseppe my foot, my sweats be D'Honneur
Success is sweatin' me bet you ain't know her!

You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

You don't know what
You don't know what
You don't know what to do

She wanna leave (She said she wanna leave)
Then you never go (Then you never go)
I'm a set you free (I'm a set you free)
Baby you don't know

You don't know what you do to me
You don't know what you do to me
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know what you do to me
You don't know what you do to me
You don't know
You don't know
Said ou don't know
You don't know
