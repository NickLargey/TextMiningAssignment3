The Latin explosion ain't new to me
I've been into foreskin since puberty
I want an uncut Latino with a libido
The size of Reno, Nevada to bang me
'Til My bladder splatters
A dick fatter than a beer can
Lay down, stand
Or in the back of his van
He sports Tommy, Adidas
Fubu, Timberland
Pinky ring on his hand
His wish is my command
I'll suck his dick on the can
Or on the Puerto Rican sand
That's my man with the nice clean fade
And when he gets paid, I get paid
And when I get laid, I'm glad he stayed
'Cause there's nothin' like more than foreskin
I drop my chin so I can fit it all in
And then he eats my ass
Like he eats rice and beans
Until the plate's clean
You know what I mean?

Yes, I do, just the other day
I got a blowjob from a hoe job
With no job
Seen him at the bar
Battin' his eyelashes
Show me where your cash is
I'll show where my stash is
His ass is on my bed
The head board hit his head
'Til his head turned red
In and out was the motion
KY was the lotion
And that's the way it goes girl
When you f*ck until your toes curl
I rocked his world
With mad stamina
Hot like panama
Shot like an enema
I'm sending your ass back to the store to get some rubbers
So I change the covers

This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need

Well, it won't be long
Before he takes off my thong
(But it wasn't a thong until you put it on)
Shut the f*ck up
I'm the one getting laid here
He's back from the bodega
With a case of beer and a bag of weed
So I'm on my knees pulling out the seeds
He wants to squeeze my 34Bs
Until I can't breathe
Someone pass the poppers and a bottle of lube
Before he bangs me from the back
With his rough rider attitude the routine
We f*ck on the rug so the sheets stay clean
Damn, my man is heaven sent
He got me horny like the ex president
Just thinking of my man's big dick in my face
And then he cums in my face
And then runs out of the place
I don't care, he'll be back
'Cause he loves this ass
And when he's done his friends'll be over fast
You got a problem with me?
You should get your ass off of Avenue D.

See you like the type of guy that works at the pizza place
Sweat on his face mustache above his lips
Open shirt, gold chain and a crucifix
I like the type of guy that east vil style
Chill for a while if he's versatile
But the bottom direction give me his ass
And give me affection
Did I happen to mention?
(No, I don't think you did)
Well, I like to keep my man in the 718
'Cause I'm in the 212 and got things to do
(Like what?)
Like whatever, I wanna leave this
With no shame
Behind me
But all I see is his name on my caller ID
Which reminds me of the time we took three ecstasy
You know, one things leads to another
I see him on the weekends
(What about the weekdays?)
That's when I'm busy messin' with his brother

This is the kind of man that I want
