Got a nigga gone, got a got a nigga gone
Got a got a nigga gone off that Hennessey & Hydro
Got a nigga gone, got a got a nigga gone
Got a got a nigga gone off that Hennessey & Hydro

I'm droed out dead drunk and even off them ex pills
My foots alone could make ya groan and even give ya neck chills
I call Paul hit up Juice and now we on the Jazzy T
I got my heat in case they creep 'cause that's just how these niggaz be

I'm slow motion, slow ridin', lookin' for some slow head
You know 2-0 I'm east side what I rep until I'm dead
7 deuce Catalina all chrome and candy paint
And got my nerve to ask myself I wonder why these niggaz at

I'm so street I love the beef ain't no way I'm endin' it
So just in case it last long I bought me an extended clip
Three 6 my other click and DTP is who I love
I'm always hollerin' 'bout that Dec 'cause I'm in love wit where I'm from

So east side throw it up rep ya side and let 'em know
Got plenty shells that I can give and ain't afraid to let 'em go
Hennessey & Hydro got a nigga gone dog
My muthafuckin' lifestyle is more than just a song dog

Got a nigga gone, got a got a nigga gone
Got a got a nigga gone off that Hennessey & Hydro
Got a nigga gone, got a got a nigga gone
Got a got a nigga gone off that Hennessey & Hydro

Got a nigga gone, got a got a nigga gone
Got a got a nigga gone off that Hennessey & Hydro
Got a nigga gone got a got a nigga gone
Got a got a nigga, gone off that Hennessey & Hydro

I put the peddle to the metal then stop
Point it out the window boy a big ol plastic glock
Bullets richochetin' man flyin' through they car doe
Stoppin' in they bodies and explodin' 'cause they hollows

Ballin' off doin' about a dollar and I got ghost
They was in a Regal I was in a Monte Carlo
Pissin' on they CDs thought they really wanted beef
Now they back there bleedin' from they head to they stanky feet believe it

Playa pass me the green I'mma smoke it like a fiend
And I'm bout to pour some purple syrup and sip up on some lean
But it's cool if you niggaz wanna take the weed and roll it
If you wanna buy the syrup and then pour it

Don't be stingy wit the shit because I'm so legit
Ain't the type to take the weed and then hold it
Juicy J the type to lick a blunt and fold it
You can come by my crib and get so lit

Got a nigga gone, got a got a nigga gone
Got a got a nigga gone off that Hennessey & Hydro
Got a nigga gone, got a got a nigga gone
Got a got a nigga gone off that Hennessey & Hydro

Got a nigga gone, got a got a nigga gone
Got a got a nigga gone off that Hennessey & Hydro
Got a nigga gone, got a got a nigga gone
Got a got a nigga gone off that Hennessey & Hydro
