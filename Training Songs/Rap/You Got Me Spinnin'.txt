I had my head on my shoulders.
I had my feet on the ground.
I had my spirit together yeah.
Until you came around ('til you came around)

So many reasons to doubt you
But I cast them aside (yeah)
I let my hear be the driver
And on the road lost my pride (yeah).

You got me spinnin' around and around
(You got me spinnin')
You got me spinnin' around and around (noooo, na, NA, NA, nooo, NA NA)
Can't get my feet to step on solid ground
You got me spinnin' around.

Even though I still love you (yes I do)
I can't ignore what's inside (ohhhh)
My soul says let it on go
And let this one pass you by
Ohhh you got me spinnin' spinnin'

Going in circles.
I'm spinnin' around and around so fast
But I love you
I still love you

Going down this road
This never ending path
Why do I love you
Why why do I love you

Been here before
Can't take no more
Now I got to go
Walk through that door

Can't keep my feet on solid ground
You got me spinnin' around.

You got me spinnin' around and around (You got me spinnin').
You got me spinnin' around (say it again now)
Can't get me feet to step on solid ground
You got me spinnin' around.

Why must you this thing to me
That you do
You got me spinnin'

You got me so confused
You got em so confused
You got to let me go
You got to set me free.
Oh leave me be 'cause I can't take it
I can't take it.
