There's a whole lot OF ones stacked up to make a nine
You know you ghetto when you thinkin' your a star 
When you waitin' in line at the back for drinks at the bar
You know you ghetto when you think your number one with the flow

And your shoutin' out yourself on the radio
You know you're ghetto when the Polo that you rock 
Says Fruit of the Loom on the label and on the top nigga
You know you're ghetto when your stuck inside the jail

Them Jordan's on your feet costin' more than your bail
You know you're ghetto when your goin' on a creep
And your girl gotta wait for her children to fall asleep
You know you're ghetto when you think you represent

But them niggas on your block ain't spendin' a red cent
And tryin' to buy your album (nigga hell no!)
If your dubbin this right now 'stead of buyin' the single you're ghetto
Ghettos what you are when you think you're a star

Flossin' on the street in a rental car
Ghettos what you are when you think that your nice but the opposite
Don't look twice you're G to that H to that E to that T-T-O
You're G to that H to that E to that T-T-O

You know you're ghetto when your boys push crack
And you buyin' crack from them so you can go smoke out back
You know you're ghetto when yo ma's parta yo crew
And your grandma's only 5 years older than you

You know you're ghetto when I don't know who you are
But nigga I know your name cause I can read it on your chain
You know you're ghetto when your singin' along 
And you can relate to the rhymes I'm spittin' in the song

You know you're ghetto when your best clothes is yo dress clothes
And your dress clothes is blue jeans and chine slippers na I mean?
You know you're ghetto when your askin' for some cigarettes
'Cause you can't afford hash and that weed mixed up in yo stash

You know you're ghetto when you're tryin' to get your flirt on 
And that cop blockin' niggas got the same damn shirt on
You know you're ghetto when you own two cars
And you need 10 for me to buy drinks at the bar

Ghettos what you are when you think that your fly 
And the home girl walks right by
Ghettos what you are when you think you got clout 
But your hair weave keeps fallin' out

You're G to that H to that E to that T-T-O
You're G to that H to that E to that T-T-O

You know you're ghetto when you bring home your boys
And ya mommas lookin' at yo crew like they're sex toys
You know you're ghetto when your brothers paid from juggling
And your driving his beamer talkin' bout nigga we strugglin

You know you're ghetto when your sittin' down in class
And a cockroach crawls outta ya book bag
You know you're ghetto when you try 
To sound like Lil Kim and you end up soundin' like Foxy

Oh wait a minutes that's the same thing!
You know you're ghetto when rappins part of ya dream
But you can't stay out past 1 because ya mom runs ya street team
You know you're ghetto when your savin' to buy your key

But ya grandpoppas still on the street pushin' that weed
You know you're ghetto when you know your not Jamaican
But your clothes say Tommy 'Ilfiger nigga you fakin
You know you're ghetto when your like every other brother

Rappin' loud walkin' down the street tryin' to be the struggle
Ghettos what you are when you think you're a star
Flossin' on the street in a rental car
Ghettos what you are when you think that your nice but the opposite

You're G to that H to that E to that T-T-O
You're G to that H to that E to that T-T-O
You're ghetto!
