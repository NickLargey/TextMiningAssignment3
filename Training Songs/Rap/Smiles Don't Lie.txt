I've been sitting all day
Sitting here thinking bout you
That's what I do, yeah
I been sitting all day
Sitting here thinking everything about you
That's what I do

I told her she got a pretty face
I can tell the smile doesn't lie
She called me chickee-babe, nickname me idiot, I don't really give a shit
Though I love her any way, I find
There is beauty in the little things
Lying in bed she just sighs and says "You act a fool and you ain't that cool
And I know it's irrational but I'm gonna love you anyway"
Sometimes we just sit around, don’t say much, and I know that she’s got my back
She got no hang-ups, she holds faith in us, I come by real late, she don’t wait up (nah)
She don’t make a fuss, she knows that
Won’t make trust when we both wake up I feel my hands on my bare chest, bare flesh, when we make soul mate lovin'
I ain't just trying to write a love song, I ain't just trying to get my f*ck on
Let me describe this where I come from
Let me speak on something like
Sunshine on the window pane
Feeling like every things okay
Sing a lullaby, my oh my
I can tell a smile don't lie when it's on her face

I've been sitting all day
Sitting here thinking bout you
Thats what I do
I been sitting all day
Sitting here thinking everything bout you
Thats what I do

I love you

Sometimes the words I use can only go so far
That ain’t right, that ain’t fair
Sometimes the words I use don’t mean nothing at all
That ain’t right, that ain’t fair

I know its been a minute now
Since I been around
Yeah I probably should of had it figured out
But I don't know, doze got me feeling like a clown
I'm a joke, so broke
But you don't care about the finer things, thats fine with me
'Cause I ain't got no diamond ring
She is conversational, elation, some wine to drink, listening to Q-tip, your my vibrant thing
I got a life to give you, I'm a simple man
You been down since before we were in demand
Plus she keep it on the humble, and I'm in to tight
No selflies posted on her instagram
I'm down to make a dick of my self to see you smile, girl you pretty as hell
Yeah I chucked a few pennies down a wishing well and if you ever did leave, then I wish you well
I ain't just trying to write a love song, I ain't just trying to get my f*ck on
Let me describe this where I come from
Let me speak on something like
And your on my mind, 24/7, 365
The reason that I can't sleep at night
Hypnotised but the way you smile

I've been sitting all day
Sitting here thinking bout you
Thats what I do
I been sitting all day
Sitting here thinking everything bout you
Thats what I do

Sitting all day
Sitting here thinking bout you
That's what I do
I been sitting all day
Sitting here thinking everything bout you
Thats what I do

Sometimes the words I use can only go so far
That ain’t right, that ain’t fair
Sometimes the words I use don’t mean nothing at all

I love you babe
