Konvict, Zion, baby

I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

She's like Shakira belly dancing on the Grammy Awards
Like Beyonce clapping hard for them the MTV show
She's so amazing, she drives me crazy

Baila, baila, mamita que te quiero ver
Rompiendo la pista abusadora
Eres bien tentadora, de todas la mas seductora

Baila, baila, mamita que te quiero ver
Rompiendo la pista abusadora
Eres bien tentadora, de todas la mas seductora

I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

For me, is so tempting that I can't deny
For us to be together side by side
La noche esta buena para experimentar
Just me and you together, sin parar

Excuse me, Zion, don't mean to interrupt but she's fire
Way her body jiggling all in her attire
Dropping it down low while she bring it up higher
While we sing it now

I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

Shorty so sexy, I wanna take you to my crib
Excuse me, Kon, let me help you out, she don't speak no English
Ella se ve de lo mas de bien quiero sacarte de aqui
Por si no lo sabias esta noche, you're gonna end up with me

Then I can just ride you, you know slip and slide you
Flip you over good lovin' is what I can provide you
If you don't want it, then walk away 'cause it's your right to
But I wanna show you to the world, never hide you

'Cause you're the most beautifulest thing that I ever seen
And you got the potential to blow me up like gasoline
Girl, I'm trying to be patient, trying to be a gentleman
Can you see what you're doing to me?

I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
