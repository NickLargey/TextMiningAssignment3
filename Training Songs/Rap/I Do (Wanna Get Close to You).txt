Rode up in the club like what
I got the VIP on lock down
Then I saw you starin' at me
The way we started to the back

You make me think that you're the one
Lickin' your lips at me for fun
While the DJ's makin' 'em sweat
Won't you come step to me

If you wanna get down, baby, I do
Holler at me, baby, uh-huh
If you're rollin' deep tonight
Then I do wanna know you

But if you wanna get down, baby, it's cool
Holler at me, baby, uh-huh
If your love is ridiculous
Then I do wanna get close to you

Your ice, your gear, your sex appeal
Your game so tight, you got me feenin'
Wantin' you alone with me
Is the illest fantasy

You make me feel like wylin' out
Showin' you what it's about, yeah
Got it goin' on uptown
Now let me see you work it out on me

If you wanna get down, baby (I do), I do
Holler at me (Baby), baby, uh-huh
If you're rollin' deep tonight (Rollin' deep)
Then I do wanna know you (I want you)

If you wanna get down, baby, it's cool
Holler at me, baby (Holler at me, baby), uh-huh
If your love is ridiculous
Then I do wanna get close to you (Whoa, baby)

I'm sure you had me to get her, baby
Baby, how can I just make you see
I'm the only one you need
So please let me know right now
'Cause it's true ('Cause it's true), I want you (I want you)
Say that you want me too

Come on, yeah
Ladies and gentlemen
I know I could make you scream like a woman' supposed
to
Seems like you wanna get closer
Well, Boo here's the ticket, come through, we could
kick it
One hun' twenty, five foot two ??, my view with the
sickest
It's true, been convicted, I'm probably needin' a girl
In other words, ma, I'm due for some kisses, I'm due
for some huggin'
And all them dudes that be buggin', I ain't with it
I'm through the thuggin', I'm due for some lovin'
I need a wife in my life and ma, you're lookin' like
you're due for a husband
I choose not to love 'em
These chicks runnin' around actin' like straight fools
in the public
Let's move with the subject because I came with a
better plot
Just play the game and you'll never flop
It's in your brain, you already hot
But you ain't close to my face, so you better stop

Wanna get down, baby (Wanna get down), I do
Holler at me, baby, uh-huh
If you're rollin' deep tonight (Deep tonight)
Then I do wanna know you (Whoa...ho...)

If you wanna get down, baby, it's cool (It's cool)
Holler at me, baby (Oh...), uh-huh
If your love is ridiculous
Then I do wanna get close to you

Wanna get down, baby, I do
Holler at me, baby, Uh-huh
If you're rollin' deep tonight
Then I do Wanna know you

If you wanna get down, baby, it's cool
Holler at me, baby
If your love is ridiculous
Then I do wanna get close to you

That's cool, don't stop
Ah-hah

Uh-huh, uh-huh
