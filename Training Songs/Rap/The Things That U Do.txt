(Intro/Chorus) 

It's just the things that you do (5x) 
The way you do the things you do 

(Verse 1) 

Ain't yo' fault the alarm clock sound 
I grab my shoe and turn the damn thing down 
But now it's 9 o'clock and I still ain't up up yet 
Work on time  yeah I admire the concept 
You got me journin' and I mean anticipating 
Seeing you I can't wait and so not concentrate 
My mind is blind of all the times thinking of you 
And the way you do things you do 

(Chorus) 

(Verse 2) 

I walk in the park for a midnight rynic 
For a slow dance, romance, my (?) of see through 
I want to be with you 
But I ain't hiding 
A wave of love and I'm gliding and ridening 
Things like that when you hear me 
Sayin' sort of sounds like that same old clich√© 
Climbing the highest mountain and swimming the deepest sea 
But I can't front, I want you to be want me 
Cause baby when you grab me tightly 
You send chills and tend to insight me 
When you ?coress? and fumble me lightly 
Oh girl watch up cause she might be 
Settin' yourself up the way that you tease me 
Sooner or later you might have to please me 
It's just something about you 
The way you do things you do 

(Chorus) 

(Verse 3) 

Now why oh why would an incredibly fly guy like me 
Be chasing one lady 
It's just something about you 
The way you carry yourself when you're out to 
Seein' how I sort of captifying style, I've parked the feelin' 
But your whippers are peeling 
Since this is a subject that I brought up 
I just mind as well admit that I'm caught up 
It ain't the clothes that you're wearin' 
Your perfume or the sytle that that your hair's in 
It ain't your body, how slim your waist is 
Your new jeans and how pretty your face is 
But I feel funny when it close pack sillity 
Make it wonder what's gettin' in to me 
It's just something about you 
The way you do the things you do 

(Chorus) 

(Bridge) 

It's nothing that you do (2x) 
The way you do the things you do 

(Verse 4) 

The mystery is some this world ?panda? 
Just sittin' back let my mind wonda 
Whatta, whadda, whodda, whada hell is this young lady 
Drivin so crazy 
Reply in thought pose like the thinker 
I play you with kiss or a winka 
Or a smile just to show you 
It's something about you 
The way you do the things you do 

Come here, come here 
Come on out, don't worry 
You want me to chase you don't you? 
Just come here, I've got you now 
Sss 

The way you do the things you 

(Chorus) 
It's just the things that you do 
(the way you do the things you do) (10x) 

(Bridge) 

The way (repeated several times)
