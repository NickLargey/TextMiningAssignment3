Yeah come see this nigga 
Come see this ol' light-skinned motherfucker
I seen him and I'm addicted 
He serving a piece of the click 
Please tell dis fake ass niggas who you are 

[Ludacris] 
I be that nigga named Luda'
Alert Alert it's the ATLlien intruder
College Park waterboy, spitting in ya cooler 
I jam till they deaf, they call me Slick Dick Da Ruler 
Women indeed, keep ya eyes closed 
Bowl closed, come out them clothes hoe 
Low pros, low bows, watch out for the po-po 
And I chose, to be that number one contender, Southern offender
Fucking up ya whole Agenda 
When I walk you try to run 
When I run you try to hide 
You skated the snap of my finger 
Call me Golden Gley 
It's you and I, Do or Die, who am I? 
I got a pocket full of family stones, cats think I'm sly 
Why try, you one of them niggas that like to cheat death 
And I'm one of them niggas that rip up Excursions 
Til there is no seats left 
You shit out weed checks and fart out deep breaths 
While we talk dirt till the bottom of ya'll v-necks

Who, that nigga Chris? 
Oh that nigga is alright 
That nigga can't f*ck wit me thou 
Let me get on the mic 
Nigga, who the f*ck called you nigga 

[Ludacris] 
I be dat nigga bronze Bridges
Players want to ball or go on strike cause of my pitches
They think I want they bitches 
But I don't want no pigeons 
Yet pigeons can scrub my dishes 
And ya'll don't want no scrubs till ya'll pull out ya'll extensions 
Ya'll in school detention that'll neva come out 
Man I'll catch yo achilles tendon and put a sock in yo mouth 
Cause we da shit in the South, they know what I'm talkin bout 
You see we Jack and we Daniels, y'all Earl and Ralph 
For I swerl it out, lick it dry and tend it to flames 
Not even Joshua can come to +War+ wit dis +Games+
These bitch niggaz is lame and come down wit da reigns 
You all wet behind da ears but its a drought in ya brain 
And dats tha simple and plain man 
Three W Dot Shhhh

-Hold on man 
Hold on lil buddy 
Ya'll talkin bout shorty man 
Shorty up at da radio station? 
Shorty be poppin man? 
Let the name be known 
Who ya'll talkin bout 

[Ludacris] 
I be that nigga that love a lover 
I'm asking if you think bout yo parents sex each other 
No glove, no love, better tell yo dick to run for cover 
So when lightening strikes, you can be safe from a few rubbers 
If you know what I mean 
Not everybody is Mr and Mrs. Clean 
Some get burnt like Freddie Kruger, sweat dreams 
Girls backing they ass up now they 400 degrees Ha 
Hot girl, trying to give to niggaz up on the block girl 
Have you screaming "STOP GIRL" 
I rock worlds with my 9 inch Louisville slugger 
Still wonder why they call me lova lova 
Self Explainatruim 
Ass Valedictorian 
I bring 'em back to the future like a '85 Delorium 
The Luda drug emporium 
On the counter prescription 
You like my diction 
And my Doctor nurse convention 
I put the stethoscope quite close to yo tittie 
Have yo butt checks Red-man like Uncle Quilly
