There's too many phony MC's out there this year 
It's best to beware 
I've burnt thousands already 
So get ready  lyrics are deadly 
There's too many phony MC's out there this year 
It's best to beware 
I've burnt thousands already 
So get ready  lyrics are deadly 
Too frontin  ain't saying nuthin 
Killah Priest remains calm and carry on 
So heads sing your song 
Claim that your dons  rap   stars look cute with your cigars 
It's like that, where your mics at, bite me I bite back 
Plus I break backs, you can sue me, yours truly 
Say I'm phony, there's too many rappers in the east want to be gangsters 
Too many gangsters in the west want to be rappers 
Bunch of actors, I aught to smack them, who's your master 
Sit down take a lesson, stop guessin', begin to have grace 
Show your mad face, and only show bad taste 
Runnin around like your delirious 
Foamin from the mouth like you're furious 
I'd rather be serious, keep the audience curious 
Beats fetch emcees loving for your fantasys, it might cause casualties 
I'd be with ? your neighborhood, and if it is 
Give the mic to ?wood 
And ya'll can be all to be the wizard 
The wonderful wizard of are, which are, the A & are's 
And you ? doing promo, along with the scarecrow 
You receive no dough 
There's too many phony MC's out there this year 
It's best to be aware 
I've burnt thousands already 
So get ready, my lyrics are deadly 
There's too many phony MC's out there this year 
It's best to beware 
I've burnt thousands already 
So get ready, my lyrics are deadly 
I lay in the cut, like a rock star 
Looking at ya ca ca, 'cause your music sound ? 
They sound tongue tied, butch of young guys 
Have um' hung high, watch his lungs fry 
From the sunshine, which is one rhyme 
Generating from the mind 
Killah Priest now late, I terminate 
Burn and break, and intimidate 
I come cold as blue winter break 
I put it in to snakes, pretenders and fakes 
Shake, like the earthquakes, I judge wisely 
Between two pillars of poison ivy 
Those that despise me, attach in to the eyes be 
And pops should've bust you on the couch 
And sit you down a mount, next time where a condom 
When I step upon them, I make emcees memories 
Whenever there's a synphony, I look sinfully 
Been doing this for centuries 
I write ? like Shakespear tripping off an asprin 
Rolling you like John The Baptist 
With the rusty hatchet 
I preach to murder talk before I murder y'all 
Swear I never heard of y'all 
There's too many phony MC's out there this year 
It's best to be aware 
I've burnt thousands already 
So get ready, my lyrics are deadly 
There's too many phony MC's out there this year 
It's best to beware 
I've burnt thousands already 
So get ready, my lyrics are deadly
