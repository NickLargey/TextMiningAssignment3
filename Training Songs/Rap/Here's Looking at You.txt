Who's that peepin' in my window
Uh-uh
Oh
Oh
Yo', baby doll

I'm not tryin' to sweat you
But lately
It seems like you haven't been givin' me 100%
Now you're gonna have to tell me somethin'
Is there someone else in the picture
Or am I still the only one
Ah, yeah

I've been trying to describe the things I feel about you
What it is that's got me dreaming, all night creaming 'bout your love
Must be your kisses or maybe it's your smile
Or maybe it's the way you whisper sweet, sweet nothings

Tell me what's your secret, have you always been this way
So sexy, so sensationally sexy
Hey, I've been around the world from Casablanca to New York
But in my travels, baby, there's been none that can touch your love

Here's looking at you
Here's to everything you do to me
Here's looking, here's looking at you, baby
I raise my glass and toast your love to ecstasy, ecstasy, hey

I've been trying to pretend it's really not that heavy
Maybe I'm not really floating, sugar, jonesing on your love
Must be my body or maybe it's my mind
Or maybe it's the way you whisper tender, so tender

Tell me what's your secret, have you always been this way
So enticing, so enchanting, so inviting
Hey, I've been around the world from Madagascar to L.A.
But in my travels, baby, there's been none that can touch your love, no

Here's looking at you
Here's to everything you do to me
Here's looking, here's looking at you, baby
I raise my glass and toast your love to ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy

Swee dwee a dwee dwee di ooh dwee doo sha doo dee doo da
Everybody get up, Here's to you
Swee dwee a dwee dwee di ooh dwee doo sha doo dee doo da
Must be your body, baby, ooh-wee, hey
It must be your eyes
Must be your body, baby, ooh-wee, hey
It must be your thighs
Must be your body, baby, ooh-wee, hey
It must be your walk
Must be your body, baby, ooh-wee
Talk that sexy talk
Must be you're freakin' me all in my face
You're pumpin' it high, you're pumpin' it low
That treble, the mid range, the bottom and mo'

I tell you specific your love is terrific
I'm shakin', I'm achin, that point that I'm makin'
Is should old acquaintance be forgotten
I'm lookin' at you, kid, your body
Ooh, baby, ooh, ooh, baby
