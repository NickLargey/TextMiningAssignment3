But how you goin' tell me how to dance yo
No you didn't
Check it out
Pajam
See you don't know what I've been through player
No
So you can either join in or move on out of my way
Cause I gotta get mine
You gotta get yours
And here I go

Been working hard all week
With everything blowing at me
I need to get some peace
So I go down on my knees
So would you feel my cross and lift my spirit up
And how he always does as a token of his love yeah

When it seems my world is blowing up
I remember he's still the master (when it feels like)
When I feel I'd rather not wake up
I remember he's still the father (just keep a)
I just keep a praise upon my lips
Oh lord I thank you (thank you) I love you (love you) adore you (adore you)
Hallelujah

[Chorus]
You can't tell me how I feel (yeah)
Don't try to judge on how I don't
How I praise is how I praise
Don't try to tell me how to shout
(Don't try to tell me how to shout no)
I can praise him in a dance (oh)
I can praise him in a song
Every chance I get to praise
I'm gonna turn it turn it out

I have a right to praise
As much as anyone living today
I'm gonna celebrate
You better move on out my way
He's given life to me
And that more abundantly
I must respectfully
Show him what he means oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

When it seems my world is blowing up
I remember he's still the master
When I feel I'd rather not wake up
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I remember he's still the father
(just keep a) I just keep a praise upon my lips
(Oh yeah)
Oh lord I thank you (thank you) I love you (love you) adore you (adore you)
Hallelujah

[Chorus]

(Sometimes) sometimes I'm just glad (glad) that I made it through the day
(Whoa sometimes yeah)
Sometimes I wanna thank him for the blessing yesterday
(Whoa sometimes yeah)
Sometimes I just thank him 'cause I can (i can) can
Now I bless the lord at all times
And praise him from this mouth of mine

You feeling like you wanna
Well get your praise on
Baby don't front
Uh you got your mind on lock
So keep your focus person don't you stop
Your life ain't nobody trying to live it
Talking about the smoke when the heat ain't with it
Ain't nobody coming with the water to try take the fire out
With the lord
So back off
It's time to jump

[Chorus: x3]
