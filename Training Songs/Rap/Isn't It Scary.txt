I know a place
Where we can get it on good, baby
As far away, baby
From the world and all the city lights
If you're not scared to get away
From the normal things
From the normal dreams
And you're not thinking 
About your man at home
Just me and you alone
Ain't it scary, baby

Chorus:
Isn't it scary
How you1re here with me 
And not with your man at home
Isn't it scary
How you1re here with me
An not with your man at home
Me and you alone

And baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you see this love runs deep in me 
Pretty lady, oh girl
I feel to good to feel guilty
I'm sorry for nothing
Except that I'm not with you for good
And if I could, if I could, yeah
I'd make you mine, oh mine
Now aren't you scared
(Chorus)
