I'm rolling down a, lonely highway asking God 
To please forgive me for messing up the blessing 
He gave to me I see, 
Everything clearer now the nights as black as, black as its ever been 
With out my girl imma lose it and I pray that he just sheds his grace on me, I need, 
Just to be back with my baby 

[Chorus]
It feels like I've just walked right out of heaven,
It feels like I've damn near thrown my life away scared like a child that's lost at seven, 
Don't know what to do, to get back right wit chu,
It feels like I've just walked right out of heaven,
It feels like I've damn near thrown my life away, (hey yea yea) 
Like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do,
It feels like I just walked, right out of heaven

See my mama told me that's if its meant to be she'll come back 
And she'll forgive me and the best thing I can do it to just 
Let her, let her go I know, I don't want to do it 
But if I continue to push she'll just pull away 
And I know that in my heart its a reality 
I didn't treat her like she wanted 
To be treated, and I hope that she's not gone for good no no no 

[Chorus]

(Bridge 1) 
Hey girl waiting for you all the time, 
Supposed to move on with my life, and girl I tried, and I tried 
I feel like I can't walk, I feel like I can't talk girl I don't know 
What to do get back right wit chu I feel like I just walked outta heaven baby

If you ever loved somebody, and if you ever had somebody, 
But you know that you hurt that somebody, 
Let me hear you say yea 

[Chorus: until fade]
