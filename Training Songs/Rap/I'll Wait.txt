I'll wait by the window 
I'll wait by the door 
To make sure you don't come home after dark 
Now, I'll wait by the phone 

I'll make sure I'm at home 
I'll be there when you're needin' you know what 
Now, I can tell you, by things you do 
You don't know that I've been watching you 

Now, I don't understand your games or crazy plans 
I'm here for you baby, stop playing with my mind 
Well, I know what I feel inside 
I trust enough in what my heart tells me 

Haven't I been good the way I should 
Just act like a man and stay here and stand by my side 
I'll wait just a little more time 
Just a little more time 

To move in a new direction 
I'll wait just a little more time 
Till you make up your mind 
You know that you needed me too 

Why are you feelin' so scared and unwilling 
To be there, when someone's there for you 
Why time has to be so unkind for no reason 
But love has no measure, this is true 

Well, I know what I feel inside 
I trust enough in what my heart tells me 
Haven't I been good the way I should 
I'm willing, I'm able 

I need you to give me a sign 
I'll wait just a little more time 
Just a little more time 
To move in a new direction 

I'll wait just a little more time 
Till you make up your mind 
I know that you needed me too 
I'll wait, yes, I'll wait 

Just a little more time 
Baby, new directions 
I'll wait just a little more time 
Till you make up your mind 

I know that you needed me too 
Baby, haven't I been good to you 
The way that I said I would be 
Why are you leaving me now 

Well, I know what I feel inside 
I trust enough 
In what my heart's been telling me 
Haven't I been good the way I should 

I'm willing, I'm able 
I need you to give me a sign
