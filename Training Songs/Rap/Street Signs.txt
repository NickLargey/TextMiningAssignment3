Oye! Chico! Tirate! Que Tirate!
Oye! Chica! Tirate! Que Tirate!

This for the be	 boys in the place who be breaking rockin ecko
Pnb the nation now its on ready set go
Let it be said dude with the dred is from the west coast
Linoleum what? My homies kill it like asbestos
Yeah I'm bout the cleanest of the grimys
Hold the mic and with the same hand do 1990s
Peace to radiotron don't stop you know its real
Being normal like a bunt so I do stunts when I windmill
And if you pose, you a faker 
Peace to rock steady and the LA City breakers
Replace electro lights with a shot of super socco
Nobody ever ticked like the homie poppin taco
Or my Uncle Pablo still pop on occasions
This is dedicated to the blacks, whites, and Asians
And my Latinos and my bambinos
Who refuse to be wack 
Spin on they back for a see-note
Come on!

Throw ya hands in the air
Come on people keep em there
Got a fam fresh crew and I?m now for mayor
Cause its more to this track then the kick and the snare
We been all around the world trying to take you there
So say yeah! 

Yeah today?s the day ain't it
Let your soul soar free above this world tainted
I dream a dream to some it seems faded
Where it don't even matter what color your skin's painted.
I windmilled in whales until I fainted
Before the record sales prevailed we was related
Like cousins and then the bling came
In the meantime we still grind for street fame
Like Chaka spray paint what I'm saying
When I was a baby I wrote graffiti with a crayon
My combos levitate like a s√©ance
See the street signs so I'm embracing the chaos
Come on!

Get your hands up!
Get some!
Put your feet down!
Get on the floor!

World wide party people get ready
Let the beat ride, time to rock steady
Black-white-yellow, yellow-red to brown
Let?s rock the planet
Everybody get down!
