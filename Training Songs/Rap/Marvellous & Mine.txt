The way you touch, you got a touch like gold
When we kiss and you hold me in that hold
We're full of fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
You're so good, you make me cry, fill me up

You fill me up like wine
I need to please you and hold you in my arms
And feel the fire, fire, fire, fire, fire

Ooh, when you're by my side
I feel my heart is open wide and brand new
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Everything's gonna be alright
'cause we have so much sun inside
So baby, it's no wonder
That there ain't any other for me like you

You are marvellous & mine
You're so much more than time
Baby, you fill me up so
You're marvellous & mine

Pull me in with the treasure in those eyes
With you there's no such thing as time
There's just fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
When we kiss all that I do is sigh

We embrace, and I feel like I could die
I want to hold you forever in my arms
And feel the fire, fire, fire, fire, fire

Ooh, when you're by my side
I feel my heart is open wide and brand new
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Everything's gonna be alright
Can we have so much sun inside?
So baby, it's no wonder
There ain't any other for me like you

You are marvellous & mine
You're so much more than time
Baby, you fill me up so
You're marvellous & mine
