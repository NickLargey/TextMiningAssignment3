And so, my fellow Americans
Ask not, "What your country can do for you?"
Ask what you can do for your country?"
And now, back to New York

Heart as, hard as, Chinese arithmetic
Avante Garder, not a heretic
Figure out a right rhyme, stick it in my cranium
Pete Nice, elemental like uranium
Throwin' joints, blowin' like a cool breeze
Swimmin' in, I lift on juice, I wax M.C.'s
These hoes go frontin' on my Jimmy
I smack 'em on the back, sit 'em down, say

Gimme some rhythm baby loosen up my collar
(Rhythm)
I'll lay you out, like a funeral parlor
Ready willin', fillin', killin' for a billin', top
I never stop, with search and Sam drillin' it
Soul in the hole, M.C.'s workin'
Kickin' it, vickin', the suckers who be jerkin'
Me and my posse are hardcore, you want some more
Reason that I'm squeezin' your girl
(You never please her)

So I pleased, then I threw her in the gutter
Cut her off, my wisdom wiser so I muster
Rows of all opposed, lows conquer all
Those who pose as dope I say nope, I wear def clothes
Dapper like Dan from, three the hard one
Never stigmatize as a rapper or I'll slap ya
You're stung from my tongue as you run from the drum
(Diggy drum)
Three the hard way, wordz of wisdom

This time there was three
One two three the hard way
This time there was three
One two three the hard way

A branch of the hip-hop tip grills your dome
You're toe ingrown low showin' you ain't got nobody home
Prone to the microphone, light up, and take out
Make out your will Bill, three is gonna break out
The stylee, me and P E T E
Embark on a mission that's deadly, break out the ammo
Aiyyo Sammo, hook up the beat
And I'll lay the plan oh man

You just got taken, I took a head out
Attack on the back of the six of the Guinness stout
Usin' abusin', those of the past tense
Funning gunning, but I'm summing up the nonsense
Three, the hard way, cards laid are okay
Gettin' up and settin' up, just for a payday
The minister, sinister
(I ain't no devil)
Ten snakes circle and scoundrel Sam level

This track to smack, the smile off a doubter
The brother's, another M.C. who's about
Frontin' like he's buntin', deceivin' the delinquent
Rappers on track, bustin' out a medium
For those opposed, who manifest a diss
Pete tell 'em, manifest this
Not righteous, but might just, make you wanna listen
Yo I'm Elvis with the wordz of wisdom

This time there was three
One two three the hard way
This time there was three
One two three the hard way

A Ludacris Buddhist, boo this when I do this
So true to this, perpetrators view this
Style, empirical, lyrical, it's critical
Three the hard way, boy you need medical attention
I'm like a surgeon in my left hand
Hold a microphone like a scalpel so you understand
Wordz of wisdom, woven like a spider
Bitch on my tip, I get busy and I ride her

Uptown, then I drown her like a psycho-pathic
'Cause I'm graphic on the mic I never let go
Light skinner eat dinner like a soul man
Prove with the rhyme I'm down, Sam's hands
Transform strong as a good pitch
(Too strong)
Switch up the wisdom, into word which
Kicks out the benzi in a frenzy it sends me
Up the Bronx river back to Brooklyn apprehends me

Like a D-tech bustin' my man in the projects
I'll send you up north, I ain't givin' respect
Prejudicial, your style artificial
As live as limb that's attached to a criple
It's simple eliminate you like Gotti
(So simple)
I chill in bed-stuy and drive a Mazzeratti
With the body of a freak on my side, how am I livin'?
(How ya livin'?)
Larger than large, with the wordz of wisdom

Hyper-selective, search is attracting
Females who focus on the future, not slacking
Rhythmic it's too quick, feel it, I let it flow
Sam sever seas'll submerge, so let it go
Throughout, or put out, lyrics like a D-valve
Speak up, a deeper meaning as I leak out
And seek out, a three the hard way endeavor
Pete Nice, search, produced by Sam Sever

Livin' in my shoes boy, this is not shoe town
A showdown for Motown, it's a new sound
Lyrics that lick, the tick off a timepiece
Foamin' at the mouth punk, you need a leash
What are you sick? I'm a slick stupid scientist
Rhymin' that you can't comprehend
(But you're buyin' this)
Record I'm wreckin', my homeboys are breakin'
Hopin' that you're copin', no slopin', I'm not takin' no shorts

'Cause I'm playin' the high post
Ask any girl in the place, who's the fly most
Brother with a cover, shootin' to my cribbo
The tease wants a please, girl screamin' ditto
So I did this, I needed the bed rest
Hangin' with the bangin' on the strength, there's no contest
Physically or lyrically, it's my kingdom
Stingin' 'em and bringin' 'em the wordz of wisdom

This time there was three
One two three the hard way
This time there was three
One two three the hard way

Shammo, hook up the Def mix
Ahh, ahh
All but three of the defendants were found guilty
All but three of the defendants were found guilty
See-ya
Yo yo, that's ridiculous
