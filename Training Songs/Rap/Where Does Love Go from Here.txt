Gonna tell you a story,
Where does love go, where does love go, baby.
Say you want to find love in her.
Listen love, listen closely,
So I'll tell you something.

I've been thinking to myself, what the hell I did wrong.
Always in a relationship that, that never last long.
Let me tell you a little story, about someone I met.
A situation so trifling that, that I'd never forget.

So I met this girl and, she seemed so right.
I got so caught up by, what was on outside.
As time went on, I really got to know.
That the girl I thought was an angel, was nuttin' but a hoe.
My homie tried to warn me, but I was too caught up.
I started tripping on my best friend, I told him shut the f*ck up.
I said "You don't know what yer talkin' 'bout, this girl loves me."
But as quiet as kept, she was lovin' everybody else.

Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Somebody now tell me now, baby.
Cause I can't seem to find true love no more.
I can't seem to find baby,
Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Cause I can't seem to find true love and peace of mind.

Listen to this,
I still wasn't trying to hear,
What my man was kickin' in my ear.
Heard the same gossip, down in a barber shop,
But I still didn't hear.
I had to find out, found out the hard way,
Til my man called me up on phone, this is,
This is was what he said.
"You remember what I told ya, about your girlfriend
Saw her down at Kiesha's party,
Drove off with a nigga named Ronnie."
"Uh un, this can't be true."
"But this what is I, been trying to tell you,
That the woman you love, just trying to play you all day!"

So I left work early, trying catch this girl.
Driving all over town, I couldn't find my girl.
I finally gave up, and, I took my ass home.
That's when I found my girl, laying with Ronnie,
They was getting it on, tell me.

Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Somebody now tell me now, baby.
Cause I can't seem to find true love no more.
I can't seem to find baby,
Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Cause I can't seem to find true love and peace of mind.

Somebody tell me, tell me, I said tell me.
Somebody show me, show me, you gotta show me.
Somebody tell me, tell me.
Where does love go from here, where does love go.
Somebody tell me, tell me, I said tell me.
Somebody show me, show me,
Somebody tell me, tell me.
Where does love go from here, somebody sing it.

Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Somebody now tell me now, baby.
Cause I can't seem to find true love no more.
I can't seem to find baby,
Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Cause I can't seem to find true love and peace of mind.

Can't somebody tell me, somebody show me,
I want to find, I need to find true love and peace of mind.
Somebody tell me baby, I need to know.
I want to find,
True love, true love, true love, true love.
I need to know, I need to know, I need to know.
I'm searching long, I'm searching long to find.
Somebody, anybody, they treat me right,
Oh yeah. oh yeah.
