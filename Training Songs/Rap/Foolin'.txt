Looking at the man so you always see
Without him to know you're checking him out
Talks of people here, so indiscreet,
Hoping they gon' put it about.

You really like him don't you,
You really want him don't you

I'm not mugging myself off,
I'm not showing my hand like you do
I'm not shooting myself down
I'm watching, just watching

I'm not foolin' myself now,
You're the best teacher that I ever knew
I'm not shooting myself down
I'm watching, just learning from you.

You already know, he don't desire you,
I think he's always made it clear,
And when I'm standin' there, beside you
You can't believe he's lookin' at me

Though you know he doesn't like ya,
You don't want me to have him either.

I'm not mugging myself off,
I'm not showing my hand like you do
I'm not shooting myself down
I'm watching, just watching

I'm not foolin' myself now,
You're the best teacher that I ever knew
I'm not shooting myself down

Give it up, don't stand in my way,
It's enough, for all your mistakes

You really like him don't you,
You really like him don't you.

I'm not mugging myself off,
I'm not showing my hand like you do
I'm not shooting myself down
I'm watching, just watching

I'm not mugging myself off,
I'm not showing my hand like you do
I'm not shooting myself down
I'm watching, just watching

I'm not foolin' myself now,
You're the best teacher that I ever knew
I'm not shooting myself down
I'm watching, just learning from you.
