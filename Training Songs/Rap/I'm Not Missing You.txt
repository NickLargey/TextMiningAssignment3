Oh, Oh
Iâ??m not missing you

Been through just about everything that I could go through
When it comes to relationships
Donâ??t know what I was missing or why I ainâ??t listen
When I told myself that was it
Now here I go, hurt again
Cause of my curiosity
Now that itâ??s over 
What else could it be, he just had to cheat 

I made a promise never to settle
Why didnâ??t I keep it?
Cause I hated the heartbreak
Crying and cheating, the fooling around

[Chorus]

(But) Iâ??m not missing you
Iâ??m not going through the motions
Waiting and hoping you call me
Iâ??m not missing you
You might have had me open
But I must be going because
I got life to do
I know Iâ??m usually hanging on
I used to hate to see you gone
But this time itâ??s different
I donâ??t even feel the distance
Iâ??m not missing
Iâ??m not missing you

Itâ??s a shame in a way cause
I feel that I may not ever find the right one for me
Did I leave him, is he right in front of my face oh
Will my true love ever be?
Why would I go on a search again
When I know what the end will be
What good is love when it keeps on hurting me?

I made a promise never to settle
Why didnâ??t I keep it?
Cause I hated the heartbreak
Crying and cheating, the fooling around

[Chorus: x2]

(But) Iâ??m not missing you
Iâ??m not going through the motions
Waiting and hoping you call me
Iâ??m not missing you
You might have had me open
But I must be going because
I got life to do
I know Iâ??m usually hanging on
I used to hate to see you gone
But this time itâ??s different
I donâ??t even feel the distance
Iâ??m not missing
Iâ??m not missing you

No I canâ??t be with you
Cause I'm scared felt like I was falling when you left me
I canâ??t keep going through life
Unaware of what I missed
And the person I could be 
Love's good when itâ??s right
And when it's left in your memory 
All the times I let you down
I guess love will be nice for someone else's life 

[Chorus]

(But) Iâ??m not missing you
Iâ??m not going through the motions
Waiting and hoping you call me
Iâ??m not missing you
You might have had me open
But I must be going because
I got life to do
I know Iâ??m usually hanging on
I used to hate to see you gone (I used to hate it)
Oh different, oh feel the distance
Iâ??m not missing
Iâ??m not missing you

Iâ??m not going through the motions
Waiting and hoping you call me (knockin' at my door)
You might have had me open
But I must be going because (it's the best day of my life)
I know Iâ??m usually hanging on
I used to hate to see you gone
Oh different, feel the distance
Iâ??m not missing
Iâ??m not missing you I'm not missing you (oh baby)
I'm not missing you
I'm so over you
It ain't even a problem
