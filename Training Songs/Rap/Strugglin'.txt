I start out just to vibe out I ain't about to bow out. 
I'm more gangsta then your but I ain't about to row out. 
My season will come it has to, honestly I feel like I'm 10 months pregnant, I'm past due. Sincerely, un-touchy these days I can't take nothin'. 
I'm trying to treat my record like the Lord shit I'm trying to brake somethin'. 
N mostly I'm up and stressing when other folks sleep  
And believe I know struggle and struggle knows me. 
My life owes me like an oven dose 
I'm slowly drifting to the arms of trouble and trouble holds me 
And nothing else is close to me more than pain unfortunately,
Like a self-fulfilling prophecy I'm supposed to be

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
I'm struggling and it's troubling in the circumstance 
I'm dwelling in to find myself in the corner huddling 
With some angry men and I gotta settle shit again before they gotta kill again

I should be chilling on beaches instead my bone freezes ducking glocks 
And I was and 12s like Jesus the realest thing to me is since I was a fetus 
The only break I ever got was at recess so legitimately 
I remain very little relieved and that thug rappas 
I remain very little entriged and can you blame me with how we lived in the late 80's 
Throwing rocks at the crazy ladies 
And when we played these crazy games the whole crew had crazy names 
We even had a crypper we called him lazy legs 
But my faith remains untouched and unchanged 
Still in my block you hear more shots then a gun range

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

More to the truth no writing just me recording in the booth 
Forced by the loop and the guitar but I'm the boss of the group 
I speak truth deep roots remain equal danger 
The pain in my song is crazy but the sequel is stranger
Hey man I'm from the oddest hardest progress then departed 
I'm now known as a recording artist spitting what little remains of your memories 
In your process bigger or little making your name into a colossus 
Believe me I'm thankful my brothers still with me 
And ain't much changed Bobby's still troubling with me 
I'm still mom and pory but we always dently I got a little recording gig but evidently

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
