Gang-bangin' murder with the killin'
Stackin' Phillys to the ceiling
Bloody body chillin', can't fight the feeling
Now I'm a Chi-Town building

And I'm rolling with New Orleans
What the f*ck enemies gonna bring to the table?
I'm gonna train to slain you
Rollin' with my gangstas Kane and Abel

In pain can you sustain them cables hooked on your back
Who got you charged? Wanna get the mac off guard?
Nigga I don't know you so you better come hard
Get your nieces, nephews and cousins

Takin' bunches all of the sudden
Who them niggas that's southern?
All the bullshit haters talking, I ain't stuntin'
We're gonna be ballin', never fallin'
Rollin' hundreds in a 600 Benz

Steady stackin' ends hit the block on ten
Rollin' with the twins merciless thugs, bustin' off slugs
So your family didn't know where you was
Breakin' the motherfuckers off for the set dub 2000

It happened to lack for the love what?
No fear strike first, gonna roll, strike first, don't fit
To the death, gotta ride till we die
We the one, then if you gotta try

Hollow points gotta fly, so holla bye, shorty don't cry
Hold yo chest up, you about to get touched
That's what you get for bein' a hoe
And fuckin' with niggas like us

We're straight thuggin', straight thuggin'
Straight thuggin', straight thuggin'
Gotta get 'em all by the dozen
Better start runnin' if it ain't no lovin for what

Real ass niggas let's break some bread together
All you fake ass niggas y'all gonna be dead together
Niggas could never understand what the tec would do
Turn all you smart mouth motherfuckers in a vest of bulls

In and out, in and out my bullets havin' sex with you
I'm triggafied niggafied, my niggas ride, I do
Bitches got no class like a substitute teacher
Disrespect that ass, take off my rings and beat ya

If I catch you doin' bad, I got that right to heat ya
Put some tens in yo meter, twist that cap like a two liter
What on Earth would possess you to push me, take off your skirt
Bitch show the world your pussy

The kingpin most wanted kid run this gangsta rappin'
Down with each other for life, bitch it was bound to happen
Haters start yappin', niggas bound to start cappin'

Kiss your lips then I kill you while I'm fucking you slow

Excelling niggas, reaching they norm you was sworn
