Livin' in the world of ghetto life 
Shot with the gun, get you cut with the knife 
That's the story yo, the way the peeps like to move 
No fakin' the funk, it's all about how to show and prove 
Some get to make it through life livin' legal 
The others gotta try to survive, doin' the evil 
That men do, peace to every hood that I been through 
I even got love for my homies in South Central 
But to the East my brother, 'cause that's where I stay at 
Runnin' through the streets like a stray cat 
Like that Good Times show it makes me go 
Hmmm, mmm, mm
Up in the projects, it gets no iller
With true guerillas, and stone cold killers 
It seems that every night, you get to hear the fireworks 
As much as I hate, to see my people die or hurt 
It's just a street mentality, a reality 
Neighborhood warfare, that brings home casualties 
And just because I moved out the residence 
It don't mean that I can't represent 

So to my peeps in the PJ's, throw your hands in the air (For all of y'all)
Let me know you're out there 
To my peeps in the PJ's, throw your hands in the air (For all of y'all)
Let me know you're out there 
And to my peeps in the PJ's, throw your hands in the air (For all of y'all)
And let me know you're out there 
Ah to my peeps in the PJ's, throw your hands in the air (For all of y'all)
And let me know you're out there 

I'm runnin' mob deep around the way 
It's me and the crew, we're tryin' to map out the day 
Yo what's the haps on how we gettin' snaps? 
Are we gonna shoot some cee-lo, or play a game of craps? 
Matter fact, Shane, ring the intercom 
And see if you can get ten dollars from my moms 
Tell her to throw it out the window if she got it to spare 
'Cause the elevator's broke, and I ain't checkin' for the stairs 
And do me a solid, run to the store shorty 
And pick me up some Olde E, but not a 40 
Just a two-two of brew will do, so I can knock it out fast 
To make the coldness last 

And while you at man see where'd your friend go (word) 
He shoulda been back a hour ago with the indo (yeah) 

And meet us in the back park to get sparked 
So I can be toasted by time it gets dark 
Ayo Jay, I see that bulge in the back of your jeans 
Hope that's the God you Now, know what I mean? 
'Cause if somebody brings the noise, I'ma make it a silent movie 
So take the safety off the toolie 
'Cause I don't want no beef, nah baby
The only thing I want to do is parlay
Peace and harmony is what I relate to 
But damn man, drama's just in the nature 

So to my peeps in the PJ's, throw your hands in the air (For all of y'all)
Let me know you're out there 
To my peeps in the PJ's, throw your hands in the air (For all of y'all)
Let me know you're out there 
And to my peeps in the PJ's, throw your hands in the air (For all of y'all)
And let me know you're out there 
Ah to my peeps in the PJ's, throw your hands in the air (For all of y'all)
And let me know you're out there 

I send this out to the homies in the hood 
That stood by my side, to help a brother do good 
Just like SWV you was Right Here 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we in there 
From all thugs that flex with all the muscle 
Down to the brothers, that got a swift hustle 
Like good golly Miss Three Card Molly, a neat trick 
Where people get beat quick 
Want to see a sweet vic? 

Jackety Jack, blackety black 
You get nuttin' back, and that's a fact 
The sweetest game I ever seen 
All you gotta do is find the red queen 
Just point to it, can anybody point to it? 
I play by the point of the finger, the tone of the voice
"The one in the middle. The one in the middle" 
That's black, you get no money back
