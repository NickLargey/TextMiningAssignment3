Dream
Imagine
Close your eyes

Oh,
Oh,
Oh

Now I may not have
Five or six cars in my garage
But would you settle for a nice massage
And the love of a lifetime

Girl, I swear to God that
With a whole lot of love
And little bit of faith
That we can make it
You just gotta believe that

We could roll till the wheels fall off (And)
I'ma love you till my soul's gone on ('Cause)
It can happen, baby, just hold on
Close your eyes and dream (And imagine that)

Imagine that smile ever leavin' your face
Comin' home from work and never leavin' the place
Got chocolate and champagne just for you to taste
(Close your eyes)
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that

Imagine Benzes in the parking lot
A different chauffeur for every car you got
Islands to settle on a private yacht (Just close your eyes)
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that

I know you deserve
More than I got right now
But baby, there's no doubt
'Cause you've always stayed down

I swear to God that
A whole lot of love
And a little bit of faith
That we can make it
You just gotta believe that

We could roll till the wheels fall off (And)
I'ma love you till my soul's gone on (Hey)
It can happen, baby, just hold on
Close your eyes and dream (And imagine that)

Imagine that smile ever leavin' your face
Comin' home from work and never leavin' the place
Got chocolate and champagne just for you to taste
(Close your eyes)
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that (And imagine that)

Imagine Benzes in the parking lot
A different chauffeur for every car you got
Islands to settle on a private yacht
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that (Close your eyes and imagine that, girl)

{Some day} Just have my back and I promise that
{Some way} I'll work to try to cop you that
{If we pray} And believe, you will see that
{It'll be okay} You just gotta dream and believe

Imagine that
I can, can you, can we
We dream, ooh
You can have anything you need
A dream
But you've got to imagine that

Imagine that
I can, can you, can we
We dream, ooh
You can
If you close your eyes and imagine that

Imagine that smile ever leavin' your face
Comin' home from work and never leavin' the place
Got chocolate and champagne just for you to taste
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that

Imagine Benzes in the parking lot (Oh)
A different chauffeur for every car you got (Oh, oh)
Islands to settle on a private yacht (Just close your eyes, girl)
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that

Imagine that smile ever leavin' your face
Comin' home from work and never leavin' the place
Got chocolate and champagne just for you to taste (Oh)
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that

Imagine Benzes in the parking lot (Parkin' lot)
A different chauffeur for every car you got
(Oh, oh)
Island to settle on a private yacht (Just close your eyes)
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that

Close your eyes and dream and
Close your eyes and dream and
Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that

Dream with me
Imagine
