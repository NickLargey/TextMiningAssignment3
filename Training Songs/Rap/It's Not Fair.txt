Can't believe that the heart of my world
Got me on my knees
Prayin' my eyes are lyin' to me
I built a whole new life around you

In an instant we were through
As our future disappears
Fallin' like tears
Are the dreams of a love we thought we shared

It's not fair, I was true to you
I finally settle down
Then you don't turn around
And betray the trust I had in you

It's not fair, after all I treated you
Respectable, with care
Said that you'd be there
Now, who am I to turn to

And I trusted you
And this is what I get in return
You was like a brother to me
But now I is see you was just waitin' your turn

When I was out at work, y'all was doin' dirt
Stealin' my heart away
Shared everything with you, all I was goin' through
Now dark skies and tearful eyes are here to stay

It's not fair, I was true to you
I finally settle down
You don't turn around
And betray the trust I had in you

It's not fair, after all I treated you
Respectable, with care
Said that you'd be there
Now, who am I to turn to

It's not fair, after all I sacrificed
For my seed said, you'd give life
With everything I am
Wanted for you to be happy

And now slowly the life of love
You breathed into my heart
Is slipping away, dying today
If only

Never thought I'd live to see
Disrespected me
How could it be
Let away so easily, yeah

I was true to you
I finally settle down
You don't turn around
And betray the trust I had in you

It's not fair, after all I treated you
Respectable, with care
Said that you'd be there
Now, who am I to turn to

It's not fair, I was true to you
It's not fair, after all I treated you
Respectable, with care
Said that you'd be there
Now, who am I to turn to

It's not fair, it's not fair
