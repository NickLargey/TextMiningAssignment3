Woke up when I got the feeling
A nobody's gonna make it easy
Left out when I want to be inside
As it's all goin' down
(Your love) Your love is enough to feed me
(Held up) Held up for another evening
(Lord knows) Lord knows I could use the freedom
For waiting around when I need you

Who are we to fall to pieces baby (oh baby oh)
Worked so hard to see things through 
(see it through, see it through)
Who are we to question each other mama (ohhh)
I know what it takes to make it right for you

It's the way I feel (repeat 4x)

(This life)This life there's no surprises
(So good)So good well I can't defy it
(So true)So true that I want to try it
All without making a sound
(Hooked up) Hooked up in a situation
(I'm down)I'm down with the invitation
(New love)New love and a revelation
For keeping my head to ground (ohh)

Who are we to fall to pieces baby (oh baby oh)
(oh baby oh baby)
Worked so hard to see things through 
(see it through, see it through)
Who are we to question each other mama (ohhh)
I know what it takes to make it right for you

It's the way I feel (Repeat x4)

Here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come(talk too much
Here I come, here I come (repeat)

It's the way i feel (Repeat x8)
