O, Jenny's a' wet, poor body,
Jenny's seldom dry:
She draggled a' her petticoatie,
Comin thro' the rye!

Chorus:
Comin thro' the rye, poor body,
Comin thro' the rye,
She draigl't a' her petticoatie,
Comin thro' the rye!

if, should a body meet a body
Comin thro' the rye,
Gin a body kiss a body,
Need a body cry?

(chorus)

Gin a body meet a body
Comin thro' the glen
Gin a body kiss a body,
Need the world know?

(chorus)

Gin a body meet a body
Comin thro' the grain;
Gin a body kiss a body,
The thing's a body's own.

(chorus)

Ilka lassie has her laddie,
Nane, they say, haâ€™e I
Yet all the lads they smile on me,
When comin' thro' the rye.
