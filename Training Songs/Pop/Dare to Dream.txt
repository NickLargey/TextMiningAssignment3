(Paul Begaud/Vanessa Corish/Wayne Tester)

I am my own believer
In my heart the reason
I will follow the light from within
I'm not afraid of weakness
I'm gonna taste the sweetness
Of the power not to give in
Oh I will see it through
I believe this is my moment of truth

Dare to dream
Dare to fly
Dare to be the hier the chosen one to touch the sky
Dare to reach
Dare to rise
Find the strength to set my spirit free
Dare to dream

I will go the distance
Embrace resistance
I will lay my soul on the line
When the wait is over
And the hunger has spoken
If I give my all,I will shine
Oh I will see it through
I believe, this is my moment of truth

Dare to dream
Dare to fly
Dare to be the ever chosen one to touch the sky
Dare to reach
Dare to rise
Find the strength to set my spirit free
Dare to dream,Oh

And my heart will shine like the sun
A million voices together as one
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe

Dare to dream
Dare to fly
Dare to be the ever chosen one to touch the sky
Dare to reach
Dare to rise
Find the strength to set my spirit free

Dare to dream
Dare to fly
Dare to be the ever chosen one to touch the sky
Dare to reach
Dare to rise
Find the strength to set my spirit free
(Find the strength to set my spirit free)
Find the strength to do what I believe
(I believe)
Dare To dream
Dare To dream
