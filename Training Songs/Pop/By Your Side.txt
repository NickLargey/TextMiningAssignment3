Whatever we may do
Whatever we may fall
All I ask of you
Please love me too, like I love you

Always, always
By your side

We share the pain inside
Together we will try
To understand, why?
For those who die, so many friends
Goodbye

Always, always
By your side
Always, always
By your side
By your side

If life is all we are
Then shine like every star
Nothing lasts forever
Time will make our history
As love will too

Always, always
By your side
Always, always
By your side
By your side
By your side

Always, always
Always, always
By your side
