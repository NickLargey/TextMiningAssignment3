Here I see you trying to go and leave it all behind
Hey, you know it's wrong to fall

We're in it for the money, we're in it for the money
We're in it for the money, we're in it for the money
We're in it for the money, we're in it for the money
We're in it for the money

Got my mind made up, I got my finger on the button, going way home
Got the sound turned down, got a feeling in my pocket, going way home

Well all I can see is our love and all I can hear is her
Well all I can see is our love and all I can hear is her

Got my mind made up, I got my finger on the button, going way home
Got the sound turned down, got a feeling in my pocket, going way home
Got my mind made up, I got my finger on the button, going way home
Got the sound turned down, got a feeling in my pocket, going way home
Got my mind made up, I got my finger on the button going way home
Got the sound turned down, got a feeling in my pocket going way home
