Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't let the moon break your heart
Love blooms at night
In the daylight it dies

Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Oh, keep your heart for me
For someday I'll return
And you know you're the only one I'll ever love

Too many nights, too many stars
Too many moons to change your mind
If I'm gone too long don't forget where you belong
When the stars come out remember you are mine

Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't let the moon break your heart
Love blooms at night
In the daylight it dies

Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Oh, keep your heart for me
For someday I'll return
And you know you're the only one I'll ever love

Too many miles, too many days
Too many nights to be alone
Ah please keep your heart while we are apart
Don't you linger in the moonlight when I'm gone

Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't let the moon break your heart
Love blooms at night
In the daylight it dies

Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Oh, keep your heart for me
For someday I'll return
And you know you're the only one I'll ever love
You're the only one I'll ever love
