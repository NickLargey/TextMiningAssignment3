I got a gal that's mighty sweet
With big blue eyes and tiny feet
Her name is Rosabelle Malone
And she tips the scale at twenty stone.

Oh, gee, but ain't it grand to have a girl so big and fat
That when you go to hug her, you don't know where you're at
You have to take a piece of chalk in your hand
And hug a ways and chalk a mark to see where you began

One day I was a-huggin' and a-chalkin' and a-chalkin' and a-huggin' away
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other way over the mountain
Comin' around the other way

Oh Gee, it ain't so grand to be a girl so big and fat
That when you go to hug me you don't know where you're at

I have to take a piece of chalk in my hand
And hug away and chalk a mark to see where I began

Now where is that chalk? Ah, here it is
I'll put one cross here, and another one here.

Darling.

Ah, but seriously you know that I'm crazy about you, 
and I mean all of you, every little bit.

We both feel we're meant for each other.

Yet when we walk through the street people think 
that I'm out with my mother.

One day I was a-huggin' and a-chalkin' and a-beggin' her to be my bride
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other side, It was Lou Praeger
Comin' around the other side.
