When we are dancing and you're dangerously near me
I get ideas, I get ideas
I want to hold you, so much closer than I dare to
I want to scold you, 'cause I care more than I care too
And when you touch me, and there's fire in every finger
I get ideas, I get ideas
And after we have kissed goodnight & still you linger
I kinda think you get ideas too

Your eyes are always saying, the things you're never saying
I only hope they're saying, that you could love me too
For that's the whole idea, it's true, the lovely idea
That I've fall in love with you
