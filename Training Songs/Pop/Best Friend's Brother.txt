I call you up when I know he's at home,
I jump out of my skin when he picks up the phone
Why can I tell if he's looking at me?
Should I give him a smile?
Should I get up and leave?

I know it's strange, I don't know what I'm thinking
But is it wrong if I see him this weekend?
I really hope I can get him alone
I just don't, don't want her to know

Yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah yeah
A punk rock drummer and he's six foot three
I don't want to but I want to
'Cause I just can't get him out of my mind, and
Yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
B-F-B, B-F-B
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother

I kinda think that I might be his type
'Cause when you're not around
He's not acting too shy
Sometimes I feel like he might make a move
Is this all in my head?
I don't know what to do

I know it's strange, I don't know what he's thinking
But it is wrong if I see him this weekend
I really hope I can get him alone
I just don't, don't want her to know

Yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah yeah
A punk rock drummer and he's six foot three
I don't want to but I want to
'Cause I just can't get him out of my mind, and
Yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
B-F-B, B-F-B
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother
B-F-B, B-F-B
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother

'Cause he's such a dream, yeah
And you'd know what I mean
If you weren't related

Yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah-eeh, yeah yeah
A punk rock drummer and he's six foot three
I don't want to but I want to
'Cause I just can't get him out of my mind, and
