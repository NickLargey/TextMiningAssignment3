I believe there is nothing stronger than our love
I believe there is nothing stronger than our love
When I'm with you Baby
All my worries disappear

Troubles that surround me
Disappear when you are near
When you need my loving
I'll be there

You know
When you need my loving
You know
Where to go

I believe there is nothing stronger than our love
I believe it
I believe there is nothing stronger than our love
I do believe it

I believe there is nothing stronger than our love
Baby I believe it
When I'm full of sadness
Nice to know you're always there

In this world of madness
Nice to know somebody cares
When I need your loving
You'll be there

I know
When I need your loving
I'll know where to go
I believe there is nothing stronger than our love

I believe it
I believe there is nothing stronger than our love
I do believe it
I believe there is nothing stronger than our love

Baby I believe it
When I'm with you Baby
I know you make me feel so good
When I'm with you Baby

You give me what nobody could
When you need my loving
I'll be there
You know

You know
When you need my loving
You know where to go
I believe there is nothing stronger than our love

I believe it
I believe there is nothing stronger than our love
I do believe it
I believe there is nothing stronger than our love

Baby I believe it
I believe there is nothing stronger than our love
I believe it
I believe there is nothing stronger than our love
