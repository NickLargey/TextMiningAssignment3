He came from where the winds are cold
Truth is seen through keyholes
Strange longings never sleep
Now he's come where no hearts beat

Time to worry
Cry wolf time to worry now

You can start but you cannot stop
You give in but you can't give up
You can tell all your desperate jokes
To world that puts your love on hold

Time to worry
Cry wolf time to worry now

Cry wolf time to worry now
Cry wolf time to worry now

Sunken in eyes
And the pain in his cries
A shape in the dark

Time to worry
Cry wolf time to worry now

Cry wolf time to worry now
Cry wolf time to worry now
Time to worry now
