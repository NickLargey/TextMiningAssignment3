Every night I keep prayin' that you love me
Every night I keep prayin' that you do-oo
'Cause I know that my life would be worthless
Without you, (without you ) without you (without you), without you

Every night I keep prayin' that you want me
Every night I keep prayin' that you do-oo
'Cause I know that my heart would be broken
Without you, (without you ) without you (without you), without you

I couldn't bear to know you'd leave me
No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no
'Cause I know that it would grieve me
If you ever go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Every night I keep prayin' that you love me
Every night it's the question that you don't or do
So my love, let me know you really love, yes, you love me
Or I'll be (or I'll be) eternally (eternally) without you

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Without you
