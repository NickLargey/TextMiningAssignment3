Saw you in the cloud late one night
Dancing for a living in blue light
You took a glance at me, we overlooked it
My eyes were searching for the secret
As to whether we'd fit and I said

"We'll meet in the Yellow Forest
(We'll meet)
There it will be where we both can see
We'll meet in the Yellow Forest
(We'll meet)
There's a world that's made for you and me"

Time went racing on as the month passed
I caught you once again in your dance act
Your attitude has changed, you smiled at me
Now I can tell where we both should be

We'll meet in the Yellow Forest
(We'll meet)
(Yellow Forest)
There it will be where we both can see
We'll meet in the Yellow Forest
(We'll meet)
There's a world that's made for you and me

We'll meet in the Yellow Forest
(We'll meet)
(Yellow Forest, Yellow Forest)
There it will be where we both can see
We'll meet in the Yellow Forest
(We'll meet)
(Yellow Forest, Yellow Forest)
There's a world that's made for you and me

We'll meet in the Yellow Forest
(We'll meet)
(Yellow Forest, Yellow Forest)
There it will be where we both can see
