Where have the people gone
Seems like there's no one hangin' on
Look through the window
The houses are empty

Hey
Everybody's out of town
Seems like
I'm the only one around

All of the streets are bare
No traffic tie ups anywhere
Don't have to wait for a seat at the movies

Hey
Everybody's out of town
Seems like 
I'm the only one around

Everyone moved out from the ghetto
Lots of space
Empty apartments
No more pollution
Plenty of classrooms everyplace

And it looks like we're ready
To give it one more try
This time there'll be no alibis
I'm gonna send out a message to Noah

Hey
Better send some people down
Everyone on earth
Is out of town
