Beyond the shadow of a doubt,
As the mighty river flows,
As the meadow gaily plays
With the wind on summer days.

About as deep as deep can go,
From the canyons to the sky,
Like a mother as she cares
For the baby that she bares.

[Chorus]
Do I love you, don’t you know by now?
Do I love you, must I show you how?
Do I love you, do I have to say?
Do I love you, yes, in every way.

About as sacred as an hymn
And the Bible full of pearls
From a whisper to a roar
Very much and even more.

Let me say it with my eyes,
And I’ll share it with the night
Even in death the good Lord is kind
You’ll be the last thing on my mind.

[Chorus]

I believe in you, don’t ever take your love away.
Do I love you, don’t you know by now?
Do I love you, must I show you how?
Do I love you, do I have to say?
Do I love you, yes, I love you,
In every way.
Do I have to say?

I’m saving my love for you,
I think about you, I think about you
Do I love you, do I love you?
Yes, in every way.
