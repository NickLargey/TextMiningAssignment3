(Don't hold your breath)

You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

I was under your spell for such a long time
Couldn't break the chains
You played with my heart
Tore me apart with all your lies and games
It took all the strength I had
But I crawled up on my feet again
Now you're trying to lure me back
But no those days are gone my friend
I loved you so much then I thought
Someday that you could change
But all you brought me was a heart full of pain

You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me boy I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
Don't hold your breath

I was worried about you
But you never cared about me none
You took my money
And I knew that you you could kill someone
I gave you everything but nothing was ever enough
You were always jealous over such crazy stuff

You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me boy I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
Don't hold your breath

Move on (move on)
Don't look back (don't look back)
I jumped off a train running off the tracks
Your day is gone (your day is gone)
Face the facts (face the facts)
A bad movie ends and the screen fades to black

What you did to me, boy I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back

You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

Ooh
