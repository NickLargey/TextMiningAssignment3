You're walking down the street
You've got this white Chevy Lumina undercover
Checking you to see
They're checking your I.D.
'Cause it's a fine time 
It's a fine time
It's a fine time
Say just to run a name
'Cause you look the same

As the dude with the rebel in his veins
But while you're checking me
You've got them crooked politicians

Eating up the treasury
And taking our cash
To spend on the prisons
While the youth they fast
Now I'm waiting on the day 
When we can all bring
Like Martin Luther King
This is why I sing

I want some contact contact
I want some contact contact
I want some contact contact
Contact contact 
Only because my life depends on it
