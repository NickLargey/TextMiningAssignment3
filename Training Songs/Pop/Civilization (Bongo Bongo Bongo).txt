Each morning, a missionary advertises neon sign
He tells the native population that civilization is fine
And three educated savages holler from a bamboo tree
That civilization is a thing for me to see

 So bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't want to leave the Congo, oh no no no no no

 Don't want no jailhouse, shotgun, fish-hooks, golf clubs, I got my spears
