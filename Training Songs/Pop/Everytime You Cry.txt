Never before have I seen you look so blue
Can't find the cure and nothing comforts you
The light at the end of the tunnel
Doesn't shine at the end of the day
Every time you cry
Save up all your tears, I will be your rainbow
When they disappear
Wash away the pain 'til you smile again
I will be the laughter in your eyes
Every time you cry
Every time you cry
Time has a way of wounding what has healed
What can I say, I know just how you feel
Your soul is dark and troubled
Like a river running wild
Every time you cry
Save up all your tears, I will be your rainbow
When they disappear
Wash away the pain 'til you smile again
I will be the one who dries your eyes
Every time you cry
Every time you cry
Well you know that's what I'm here for
And I will give you when you need more
There'll be no hesitation, I will reap no reward
