Dear darling
I love you always
Some things never change 
Our love is one of them
That's what you say 
In your letter
Of only yesterday

But there's another story
Hidden on the pages
Where though I can see it
Only hearts can feel the words 
Between the lines
The little signs that hide between the lines
The little signs that hide between the lines

Opportunity
A sudden phone call
Such a little white lie
Ooh where when or why
My friends won't say a thing
Think I must be blind
Truth is so unkind

A glance
A whisper
A chance to meet
Across a crowded room
A guilty secret 
That lies between the lines
The little signs that hide between the lines
The little signs that hide between the lines

There's a place I believe in
Partly truth
Partly fiction
I can say with conviction
I'll get there
I'll get there

Dear darling
I love you always
Some things never change 
Our love is one of them
That's what you say 
In your letter
Of only yesterday
But there's another story
Hidden on the pages
Where though I can see it
Only hearts can feel the words 
Between the lines
The little signs that hide between the lines
The little signs that hide between the lines
