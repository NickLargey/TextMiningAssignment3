(I am feeling very warm right now
Please don't disappear
I am spacing out with you
You are the most beautiful entity
That I have ever dreamed of)

(At night I will protect you with your dreams
I will be your angel
You worry so much about us having 
Enough time together
It makes no difference to me
I would be happy with just 
One minute in your arms
Let's have an extended play together
You're telling me that we live 
To far to love each other
But our love can stretch farther 
Then the eye can see
So how does this make you feel?)

How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?

(Do you know that when you look at me
It is a salvation
I've been waiting for you for so long
I can drive on that road forever
I wish you exist to live on my planet
Well, it's very hard for me to say 
These things in your presence
So how does this make you feel?)

How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?

How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?

(So how does this make you feel?)

Well, I really think you should quit smoking!
