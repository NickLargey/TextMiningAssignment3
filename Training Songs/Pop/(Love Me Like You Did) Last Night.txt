Last night, last night, last night, you loved me, how you loved me 
Oh, you made me love you last night 
Oh how you teased me like you did it, when you did it last night 
Pleased me like you did it, when you did it last night 
You stole my heart away from me last night 
Holding you tight, did it mean as much to you as it meant to me, last night 
Were you just lonely, was I just a friend?, did you want me only, or did you pretend? 
Was it just one night to hold you tight? then make tonight just like last night 
Come on and love me like you did it, when you did it last night 
Hold me like you did it when you did it last night 
I want you to stay and love me all the way 
Say sweet things to me like you said last night, hang on so tight 
Now it's alright, just like last night I feel so fine now, you are mine now 
Yeah, just like last night, yeah kiss me like you did it 
When you did it last night, yeah, touch me like you did it 
When you did it last night, ah love me like you did it 
When you did it last night, last night
