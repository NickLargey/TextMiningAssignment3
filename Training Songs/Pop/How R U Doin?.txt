How r u doin'?
Party

It's time do it
It's time to tell us how to queue it
We're gonna pop what's in the bottle
Gonna rock what's in the shuttle
All the love, we're gonna spread it (spread it)

How r u doin'?

Hey girls, let's get it on, let's get it on till we got it
Gotta lose the distance that we got until we rock it
Tonight we're gonna share a secret invitation
Love generation, love generation

We wanna know now if you're feeling alive
We wanna know now are you ready tonight?
It's time to party 'cause the feeling is right
We wanna know now are you ready to go-oh-oh-oh?

How R U doin' girl? How r u doin' boy?
Wanna get to know you, tell us how r u doin'?
How R U doin' girl? How r u doin' boy?
Let's bring it all together, how r u doin' tonight?

First step is taken when you say it (say it, say it)
It's time to show what's in the pocket
Gonna shake what's in the rocket
All our love will turn to magic (magic, come closer)

How r u doin'?

It's time to pick it up to put it down in words, yeah
Gotta stop believing that no one's gonna hurt ya
Tonight we'll get it out with best, best intentions
Love generation, love generation
