You and me, me and you
In the summertime
How we touched, how we kissed
Felt so right
Sun is gone, but the moon shines so bright
And I know we will share under the same star tonight
Oh, don't give up on love, don't give up on love, don't give up on love
Oh, don't give up on love, don't give up on love, don't give up on love

Dance with me like no one else can see
Hold me like you don't want to be free
Sun is gone, but the moon shines so bright
And I know we will share under the same star tonight
Oh, don't give up on love, don't give up on love, don't give up on love
Oh, don't give up on love, don't give up on love, don't give up on love

Cause' I just wanna dance with you
Won't you let me dance with you?
Just one more time, time, time
Just one more time, time, time
One more time, time, time

Sun is gone, but the moon shines so bright
And I know we will share under the same star tonight
Oh, don't give up on love, don't give up on love, don't give up on love
Oh, don't give up on love, don't give up on love, don't give up on love
Oh, don't give up on love, don't give up on love, don't give up on love
Oh, don't give up on love, don't give up on love, don't give up on love

Cause' I just wanna dance with you
Won't you let me dance with you?
Just one more time, time, time
Just one more time, time, time
