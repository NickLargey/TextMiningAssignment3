Let's go
Uh, the drop-top specialist
Yes, we turn heads like an exorcist
Red bottoms on our feet looking devilish
We take it to the next level, feel effortless

I'm tired of you kicking the dirt, just want the dust to settle
I'll find just what I deserve, if you cant do better
Can't say that you'll take your time, before the sweet turns sour
You changed right before my eyes, you picked the wrong flower

Don 't know what you think I'm after
Don't think I can take anymore
Don't know what you think I'm after
What do you take me for, what do you take me for

Then I'm like whatever
Go on right through the front door
Bye I'll see ya later
What do you take me for, what do you take me for

Boy now that the tables have turned, let me see you begging
It's a hard life lesson to learn, when its me you're not getting
So low but you're all alone, and now you got no power
Let go cos I'm cutting the rope, guess you climbed the wrong tower

Don 't know what you think I'm after
Don't think I can take anymore
Don't know what you think I'm after
What do you take me for, what do you take me for

Then I'm like whatever
Go on right through the front door
Bye I'll see ya later
What do you take me for, what do you take me for

Two kids in a bucket bucket, f*ck it ?
The way you handle this,
Yeah I'm disgusting
Never been busted, treat me like a suspect
Why am I the one that just can't be trusted

Try harder, discuss it, why bother
I made you, I'll make another and she'll go further
And you can bet a million on it
South of France on a yacht with us chillin on it

Don 't know what you think I'm after
Don't think I can take anymore
Don't know what you think I'm after
What do you take me for, what do you take me for

Then I'm like whatever
Go on right through the front door
Bye I'll see ya later
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
