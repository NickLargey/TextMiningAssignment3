When the town is fast a-sleep, and it's mid-night in the sky, 
That's the time the fes-tive chink starts to wink his oth-er eye, 
Starts to wink his dream-y eye, la-zi-ly you'll hear him sigh. 

Strang-ers ta-king in the sights, pig-tails fly-ing here and there. 
See that brok-en wall street sport, still thinks he's a mil-lion-aire. 
Still thinks he's a mil-lion-aire, pipe dreams ban-ish ev-'ry care. 

Chi-na-town, my chi-na-town 
Where the lights are low, 
Hearts that know no oth-er land, 
Drift-ing to and fro. 
Dream-y dream-y chi-na-town, 
Al-mond eyes of brown, 
Hearts seems light and life seems bright, 
In dream-y chi-na-town
