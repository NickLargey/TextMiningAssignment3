I met him on the powwow trail
He was singing and I was a dancer
To the Heartbeat Drum
Heartbeat Drum - heyo heya

Long summer nights 
Falling in love
Don't ever want to part, 
Don't ever want to say goodbye
Darling don't cry

When I leave the USA
If you like I'll take you home
When I go back to Canada
Hey ya, hey ya...
