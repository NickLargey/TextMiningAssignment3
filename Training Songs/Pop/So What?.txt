No lines we just walk up to the front
Thirty girls and my flavor of the month
Evel Knievel cause ya know I got a stunt (it's show time)

So whatcha whatcha whatcha need?
You wanna bang bang boogie with a freak?
Pop bottles at my table to the beat
Ya better gimme what I gimme what I need

Hey you take it to the room
We can blast off take it to the moon
We can wild out take it to the zoo
All I wanna do is zoom zoom zoom zoom

You and me in the backseat
Bass in the trunk, you remind me of my jeep
Bass hang low all the way to your feet
All I wanna do is beat beat beat

Hundred dollar bills stacked higher than the trunk
Eatin' real good take your ? out to lunch
Sleepin' real good take your vodka out to brunch

So whatcha whatcha whatcha need?
Need da be swimmin' in women like the sea
Super hot model chicks rum and lin-ger-ie
Need da spray em down with the cham-pag-ne

Hey you take it to the room
We can blast off stars take it to the moon
We can wild out take it to the zoo
All I wanna do is zoom zoom zoom zoom

You and me in the backseat
Bass in the trunk you remind me of my jeep
Bass hang low all the way to your feet
All I wanna do is beat beat beat
