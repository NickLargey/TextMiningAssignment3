No, no, no, no, no
Uh, wait

You, gotta excuse me
You see I went looking for yesterday
That’s where I think all the good memories of you and me, went, yeah
So I’m swimming in a sea of forgetfulness
Just to get a glimpse of the you I remember, damn (Damn)

I miss you cause the one I’m lookin’ at right now
She, looks just like sounds just like feels just like you
But I’m so confused cause she don’t seem like you
So when I get there

I’ll be drowning, drowning
I’ll be drowning 
In our memories
When I get there 
I’ll be drowning
I’ll be drowning
I’ll be drowning
In our memories
I'd rather be there than here

I, don’t, want a life saver (No)
Unless it's gonna save this love
If it’s not, then leave me right here
Let me breathe in the moments I won’t let go, of
I wish you’d get back to that girl
The one that I remember as my lover, damn (Damn)

I miss her cause the one I’m lookin at right now
She, looks just like sounds just like feels just like you
But I’m so confused cause she don’t seem like you
So when I get there

I’ll be drowning, drowning
I’ll be drowning
In our memories
When I get there 
I’ll be drowning
I’ll be drowning
I’ll be drowning
In our memories
I'd rather be there than here

I'd rather be there than here
I'd rather be there than here
I'd rather be there than here
Than here
Than here
