Non dimenticar means don't forget you are my darling
Don't forget to be
All you mean to me
Non dimenticar my love is like a star, my darling
Shining bright and clear
Just because you're here

Please do not forget that our lips have met
And I've held you tight, dear
Was it dreams ago my heart felt this glow?
Or only just tonight, dear?

Non dimenticar although you travel far, my darling
It's my heart you own, so I'll wait alone
Non dimenticar

Se ci separo, se ci allontano
L'ala del destino
Non ne ho colpa, no, e mi sentiro sempre a te vicino

Non dimenticar although you travel far, my darling
It's my heart you own, so I'll wait alone
Non dimenticar
