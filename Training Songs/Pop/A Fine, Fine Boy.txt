My boy
I got so much love in my heart for him
That I really don't feel like me when he's not around
Yes, there are boys and there are boys
But he's a (fine, fine boy)

I wanna tell the world about the boy I love
Just the kind of guy I was dreaming of
He's so sincere when he holds me tight
And when I'm blue he makes me feel alright

Oh he's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And something tells me that we'll never part
He's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And he's (fine) yeah, (fine) yeah, (fine) yeah
I know he's (fine) yeah, (fine) yeah, (fine) yeah
I know he's a (fine, fine boy)

(Fine, fine boy)

He can take me places and buy me things
But love is more important than a diamond ring
So all I wanna do is stay by his side
And take care of him and I'll be satisfied

Oh he's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And something tells me that we'll never part
He's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And he's (fine) yeah, (fine) yeah, (fine) yeah
I know he's (fine) yeah, (fine) yeah, (fine) yeah
I know he's a (fine, fine boy)

Oh he's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And something tells me that we'll never part
He's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And he's (fine) yeah, (fine) yeah, (fine) yeah
I know he's (fine) yeah, (fine) yeah, (fine) yeah
I know he's a (fine)

My boy, he's a fine, fine, super fine boy

(Oh-oh, fine, fine boy) I know he's fine, oh yeash
(Oh-oh, fine, fine boy) oh yeah, I know, I know he's fine
(Oh-oh, fine, fine boy) I know he's fine, yeah, yeah
(Oh-oh, fine, fine boy) oh, he's fine
