Have you ever seen sunshine come pourin'out of space
Just to be part of the smile on someone's face'
Uh-huh-huh, that's my baby, talkin' bout my baby,
And I love him -- he's a walkin miracle,
(Ooh, ooh) he's a walkin miracle.
Have you ever seen lovin that really rings a bell,
Kooky and crazy, like Romeo himself 
Uh-huh-huh, that's my baby, Talkin  bout my baby,
And I love him -- he's a walkin miracle,
(Ooh, ooh) he's a walkin miracle.
(Ooh, ooh)
And you should see cherries do flips, woh, yeah,
When they're picked to be the taste on his lips, who, yeah,
And I know how happy his clothes must be,
 Cause that's how I feel when he's close to me (close to me)
Have you ever seen lovin that really rings a bell,
Kooky and crazy like Romeo himself 
Uh-huh-huh, that's my baby, Talkin  bout my baby,
And I love him -- he's a walkin miracle,
(Ooh, ooh) he's a walkin miracle.
(Ooh, ooh) he's a walkin miracle.
(Ooh, ooh)
(Fade)
