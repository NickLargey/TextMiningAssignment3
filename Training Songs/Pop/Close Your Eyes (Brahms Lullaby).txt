Music play 
something dreamy for dancing 
while we're here romancing 
It's love's holiday 
And Love will be our guide 

Close your Eyes 
When you open them dear 
I'll be right hear by your side 
So

Close your eyes 
rest your head on my shoulder and sleep 
Close your eyes 
And I will close mine 

Close your eyes 
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep 
Close your eyes 
This is divine 

Music play 
something dreamy for dancing 
while were here romancing 
It's love's holiday 
And Love will be our guide

Close your Eyes 
When you open them dear 
I'll be near by your side 
So won't you close your eyes
