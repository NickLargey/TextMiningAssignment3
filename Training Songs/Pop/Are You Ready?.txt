Time, time is running out
And your life, yes, your life is still in doubt
Well, it's all up to you
Everything you say and do
Will you face the truth
Or be lost in certain doom

Are you ready?
Are you ready for the Lord
If He comes in the night?
Are you ready?
Are you ready for the Lord
If He comes in the night for you?

You, you all playing with fire
If you choose, if you choose to waste your time
'Cause the day of the Lord
Is a day that's close at hand
So don't wait anymore
This could be your final chance

Are you ready?
Are you ready for the Lord
If He comes in the night?
Are you ready
Are you ready for the Lord
If He comes in the night for you?
