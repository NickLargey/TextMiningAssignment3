Every breath that I take
You're the reason I can't live without it
I know for sure
I'm addicted to you
Like a drug
And There's No doubt about it
I need some more

'Cause the way that I feel about you
Is making me lose control
I want it all

Anywhere you go
Baby I'll follow
I will find you wherever you are
Anytime or place
In a million ways
I need you like every breathe I take
And every move you make - Oh Yeah

Even if I would try
There's no way I could ever deny it
I want you near
More than words can explain
There's no letters invented to write it
Anywhere

'Cause the way that I feel about you
Is making me lose control
I want it all

Anywhere you go
Baby I'll follow
I will find you wherever you are
Anytime or place
In a million ways
I need you like every breathe I take
And every move you make - Oh Yeah

Ooh
'Cause the way that I feel about you
Is making me lose control
I want it all

Anywhere you go
Baby I'll follow
I will find you wherever you are
Anytime or place
In a million ways
Every breathe I take

Anywhere you go
Baby I'll follow
I will find you wherever you are
Anytime or place
In a million ways
Like every breathe

Anywhere you go
Baby I'll follow
I will find you wherever you are
Anytime or place
In a million ways
I need you like every breathe I take
And every move you make - Oh Yeah

Like every breathe I take
