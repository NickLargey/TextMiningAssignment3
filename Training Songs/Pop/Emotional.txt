Sometimes I get emotional
Sometimes I do some stupid things
Something I say what I should keep inside

Sometimes I'm sad about everything
Sometimes I'm mad and break some things
Sorry times ten but you just got in the way

Don't give up now
Running away
I won't hurt you
Sometimes I'm just a pain
And that's the way it is
That's just the way I am

Sometimes I feel like crying
Laying down and dying
That's when I need you
Life is always easy
But sometimes I'm just scared to leave me

That's when I feelâ?¦ emotionalâ?¦â?¦

You say I'm just impossible
Totally unpredictable
I'm just a girl, get used to it
No big deal

You can't change me
Why would you try
I'm no angel, but I can make you smile

And that's the way it is
That's just the way I am

Sometimes I feel like crying
Laying down and dying
That's when I need you

Life is always easy
But sometimes I'm just scared to leave me
That's when I feelâ?¦â?¦ emotionalâ?¦..

Don't give up
I won't hurt you
Oh, sometimes I'm just a pain

And that's the way it is
That's just the way I am

That's when I need you
Life is always easy
But sometimes I'm just scared to leave me

That's when I need
Ohhhh yeaaahhhhhh
I need you

Sometimes I getâ?¦â?¦ emotionalâ?¦â?¦.
