When I'm feeling blue and when I'm feeling low
Then I start to think about the happiest man I know
He doesn't mind the snow and he doesn't mind the rain
But all December you will hear him at your window pane
Singing again and again and again and again and again

Christmas is a coming and the bells begin to ring
The holly's in the window and the birds begin to sing
Now I don't take time to worry and don't take time to fret
And the more you give at Christmastime the more you get
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
The more you give at Christmastime the more you get

Christmas is a coming and the egg is in the nog
Please give a friendly man a friendly little dog
If you haven't got a friendly dog, a friendly cat'll do
If you haven't got a friendly cat, may God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
If you haven't got a friendly, cat may God bless you

Christmas is a coming, the lights are on the tree
How about a turkey leg for poor old me
If you haven't got a turkey leg, a turkey wing will do
If you haven't got a turkey wing, may God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
If you haven't got a turkey wing, may God bless you

Christmas is a coming and the cider's in the keg
If I had a mug of cider then I wouldn't have to beg
If you haven't got a mug of cider, half a mug will do
If you haven't got half a mug, may God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
If you haven't got half a mug, may God bless you
If you haven't got a thing for me, may God bless you
