Sittin’ in your garden grove,
Watching the flowers grow,
Tell you whats on my head,
You didn’t hear a thing I said,
And Im breaking down from it all,
See your point, but not at all.
You’ll still be rockin’ til the earliest sun rise,
You’ll wait a minute, til’ the glorious moonlight,
Oh no, can you feel it in your spine?
The force of gravity and weight on your mind,
And then I got sick from the cigarette,
Even more when I think of it.
So let’s not make some kind of scene,

'Cause I don’t wanna waste my time,
Always trying to be right,
Don’t really know what to do, whats going on with you?
Whats running through your head, whats that last thing you said?
You said, are you gonna waste my time? Are you gonna be mine?

Easy come, easy go, l so put it down and let it go,
You tell me something I don’t want to know,
And I can see you through my ruby reds,
Break.

You said, are you gonna waste my time? Are you gonna be mine?
You said, are you gonna waste my time? Are you gonna be mine?
You said, are you gonna waste my time? Are you gonna be mine?
You said, are you gonna waste my time? Are you gonna be mine?
