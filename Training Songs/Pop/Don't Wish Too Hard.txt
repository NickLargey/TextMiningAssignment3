Don't wish too hard for what you want
Or then you might get it
And then when you get it
You might find you didn't want it at all
And don't go lookin' far love to come
Or then it might find you
And then when it finds you
You might wish that you had never been born

Oh how I wished for you and now you're here
Now I wish that you would disappear
And go away

My poor heart's repeatin'
It can't stand the beatin'
That it's been takin'
I can't tell if you're fakin'
Every time you're making love to me

One day soon I'm gonna change my tune and
Without hesitating
I'll be leaving you waiting
Waiting at the gate for me
Then you'll wish for me and I won't be here
So long darlin'
I'll just disappear
And go away

Oh how I wished for you and now you're here
Now I wish that you would disappear
And go away
Don't wish too hard for what you want or then you might get it
And then when you get it
You might find you didn't want it at all
And
Don't go lookin' for love to come or then it might find you
And then when it finds you
You'll find
What you really wanted and what you really wished for
You never really wanted at all
