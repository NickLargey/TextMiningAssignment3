Every morning, every evening
Ain't we got fun
Not much money, oh, but honey
Ain't we got fun
The rent's unpaid dear
And we haven't a bus
But smiles were made dear
For people like us

In the Winter in the Summer
Don't we have fun
Times are bum and getting bummer
Still we have fun
There's nothing surer
The rich get rich and the poor get poorer
In the meantime, in between time
Ain't we got fun

Every morning, every evening
Ain't we got fun
Not much money, oh, but honey
Ain't we got fun
The rent's unpaid dear
And we haven't a bus
But smiles were made dear
For people like us

In the Winter in the Summer
Don't we have fun
Times are bum and getting bummer
Still we have fun
There's nothing surer
The rich get rich and the poor get poorer
In the meantime, in between time
Ain't we got fun

Every Summer, every Winter
Don't we have fun
Twins and cares dear come in pairs dear
Still we have fun
When I first saw you
I had but one thought
And then you chased me
Until you were caught

From the day I whispered
May I please hold your hand
You progressed and I'm impressed
And I think you're grand
I'm not too clever
But I'd like to say those words forever
Thank you kind sir I won't mind sir
Ain't we got fun
