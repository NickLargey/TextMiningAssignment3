I thought I'd found the man of my dreams
Now it seems this is how the story ends
He's gonna turn me down and say
Can't we be friends?

I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long, I can see the way this ends
He's gonna turn me down and say
Can't we be friends?

Never again, through with love, through with men
They play the game without shame, and who's to blame?

I thought I'd found a man I could trust
What a bust, this is how the story ends
He's gonna turn me down and say
Can't we be friends?

Why should I care?
Though he gave me the air
Why should I cry, heave a sigh and wonder why?

I should have seen the signal to stop
What a flop, this is how the story ends
I'll let him turn me down and say
Can't we be friends?
