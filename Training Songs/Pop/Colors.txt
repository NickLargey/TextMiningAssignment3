Oh, what a feeling
Look what we've overcome
Oh, I'm gonna wave-a-wave my flag
And count all the reasons
We are the champions
There ain't no turning, turning back

Saying "Oh, can't you taste the feeling, feeling"
Saying "Oh, we all together singing"

Look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now
There's beauty in the unity we've found
I'm ready, I'm ready
We still got a long way
But look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now
Hands up for your colors

Ready the people
A new day has just begun
And I wear my colors on my back (celebrate, celebrate)
We're created equal
One race, and that's human
Can't wait 'til they all see all see, that

Saying "Oh, can't you taste the feeling, feeling"
Saying "Oh, we all together singing"

Look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now (there's beauty)
There's beauty in the unity we've found
I'm ready, I'm ready
We still got a long way
But look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now
Hands up for your colors
One hand, two hands for your colors
Show your true colors

Here we go (here we go)
Let's put on a show (let's put on a show right now)
Let me see your hands up
Let me see your hands up
Here we go

Look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now
There's beauty in the unity we've found
I'm ready, I'm ready
We still got a long way
But look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now
Hands up for your colors
(There's beauty in the unity we've found)
One hand, two hands for your colors
(There's beauty in the unity we've found)
Show your true colors

Here we go (here we go)
Let's put on a show
Hands up for your colors
Represent your country
Raise your flag
Show your true colors
