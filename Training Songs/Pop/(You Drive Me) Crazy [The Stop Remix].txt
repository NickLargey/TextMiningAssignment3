Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something, what can I do
Baby, you spin me around
Oh, the earth is moving, but I can't feel the ground

Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see
Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh crazy
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

Oh oh
Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me, I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you

Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh crazy
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

Crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy
But it feels alright
Every day and every night

You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh crazy (you make me feel alright)
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
Yeah
Oh crazy (you make me feel alright)
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
