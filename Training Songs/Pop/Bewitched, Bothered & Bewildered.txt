After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy I awake
With no Bromo Seltzer handy,
I don't even shake.

Men are not a new sensation;
I've done pretty well, I think.
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again
Beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Listen, baby
I couldn't sleep
And wouldn't sleep
Until I could sleep where I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart but what of it?
My mistake I agree.

Oh she's such a laugh, and I love it
Although the laugh's on me.

Ooh I'll sing to him
Bring springs to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Oh you're so cute
Oh she's kept enough, she's slept enough
And yet, where it counts she's adapt enough

Aha

Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

When he talks he is seeking
Words to get off his chest.

Horizontally speaking
She's at her very best.

Oh we've seen a lot
I mean a lot
And now we're like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
Oh, we're vexed again
Perplexed again
Thank God we can't be over-sexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
