Amor amor amor 
This word so sweet that I repeat 
Means I have adored you 
Amor amor my love 
Will you deny this heart that I have placed before you 
I can't find another word with meaning so clear 
My lips try to whisper sweeter things in your ear 
Somehow or other nothing sounds quite so dear 
As this soft caressing word I know 
Amor amor my love 
When you're away there is no day and nights are lonely 
Amor amor my love 
Make my life divine say you'll be mine and love me only 
I can't find another word with meaning so clear 
My lips try to whisper sweeter things in your ear 
Somehow or other nothing sounds quite so dear 
As this soft caressing word I know 
Amor amor my love 
When you're away there is no day and nights are lonely 
Amor amor my love 
Make my life divine say you'll be mine and love me only 
Make my life divine say you'll be mine and love me only 
Make my life divine say you'll be mine and love me only
