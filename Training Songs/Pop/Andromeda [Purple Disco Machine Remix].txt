When the passing looks to die for
Take it in your heart now, lover
When the case is out
And tired and sodden
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart

Back to when it was cool
'Cause there's no substitute
Who even knows the truth?
The truth, the truth

Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart

Outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
I took it to the right man
Took it all back
When the courts were closing
It was Bobby gracing
I know that
A bullet to the right man
He pulled it back

Back to when it was cool
'Cause there's no substitute
Who even knows the truth?
The truth, the truth

Caught in your eyes
Stacks of lights
Come streaming back
Make it for the best times
Growing pains, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times

Take it in your heart now, lover
Where it all goes down

It was Bobby gracing
A bullet to the right man

Back to when it was cool
'Cause there's no substitute
Who even knows the truth?
The truth, the truth

Take it in your heart now, lover
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart now

Where it all goes down
Take it in your heart now, lover
Take it in your heart now, lover
Where it all goes down
