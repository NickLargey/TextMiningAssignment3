And I gave you my all

And now I don't know about you
But I know I'm gonna be fine
And I gave you my all, ahh

Took you places that you ain’t been (that you ain't been)
But I decline your call all the time
‘Cause you tried to play me (you tried to play me, yeah)
I would have made you my queen
But you took me for granted (for granted)
I’ve lost so much love and trust for you

Went through struggle and shame
You was at the bus stop in rain (in rain, yeah, yeah)

And now I’m walking out the door
And there is no debate (no, there's no)
