Down by the river, I was drawn by your grace
Into tempest of oblivion and to the lovers-place
I was stuck in a puddle, full of tears and unwise
Dark doings now I know, that we've paid unlike

Honey I know, hey when we walked arm in arm
I felt like we can throw away the falseness of our past
And I know too it's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window
Thats what those lovers do
