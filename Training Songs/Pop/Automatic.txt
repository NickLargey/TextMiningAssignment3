Look at my body, it's so official
Every time they see me, they shoot over like a missile
Just wanna party, don't mean no issues
If that's your girlfriend over there, I think she miss you

When I'm on, when I'm on the dance floor tell the Dj give me more
Up so loud the speakers go, the beat makes my body go

I'm begging for up now, spinning round and round
Wanna tear it down, I can't control it

When the beat goes boom, I hit the room, my body goes in automatic 
When the beat goes boom, I hit the room, my body goes in automatic 
 
They crowd around me, every time I enter
You could see the hot beat pumping a lot than a speaker
So get above me, with all them whispers
Cause I'm the type of girl that's gonna hurt your feelings

When I'm on, when I'm on the dance floor tell the Dj give me more
Up so loud the speakers go, the beat makes my body go

I'm begging for up now, spinning round and round
Wanna tear it down, I can't control it

When the beat goes boom, I hit the room, my body goes in automatic 
When the beat goes boom, I hit the room, my body goes in automatic 
 
When I'm on, when I'm on the dance floor tell the Dj give me more
Up so loud the speakers go, the beat makes my body go 

When I'm on, when I'm on the dance floor tell the Dj give me more
Up so loud the speakers go, the beat makes my body go

I'm begging for up now, spinning round and round
Wanna tear it down, I can't control it
