Dark is the night,
Sad is my heart, 
Blue is the moon,
It's over.
Now I must dream, 
Dream of her warm embrace.

Soft were her lips,
Tender her touch,
Now she is gone,
It's over.
And I must walk,
Walk in a lonely place.

When we met, the world was a laughing thing.
And each season, had its reason,
For returning to spring.

Dark is the night,
Sad is my heart,
Blue is the moon,
It's over.
And I must dream,
Dream of her warm embrace.

Dark is the night,
Sad is my heart,
Blue is the moon,
It's over.
And I must dream,
Dream of her warm embrace.
