There'll be bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see
There'll be love and laughter and peace ever after
Tomorrow when the world is free

(The shepherd will tend his sheep)
(The valley will bloom again)
And Jimmy will go to sleep
In his own little room again

There'll be bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see
There'll be bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait?and see
