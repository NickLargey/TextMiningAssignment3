What am I fighting, afraid of losing?
Itâ??s like Iâ??m not in control.
Iâ??m watching myself, Iâ??ll die thinking you wonâ??t be around.
You know you got my heart on lock, and even if I were to run, I canâ??t go

Go oh; I donâ??t want to go oh
Gotta let it go oh, I donâ??t wanna go, I canâ??t breathe
Without you I get weak, and I canâ??t breathe, and I canâ??t breathe
And I canâ??t breathe without you with me and I canâ??t live, and I canâ??t live without you, I canâ??t
Breathe and I canâ??t breathe, and I canâ??t breathe without you with me and I canâ??t live here and I canâ??t live without you.

Maybe I make believe, youâ??re no different, but you got me in love, Donâ??t wanna be alone again, I cannot function ,without you here, my indecisions and all my fears get higher higher day by day, higher higher but I canâ??t go

Go oh; I donâ??t want to go oh
Gotta let it go oh, I donâ??t wanna go, I canâ??t breathe
Without you I get weak, and I canâ??t breathe, and I canâ??t breathe
And I canâ??t breathe without you with me and I canâ??t live, and I canâ??t live without you, I canâ??t
Breathe and I canâ??t breathe, and I canâ??t breathe without you with me and I canâ??t live here and I canâ??t live without you.

Itâ??s just not fair that, Iâ??m lost in your love that I just canâ??t breathe, just canâ??t breathe.
Iâ??m coming up, coming up for a breath(x4)

Go oh; I donâ??t want to go oh
Gotta let it go oh, I donâ??t wanna go, I canâ??t breathe
Without you I get weak, and I canâ??t breathe, and I canâ??t breathe
And I canâ??t breathe without you with me and I canâ??t live, and I canâ??t live without you, I canâ??t
Breathe and I canâ??t breathe, and I canâ??t breathe without you with me and I canâ??t live here and I canâ??t live without you.
