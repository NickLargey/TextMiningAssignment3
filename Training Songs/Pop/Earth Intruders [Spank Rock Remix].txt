We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches

Turmoil
Carnage

Here come the earth intruders
We are the paratroopers,
The beat of sharpshooters
Comes straight from voodoo

Shower of goodness coming to end the doubtâ??pouring over
Shower of goodness coming to end

We are the earth intruders
We are the sharpshooters
Flock of parachuters
Necessary voodoo

I have guided my bones through some voltage
And love them still
And love them to

Metallic
Carnage
Furiousity
Feel the speed

We are the earth intruders
We are the sharpshooters,
Flock of parachuters
Necessary voodoo

There is turmoil out there
Carnage
Rambling
What is to do but dig
Dig bones out of earth?

Mud graves
Timber
Morbid trenches

Here come the earth intruders
Thereâ??ll be no resistance
We are the cannoneerers
Necessary voodoo

We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders,
Muddy with twigs and branches

Forgive this tribe

We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
We are the earth intruders

we are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Marching
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Marching
