Mountains high
Rivers flowing
Skies of blue beckon to Me
Restless soul
Keep on going
Spending life being free, being free

(Well) And I can't get You off My mind
No matter what I do
I just can't get You off My mind
I turn around and there You are
You're everywhere I go, You're every One that I know
You're everything I see
I don't know what's happening to Me
What's happening to Me

Well, it's a perfect day
The sun is shining
I wish that You could share it with Me
Each night I dream
I start crying
Can't You hear Me call out Your name?
I call out Your Name

And I can't get You off My mind
No matter what I do
I just can't get You off My mind
No matter how I try
I just can't get You off My mind
I turn around and there You are
I just can't get You off My mind
No matter what I do
I just can't get You off My mind
