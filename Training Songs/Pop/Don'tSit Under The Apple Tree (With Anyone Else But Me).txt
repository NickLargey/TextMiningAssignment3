I wrote my mother
I wrote my father 
And now I'm writing you too
I'm sure of mother
I'm sure of father
Now I wanna be sure of you
 
Don't sit under the apple tree  with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Just remember that I've been true to nobody else but you
So just be true to me
 
Don't go walking down lovers' lane with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Don't start showing off all your charms in somebody else's arms
You must be true to me
I'm so afraid that the plans we made underneath those moonlit skies
Will fade away and you're bound to stray if the stars get in your eyes
So, don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
You're my L-O-V-E.
 
Don't sit under the apple tree  with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Just remember that I've been true to nobody else but you
So just be true to me
 
Don't go walking down lovers' lane with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Don't start showing off all your charms in somebody else's arms
You must be true to me
I'm so afraid that the plans we made underneath those moonlit skies
Will fade away and you're bound to stray if the stars get in your eyes
So, don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
