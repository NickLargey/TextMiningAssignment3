Outside a storm was blowin', 
And the rain was whippin' down, 
But she'd set her mind on going, 
to visit out of town. 
Give my love to your mum and dad I said, 
As i kissed her at the door, 
and the words came automatically, 
Like a thousand times before. 
Drive safely darlin', 
There's a long long road ahead, 
And the weatherman says the freezing rain may turn to snow, 
Mind how you go, 
Drive safely darlin' 
Mind how you go, 
Drive safely darlin' 

It was kinda fun without her, 
Just being on my own, 
But as usual by the evening, 
I was wishing she was home, 
And I thought to myself when she gets back, 
I'll show her how I care, 
And on that god forsaken night, 
I said me a little prayer. 
Drive safely darlin', 
There's a long long road ahead, 
And the weatherman says the freezing rain may turn to snow, 
Mind how you go, 
Drive safely darlin' 
Mind how you go, 
Drive safely darlin' 

Well I waited and I worried, 
As the long night dragged on by, 
And I thought my prayers where answered, 
When a car drew up outside, 
But a stranger stood there by the door, 
And I knew it at a glance, 
He said, 
There's been an accident, 
She didn't stand a chance. 

Drive safely darlin', 
That was our last goodbye, 
Till the day I die I'll wonder why I let her go, 
In the wind and snow, 
Drive safely darlin' 
I'll never know, 
Drive safely darlin', 
I miss her so, 
Drive safely darlin' 
I'll never know
