Here they come 
A lonely boy and a lonely gir-ir-irl
They can't say 
Where they're goin'
Lo-onely...
With no money to spend
They can't sink 
Any-why lower
Some people laugh all day
Some people cry, cry, cry-why
In the ni-ight

This could be (this could be-ee)
The cosest thing to heaven 
I have ever know-own (I've ever known)
I've ever know-own

Can't try
Can't try-why a-any harder
Whose turn is it now 
To win whi-ile we lo-ose
Livi-i-in'
Living at our expense
While we discover
Can't try, can't try-why
Any harder

This could be (this could be-ee)
The closest thing to heaven 
I have ever know-own (I've ever known)
I've ever know-own

Hey, what you gonna do
What you gonna do-oo
Call me the king of foo-ools

(Yeah) This could be (this could be-ee, yeah-eah-eah)
The closest thing to heaven
I have ever know-own (I have ever known)
I've ever know-own, ooh-hooh-hooh-ooh
This could be-ee (this could be)
The closest thing to heaven
I have ever known (I've ever known)
I've ever, yeah...
This could be-ee-ee 
**(This could be-ee) the closest thing [fade]
**Call me the king of fools, call me the king of fools
Call me, call me, call me the king of foo-oo-ools
