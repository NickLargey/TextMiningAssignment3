Oh, lay lay lay lay
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, hey hey

I thought that love would conquer all
That nothing could break my fall
The moment you left my side, oh baby
And now there's nothing left to say
Ever since you went away
I've been yearning for you deep inside

I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
When I think about the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how, can I go on, can I go on

Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours
Mine and yours
Will I ever get over cause I've come to know
That it's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone

If I had only had a clue
That I'd end up losing you
I might of held on to my heart, oh girl
Taking for granted you'd be mine
Till the end of time
Has torn my world apart

And I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
When I think about the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how, can I go on, can I go on

Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours
Mine and yours
Will I ever get over cause I've come to know
That it's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone

I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
When I think, think about the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how, can I go on, can I go on

Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours
Mine and yours
Will I ever get over cause I've come to know
That it's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone

After the love is gone
I must go on
I gotta be strong
After the love is gone
I can't believe it, but she's gone
But I gotta be strong
I gotta gotta gotta be, gotta gotta gotta be
Gotta gotta gotta be strong
Oh, after the love is gone
