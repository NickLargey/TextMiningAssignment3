There's nothing left for me to do
Just like time and time and time again
What else is left for me to prove?
But when it comes around
I can't help falling down
Is this the state of so-called pleasure?
Or just the weight of stones & feathers
I'm not myself
Maybe I'm never
Just like tear that fades away
Just like a word I can't express or can't explain
A thousand voices in my brain
I wish they'd comfort me
Instead it's torturing
Is this the state of so-called pleasure?
Or just the way I'm made to measure
I'm not myself
Maybe I'm never
When all is said and done
I confess I've had enough
Is this the state of so-called pleasure?
Or just a chill that lasts forever
I'm not myself maybe I'm never
Is this the state of so-called pleasure?
Or just a break in heavy weather
I'm not myself
Maybe I'm never
