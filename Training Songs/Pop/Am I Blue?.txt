I'm just a man, a lonely man
Waiting on the weary shore
I'm just a man who's only human
One you should feel sorry for

It was a morning, long before dawn
Without a warning I found she was gone
How could she do it, why should she do it
She never done it before

Am I blue, am I blue
Ain't these tears in these eyes telling you
How can you ask me am I blue
Why, wouldn't you be too
If each plan with your woman
Done fell through

There was a time
When I was her only one
But now I'm the sad and lonely one, lonely
Was I gay, until today
Now she's gone, and we're through
Am I blue
