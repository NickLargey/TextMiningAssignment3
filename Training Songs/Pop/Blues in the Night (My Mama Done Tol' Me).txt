BLUES IN THE NIGHT
Woody Herman
- words by Johnny Mercer, music by Harold Arlen
- written for a film called "Hot Nocturne", this song became

My mama done tol' me
When I was in kneepants
My mama done tol' me, Son!
A woman'll sweet talk
And give ya the big eye
But when the sweet talkin's done
A woman's a two-face
A worrisome thing who'll leave ya t' sing the blues in the night

Now the rain's a-fallin'
Hear the train a-callin'
Whoo-ee (My mama done tol' me)
Hear that lonesome whistle
Blowin' 'cross the trestle
Whoo-ee (My mama done tol' me)
A whoo-ee-duh whoo-ee
Ol' clickety clack's a-echoin' back the blues in the night (Hum)
My mama was right, there's blues in the night
