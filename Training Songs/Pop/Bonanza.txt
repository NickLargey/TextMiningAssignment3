We chased lady luck, 'til we finally struck
Bonanza
With a gun and a rope and a hat full of hope
We planted our family tree

We got a hold of a pot full of gold
Bonanza
With a horse and a saddle
And a ring full of cattle
How rich can a fellow be?

On this land we put our brand
Cartwright is the name
Fortune smiled
The day we filed the Ponderosa claim

Here in the west, we're livin' in the best
Bonanza
If anyone fights any one of us
He's got a fight with me
Bonanza

Hoss and Joe and Adam know
Every rock and pine
No one works, fights or eats
Like those boys of mine

Here we stand in the middle of a grand
Bonanza
With a gun and a rope and a hatful of hope
We planted our family tree

We got a hold of a potful of gold
Bonanza
With a houseful of friends where the rainbow ends
How rich can a fellow be?

On this land we put our brand
Cartwright is the name
Fortune smiled, the day
We filed the Ponderosa claim

Here in the west we're living in the best
Bonanza
With the friendliest, fightingist, lovingist band
That ever set foot in the promised land

And we're happier than them all
That's why we call it
Bonanza, bonanza, bonanza
