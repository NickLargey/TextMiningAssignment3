A woman's heart is filled with passion,
A woman's heart is filled with lust,
If you don't believe that these things happen,
Could be the biggest mistake that a man can make;

A woman's night is filled with dreaming,
Of the perfect man, who may not be you,
If we don't see what she's been missing,
Could be the biggest mistake that a man can make;

She wants to get near to you, don't turn her away,
She wants to get through to you, she wants to say;

Give me your night and I will show you my passion,
Give me your lust and I will drink you dry,
Give me your dreams and I will show you a lover,
Give me your heart and I will hold you close,
And I will love you till the day I die;

A woman's day is filled with longing,
For a little romance and company,
If we don't look or just don't listen,
Could be the biggest mistake that a man can make;

She wants to get near to you, don't turn her away,
She wants to get through to you, she wants you to say;

Give me your night and I will show you my passion,
Give me your lust and I will drink you dry,
Give me your dreams and I will show you a lover,
Give me your heart and I will hold you close,
And I will love you 'til the day I die;

Give me your night and I will show you my passion,
Give me your lust and I will drink you dry,
Give me your dreams and I will show you a lover,
Give me your heart and I will hold you close,
And I will love you till the day I die;

A woman's heart, a woman's heart,
A woman's heart is filled with passion,
A woman's heart is filled with lust,
A woman's heart is filled with dreaming,
A woman's heart is yours forever.
