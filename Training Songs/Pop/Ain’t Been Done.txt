I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done

I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done

Can't beat me I'm a show sharp winner (winner)
One of a kind, I'm original (original)
I'm so ill, gonna need a painkiller
Stealing the show like a criminal (criminal)

Don't fight for all the leaders
Give a little and you might get some
This one's for the non-believers
All together now everyone, go!

I'm a do it like it ain't been done
On top only just began
Better believe I'll be your number one
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
And I hope you're holding on
'Cause I'm goin', go and gone
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done

I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done

Both hands tied and I get gold medals
Still alive and I'm going hard
Make my mark and I'm breaking all records
You know me, I'm a superstar

Don't fight for all the leaders
Give a little and you might get some
This one's for the non-believers
All together now everyone, go!

I'm a do it like it ain't been done
On top only just began

'Cause I'm goin', go and gone
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done

Like it ain't been done
Like it, like it ain't been done
Like it ain't been, like it ain't been done
Like it ain't been done, done, done
Like it ain't been done

I'm a do it like it ain't been done
