Keep trying, keep keep on trying 
Keep trying, keep keep on trying 

Everybody's saying 
What can we do to make it better? 
Day out and day in 
We're standing on the edge of forever 

Can we make it? Can we try? 
Can we make it? Can we make it right? 

And the news just keeps on breaking Â­ 
It's breaking now more than ever 
Everybody aiming 
To be a name and not a number 

Can we make it? Can we try? 
Can we make it? Can we make it right? 
Can we make it? Can we make it right? 

Who really cares what clothes we wear 
Who styles our hair 
Or what goes on in our heads, tell me 
Who really cares what books we've read 
What boots we wear 
All that matters is we are there 
We are there, you can count me in 

Keep on trying, Keep on trying 

Can we make it? Can we make it right? 
One more time 

Don't you spend your time now wandering about forever 
Day in and day outÂ  now Don't you waste Don't you waste Don't you wasteâ?¦ 

Can we make it? Can we make it right? 
Can we make it? Can we make it right? 
You've gotta rock 'n roll you gotta save your soul 
You gotta make it right, you gotta work through the night 
You gotta move on up, you gotta get on down 
Spinning round and round and round
