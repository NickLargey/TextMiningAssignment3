Sometimes you let your tongue and heart 
get the best of you and me.
I'm not trying to be cruel, 
That’s just what we do.
You know that it's true.

You let the cold speak when you’re talking to me.
(This is a just love)
Don't let the cold speak when you’re talking to me.
(This is a just love)

Say what you mean, but always love.
Say what you mean, but always love.
Don't let the cold speak.

To be the most beautiful song that I’ve ever heard.
You have to make the notes and melodies find my heart
and twirl me around.

You let the cold speak when you’re talking to me.
(This is a just love)
Don't let the cold speak when you’re talking to me.
(This is a just love)

Say what you mean, but always love.
Say what you mean, but always love.

Don't let the cold speak.
Don't let the cold speak.

Your mouth is an open grave. Your heart overflows with death.
I don't need to see straight through you just to see what's inside. 
To change the fruit, you've gotta change the root.

Say what you mean, but always love.
