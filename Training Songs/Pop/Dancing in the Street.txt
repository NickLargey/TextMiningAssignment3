Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street

They'll be dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
In New York City
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be records playing
Dancin', swayin'
Dancing in the street

Well, doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So every guy grab a girl
Every night around the world

There'll be dancing in the street
This is an invitation across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughin', singin'
And music swingin'
Dancing in the street

Philadelphia, PA
Baltimore, D.C. now
Can't forget the motor city
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be dancin', swayin'
Records playing
Dancing in the street

Well now, doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So every guy grab a girl
Every night around the world

There'll be dancing in the street
This is the invitation across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughin', singin'
And music swingin'
Dancing in the street
