Doggone I've done it, I've fallen in love
Doggone, it hit me from heaven up above
The day I met him, my, I knew I was gone
My heart went kerplunk oh, boy I was sunk
Doggone I've done it, I fell with a thud
It must be springtime 'cos it's in my blood
Mr. Cupid sneaked behind and gave me a shove
Doggone I've done it, I've fallen in love, oh you dove!

I don't use strong expressions
I'm known for my repression
Nobody ever heard me swear
But something's gone and changed me
It's really disarranged me
I'm cuttin' loose and I don't care

Doggone I've done it, I've fallen in love
Doggone, it hit me from heaven above
The day I met him I just knew I was gone
Heart went kerplunk, oh boy I was sunk
Doggone I've done it, I fell with a thud
It must be springtime 'cos it's in my blood
Mr. Cupid sneaked behind and gave me a shove
Doggone I've done it, I've fallen in love.

Doggone I've done it I've fallen in love
Doggone, it hit me from heaven above
Day I met him I knew I was gone
Heart went kerplunk, oh boy I was sunk
Doggone I've done it I fell with a thud
It must be springtime 'cos it's in my blood
Mr. Cupid gave me a shove
Doggone I've done it, I've fallen in love.
