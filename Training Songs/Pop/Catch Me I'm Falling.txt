I can't believe that I'm feeling this way about you
I'm so confused that all of my thoughts surround you
Guess there's just nothing to do
But spend my whole life lovin' you
Oh, I'm fallin', catch me, I'm fallin' in love with you

You hypnotising, your eyes mesmerise everything I do
Now that you're near, I'll always fear living without you
I don't have any doubt
You are what I'm all about
I'm fallin', catch me, I'm fallin' in love with you

All of the signs point one way
Leaves me with one thing to say

My head's in the clouds and I'm singin' out loud about you
To tell you the truth, I'll find any excuse to be near you
Maybe tomorrow you'll see
You'll spend your whole life lovin' me
I'm fallin', catch me, I'm fallin' in love with you
Catch me, I'm fallin' in love with you
Catch me, I'm fallin' in love with you
