It's always about you
Colors faded
Into an ocean, blue wine breaking
Unless we forget all of our regrets, I’m written with you
I deeply do exalt you, darling, I do

If I should remain, you compensate me
I can repay with love
Never say never, I'm down forever
It's just a shame, because there's something about you, no
Oh, there's something about you, no

Hey, baby, I really do, really do, j’adore you
Hey, baby, I really do, really do, j’adore you
But you're so complicated, ah
You're too complicated, ah
You're so complicated
You're too complicated
You're so complicated
You're too complicated

It's always the wrong thing that makes us feel right
Undressing, full moons and late nights
And if we accept each other for less, I'm ridin' with you
I deeply do exalt you, you know that I do

If I should remain, you compensate me
I can repay with love
Never say never, I'm down forever
It's just a shame, because there's something about you
Oh, there's something about you

Hey, baby, I really do, really do, j’adore you
Hey, baby, I really do, really do, j’adore you
But you're so complicated, ah
You're too complicated, ah
You're so complicated
You're too complicated
You're so complicated
You're too complicated

You're so complicated
You're too complicated
You're so complicated
You're too complicated
