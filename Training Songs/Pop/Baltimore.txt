Beat up little seagull on a marble stair
Tryin' to find the ocean, looking everywhere
Hard times in the city, in a hard town by the sea
Ain't nowhere to run to, there ain't nothing here for free

Hooker on the corner waiting for a train
Drunk lyin' on the sidewalk, sleeping in the rain
And they hide their faces and they hide their eyes
'Cause the city is dying and they don't know why

Oh Baltimore, man, it's hard just to live
Oh Baltimore, man, it's hard just to live
Just to live

Get my sister,Sandy, and my little brother,Ray
Buy a big old wagon to haul us all away
Live out in the country where the mountains high
Never comin' back here 'till the day I die

Oh Baltimore, man, it's hard just to live
Oh Baltimore, man, it's hard just to live
Just to live
