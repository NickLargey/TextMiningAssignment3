La la la la la

I dare you!

All of my life, too late
To you showed out with perfect timing
Now, here we are, you rock it
Our fingers are stuck in the socket
It's just a mature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

La la la la la
Truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la oh, oh, oh, oh
I dare you

Of all the millions, on the planet
You're the one is keeping me on it
You know I like you, and nobody's business
And your are my witness
It's just a mature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

La la la la la
Truth or dare on the dance floor
La la la la la oh, oh, oh, oh
I dare you

Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
I dare you to touch me
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

La la la la la
I dare you
