I live in this fantasy
Where everything is amplified
Senses heighten in a flash
And everything just comes alive
This pressure all inside of me
Is sexual anxiety

Baby, there’s a lot of freaky shit running in my mind
That I can’t say, but I know I can demonstrate
And I can let my body explain
I know I can demonstrate
So I’ma make it simple and plain
You just need to come over
Come over, come over, yeah
I can just demonstrate

I’m arrested by the night
And only you can set me free
Guilty, but I’m not ashamed
I’m exactly where I wanted to be, yeah
I leave the door, open wide
In hopes that you will sneak inside

Baby, there’s a lot of freaky shit running in my mind
That I can’t say, but I know I can demonstrate
And I can let my body explain
I know I can demonstrate
So I’ma make it simple and plain
Bring your ass over
Come over
So I can just demonstrate

Come over, we need to be closer
Come over, come over
I’m thinking

Baby, there’s a lot of freaky shit running in my mind
That I can’t say, but I know I can demonstrate
No I can't
And I can let my body explain
I know I can demonstrate, uh
So I’ma make it simple and plain
You just need to come over
I can just demonstrate
