You're the end of the rainbow, my pot of gold
You're daddy's little girl to have and to hold
A precious gem is what you are
You're mommy's bright and shining star.

You're the spirit of Christmas, my star on the tree
You're the Easter Bunny to mommy and me
You're sugar, you're spice, you're everything nice
And you're daddy's little girl.

You're the treasure I cherish, so sparkling and bright
You were touched by the holy and beautiful light
Like angels that sing, a heavenly thing
And you're daddy's little girl.
