Oh pretty Emma 
You sweet pretender
Why don't you stay around?
What's your dilemma? 
Won't you please tell me Emma
I don't wanna lay you down
Sometimes it's hard to bend
Turn around 
You better start all over again

Please tell me Emma [Repeat x2] 

Don't get excited 
You'll be invited
Wait for the wheel to turn
Don't be impatient 
You'll get liberated
Everybody's got to learn
You have got to make a contribution
Then you can start to draw your own conclusion

Please tell me Emma [Repeat x4] 
Emma [Repeat x3] 
I'm still waiting [Repeat x2]
Emma [Repeat x2]

Sometimes it's hard to bend
Turn around 
You'd better start all over again
All over again

Please tell me Emma [Repeat x4]
Emma [Repeat x3]
You'd better start relating 
Start relating
