When the music's loud
And there is nothing to say
You can only watch me move 
You can only watch me sway

See how I turn.
And never walk away
See how I hang around
How I "patiently await"

You're so far away
Wouldn’t you agree
It’s time to make your move
Make your way over to me

Come closer now
If you wanna talk to me
Come tell me now
Do you like what you see?

Come here- sit down
If you wanna get next to me
Wont you tell me now
Do you like what you see?
Do you like what you see?

I use your high
And if you can follow my see’s
How take you to a place you’ve never been

If I showed you everything
I'd have you on your knees
So let’s take it slow
Like a long night's sweet dreams

You're so far away
Wouldn’t you agree
It’s time to make your move
Make your way over to me

Come closer now
If you wanna talk to me
Come tell me now
Do you like what you see?

Come here, sit down
If you wanna get next to me
Wont you tell me now
Do you like what you see?
Do you like what you see?

Here I am right before your eyes
I think you see something that you like
I hope now you realized
I’ve got you hypnotized

All alone in a crowded room
There’s only me and you
Come baby- come to me soon, 
Before the music through

Come closer now
If you wanna talk to me
Come tell me now
Do you like what you see?

Come here, sit down
If you wanna get next to me
Want you tell me now
Do you like what you see?
Do you like what you see?
