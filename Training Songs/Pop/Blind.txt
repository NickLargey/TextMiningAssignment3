[Chorus]
Your love is blind
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
And you got it you got it
You got it for me
Your love is blind
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
And you got it you got it
For everybody
Your love is

Marked it down the street
Turned to sender
Usually I'm real quick to trash what I don't like
And won't look twice
When it comes to love it's no different
Hurt me once and it could be ending
No more tries, I'll say goodbye

But you're not like me
You see past me
And constantly forgive
Again, again, and again

[Chorus]

How can someone owns the planet
Everything in it and around it
Want my heart with all its scars
Full of stains and sometimes like garbage
Fit to be torn up and discarded
How could I, stand in your sights

But you're not like me
You see past me
And constantly forgive
Again, again, and again

[Chorus]

Patient and faithful
It's unconditional
It's unconditional
More than any love I've known
I'm grateful, so thankful
This is incredible
Where would I be without your love

Your love is blind
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
And you got it you got it
You got it for me
Your love is blind
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
And you got it you got it
For everybody
