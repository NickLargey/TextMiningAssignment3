Should I put my weapons down
Turn and walk away don't look around
They want me to say my lesson's learned
Didn't think I'd find so much strength in the hurt

So I pushed away that feeling
There's no truth in what they're saying
Never giving only taking
From this I'm escaping

Ascension
Just sky holding me
Oh to rise like an angel
Just to kiss every star
See the clouds silver lining
Flying high and far
Oh ascension
That's what I want

Take me to that hallowed ground
High above so safe and sound
Do your best to clip my wings
You'll see my skin is thicker than you think
So I'll lock away that madness
Keep emotion in a tight fist
Gonna hold my head up high until I reach the summit

Ascension
Just sky holding me
Oh to rise like an angel
Just to kiss every star
See the clouds silver lining
Flying high and far

Oh ascension
Ascension

Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Higher

Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Higher

Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Higher now

Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Higher

Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Much higher

Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Much higher now

Oh to rise like an angel
Just to kiss every star
See the clouds silver lining
Flying high and far

Ascension
Just sky holding me
Oh to rise like an angel
Just to kiss every star
See the clouds silver lining
Flying high and far

Oh ascension
Ascension

No matter what they say
You'll rise again some day
Through darkness into light
May all your dreams take flight
