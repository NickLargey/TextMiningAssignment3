Did you see the way she looked at me?
A honey bee got two lives and she's got me
I tried to love her back
But then I shrunk back into my wrap
And in the barrel of my gun
I hope I'm not the only one

Yes, I see the way she looked at me
She's got an eye for an awkward guy like me
I tried to love her back
Then I shrunk back into my wrap
And in the barrel of my gun
I hope I'm not the only one
And in the barrel of my gun
I hope I'm not the only one

I tried to love her back
And then I shrunk back into my wrap
And in the barrel of my gun
I hope I'm not the only one
And in the barrel of my gun
I hope I'm not the only one

I tried to love her back
And then I shrunk back into my wrap and then
I tried to love, I tried to love her back
