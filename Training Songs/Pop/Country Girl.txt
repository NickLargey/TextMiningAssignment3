New York is a long way from Texas Vegas is a long way from Abilene
I spend lots of my time flying out to LA
And if you've never been there you don't know how lonesome big towns can be
Oh what I'd give to be a country girl 
Again to be with my people, my man and my kids
To live in a house about a mile down the road from mama's
Oh Lord what I'd give to be a country girl again

I go walking down a country road at sunset
And see colors I could almost touch over head
I'd hear gentle breeze is blowing at the treetops
No out in the country there is no talk that God is dead
Oh what I'd give to be
Oh what I'd give to be a country girl again
