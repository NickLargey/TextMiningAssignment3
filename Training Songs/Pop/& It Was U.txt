You don't have to call me
My love will be there for you
And you don't have to worry
Cause our love will be there for you girl

Whenever you would call me
My love will be true
And when it had to wonder
Said my love will be there for you girl

Anytime you need me I will (come back)
Anytime you want me I will (come back)
Time is almost there and I will (come back)

And it was you, who my love was to compare

Said it was heaven at this moment
Said it was you who my love was to compare
Said it was you now I'm lucky to even call you
Oh It's sympathy without truth baby

You don't have to worry (hey) said my love will be there for you boy
Whenever you would call me
Said it wasn't me and it wasn't you and it wasn't waiting for the week, don't want to see you go

My love tends to wonder (my love tends to wonder)
When you need me I'll always be a friend
When I was undiscovered
Said it was you babe and never had a thought that wouldn't be about you

You don't have to worry
My love will be there for you babe
You said that you'd gone wonder
I will be the reason to be without you

I've never been exactly one second without you
I'm never gonna make my mind stop to think about this side of you
I'm never gonna make my bickering won't break my pride
I'm never gonna lose this sight, I never wanna see this losing strike

Anytime you need me I will (come back)
Anytime you want me I will (come back)
Time is almost there and I will (come back)

And I was you, who my love was to compare

Said it was heaven at this moment
Said it was you who my love was to compare
Said it was you now I'm lucky to even call you
Oh It's sympathy without truth baby
