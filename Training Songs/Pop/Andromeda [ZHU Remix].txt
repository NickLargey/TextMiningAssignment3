Where it, where it, where it, where it all goes down
Where it, where it, where it
Where it, where it, where it, where it all goes down
Where it, where it, where it, where it all goes down
Where it

Take it (Where it)
Take it (Where it)
Take it (Where it all goes down)
(Where it) Take it
(Where it) Take it
(Where it) Take it
(Where it all goes down)
(Where it) Take it
(Where it) Take it
(Where it) Take it
(Where it all goes down)
(Where it) Take it
(Where it) Take it
(Where it) Take it
(Where it all goes down)

Where it all goes down
Where it all goes down

Outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
I took it to the right man
Took it all back
When the courts were closing
It was Bobby gracing, I know that
(When it all goes down)
A bullet to the right man
He pulled it back

I'm gonna miss you and this moment
I'm gonna miss you undivided
I'm gonna miss you and this moment
I'm gonna miss you undivided

Where it all goes down
Where it all goes down
Where it all goes down
Take it in your heart now, lover
Where it all goes down
Take it in your heart now, lover
