When you complain and criticize 
I feel  I'm nothing in your eyes.,
It makes me feel like givin' up 
Because my best just ain't good enough.
Girl I want to provide for you and 
Do the things you want me to!
 
But oh, oh, no, don't bring me down!
Oh, baby you know!
Oh, oh, no, don't bring me down!
 
Sacrifices I will make,
I'm ready to give as well as take,
One thing I need is your respect,
One thing I can't take is your neglect,
More than anything I need your love
Then trouble's easy to rise above.
 
But oh, oh, no, don't bring me down!
Oh, baby you know!
Oh, oh, no, don't bring me down!
