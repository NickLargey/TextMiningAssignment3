Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
It was full steam ahead

Destination unknown

I asked our position
The crew didn''t know
They were all jiggin'' up in the riggin''
''Cos the captain loves to rock and roll

I looked out to sea
there was no land in sight
The ship kept on sailin'' right into the night
Ev''ryone cheerin'' nobody steerin''
But we seemed to be doin'' all right

Ev''rybody was dancing with the captain
Ev''rybody was dancing with the captain
Just look at them dancing with the captain
Well
we all had fun the whole night long
And the ship sailed on

Pretty soon the captain was out of control
He said "This here''s the plaice if you go the sole"
Keep on cruisin'' let''s have the music 
Your captain loves to rock and roll

Ev''rybody was dancing with the captain
