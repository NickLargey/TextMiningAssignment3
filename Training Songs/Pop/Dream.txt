We are all here in the act of creation
Let's fly away on our imagination
You take me to the highest heights
and into the depths of the deepest abyss

When I am dreaming, I don't know if
I'm truly asleep or if I'm awake
And when I get up, I don't know if I'm
truly awake, or if I'm still dreaming

Dream, Dream, Dream, Dream, life is
but a dream
Traveling the waves of an infiinite ocean
I feel the deepest emotion
I see a shadow of reality
Please hold me closely and take me away

I'm the first person
you're the second person
Earlier today I was in the third person
Stop cursing, start diversing
Oedipus is bliss
the sunshine will affect your mind
Stretch it out, don't doubt the amount
my brain is caught
I'm just blessed
Trip hoppin', so I flow like a stream
It's just a dream
