Don't that beat all I ever heard, dear
Don't that beat every single word
You say you've changed your mind
Oh baby, that's unkind
They say that love is blind
The more I look, the more I find

Don't that beat all I ever saw, dear
Don't that beat all and that's for sure
More fool that other guy
He's gonna get the old go-by
Well, well, don't that beat all

Play the sad, sad, story

You change your lovers fast
So our affair is past
But now the die is cast
And he lasts longest who lasts last

There's one thing more I want to say, dear.
When you come begging back one day
I'll take one look at you.
And then I'll tell you what you can do
Well, well, ha-ha,
Don't that beat all
