Baby I was a loser
Several years on the dole
An Englishman with a very high voice
Doing rock and roll

There are seas of sleeveless T-shirts
And queues around the block
And every man, woman and child
Wants to
Suck my cock

I’m in a band with my brother and my two best mates
So I never leave the house without my SM fifty-eight

Every inch of you
You know I’m gonna work it
Every inch of you
Alright

I wanted to be a doctor
I wanted to be a vet
Until I heard communication breakdown
On a TDK D ninety cassette
My entire adult life was spent defying the man
I got the whole arena eating out of my hand

Every inch of you
You know I’m gonna work it
Every inch of you

I’ve attended my last lectures
Slept through my last class
You can take your qualifications
And shove them up your ass

Every inch of you
You know I’m gonna work it
Every inch of you
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Every inch of you
Every inch of you
