Baby blue, if you know
Just how much I'd like to make you mine
Baby blue, maybe you would let me be
Your lover just one time

I watch you walk around
And you're really looking down
I know that someone hurt you long ago
At night when I'm asleep
Into all my dreams you creep
I want you more than you could ever know

I pass you every day
But you seem so far away
And I can't climb those prison wall you're in
If you could only see
Just how much you mean to me
I know that I could make you smile again
