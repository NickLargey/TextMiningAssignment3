There she is, my old gal,
There he is, my old pal,
And here am I, broken hearted!
She was mine in May, his in June,
She forgot mighty soon,
And here am I, broken hearted!

The last time that we said goodbye,
I knew that we were through!
It's bad enough that I lost her,
I only had to lose him too!

Therer they go in their joy,
Happy girl and lucky boy!
And here am I, broken hearted!
Oh, my heart will never ever know a pain
If I hadn't ever loved in vain,
But here am I, broken hearted!
