Can this be love, this crazy feeling;
The kind of love there's no concealing?
From time to time I've fallen for the spell
Of might-have-beens that seemed to start out so well.
And yet it seems this time's the right time;

No doubts, no dreams disturb my nighttime.
We seem so close, so grand, so hand in glove;
Can this be true, can this be love?
