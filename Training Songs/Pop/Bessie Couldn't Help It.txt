Bessie couldn't help it,
Bessie couldn't help it

Bessie couldn't help it any more than you could, or I could
Bessie couldn't help it though she tried to be good, Oh! So good.
She was pretty as the heavens above
Oh! Boy but how she could love
Bessie had affection that was simply wonderful,terrible
But Bessie couldn't help it any more than you could or I could.
When she smiled you were bound to fall, that's all
A boy kissed Bessie in the parlor one night
Why, oh! Why did she yell with delight
'Cause Bessie couldn't help it any more than you could, or I could

Aww! Dum pe dum now people listen
Bessie couldn't help it any more than you could or I could

She was pretty as the heavens above
And oh! Boy how that girl could love
Bessie had affection that was simply wonderful
Bop, bop be de oww.
Bessie couldn't help it any more than you could, or I could
Now when she smiled you were bound to fall, that's all. Boy!
Boy kissed Bessie in the street one night
My oh! My how she yelled with delight
Bessie couldn't help it any more than you could, or I could
