I was talkin' to the whippoorwill
He says you got a corny trill
Bob White (I'm gonna swing tonight)

I was talkin' to the mocking bird
He says you are the worst he's heard
Bob White (I'm gonna swing tonight)

Even the owl tells me you're foul
Singing those lullaby notes
(Well, he is a bring down)
(He never could swing down)
(He ain't got my high notes)

There's a lot of talk about you, Bob
(Yeah) they're sayin' you're off the cob
(Why, that's heresy, I'll sue)

Fake it, (mm) Mr. B, (yeah go)
Take it, follow me, Bob White
We're gonna break it up tonight

Now, here's a wire from the whippoorwill
(You mean my old friend Will)
Who says you got a mellow drill
(Oh, ho, ho, yes, I have)

Bob White, (oh, ho, ho)
We're in the groove tonight

Now, here's another one from the mocking bird
(What does he have to say)
That you're the best he's heard
(Ho, ho, ho that's too absurd)

Bob White, (oh, ho, ho)
We really stole the light

Even the owl threw in a towel
After you sing staccato
(And the flamingo hollered up a jingle)
(What have we brought to)

Now the consensus of opinion
(Oh, ho, ho, what does the consensus say)
That you are a solid will
(Ho, ho, ho, yes, I am)

Sing on, Mr.B
(I'm gonna swing on merrily)
Bob White
We really broke it up tonight, Bob
