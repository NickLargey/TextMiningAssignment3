Sittin' at the laundry-mat
Trying to keep clean
Twenty five women arrive on the scene
Ain't no way, baby
Ain't no way, baby
Ain't no way, baby
Ain't no way you're gonna get to me

Down in the south land
Down among the twisted vines
You ought to see my baby
Shootin' up the freeway signs
Ain't no way, baby
Ain't no way you get to me
Ain't no way, baby
Ain't no way you're gonna get to me

Goin' to the welfare
Standin' in line
The woman at the window
She won't give me a dime
Ain't no way, baby
Ain't no way you get to me
Ain't no way, baby
Ain't no way you're gonna get to me

Ain't no way, baby
Ain't no way you get to me
Ain't no way, baby
Ain't no way you're gonna get to me
