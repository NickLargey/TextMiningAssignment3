I just made an appointment
For a special rendez-vous
To see a man of miracles
And all that he can do

I checked in at reception
Put my hat onto my lap
And when he walked in dressed in white
I had a heart attack

My eyes went ooh
My voice just cooed
My mind let loose
I'll stay forever, it's up to you

Doctor I want you
Ooh, my Doctor Wanna Do
I can't get over you
Dr. do anything that ya Wanna Do

I sat down and I waited
Til I heard my name get called
It's like I'm at races
And I think I won them all

He asked me to step forward
First I caught my breath, and ran
For endless observation
In the hands of Superman

My eyes went ooh
My voice just cooed
My mind let loose
I'll stay forever, it's up to you

Doctor I want you
Ooh, my Doctor Wanna Do
I can't get over you
Dr. do anything that ya Wanna Do

Come over here and give me some medicine
Move a little closer so my head can spin
A little bit of potion makes my fever go
Get it outta me like a volcano

My eyes went ooh
My voice just cooed
My mind let loose
Ooh, Dr. Love

Doctor I want you
Ooh, my Doctor Wanna Do
I can't get over you
Dr. do anything that ya Wanna Do
