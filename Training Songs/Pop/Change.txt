Standing
At the gate of indecision
Debating
This thing called sovereignty
Questioning what I believe
My faith is bound by what I see
But there is so much more
Outside this box
I've built around my heart

Change
Change the way I'm thinking
Explain
Who You are again
Reach
Into the deepest part of my soul
I need to feel Your love inside
Oh, make a change
'Til I trust You with my life

Searching
For a hand to steady me
Praying
For the strength to just hang on
Undo everything I've done
Make me Yours, make us one
Until the world can see without a doubt
You're living in my heart

Turn it all around, turn it upside down
Take all I know
I surrender
