Hear my voice where you are
Take a train, steal a car
Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me
Catch a plane, catch a breeze
On your hands, on your knees
Swim or fly, only please, come back to me
On a mule, in a jet
With your hair in a net
In a towel wringing wet
I don't care, this is where you should be
From the hills, from the shore
Ride the wind to my door
Turn the highway to dust
Break the law if you must
Move the world, only just come back to me
Blast your hide, hear me call
Must I fight City Hall
Here and now, damn it all, come back to me
What on Earth must I do
Scream and yell till I'm blue
Curse your soul when will you come back to me?
Have you gone to the moon or the corner saloon
Or to wreck and to ruin
Mademoiselle, where in Hell can you be?
Leave a sign on your door
Out to lunch ever more
In a Royce or a van, wrapped in mink or Saran
Anyway that you can, come back to me
Hear my voice through the din
Feel the waves on your skin
Like a call from within, come back to me
Leave behind all your own
Tell your flowers you will phone
Let your dog walk alone, come back to me
Let your tub overflow
If a date waits below
Let him wait for Godot
Come by rail,
Come by mail, COD
Par avion, par bateau
Dans une vielle, deux chevaux
Come by steam, come by gas
Call for free on a pass
On the drags and the glass, come back to me
Leave your bills all unpaid
Let your bed go unmade
Your souffle unsouffled, come back to me
Come by sail, come by freight
In a box or a tray, keep your head on the plate
I don't care this is where you should be
Come in pain or in joy
As a girl, as a boy
In a bag or a trunk (Shut up!)
On a horse or a drunk
In the flora or faun, come back to me
Come back to me, come back

"Will you stop bothering me?"
