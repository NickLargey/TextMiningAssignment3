You left me shadows
Etched on the wall
You don't hear my whispers
I'm deaf from your call

Dream your lie in your tainted sun
Tell me I'm right when I'm left for dead
I wanna see you come in before I give in to you

You left me echoes
Footsteps in the hall
You marked the borders
I built the walls

Dream your lie in your tainted sun
Tell me who is right when I'm left for dead
Wanna see you come in before I give in

Don't be scared, don't be scared
You can face the truth of it all
Don't be scared, don't be scared
If you can't bear the weight of it all
In your tainted sun

So you hear my whispers
But that there's no doubt at all
But you still walk round the borders
And I'm, I'm stuck with the walls

Dream your lie in your tainted sun
Tell me who is right when I'm left for dead
Wanna see you come in before I give in

Don't be scared, don't be scared
You must face the truth of it all
Don't be scared, don't be scared
You can't bear the weight of it all

Don't be scared, don't be scared
You can't bear the weight of it all

Dream your lie in your tainted sun, baby
You tell me I'm right when I'm left for dead
Gotta see you rise, just an inch of the truth
Wanna feel your right, just an ounce of the truth

Wanna see you right, gotta fell you right
Wanna see the truth before I give in to you
Before I give in to you

But in your tainted sun, all I see is shadows
All you hear [Incomprehensible]
