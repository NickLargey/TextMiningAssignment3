When I write to you and say
Everything is okay,
if my letters seem gay,
Can't you read between the lines?

I go dancing when I'm blue,
As you wrote me to do!
but it's not like with you,
Can't you read between the lines?

It might worry you
If I told you I cried every night;
You'll tell me it won't,
But why take a chance that it might?

I'll be seeing you again,
Only heaven knows when!
But my dear, until then,
Can't you read between the lines?
