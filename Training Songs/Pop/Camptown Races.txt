De Camptown ladies sing dis song, doo-dah! doo-dah!
De Camptown race-track five miles long, Oh, doo-dah day!

Gwine to run all day!
I'll bet my money on de bob-tail nag,
Somebody bet on de bay.

De long tail filly and de big black hoss, doo-dah! doo-dah!
Dey fly de track and dey both cut across, oh, doo-dah-day!
De blind hoss sticken in a big mud hole, doo-dah! doo-dah!
Can't touch bottom wid a ten foot pole, oh, doo-dah-day!

Gwine to run all day!
I'll bet my money on de bob-tail nag,
Somebody bet on de bay.
