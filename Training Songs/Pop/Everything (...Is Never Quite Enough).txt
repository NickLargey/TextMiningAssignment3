Moments take so very long
Who has time to fear? 
Trust to set no precedent;
Why should it be accompli?
Giving you a little less
Is taking what I need. 
Everything is never quite enough. 

Let machinery fake my face
Who has time to chase? 
Digital is where it is;
Love can always be replaced. 
Welcome to my consciousness
Welcome to our race. 
Everything is never quite enough. 

Can't see my face
What are you thinking? 
Fill in the space, please
Oh let me hear you

Sterilize behind these gates,
Locked behind the green. 
Even if I had you here
What we had was never clear 
No more words to say to you;
No more thoughts appear 

Love was taking way too long
Who had breath to waste? 
Tired of disappointing you;
Bored with everything I do. 
Every day there's less of you.
Me, I've been erased.
