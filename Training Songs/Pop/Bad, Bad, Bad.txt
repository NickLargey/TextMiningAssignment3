You got the looks, you got the eyes
Well I can see right past your lies
I can't miss, and now it's come to this

You got mouth, got lips got talk
You got feet but have you got the walk
It won't last, going nowhere fast

Bad bad, I know that it's bad, 
What's making you happy is driving me mad mad mad

Want to scream and shout but I count to ten
I show myself out though I never been in
I give up, I give in, I just can't win

Like so many, controlled by the few
Being told being free is being told what to do
It's true, one of them is you

No river deep, no mountain too high
There is nothing that money can't buy
How you sow you shall reap, and it won't be cheap

Want to scream and shout but I count to ten
I show myself out though I never been in
I give up, I give in, I just can't win

Feeling upset, feeling uptight
Still I ain't gonna start a riot tonight
I give up, I give in, I just can't win
