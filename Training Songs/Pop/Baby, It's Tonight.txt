Won't you pick up the phone
‘Cause I know that you're home
Too many words have not been said
For us to be living alone
Now all of the fighting
And all of the tears
Well they don't matter now
Another night falls dark and lonely
And you're the only one that I can turn to

If I ever needed your arms to hold me
Baby, it's tonight
And if I ever needed your eyes to heal me
Baby, it's tonight

So come hold me close
And show me that you still care
Let's take it to where it all began
And start again from there
‘Cause there's no way out
As far as I can tell
I'm walkin' in a world of strangers
And you're the only one who really knows me

If I ever needed your arms to hold me
Baby, it's tonight
And if I ever needed your eyes to heal me
Baby, it's tonight

If I ever needed you're arms to hold me
Baby, it's tonight
And if I ever needed your eyes to heal me
Baby, it's tonight
Baby, it's tonight

So won't you please, please pick up the phone
Don't leave me to face this world all alone
Take some time
‘Cause baby, it's tonight

If I ever neede your eyes to heal me
Baby, it's tonight
If I ever needed your arms to hold me
Baby, it's tonight
And if I ever needed your eyes to heal me
Baby, it's tonight
Baby, it's tonight
