He's a man I ain't never seen, but I choose it's only so
He's a man with cash in his hand, he's my baby, my baby, oh no
If I ain't alight, and I'm feeling alright
I'm so ready to go, and my baby, oh no
 
[Chorus]
But my baby, oh no, you make me lose my self-control
I'll go crazy, whoah, if baby oh no doesn't show
Hard and mean, he's a rhythm machine, he can move it fast or slow
Man's got style, he don't never smile, he's my baby, my baby, oh no

My head's in a mess and I've torn my best dress
But I ain't like the rest, gonna make him say yes

[Chorus]

I want him, I need him, I want him, I need him
He can move it, he can groove it, he's a rhythm machine
He can take me, he can break me, he's so hard and so mean
He's my lover, he's my hero, take it fast, take it slow
My baby, my baby, my baby oh no
My head's in a mess and I've torn my best dress
But I ain't like the rest, gonna make him say yes

[Chorus until fade]
