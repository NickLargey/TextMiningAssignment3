The sun is overshadowed by the presence of the moon
Night time has fallen, she'll be comin' home soon
Leave the door wide open, ah, so she won't need a key
Lock it behind you baby, draw the blinds so no one can see

There's only one thing on my mind
Don't let, don't let me down
Don't let, don't let me down
Feelings are near the ground

Silence is golden, ah, for me there's just one choice
The music of your laughter, ripplin' of your voice
The freshness of the evergreen, ah, fades as if too shy
Can't compete with your beauty, couldn't if it tried

There's only one thing on my mind
Don't let, don't let me down
Don't let, don't let me down
Feelings are near the ground

Let's build somethin' to climb on
Makin' the show a live one
No need for make-up, let's be real

Give all in what you're givin'
Makin' life worth livin'
Bein' alive's how you should feel

Oh and don't let, don't let me down
Feelings are near the ground

Don't want the sun to be shinin', raisin' his eyebrows at the moon
Sayin' I told you, so she wouldn't show
Well, don't speak too soon

I hear her footsteps walkin' on the outer floor
Well, it could be
I don't know, I don't know for sure

There's only one thing on my mind
Don't let, don't let me down
Don't let, don't let me down
Feelings are near the ground

Come on back
Can't live without you
Come on back (I need you, I need you, I)
Can't live without you
Come on back (I want you, I want you, I)
Can't live without you
Come on back (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, I)
Can't live without you
Come on back (I love you, I love you, I)
Can't live without you
Come on back (I need you, I need you, I)
Can't live without you
