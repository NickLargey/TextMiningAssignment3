Don`t go out into the rain
you`re gonna melt, sugar
oh, no come and sit here by the fire
for a spell, sugar
oh, ho, please take your shoes off and make yourself  comfortable
the weather`s miserable and you`re so kissable
it`s getting late

she`s got to go
oh no no no please don`t go
don`t go out into the rain
you`re gonna melt, sugar
oh, no, come and sit here by the fire for a speel, sugar
oh, ho, the house is ours now that everybody`s gone
and while the telly`s on we should be having fun
it`s gettin glate
why don`t you wait
it`s after one
we`ve just begun
she`s got to go
oh no no no please don`t go
don`t go out into the rain you`re gonna melt sugar
oh, no,  come and sit here by the fire for a spell sugar
oh ho, it`s getting late
why don`t you wait
it`s after one
we`ve just begun
she`s got to go
oh no no no, don`t be insane
