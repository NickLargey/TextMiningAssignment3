She's got the answers
She waves them like a flag
She'll take all the cards from the Soho League
And stick them in her bag for security
Baby likes her fever
Well, she'll take it all night long
Around the track with the red-eyed Jacks
And nothin' she can do can be that wrong

Don't fight it, don't fight it
You've been on the ropes too long
Don't fight it, don't fight it
Nothing she does can be wrong

She's got her reasons
And she wields them like a knife
But she'll take her stand in the underground band
She doesn't know that she's in there for life
But me, I've got my business
And I struggle to keep life sane
But what does it mean you can't keep your hands clean
Cause baby's caught up in her social machine

I won't, I won't
Ever let you down
She said to me
I won't, I won't
Ever let you down

You've been on the ropes too long
Nothing she does can be wrong
She likes her fever 
She says, 'Take it like a man'
And we fight combat sometimes
But we don't fight it hand to hand
And when my world is crumbling
And I go stumbling blind

If I get thin
She'll be there in a pinch
She's got a way
To make life feel fine

Don't fight it
I won't
Don't fight it
Let you down
You've been on the ropes too long

Don't fight it
I won't
Don't fight it
Let you down
Nothing she does can be wrong
You've been on the ropes too long

I won't, I won't
Ever let you down
She said to me
I won't, I won't
Ever let you down
You've been on the ropes too long

Don't fight it, don't fight it, don't fight it
I won't let you down
