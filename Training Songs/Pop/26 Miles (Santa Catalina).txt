Twenty-six miles across the sea
Santa Catalina is a-waitin' for me,
Santa Catalina, the island of romance, 
romance, romance, romance.
Water all around it ev'rywhere, 
tropical trees and the salty air,
but for me the thing that's a-waitin' there's romance.
 
It seems so distant, twenty-six miles away, restin' in the water serene.
I'd work for anyone, even the Navy, who would float me to my island dream.
Twenty-six miles, so near, yet far.
I'd swim with just some water wings and my guitar.
I can leave the wings but I'll need the guitar
for romance, romance, romance, romance.

but for me the thing that's a-waitin' there's romance.
 
A tropical heaven out in the ocean covered with trees and girls.
If I have to swim I'd do it forever till I'm gazin' on those island pearls.
Forty kilometers in a leaky old boat,
Any old thing that'll stay afloat.
When we arrive we'll all promote romance, romance, romance
