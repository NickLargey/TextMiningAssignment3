You said
A fool would say it's over
But instead
The voice in my head was right

No more lettin' you down or messing around
All over the place, I'm just sayin'
You can be certain, you can move on
And you'll find someone, yeah I'm prayin'
She'll be better than me, I know I'll be pleased
I promise you that I'm not fake
Yeah, I know I'll see that setting you free was not a mistake

Don't look over your shoulder
Just keep walkin' away
We can breathe now, it's over
And erase all the pain

I bet
You smile just a little longer
So glad we made it (so glad we made it, so glad)
The voice in my head was right

She'll be better than me, I know I'll be pleased
I promise you that I'm not fake
Yeah, I know I'll see that setting you free was not a mistake

Don't look over your shoulder
Just keep walkin' away
We can breathe now, it's over
And erase all the pain

I know she'll be better, you'll see
Don't worry 'bout me, babe
(Don't worry 'bout me, babe)
I'm sure she'll be all that you need
Don't worry 'bout me, honey
(Don't you worry 'bout me, honey)
You know you'll be good without me
Don't worry 'bout me, babe
(Don't worry 'bout me, babe)
You left me tied up
We're not better together
Then she'll treat you better

Don't look over your shoulder (don't look back, baby)
Just keep walkin' away (don't look back, baby)
We can breathe now, it's over (don't look back, baby)
And erase all the pain
