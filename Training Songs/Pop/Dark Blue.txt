I have, I have you 
Breathing down my neck, breathing down my neck
I don't, don't know
What you could possibly expect
Under this condition, so
I'll wait, I'll wait
For the ambulance to come, ambulance to come
Pick us up off the floor
What did you possibly expect
Under this condition, so
Slow down
This night's a perfect shade of 

Dark blue, dark blue
Have you ever been alone in a crowded room?
When I'm here with you
I said the world could be burning, burning down
Dark blue, dark blue
Have you ever been alone in a crowded room?
Well, I'm here with you
I said the world could be burning
'Til there's nothing but dark blue 
Just dark blue

This flood (this flood)
This flood is slowly rising up
Swallowing the ground, beneath my feet
Tell me how anybody thinks
Under this condition, so
I'll swim, I'll swim
As the water rises up, sun is sinking down
And now all I can see are the planets in a row
Suggesting it's best that I
Slow down
This night's a perfect shade of

Dark blue, dark blue
Have you ever been alone in a crowded room?
When I'm here with you
I said the world could be burning, burning down
Dark blue, dark blue
Have you ever been alone in a crowded room?
Well, I'm here with you
I said the world could be burning
Dark blue

We were boxing
We were boxing the stars
We were boxing (we were boxing)
You were swinging for Mars
And then the water reached the West Coast (hoo)
And took the power lines, the power lines (hoo)
And it was me and you (this could last forever)
And the whole town under water
There was nothing we could do
It was dark blue

Dark blue, dark blue
Have you ever been alone in a crowded room?
When I'm here with you
I said the world could be burning, burning down
Dark blue
Have you ever been alone in a crowded room?
Well, I'm here with you
I said the world could be burning
Now there's nothing but dark blue

If you've ever been alone
You'll know
Dark Blue
If you've ever been alone
You'll know
You'll know
