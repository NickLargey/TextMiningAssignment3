You said to come and sort your mind
(But did you mean it? Ooh, but did you mean it?)
Then warmed the bread and poured the wine
I thought I'd seen it all, until you broke that seventh wall

I said I'd hang on for the ride
Now I'm hanging on for dear life
Is that a real knife?

Get me out of this creep city
I'm flat broke and I don't need pity right now
Just get me out, out, out, out
All the dogs in the back have been smothered
And these cats don't make good lovers
This town's on cursed ground, ground, ground, ground

Was the judge not clear?
Just have a look at them ears
Full of ice cream sundaes
(Funny no one wondered whose thumb I was under)
Never gave a goddamn, I gave you twenty-one grand
'Cause baby I love you more than the trash can

I said I'd give you one more try
Now I'm giving up the good life
I'd make a bad wife

Get me out of this creep city
I'm flat broke and I don't look pretty right now
Just get me out, out, out, out
All the dogs in the back been smothered
And these cats don't make good lovers
This town's on cursed ground, ground, ground, ground

And if there's a sign to show me from this world back to mine
Or tell me you'll try, or at least please reply
Sincerely I'll be waiting, 'til I die

(Creep city)
No, Iâ€™m never gonna say goodbye to this
(Sin city)
Something is alive
