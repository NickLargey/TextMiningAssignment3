Walk right up to him
Give him a great big kiss
Muah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

You wait three days till you call my number
And you take a week to ask me out
Let the game be a mystery
And we wait two weeks to hit the town
Then, I pretend like I don't want you back so
You'll come running after me 
I'll play it cool and turn down your offer
So your burning at the center of the sea 

Baby won't you come to my house sir
Baby won't you come to my house sir
Baby won't you come to my house?
This ain't a game of cat and mouse

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

You're too scared to walk in the city
With the same woman on your arm
You're too shallow 'cause you think of something better
Leave your options open for more
I don't want a four karat commitment
Only conversation to connect
I don't even wanna meet your momma
Or leave a toothbrush in your stash

Baby won't you come to my house sir
Baby won't you come to my house sir
Baby won't you come to my house?
This ain't a game of cat and mouse

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

I ain't living in a fairy tale 
And I know you're not a charming prince
Are you thinking your gonna sweep me off my feet
And happily forever we'll live?
'Cause it's all about the here and now so lets get what we can
I just want you for the night and you'll never ever be my man

Baby won't you come to my house sir
Baby won't you come to my house sir
Baby won't you come to my house?
This ain't a game of cat and mouse (mat and mouse)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

Won't you come to my house?
We can go 'round and 'round
Won't you come to my house?
We can go, we can go
Hey ya eh
Hey ya eh
Hey eh hey ya yeah

Here comes my guy
Walking down the street
