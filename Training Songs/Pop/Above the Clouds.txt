There's a place where the sun breaks through
And the wind bites cold and hard
Stings my ears and tears my eye
When the day starts to shout out loud

Stand tall and glide
When you're all alone in the crowd
Don't fall, don't hide
When you walk above the clouds
When you walk above the clouds

When the light is against your face
And your smile is soft and proud
That's when you tell me all your fears
And all your dreams, so sound

Stand tall and glide
When you're all alone in the crowd
Don't fall, don't hide
When you walk above the clouds
When you walk above the clouds

I try and tell you to keep your head upright
Don't swing your sword and shield against the night
Don't block your blessings, boy
You don't have to fight, you don't have to fight

Stand tall and glide
When you're all alone in the crowd
Don't fall, don't hide
When you walk above the clouds
When you walk above the clouds

When you walk, when you walk
When you walk above the clouds
