Mom and Dad were reading in the den
Mom said, "I'm gonna go to bed, it's late"
She went to the kitchen to make three school lunches
Another night in a mother's day
Put the cereal bowls out for breakfast
Set the coffeemaker for 6 a.m.
Sewed a loose button on brother's shirt for him

Checked sister's math homework, sent a note to the teacher
Added eggs to the grocery list
Started a load of wash, made sure the doors were locked
Put water in the puppy's dish
Wrote a check to the children's piano teacher
Turned the dishwasher on
And Dad called out, "Honey, what's takin' you so long?"

Have I ever thanked you
For everything you've done?
Now all that I can say is
"I love you, Mom"

Hung some art on the refrigerator door
And headed up the stairs
Kissed all the children and helped sister comb
Her wavy golden hair
Washed her make-up off and turned on the bath
Lay down in the moon's soft light and kissed Dad goodnight

Have I ever thanked you
For everything you've done?
Now all that I can say is
"I love you, Mom"

Thank you for nursin' me
Through all those colds and fevers
Thank you for believin' in me
When they were no other believers

And it's never too late to say
"I love you, Mom"
