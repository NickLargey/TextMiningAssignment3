Sometimes I think I'm just a crazy cat
Running around, don't know where it's at
Getting confused with my way of life
That's when you say, now you cut that jive

Right now, right now
You keep this flame I have alight in me
And with this cat, it's curiosity
That keeps me hanging on night and day

Surprisingly, again I hear you say
Guess what, guess what, curiosity killed the cat
I'm telling you I know where it's at
Love is everywhere to be found
Open your eyes and look around

You, you, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Some things you say take me by surprise
I like your style so give me your advice
Send me the truth and I'll always be
Singing your song with you in harmony

That's right, that's right, curiosity killed the cat
I'm telling you I know where it's at
Love is everywhere to be found
Open your eyes and look around

Curiosity killed the cat
I'm telling you I know where it's at
Love is everywhere to be found
Open your eyes and look around
You, you, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, oh
