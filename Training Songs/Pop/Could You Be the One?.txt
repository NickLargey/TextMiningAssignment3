Could you be the one they talk about?
Hiding inside, behind another door?
Is it only happiness you want?
Does wanting a feeling matter any more?

It doesn't mean that much to me
Sometimes I don't mean that much to you
And I don't even know what I'm hiding for

And I don't even know what I'm crying for
Don't even know what I'm hiding for

Cry inside
Cry inside

Could you be the one they talk about?
Life is a game that only you can make
Maybe I'm about to throw it out
I've given it all, that's all I can take

It doesn't mean that much to me
Sometimes I don't mean that much to you
And I don't even know what I'm hiding for

And I don't even know what I'm crying for
I don't even know

Well, could you be the one?
Could you be the one?
Could you be the one that's hanging all around?

Don't even know what I'm crying for
Don't even know what I'm hiding for

Don't even try
Hide and sigh

And I don't even know what I'm crying for
Don't even know what I'm hiding for
Don't even know, could you be the only broken-hearted one?
Could you be the one?
Could you be the one?
Could you be the one that's hanging all around?

Don't even know
I don't even know?
Well, could you be the one?
Could you be the one?
Could you be the one?
Could you be the one?
