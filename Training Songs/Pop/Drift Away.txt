Day after day I'm more confused
But I look for the light through the pouring rain
You know it's a game that I hate to loose.
I'm feeling the strain.
Ain't it a shame.

Chorus
Gimme the beat boys and free my soul,
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n' roll and drift away.
Gimme the beat boys and free my soul,
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n' roll and drift away.

Beginning to think that I'm wasting time.
And I don't understand the things I do.
The world outside looks so unkind
Now it's up to you to carry me through.

Chorus

When my mind is free you know a melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue, the guitar's coming through to sooth me.
Thank's for the joy that you've given me.
I want you to know what I feel in the song.
A rythem and a ryme and a harmony.
To help me along,
You're making me strong.

Repeat Chorus to fade
