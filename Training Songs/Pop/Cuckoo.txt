Feel like I'm having a meltdown
It feels like I'm losing control
They tell me I'm a danger to myself
Now the crazy train is ready to roll, oh!

Walk that walk
Like you don't give a f***
You've got a right to turn it up and get down
Electric shock, no I can't get enough
'Cause tonight we're taking over the town, hey

I wanna lose my mind, like a maniac
And cross the line, never looking back
We're on the loose, getting crazy
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party till they take us away

I'm swinging off of my hinges
I'm cocked and I'm ready to go
Just go on and pack up your things
And the crazy train is ready to roll, oh!

Walk that walk
Like you don't give a f***
You've a got a right to turn it up and get down
Electric shock, no I can't get enough
'Cause tonight we're taking over the town, hey

I wanna lose my mind, like a maniac
And cross the line, never looking back
We're on the loose, getting crazy
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party till they take us away

Gotta get out of this straight jacket, whoa cuckoo
Gotta get out of this straight jacket, whoa
Yeah!

I wanna lose my mind, like a maniac
And cross the line, never looking back
We're on the loose, getting crazy
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party till they take us away
Gonna party till they take us away
Gonna party till they take us away
