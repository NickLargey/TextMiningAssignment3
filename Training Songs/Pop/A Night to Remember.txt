Get ready tonight 
Gonna make this a night to remember 
Get ready, oh, baby, tonight 
Gonna make this a night to remember 

When you love someone, it's natural, not demanding 
And that's one thing I'm proud to say I've found in you 
I'm so glad we've reached an understanding 
Now I know my heart is safe with you 
So now my love to you, baby, I surrender 

Celebrations in the heart 'cause we're united 
And there's nothing in the world could come between me and you 
We're together, and it keeps me so excited 
To think of what the power of love can do 
And I'm filled with a love that's, oh, so tender, yeah 

Yeah, get ready, get ready 'cause we're gonna have some fun 
Get ready, get ready 'cause you're with the nine one one 
Gonna take this, break this, then we're gonna make this 
A night to remember 'cause, baby, I surrender 
Celebration, toast the occasion 
Talking about love and true dedication 
The hand of love that's, oh, so tender is gonna give you a night to remember 
Let's make a toast to those who've helped make this occasion 
They turn their back on love, and that's what drove you straight to me 
To you, I make a lasting dedication 
I'll show you all the love and life can be 
And each day that I live I will deliver, yeah
