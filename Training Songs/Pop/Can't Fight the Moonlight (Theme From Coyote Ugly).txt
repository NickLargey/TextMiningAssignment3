Under a lover's sky 
Gonna be with you 
And no one's gonna be around 
If you think that you won't fall 
We'll just wait until 
Till the sun goes down 

Underneath the starlight, starlight 
There's a magical feeling so right 
It'll steal your heart tonight 

You can try to resist 
Try to hide from my kiss 
But you know, but you know that you 
Can't fight the moonlight 
Deep in the dark 
You'll surrender your heart 
But you know, but you know that you 
Can't fight the moonlight, no 
You can't fight it 
It's gonna get to your heart 

There's no escape from love 
Once a gentle breeze 
Sweeps its spell upon your heart 
No matter what you think 
It won't be too long 
Till you're in my arms 

Underneath the starlight, starlight 
We'll be lost in the rhythm so right 
Feel it steal your heart tonight 

You can try to resist 
Try to hide from my kiss 
But you know, but you know that you 
Can't fight the moonlight 
Deep in the dark 
You'll surrender your heart 
But you know, but you know that you can't 
Can't fight the moonlight, no 
You can't fight it, (no) 
No matter what you do (no matter what you do) 
The night is gonna get to you 
Don't try you're never gonna win oh 

Underneath the starlight, starlight 
There's a magical feeling so right 
It will steal your heart tonight 

You can try to resist (you can try to resist my kiss) 
Try to hide from my kiss 
But you know, (don't you know that you can't) 
Can't fight the moonlight 
Deep in the dark, 
You'll surrender your heart (surrender your heart) 
But you know, but you know that you 
Can't fight the moonlight, no 
You can't fight it. 

You can try to resist (you can try to resist my kiss) 
Try to hide from my kiss 
But you know, (don't you know that you can't) 
Can't fight the moonlight 
Deep in the dark, 
You'll surrender your heart (surrender your heart) 
But you know, but you know that you 
Can't fight the moonlight, no 
You can't fight it. 
It's gonna get to your heart.
