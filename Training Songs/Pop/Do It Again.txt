Do it do it do it again again Oh
Do it do it do it again again again
Tonight

I see my friend look at her watch again
She says I'll be heard so one more song that's it then were going home
No way
I'm not leaving
The drum is the end
D-J can like a night and I don't twice cause the beat is right

Doof doof clap running through the speakers
Base line running running to my sneakers
Hey, mic check one two, one two
Hold up
Let's do it

Do it again
The kick is killing
Whoa oh
Its murder in the club tonight
Do it again
One more time
Whoa oh
There's murder in the club tonight

Okay, so I'm not feeling
This guy trying talk to me talk to me
Tell me his name
So I just nod twice and I smile and
You know
I can't hear a thing, the D-J's killing
Someone dance with him, anyway
He got a pocket full of cash and he's ready to pay

Doof doof clap running through the speakers
Base line running running to my sneakers
Hey, mic check one two, one two
Hold up
Let's do it

Do it again
The kick is killing
Whoa oh
Its murder in the club tonight
Do it again
One more time
Whoa oh
There's murder in the club tonight

Walk to the floor
My outfit's murderous
And don't act like you
Like you ain't heard of us
Heavy like floor
Realists go serial
Cause all the boys say I'm feeling you
But we the moe's moeing
Chase on it
I killin' it

Doof doof clap running through the speakers
Base line running running to my sneakers
Hey, mic check one two, one two
Hold up
Let's do it

Do it again
The kick is killing
Whoa oh
Its murder in the club tonight
Do it again
One more time
Whoa oh
There's murder in the club tonight

Do it again
The kick is killing
Whoa oh
There's murder in the club tonight
Do it again
One more time
Whoa oh
There's murder in the club tonight

Do it again
One two, one two, one two
There's murder in the club tonight
