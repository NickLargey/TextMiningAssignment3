Baby I'm a queen, so why do you call me baby?
It's been about a week, it's too soon for nicknames

You tire me out but fill me up
And I don't mind it very much
You do not wait to wake me up
Too soon for mourning

I might prefer desire to self control
I might prefer crying to being composed
I might prefer chaos to even flow
It's too soon for sense though

Maybe I'm a queen, and maybe I am a baby
It's been over a week, still too soon for nicknames
