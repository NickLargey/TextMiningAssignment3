Your promises are perfect
Courage makes us strong
Holding on to something
How can this dream be wrong

When you trust somebody
And all the thoughts they hold
Through good or bad you follow
â€˜Cause of the love you show

It must be there for love
You know, It must be there for love
After all this time
I can see the world so clearly
After all this time

After all this time (After all this time)
After all this time

Wherever life can take us
Whatever road you try
No matter what the reason
We're always by your side

You felt the world against you
And you know we feel it too
Now we've come together
Our spirit pulls us through

It must be there for love
You know, It must be there for love,
After all this time,
I can see the world so clearly
After all this time

After all this time (After all this time)
After all this time

Though you know they always say that faith can save the day,
So it must be there for love,
It must be there for love
Though you feel hurt, pain, there's nothing you can say
But I'll still be there fore love
I'll still be there fore love
It must be there for love
After all this time
After all this time
After all this time
After all this time
I can see the world so clearly
After all this time
After all this time
After all this time
