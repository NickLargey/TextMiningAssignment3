Understand the purpose of making
Everything around you better
There are no zeros after this one
There is no one to destroy your sweater

I’ll try to hum it to you if I can’t sing

Smothered and covered by my high school dreams
Call Mom and Daddy cause the nest is empty
And so are you

Did you meet with your advisor?
Do you still draw in the margins?
Bubble letters reading “WHAT FOR?”
And “I wish I had a stand in...”

Let’s try to make another hit for the teens

Smothered and covered by my high school dreams
Call Mom and Daddy cause the nest is empty
And so are you
