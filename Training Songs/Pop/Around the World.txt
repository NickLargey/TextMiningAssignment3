Around the world I've searched for you
I traveled on when hope was gone to keep a randezvous
I knew somewhere sometime somehow
You'd look at me and I would see the smile you're smiling now
It might have been in county down or in New York in Gaparee or even London town
No more will I go all around the world for I have found my world in you
Around the world I've searched for you...
[ sax ]
Around the world I'm searching for you...
For I have found my world in you
