My temper's boiling like a thermal mire 
My heart is burning like a forest fire for you 
Sticking pins all over my effigy 
The pain's no worse than the witch's heart you left with me 

How can you fail to see my point of view 
Or are your eyes a bitch's brew? 
At first I thought you came from paradise 
Then you split my world in two, but I love you 

So tell me it another way 
Listen what I have to say 
Don't leave me for another day 
Tell me that you're here to stay 

There's something odd about the way I fell 
Could it be those potions that you mixed up Oh so well? 
You spin your web but like a spider's mate 
I served your purpose but for me it's not too late 

You cut me deep but hat is how I learned 
You're just my cup of gruel 
Familiar faces that you left with me 
Are they meant to be so cruel? 'cause I live you 

So tell me it another way 
Listen what I have to say 
Don't leave me for another day 
Tell me that you're here to stay 
That's all the words you have to say 
Tell me it another way
