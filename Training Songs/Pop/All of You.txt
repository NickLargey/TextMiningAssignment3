After watching your appeal from ev'ry angle
there's a big romantic deal I've got to wangle
For I've fallen for a certain luscious lass
And it's not a passing fancy or a fancy pass

I love the look of you, the lure of you
The sweet of you, the pure of you
The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you
The east, west, north, and the south of you
I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love, at least, a small percent of me, do
For I love all of you
