My feet can run
While I'm lying down
I'm flat on the ground
It's such a race
To be saving time
For later on

Go there, get that, try to never get sad
Feel me, really, am I not important?
In out, up down always and eternally

Downtown boys will fancy up-town girls
Time is running, figure it out
Make some noise 'n better make it loud
You're waiting for the life that you want

Little bright lights
Here for just a minute
Little bright lights are we
Little bright lights
Here for just a minute
Little bright lights are we

Sometimes I dream
I am still a child
That never grew up
Then I awake
Feeling sad, it's gone
But why?
What do I seek?

Bad days, bad ways I was always upset
Time gone, long gone and I tend to forget
Past tense, no sense, but I like my present me

Downtown boys will fancy up-town girls
Time is running, figure it out
Make some noise 'n better make it loud
You're waiting for the life that you want

Little bright lights
Here for just a minute
Little bright lights are we
Little bright lights
Here for just a minute
Little bright lights are we

Downtown boys will fancy up-town girls
Time is running, figure it out
Make some noise 'n better make it loud
You're waiting for the life that you want

Little bright lights
Here for just a minute
Little bright lights are we
Little bright lights
Here for just a minute
Little bright lights are we

Little bright lights
Here for just a minute
Little bright lights are we
Little bright lights
Here for just a minute
Little bright lights are we
