(Woman, woman, woman)

If she didn't roll her eyes
Tease you, feed you, tell you lies
Always act contrarywise
A woman wouldn't be a woman

If she didn't take your dough
Kiss you, coax you, make you blow
Always keep you on the go
A woman wouldn't be a woman

Well, you can't live with 'em, or without 'em
You never really know a thing about 'em
It's hard to believe that all that there is
Rag and bone and a hank o' hair

If she didn't make you sigh
Make you laugh and make you cry
Taunt you till the day you die
A woman wouldn't be a woman

(No, a woman wouldn't be a woman)
(But since the World began)
If you didn't love 'em and want more of 'em
A man wouldn't be a man
