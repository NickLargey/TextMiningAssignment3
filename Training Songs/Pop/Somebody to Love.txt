Like a paper in the wind
Blowing since I don't know when
Ever since the child was born
Holding on to something warm

Somebody to love
Somebody that you can depend on
Some place in the sun
One feeling there's just no denying

Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love

Nothing's the same inside
When there's nobody there by your side

Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love

Stand by you
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)
The rest of your life
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)
Wherever you go
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)
It don't matter if you want
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)

Think about what won't forget
Everyone that ever was
Trying to find that piece of love

Somebody to love
Somebody that you can depend on
Some place in the sun
One feeling there's no denying

Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love

Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love

It gotta be somehow
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)
To wave goodbye
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)
To hold you tight
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)
For the jealous mind
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)

To let you go
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)
Break your heart
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)
Spend your money on
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)
Make you cry
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)

Whenever, let go
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)
Doesn't matter if you want
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)
When he just keeps going on
(Somebody to love, somebody to love)

Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
