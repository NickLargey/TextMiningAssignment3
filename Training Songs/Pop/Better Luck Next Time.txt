"Better luck next time." That could never be
Because there ain't gonna be no next time for me
No siree, made up my mind to make another start
I've made my mind up, but I can't make up my heart
 
I'd like a new lucky day; that would be nice
But this comes just once in a lifetime, not twice
So don't say, "Better luck next time." That could never be
Because there ain't gonna be no next time for me
