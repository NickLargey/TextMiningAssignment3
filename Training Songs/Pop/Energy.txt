And it's no coincidence that we're hosting events and there are no incidents
This cultural one stop shop mixin' pot just for your convenience
And the flows that we implement, has a global influence

Let me tell you this when the cameras flash and the genres clash
It become the sweetest accident, no fear, and no license
So we're driving and crashing all over the continents
And the vibration that keep on purging your soul like antioxidants

Stand up, get up, jump up, get wild, get mad
Like you don't have no common sense
I said hey, I need your crazy energy
I said hey, I need your violent chemistry, yes I do
I said hey, I want a love to set me free
I said hey, why don't you give it up to me

I've got the evidence, gotta cast iron case got the best defense
We've got tradition, got erudition, we're not afraid to experiment
Smashing up new beats, form the west to east from NY down to Suriname
Give it up, pull it down and to hell with all the prejudice

I said hey, I said hey
I said hey, I want a love to set me free
I said hey, why don't you give it all to me
I said hey, I need your crazy energy
I said hey, I need you with the chemistry
I said hey, why don't you give it all

Give it all, give it all, give it all to me
Give it all, give it all, give it all to me
Give it all, give it all, give it all to me
Give it all, give it all, give it all to me
