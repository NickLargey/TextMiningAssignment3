Pre>(e) a e d a d e
Uh, I had the time but I blew it, I had the power and I knew it
D a d e
Had the energy, but outgrew it, the identity but saw through it, yeah
E d a d e
I had the walk, but got trampled, had the taste, it was sampled
D a d e
Had the engine dismantled, had the flame, but no candle

Chorus
D e
I can't bear to see how it all looks in the light, keep it hidden now
D e f#m
If I could only find a switch that turns on the endless night
E d a e f#m
That turns on the endless night, that turns on the endless night
E d e
That turns on the endless night ah ah ah uh

Ah, if there's a wire, must cross it, if there's a coin, must toss it
If it's dirt can't wash it, it's my head, d-don't cosh it
There's a door, but they shut it, we all bleed, they cut it
It's so dark when you don't fit, it's a gauntlet you gotta run it oh baby
A e
Repeat chorus (plus) turn on the endless night
Instrumental verse (then)
Be
Turn on the endless, turn on the endless, turn on the endless

If there's a cross, then bear it, if there's a loss, then share it
If it's a risk let's dare it, if it's blindness, outstare it

Repeat chorus (plus)
D a e f#m
That turns on the endless night, (that, just, and) turns on the endless night
E d e
Let's turns on the endless night ah ah ah uh (repeat with variations and fade) /pre>
