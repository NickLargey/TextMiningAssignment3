I might be a part of this
Ripple on water from a lonesome drip
A fallen tree that witness me
I'm alone, him and me

And then life itself can not aspire
To have someone be so admired
I threw creation to my king
With the silence broken by a whispered wind

All of this can be broken
All of this can be broken
Hold your devil by his spoke and spin him to the ground

And root to root and tip to tip
I look at him my country gip
Let it up I own his fears
But someone brought you close to tears

Many trains and many miles
Like you to me on this sunny isle
And what of which you wish to speak
Have you come here to rescue me?

All of this can be broken
All of this can be broken
Hold your devil by his spoke and spin him to the ground

But the love of your life
Lives but lies no more
And where she lay a flower grows

The arms are fed and the babes have wed
And the backs have bled, keeping her in tow

But I am your keeper
And I hold your face away from light
I am yours till they come
I am yours till they come

Eye to eye
Nose to nose
Ripping off each other's clothes
In a most peculiar way
