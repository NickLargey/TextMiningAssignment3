I've tried hard in pleasin'
You tell me you leavin'
I must know the reason
Don't do do this to me
My hearts like a flower
That grows every hour
It's my only power
Don't do this to me
Don't grief it
Don't leave it
Why don't you believe it
It need you
It plead you
To stay
Don't you see
You're free to abuse it
Yes you can misuse it
But please don't refuse it
Don't do this to me

I know that your'e goin'
My heart must be showin'
Cause my tears are flowin'
Don't do this to me
My poor heart is achin'
And soon will be breakin'
It's my love you're takin'
Don't do this to me
Don't grief it
Don't leave it
Why don't you believe it
It need you
It plead you
To stay
Don't you see
You're free to abuse it
Yes you can misuse it
But please don't refuse it
Don't do this to me
