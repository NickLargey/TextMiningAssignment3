You said you were doing nothing
Call me up you're doing nothing
You never know what is happening
At all now

Pull the sofa over and watch the
Television glowing on into the night
All you said you were doing nothing
Phone me up you're doing nothing
You wanna go out and do something
You just don't know what is happning
Do you know

Walk into town and wonder about
And stop then wonder what you're doing
You're doing nothing nothing at all
You're just doing nothing
