Oh, beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain

America, America
God shed His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea

Oh, beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam
Undimmed by human tears

America, America
God shed His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
