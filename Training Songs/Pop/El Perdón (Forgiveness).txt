I know you moved on
I heard you doing better without me
Girl this is driving me crazy
Can't you see what you doing to me

She let go
She killed me when she said it was over
Now I'm in the middle of nowhere
And got no space to breath

I'm missing you baby
Up all night going crazy
Now my angel can't save me
Oh no

I'm missing you baby
Up all night going crazy
Drinking my pain away

Girl I'm not with you
You're not with me
And I don't like the way it feels

Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta

Girl I'm not with you
You're not with me
And I don't like the way this feels

Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta

Can't take the pain
Can't take the hurt
I wish that I could turn back time and say I love you
I'd do anything to make it work, ohh

'Cause even through the times they try to hate on us
The only thing that mattered to me was our love
Never will I stop, I'll never get enough

I'm missing you baby
Up all night going crazy
Now my angel can't save me
Oh no

I'm missing you baby
Up all night going crazy
Drinking my pain away

Girl I'm not with you
You're not with me
And I don't like the way it feels

Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta

Girl I'm not with you
You're not with me
And I don't like the way this feels

Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta

I know they say that you're moving on
But I'm begging you please don't go
No, I don't wanna let you go, oh no

Yeah you know that I want you back
Baby I love you to the max
From here to the moon and back

Girl I'm not with you
You're not with me
And I don't like the way this feels

Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta

Girl I'm not with you
You're not with me
And I don't like the way it feels

Esto no me gusta, oh yeah, oh no

Dicen que uno no sabe lo que tiene
Hasta que lo pierde pero
Vale la pena luchar por lo que uno quiere
Y hacer el intento
