Won't you come home, bill bailey, won't you come home
I moan the whole night long
I'll do the cookin', honey, I'll pay the rent
I know I done you wrong

Remember that rainy eve' that
I drove you out with nothin' but a fine tooth comb
Yes, I know that I'm to blame, and ain't that a shame
Bill bailey, won't you please come home

Won't you come home, bill bailey, won't you come home
I moan the whole night long
I'm-a gonna do your cookin', honey, i'm-a gonna pay your rent
I know that I've done you wrong

Remember that rainy eve' that
I drove you out with nothin' but a fine tooth comb
Well, I know that I'm to blame, and ain't that a dirty, low-down shame
Bill bailey, won't you please come home
Come home, come home, bill bailey
Bill bailey, won't you please come on home
Come home, bill bailey
Bill bailey, won't you please come on home
Come on home
