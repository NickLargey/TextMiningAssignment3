It  was such a lovely day when
I laid my eyes on you
But it was just another day
I didn´t know what I got into
How you looked so innocent

Promised me the stars and moon
Tell me where that sweet boy
Went and who´s this stranger in my room

Don´t waste my time
So wrapped into you
Baby If the feelings gone
No juegues con mi corazón

Don´t waste my time
With a a heart that´s untrue
´Cause baby if I´m not the one
No juegues con mi corazón

Your love was so magical
That´s  why I´m so hooked on you
Your words were so sensual
And like a fool baby
I believed you it all went wrong
When you lied to me
´Cause I heard her on the phone If you
Don´t have  no respect for me
Then it´s time for  you to go

Don´t waste my time

Don´t waste my time

Do you feel it when we´re marking love
The way I do boy I put everything
I have into loving you
Do you remember the first time we
Touched I thought we were meant to be together
