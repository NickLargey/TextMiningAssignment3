Say goodbye, my own true lover,
As we sing a lover's song.
How it breaks my heart to leave you,
Now the carnival is gone.
How it breaks my heart to leave you,
Now the carnival is gone.

Say goodbye, my own true lover,
As we sing a lover's song.
How it breaks my heart to leave you,
Now the carnival is gone.

High above, the dawn is waking,
And my tears are falling rain,
For the carnival is over;
We may never meet again.
For the carnival is over;
We may never meet again.

Like a drum my heart was beating,
And your kiss was sweet as wine.
But the joys of love are fleeting
For Pierrot and Columbine.

Now the harbour light is calling;
This will be our last goodbye.
Though the carnival is over,
I will love you 'til I die.

Say goodbye, my own true lover,

Say goodbye, my own true lover,
This will be our last goodbye.
Though the carnival is over,
I will love you 'til I die.

Though the carnival is over,
I will love you 'til I die.

Though the carnival is over,
I will love you 'til I die.
