Someone was always in my dreams
That someone was always you
I never thought we'd meet someday
But now that my dream came true

I just want the right to love you
All of my life
Just the right to take care of you
All of my life

I just want the right to be near you
Always to be there
Sharing every care and strife

Life can be as simple as a nursery rhyme
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, all of the time

Long as I may live 
I just want the right to give
All my love with all my heart for all of my life
