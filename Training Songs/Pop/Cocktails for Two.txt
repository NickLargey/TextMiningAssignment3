In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
With someone sharing a delightful chat
Of this and that
And cocktails for two

As we enjoy a cigarette
To some exquisite chansonette
Two hands are sure to slyly meet beneath a serviette
With cocktails for two

My head may go reeling
But my heart will be o-be-di-ent
With in-tox-i-cat-ing kiss,
For the principal in-gre-di-ent

Most any afternoon at five
We'll be so glad we're both alive
Then maybe fortune will complete her plan
That all began
With cocktails for two
