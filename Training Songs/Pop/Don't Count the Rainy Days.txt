I was your hero, strong and fearless in your eyes
You were softer than the summer sky
Young lovers we were so unwise

But time is a teacher and this time I've hurt you so
Left you crying but don't you let go
There's so much the years have left to show

Don't count the rainy days
They blow hard and then they're gone
Don't throw our love away, away, away
In the dark before the dawn

You've got to hold on
To all the dreams we've made
Remember those beautiful nights
And don't count the rainy days

You know I'm a dreamer; I get lost inside a world of my own
And sometimes I'm made of stone
But I never meant to leave you alone

So I want to tell you, I know at times I didn't try
When you needed me I'd run and hide
Oh, but now I'm standing by your side

Don't count the rainy days
They blow hard and then they're gone
Don't throw our love away, away, away
In the dark before the dawn

You've got to hold on
To all the dreams we've made
Remember those beautiful nights
And don't count the rainy days
Remember those beautiful nights
And don't count the rainy days

Don't count the rainy days
They blow hard and then they're gone
Don't throw our love away, away, away
In the dark before the dawn

You've got to hold on
To all the dreams we've made
