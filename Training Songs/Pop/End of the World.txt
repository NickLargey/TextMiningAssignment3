You should come with me to the end of the world,
Without telling your parents and your friends.
You know that you only need to say the word, 
So end my play with the end of the world.
But I know that I'll go away by myself,
I feel you don't want to come.

You should come with me to the end of the world,
We could lay all day on the quiet sands.
I would introduce you to my friend the bird
Who sings and flies along the fairy [trend]
But I know that I'll go away by myself
I feel you don't want to come.

If you come with me to the end of the world,
I'll give you anything that lives on earth.
You know that you only need to say the word 
So end my play with the end of the world.
But I know that I'll go away by myself
I feel you don't want to come
