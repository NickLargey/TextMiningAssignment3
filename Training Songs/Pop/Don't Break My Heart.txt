Ever since I saw your face you knocked me offa my feet
Standing there I'm swept away, my heart is skipping a beat
You hit me with a love thing, you caught me in a fantasy
I bet you know what love means, this holding back is killing me
It's not the clothes you wear, the colour of your hair
That makes me fall apart, don't break my heart
There's nothing I won't do for a boy like you
I'm breaking all the rules, don't break my heart
Late at night I lie awake, I hope you're dreaming of me
Think my heart is gonna break, if you never ever notice me
You come on like a cool breeze, you're flirting with my heart's desire
You've got me down on my knees, my temperature can't get much higher
It's not the clothes you wear, the colour of your hair
That makes me fall apart, don't break my heart
You make me slip, I lose my grip
It's gone too far, don't break my heart
There's nothing I won't do for a boy like you
I'm breaking all the rules, don't break my heart, don't break my heart
Why can't I just throw it down, and rock it on the 1 2 3 
I could turn your head around if you let me, if you let me

(Instrumental break)

It's not the clothes you wear, the colour of your hair
That makes me fall apart, don't break my heart
I get upset, I'm a nervous wreck
Right from the start, don't break my heart
There's nothing I won't do for a boy like you
I'm breaking all the rules, don't break my heart
You make me slip, I lose my grip
It's gone too far, don't break my heart
Don't you, don't you, don't break it - don't break my heart (repeats 4x)
I'm a nervous wreck, and I get upset
Nothin' I won't do for a boy like you, don't break my heart
''cause you make me slip, and I lose my grip
Now it's gone too far, don't break my heart
Don't break my, don't break it, don't break my heart, don't break my heart!
