An angel said good bye now. And darkness lies ahead.
My heart just seems to cry out. All the words we left unsaid.
But in my soul I'll hold you forever.

Feel me, babe, I need you here.
Just by my side to ease my fear.
Oh, with you babe, I could survive.

I'm tortured by my feelings. Just you can heal the pain.
Don't want to go on stealing. The forbidden fruits again.
We gotta keep the magic together.

Feel me, babe, I need you here.
Just by my side to ease my fear.
Oh, with you babe, I could survive.
But careless love has turned off the light in our life.
Oh, babe.
