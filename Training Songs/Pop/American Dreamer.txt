Autumn's child is catchin' hell
For having been too na√Øve to tell
Property rights from chapel bells
There's nothing we can do
We could not get there in time
It's too late
She signed on the dotted line?

oh, shoot 'em up
Cops and robbers
Oh, America

The manager smiled
He said, we're gonna straighten 
This mess
He had a picture of Spot
And Jane on his desk
So I signed his strange contract
With the transparent lines
There's nothing we can do
We could not get there in time
It's too late
She signed on the dotted line?

Oh, shoot 'em up
Cops and robbers
Oh, America

The lawyers cried
Through the telephone rings
The doctors sighed
She's imagining things
When he came through the window
With those crazy eyes
Dick Tracy in disguise
He said, you need a guiding
Hand
You're soft and you're fine
Sign here on the dotted line

Oh, big deals
Cops and robbers
Oh, America
I am your rose
American dreamer
Flyin' high
And down through America
Didn't you know
American dreamer
Flyin' high
And down through America
America
America
