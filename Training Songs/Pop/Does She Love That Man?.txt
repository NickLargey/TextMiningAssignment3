Endlessly walking through a winter that's so bitterly cold 
Christmas is coming all the stores are wrapped in their neon glow 
But I don't feel festive 
Oh I've lost the woman I held so dear 
I'm so reflective as I think of all our happy years 
I brush against a stranger, 
So I turn to apologize 
And I saw her, with another man, and a sparkle in her eyes
 
Does she love that man? 
The way that I'm loving her still 
Does she love that man? 
For she has broken my will to survive 

I walked to a cafe where I sat and stared at an empty wall 
The waitress talked to me, but I could not hear her words at all 
The only sound that I could hear was the screaming of my soul 
My world revolved around one single thing I wish to know
 
Does she love that man? 
The way that I'm loving her still 
Does she love that man? 
For she has broken my will to survive 

The weather was changing, snow began falling 
The sky became dark like the mood of my heart 
I watched all the lovers 
Sharing together, their smiles and laughter were painful reminders 
I seem to recapture the moment I held her 
I made her swear that she'd always be there 
But she left me sorrow and fear of tomorrow 
As soon as I wake there's a pain I can't shake in my heart
 
Does she love that man? 
The way that I'm loving her still 
Does she love that man? 
For she has broken my will 
Does she love that man? 
The way that I'm loving her still 
Does she love that man? 
For she has broken my will 
Does she love him? 
Does she love him? 
Does she love that man?
