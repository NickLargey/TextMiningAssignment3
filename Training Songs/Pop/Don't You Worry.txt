Met a boy on my telephone,
You've been away, now you want to come home.
It's kinda strange since you are the one;
Who left me on my own.

So, don't you worry. (I'm doing fine.)
No don't you worry. (That you left me behind.)
'Cause I love my freedom, and I love my life.
So don't you worry. Coz I'm doing fine!

It's a little crazy you decided to call;
I was thinkin' bout you just an hour ago.
I was wondering if you've changed, hope that you've grown;
Won't you let me know.
It's about a year since I, got involved;
And I can't pretend that I'm not, curious.
If you're wondering why, I'm not making a fuss,
I guess I'm over us!

So, don't you worry. (I'm doing fine.)
No don't you worry. (That you left me behind.)
'Cause I love my freedom, and I love my life.
So don't you worry. Coz I'm doing fine!

So don't you worry,
If I still love thi,
The day you left my life, you lost all your right;
So don't you wonder, what I'm doing;
Well all you need to know is I'm doing fine.

So, don't you worry. (I'm doing fine.)
No don't you worry. (That you left me behind.)
'Cause I love my freedom, and I love my life.
So don't you worry. Coz I'm doing fine!
