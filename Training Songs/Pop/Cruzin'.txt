It's too high, we can't reach it
And one, two, three, four

Baby, where you going? (Where you going?)
Pull up in this grey foreign
I know you're down, don't you play me
No, no, no, no, no
Want me to change for you (right now)
Whooping through these lanes for you (aha)
Don't make me wait if you want me
No, no, no

No rely
Only you giving me mixed signals
Switching side
Why can't we just meet in the middle?

Call me when you're cruzin'
I do this, I do this
Don't give me excuses
Excuses, I do this
'Cause your body's talking, baby (body's talking)
Am lost in conversation
I stay cruzin', so carry on

Oh oh oh, I just wanna take it slow
We'll be cruzin' all of the night, aay
Oh oh oh, anywhere you wanna go
Say we're cruzin' all of the night, yeah

Hey, baby, what's the problem? (You know)
We got a lot in common (yeah, yeah)
And I'mma be around when you call me
No, no, no, no
Hey, baby, want me to flex on you?
F*ck around and spend a check on you?
Yeah, you get anything that you want
If you come with me

No rely
Only you giving me mixed signals
Switching side
Why can't we just meet in the middle?

Call me when you're cruzin'
I do this, I do this
Don't give me excuses
Excuses, I do this
'Cause your body's talking, baby (body's talking)
Am lost in conversation
I stay cruzin', so carry on

Oh oh oh, I just wanna take it slow
We'll be cruzin' all of the night, aay
Ooh, anywhere you wanna go
Say we're cruzin' all of the night, yeah

Oh oh oh, I just wanna take it slow
We'll be cruzin' all of the night, aay
Oh oh oh, anywhere you wanna go
Say we're cruzin' all of the night, yeah
