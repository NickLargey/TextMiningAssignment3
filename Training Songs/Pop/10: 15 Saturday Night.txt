Saturday night
Saturday night
And the tap drips
And the tap drips
Under the strip light
Under the strip light
And I'm sitting
And I'm sitting
In the kitchen sink
In the kitchen sink
And the tap drips
And the tap drips
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip

Waiting
Waiting
For the telephone to ring
For the telephone to ring
And I'm wondering
And I'm wondering
Where she's been
Where she's been
And I'm crying
And I'm crying
For yesterday
For yesterday
And the tap drips
And the tap drips
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip

It's always the same
It's always the same
