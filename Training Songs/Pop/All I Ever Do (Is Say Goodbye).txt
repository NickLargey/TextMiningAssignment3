Too young, they fall
That's just the way life goes
One more empty home
Can't eat, won't sleep, missing a part of me
Things are different now you're gone

Praying one day that we'll meet again
Say the words we never said
Every day I'm such a mess
What I'd give for

Just another moment by your side
(All I ever do is)
It's hard livin' without you in my life
(All I ever do is)
Man, I gotta laugh before I cry
(All I ever do is)
'Cause all I ever do, all I ever do
All I ever do is say goodbye
Is say goodbye, is say goodbye

The future in your eyes lives in a perfect memory
Hanging on for life
Though you've gone too soon
And left me feeling heavy
I celebrate our time

Praying one day that we'll meet again
Say the words we never said
Every day I'm such a mess
What I'd give for

Just another moment by your side
(All I ever do is)
It's hard livin' without you in my life
(All I ever do is)
Man, I gotta laugh before I cry
(All I ever do is)
'Cause all I ever do, all I ever do
All I ever do is say goodbye
Is say goodbye
All I ever do is say goodbye
Is say goodbye

Those were glory days
And I'm gonna miss them
Through it all, I prayed
I hope that you were listenin'

Just another moment by your side
It's hard livin' without you in my life
Man, I gotta laugh before I cry
'Cause all I ever do, all I ever do
All I ever do is say goodbye
Is say goodbye
All I ever do is say goodbye
'Cause all I ever do, all I ever do
All I ever do is say goodbye
