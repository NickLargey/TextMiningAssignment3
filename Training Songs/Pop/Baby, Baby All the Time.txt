Once I had a man, sweet as he could be
Once I had a man and he was right for me
Kind of curly hair, eyes so soft and true
That you couldn't help but care
When he looked at you
He called me baby
Baby all the time

He said, "Baby can't you see?"
"Baby understand?"
"Baby you're for me"
"Oh won't you take my hand?"
But I push him away
Wouldn't let him near
Pushed him far away
And now I'm wishing I could hear him
Call me baby, baby all the time

It's so lonely through the day
Lonely through the night
Lonely, lonely hours without that
Man I held so tight
Lord I pray that you will listen to my plea
Keep him close to you so he'll come back to me
And call me baby, baby all the time
Baby, baby all the time
