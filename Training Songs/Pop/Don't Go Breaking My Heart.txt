La la la la, lalalala la, la la la
La la la la la la

One drop of rain doesn't make the sun run away
Don't go breaking my heart
One falling leaf doesn't make September in May
Don't go breaking my heart

I made a mistake
Now must you make a mountain out of a grain of sand?
Don't throw love away because I went astray for a while
Teach my heart how to smile, oh

One sad goodbye doesn't mean we can't love again
Don't go breaking my heart
My love will last 'till the sky falls down, even then
You'll remain in my heart

Come to my arms forever more
Stay in my arms and give me your love

La la la la, lalalala la, la la la
Don't go breaking my heart
La la la la, lalalala la, la la la
Don't go breaking my heart
