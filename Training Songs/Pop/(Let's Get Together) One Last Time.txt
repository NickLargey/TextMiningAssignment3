Tomorrow you'll reach out and take my hand
And on my finger place a golden band
And somewhere on the other side of town
She'll stand beside you in her brand new wedding gown

You love her, I love him but here we are
The music's soft, the lights are dim

Let's get together, one last time
Tonight's the night, it'll be alright
You can hold me tight 'til the morning light

She loves you and he loves me
Tomorrow night just won't be right, we won't be free

Let's get together, one last time
'Cause we can't break the vows we'll make
So for old time's sake, I'm yours to take
One last time, one last time, one last time
