John's in love with Joan
Joan's in love with Jim
Jim's in love with someone
Who's not in love with him
What was meant to be, must be
see'est la vie, see'est la vie
Life's a funny thing
When it comes to love
You don't always conquer
The one you're dreaming of 
As they say in old Paree
see'est la vie, see'est la vie
Those who fall in love agree
It's the unsolved mystery
If your big romance cannot be
You'll find someone new, cherie
There goes happy Joe (Jane)
What a lucky guy
He just found a sweetheart
But no one's gonna cry
Tho' he stole her love from me
see'est la vie, see'est la vie
