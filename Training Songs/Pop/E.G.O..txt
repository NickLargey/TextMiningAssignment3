How can you help me?
How does it help you?
Show me your résumé
And I'll show you mine, too

I wanna be celebrated
And lit up on the marquee
And it's overrated
But we think it's everything

I drink the Kool-Aid, you're drinking mine, too
What if we exaggerate?
You're the greatest, I'm the greatest

Everybody gets off
On the fame and the glory
Trying to chase out the lonely
We're gonna be loved, we want it right now
Everybody gets off
On the size of a trophy
On the high that we don't need
And once you go up, you never come down

(Ooh, ooh)
No, you never come down
(Ooh, ooh)

I wanna be a hotshot
I wanna have some fun
We don't care how we get to the top
We just wanna be someone

I don't hungry, 'cause I'm always full of myself
It sounds so ugly
I'm the greatest, You're the greatest

Everybody gets off
On the fame and the glory
Trying to chase out the lonely
We wanna be loved, we want it right now
Everybody gets off
On the size of a trophy
On the high that we don't need
And once you come up, you never come down

(Ooh, ooh)

Aren't you glad you know me? Aren't you glad you know me?
(Aren't you glad you know, know?)
Look at me now, look at me now
Aren't you glad you know me?
(Know–)
Aren't you glad you know me? Aren't you glad you know me?
(I gotta know)
Look at me now, look at me now
Aren't you glad you know me?
(Everybody)

Everybody gets off
On the fame and the glory
Trying to chase out the lonely
We wanna be loved, we want it right now
Everybody gets off
On the size of a trophy
On the high that we don't need
And once you go up, you never come down

(Whoa, ooh)
(Whoa, ooh)

Everybody gets off
On the fame and the glory
On the high that you don't need
Everybody gets off
Everybody gets off
On the size of a trophy
On the high that we don't need
(Everybody gets off, gets off)
