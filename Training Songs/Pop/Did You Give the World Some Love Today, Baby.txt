When you saw a weary man
Were you quick to realize
The thing he needed most
Was a kind look from your eyes
Whan you saw an angry face
And the faces that you scanned
Did you soften up a bit
With the flower from your hands

Oh your heart is always full of love babe
And you gave me lots of love today babe
Will you also keep the world in mind
Tell me what you did for all mankind
To give the world some love today babe

Everybody in this world has to do a whole lot more
Then love the one they spend a lifetime looking for
You just can't keep your love in a cozy little shell
Got to love the one you know and a whole darn world as well
