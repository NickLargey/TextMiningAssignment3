Blue moon light feel so right
Does take light for me and and my lover
Dim the lights, lips like wine,feel so right for me and my lover
Refr.
Dance Dance dïamour, kissing the night tonight, toujours
Cause when the dance is all over, we do a sweet Bossa Nova
Dance Cance dïamour, wishing the night will last toujours
Cause when the dance is all over, we do a sweet Bossa Nova
Donït you feel this is real, time stands still for me and my lover
Dim the light, lips like wine
Feel so right for me and my lover

Dance Dance dïamour, kissing the night tonight, toujours
Cause when the dance is all over, we do a sweet Bossa Nova
Dance Cance dïamour, wishing the night will last toujours
Cause when the dance is all over, we do a sweet Bossa Nova
Tease me , please me, tell me, you be true
Hold me in your arms, I love you, I love you
