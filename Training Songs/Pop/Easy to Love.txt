You'd be so easy to love,
So easy to idolize,
All others above,
So worth the yearning for.

So swell to keep ev'ry
Home-fire waiting for,
You'd be so, grand at the game,
So carefree together,
That it does seem a shame,
That you can't see
Your future with me,

'Cause you'd be oh,
So easy to love!
