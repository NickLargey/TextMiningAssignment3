Girl
There comes a time in your life
When you know that the feeling's right
Yeah

Now I know
I took too long
To realize that now you're gone
Yeah

I should of known by the look in your eyes
That it was over when you said goodbye
No other girl can make me feel like you do
I know it's over but i'm missing you

[Chorus]
The day you left
Girl I can't forget
Oh, what can I do?
When I can't get over you
I think about it
Every night I dream
You'll come back to me
'Cause I can't get over you

When
I found my love inside
Should've given it all to you
Whoa, and honey
I wish that you only knew
This pain that I'm going through
Girl I need you

I should of known, by the tears in your eyes
How much you love me when you said goodbye
No other girl can do the things that you do
I know it's over but I'm missing you

[Chorus]

I tried to love another girl but she'd only
Only reminds me of you
No other girl can take your place in my heart
I just can't live when we're apart

[Chorus]
