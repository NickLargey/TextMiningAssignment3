Mary had a little lamb 
His fleece was white as snow 
And everywhere that Mary went 
The lamb was sure to go 

Now ain't that just like me 
Well you know cracking up over you 
You know that I love you (yeah) 
Love you (yeah) 
Won't you come along there too 

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall 
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall 
All the king's horses and all the king's men 
Couldn't put him back again 

[Chorus:]
Hey diddle-diddle the cat had a fiddle 
The cow jumped over the moon 
The little dog laughed to see such fun 
And the dish ran away with the spoon 

It's all right now 
Won't you come along there too 
We're shaking now 
Won't you come along there too 
Come on baby
