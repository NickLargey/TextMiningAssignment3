Don't be a baby, baby
'Bout a love that passed you by
But if you have to, baby
Go ahead and have your cry

I'll be your baby, baby
Truer than the one you knew
And someday maybe, maybe, baby
You will learn to love me too

Don't be a baby, baby
'Bout a love that passed you by
But if you have to, baby
Go ahead and have your cry

I'll be your baby, baby
Truer than the one you knew
And someday maybe, baby, baby
You will learn to love me too

Don't be a baby, baby

Go ahead and have your cry

I'll be your baby, baby
Truer than the one you knew
And someday maybe, maybe, baby
You will learn to love me too
