Ain't got a dime to my name, 
What a terrible shame
Ho Hum, ho ho Hum.

Just found a hole in my shoe,
And my stockin' sticks through
Ho Hum, ho ho Hum.

I know that when you're as free 
As a bird in a tree, life is a wonderful whim.
Look at the crank with his dough in the bank,
Don't you feel sorry for him?

Rolling along at a loss,
Never gathering moss,
Ho Hum, ho ho ho ho Hum.

(Take it!)

I'm no terrific success, 
I often worry I guess
Ho Hum, Wo ho ho Hum.

I like a shady ole' tree,
Whats a matter with me?
Ho Hum, ho hohoho Hum.

There's nothing quite as grotesque,
As a man at a desk,
Looking outside at the sun,
Shirts made of silk,
And a diet of milk,
Maybe he thinks he has fun.

I've got the vagabond itch,
Yes I'll never get rich
Ho Hum ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho hm
