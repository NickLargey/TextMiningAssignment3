Ask me for the world
It doesn't seem much
Ask me for the moon, dear
And I'll reach out and touch

Anything for you, for you, dear, only
But please don't ask me to be lonely

Ask me for the stars, dear
And I'll do your command
Ask me for the diamonds
I'll put them on your hand

Anything for you, for you, dear, only
But please don't ask me to be lonely

I searched this world
This whole wide world
Looking for a girl such as you

I gave up my search
When I looked into
Pretty, pretty eyes of blue
Dooby dooby dooby

Ask me for the stars, dear
And I'll do your command
Ask me for the diamonds
I'll put them on your hand

Anything for you, for you, dear, only
But please don't ask me to be lonely

Don't ask me to be lonely
