every night, when the sun goes in
every night when the sun goes in
 i hang down my head and morn and mornful cry
true love don't weap true don't morn
true love don't weap no morn for me
i'm going away to marble town
i wish to the lord
the train would come
i wish to the lord the train would come
to take me back
where i come from
true love don't don't weap 
true love don't morn
true love don't weap 
i'm going away to marble town
