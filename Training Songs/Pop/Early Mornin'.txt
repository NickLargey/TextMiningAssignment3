Early mornin' 
Alright I was out late last night 
Got a little messy 
Early mornin' 
Can't be like that anymore 
No 

I was shaking my ass in the streets all morning 
Just walked in and it's early mornin' 
Bump bump till the break of dawn 
And it don't stop till the early mornin' 

Passed out on the couch and yawning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Bump bump till the break of dawn 
And it don't stop till the early mornin' 

Met a tall dude, kinda dark hair 
When he walked up somebody grabbed him 
But I liked him 
Told him to come here 

Kinda cool 
Baby we can make plans 
Where you live 
Does your mama live there 

We can hook up at the hotel 
He was down 
So I told him, let's go 
What happened next? Guess 
But, you don't want to know

Bump bump till the break of dawn 
It don't stop till the early mornin' 

Passed out on the couch and yawning 
Just walked in and it's early mornin' 
Bump bump till the break of dawn 
It don't stop till the early mornin' 

Oh, I went out and I approached him 
But we couldn't get with his friends 
There's something bout him, I'm sure 
So I said what the hell let's go 
Got up 

Got on the dance floor 
Hooked up with a guy named Joe 
When the music was fast and slow 
What happened next? Guess 
But, you don't want to know 

I was shaking my ass in the streets this morning 
Just walked in and it's early mornin' 
Bump bump, 'til the break of dawn 
It don't stop till the early mornin' 

Passed out on the couch and yawning 
Just walked in and it's early mornin' 
Bump bump till the break of dawn 
It don't stop till the early mornin' 

Call all your boys 
Call all your girls 
Call all your friends 
Let's do it again 
Let's do it again 

Yes, Early mornin' 
Yes, can't keep doing this 

I light your fire 
Your one desire 
Pull on me baby and I'll take you higher 
You should try it so come over here and let's go some
