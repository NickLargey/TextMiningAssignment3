You sheltered me from harm.
You kept me warm.
You kept me warm. 

You gave my life to me.
You set me free.
You set me free. 

The finest years I ever knew.
Were all the ones I spent with you. 

I would give anything I own. Give up my life and my heart, my home.
I would give everything I own, just to have you back again. 

You taught me how to love.
And what it's of, what it's of. 

You never said too much but still you showed the way.
And so I knew, from watching you. 

Nobody else can ever know.
The part of me that can't let go. 

I would give anything I own. Give up my life and my heart, my home.
I would give everything I own, just to have you back again.
Just to touch you once again. 

Is there someone you know, you're loving them so but taking them all for granted.
You may lose them one day. Someone takes them away and they'll never hear the words you have to say. 

I would give anything I own. Give up my life and my heart, my home.
I would give everything I own, just to have you back again. 

Everything I own. My life, my heart, my home.
I'd give everything I own. My life, my heart, my home. 

Every little thing. 
Just to have you back again.
Just to hold you.
