Every place you go
Everyone's dancing mad
Every place you go
Everyone's got it bad

There's a dance they do
They call it crazy feet
Take a chance and you
Will find it hard to beat

If you shake and you're hot
No mistake brother
You've surely got
Crazy feet

If you go off your nut
Then you know
You've got nothing else
But crazy feet

Let's go boom
And you chase me around
Don't step on your shoe lace
You'll fall down

You ain't heard nothin' yet
Take my word
It's a kick when you get
Crazy feet

If you shake and you're hot
No mistake brother
You've surely got
Crazy feet

If you go off your nut
Then you know
You've got nothing else
But crazy feet

Let's go boom
And you chase me around
Don't step on your shoe lace
You'll fall down

Da, da, you ain't heard nothin' yet
Take my word
It's a kick when you get
Crazy feet
