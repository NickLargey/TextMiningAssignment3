I go 'round moping
And i go 'round blue
I made you cry 
For I had been untrue
And now I cry for you

Won't ya come back silly girl
Come back to me
Come back silly girl
Can't you see I'm in love

Your mother tells me that you're not at home
Each time I call you on the telephone
Oh I'm so lost and alone

Won't ya come back silly girl
Come back to me
Come back silly girl
Can't you see I'm in love
Come back my love
Come back my love
