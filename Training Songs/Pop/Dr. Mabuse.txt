It's alright - it's ok - it's an odysee
Dr Mabuse, Dr Mabuse
It's a shame he'll return - in a shade of grey
Dr Mabuse, Dr Mabuse

He's living in the Twilight Sky -
Lonley voices they will cry
In a Rain of Silence he returned
In a tempel he survived -
A Cathedral, dead man's life
He's the soldier and your heart will burn
He faced the devil - faced the hell
Can't look back - don't tell

It's alright - it's ok - it's an odysee
Dr Mabuse, Dr Mabuse
It's a shame he'll return - in a shade of grey
Dr Mabuse, Dr Mabuse
Every Night - Every Day on the run
He's the man - who has stolen the Sun
Oh he lost - all his life - all his dreams
Born hundred Years ago
Ohohohohohohohohoohooho

Oh Seven Ways of loneliness -
Tall strange Man, old black dress 
You can see his silhouette in black
A kiss of Death - a secret Friend
He's the Loser in the End
The Soldier of the Darkness, he'll come back
He's knocking on forbidden doors
Like years and years before

It's alright - it's ok - it's an odysee
Dr Mabuse, Dr Mabuse
It's a shame he'll return - in a shade of grey
Dr Mabuse, Dr Mabuse
Every Night - Every Day on the run
He's the man - who has stolen the Sun
Oh he lost - all his life - all his dreams
Born hundred Years ago
Ohohohohohohohohoohooho

It's alright - it's ok - it's an odysee
Dr Mabuse, Dr Mabuse
It's a shame he'll return - in a shade of grey
Dr Mabuse, Dr Mabuse
Every Night - Every Day on the run
He's the man - who has stolen the Sun
Oh he lost - all his life - all his dreams
Born hundred Years ago
Ohohohohohohohohoohooho....
