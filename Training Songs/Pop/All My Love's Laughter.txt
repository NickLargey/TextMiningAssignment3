All my love's laughter
And all my love's faces
She comes in the morning
Her cloak in her arms

She's following after
The king of all places
And your tenderest warnin'
Could bruise all her charm

But don't lose your heart
To that beautiful sinner
She walks without shining a light now

She stands in the shade
And the sun is there in her
But you'll never know till it's night

All my love's softness
And ll my love's graces
She carries all things
In her tiny white glove

She hides all her lostness
In satins and laces
And everyone says, everyone says
She's searching for sweet love

But don't try to hold on
To Satan's proud lady
She stands with her flock
All alone on the hill

Her stockings are hung
And her eyes are so shady
She's winning and you never will
