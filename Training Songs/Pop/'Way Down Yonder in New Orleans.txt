Well, way down yonder in New Orleans 
In the land of the dreamy scenes
There's a garden of Eden
That's what I mean, ah

Creole babies with flashin' eyes
Softly whisper with tender sighs
Stop, oh, won't you give your lady fair a little smile
Stop, you bet your life you'll linger there a little while
There is heaven right here on earth
With those beautiful queens
Way down yonder in New Orleans

Way down yonder in New Orleans
Way down in the land of the dreamy scenes
There's a garden of Eden
You know that's what I mean

Creole babies with flashin' eyes 
Softly whisper with tender sighs, stop
Oh won't you give your lady fair a little smile
Stop, you bet your life you'll linger there a little while

They've got angels right here on earth
Wearing little blue jeans
Way down yonder in New Orleans

Stop, oh won't you give your lady fair a little smile
Stop, you bet your life you'll linger there a little while
There is heaven right here on earth
With those beautiful queens
Way down yonder in New Orleans

Softly whisper with tender sighs
Oh stop oh, won't you give your lady fair, a little smile
I gotta stop, you bet your life you'll linger there a little while
There is heaven right here on earth
With those beautiful queens
Way down yonder in New Orleans
