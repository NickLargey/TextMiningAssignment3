I've got beginner's luck
The first time I'm in love
I'm in love with you
Gosh I'm lucky!

I've got beginner's luck
They told me beginners win
Now I know it's true
Gosh I'm fortunate!

This thing we've begun
Is much more than a pastime
For this time is the one
Where the first time is the last time!

I've got beginner's luck
Lucky through and through
For the first time that I'm in love
I'm in love with you!

At any gambling casino
From Monte Carlo to Reno
They tell you that a beginner
Comes out a winner
Beginner fishing for flounder
Will catch a seventeen pounder
That's what I've always heard
And always thought absurd
But now I believe every word!

I've got beginner's luck
The first time I'm in love
I'm in love with you

I've got beginner's luck
There never was such a smile
Or such eyes of blue

This thing we've begun
Is much more than a pastime
For this time is the one
Where the first time is the last time!

For the first time that I'm in love
The very first time that I'm in love
For the first time that I'm in love
I'm in love with you!
