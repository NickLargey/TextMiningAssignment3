I thought this is the real thing
I thought your better for me
I thought I hope it ain't too good to be true
It felt like nothing before
You were what I was waiting for
At least that's what I made myself belive
'Cause

[Bridge]
I was there for you
Baby what did I do, to make you untrue

[Chorus]
You said I satisfied all your fantasies
You said that I was everything you ever dreamed
So how comes suddenly it ain't enough
That I gave you the best of my love

What you saw is what you got
First you loved then you loved me not
Turns out baby your just all about the tricks
You just want what you don't have
Now I'm gone but it's too bad
I won't be making that mistake again
'Cause

[Bridge]
I was there for you
Baby what did I do, to make you untrue

[Chorus]
You said I satisfied all your fantasies
You said that I was everything you ever dreamed
So how comes suddenly it ain't enough
That I gave you the best of my love
You said you wanted to take it all away
When it came down to it you were never gonna stay
But I am done with that I've had enough
I'm taking back the best of my love

I'm done with it and I'm over it
And I can't belive I never was a fool for you
But I'm out the door and I want no more
I'm done with it and I'm over it
And I can't belive I never was a fool for you
But I'm out the door and I want no more
Now your on your own

[Bridge]
I was there for you
Baby what did I do, to make you untrue

[Chorus]
You said I satisfied all your fantasies
You said that I was everything you ever dreamed
So how comes suddenly it ain't enough
That I gave you the best of my love
You said you wanted to take it all away
When it came down to it you were never gonna stay
But I am done with that I've had enough
I'm taking back the best of my love

I'm done with it and I'm over it
And I can't belive I never was a fool for you
But I'm out the door and I want no more
I'm done with it and I'm over it
And I can't belive I never was a fool for you
But I'm out the door and I want no more
Now your on your own
