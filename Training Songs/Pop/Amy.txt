People always tell me it's a funny name
I suppose they could be right but just the same

Amy
What a girl
Even if I say so
I could've loved her if only I'd known

Amy
Flowing hair
On the seventh page there
She will never age there
Now forever she'll be

Sweet Amy
Guess I got a thing about Amy
Always wanna sing about Amy,
My picture book queen

Girl of my dreams
People always tell me it's a funny name
I suppose they could be right but just the same

Amy
How I wish
I could be there with you
All my love I'd give you
Darling I hope there'd be no one
But Amy

Years ago
Someone must have kissed you
Wonder if he missed you?
Just like I'm doing today

Sweet Amy
Guess I got a thing about Amy
Always wanna sing about Amy,
My picture book queen
