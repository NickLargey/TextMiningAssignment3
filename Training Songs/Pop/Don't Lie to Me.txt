Why can you just tell me the truth?
Hard to believe the things you say
Why can't you feel the tears I cried today, cried today, cried today
How do you win if we all lose?
You change the facts to justify
Your lips move but your words get in the way, in the way, in the way

Kings and Queens, crooks and thieves
You don't see the forest for the trees
Head and heart on our knees
You can't see what we all see

How do you sleep when the world keeps turning?
All that we built has come undone
How do you sleep when the world is burning?
Everyone answers to someone

Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me

You can build towers of bronze and gold
You can build castles in the sky
You can use smoke and mirrors, old clich√©s
Not today, not today

Kings and Queens, crooks and thieves
You don't see the forest for the trees
Hand on heart, down our knees
You can't see what everyone sees

How do you sleep when the world keeps turning?
All that we built has come undone
How do you sleep when the world is burning?
Everyone answers to someone

Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me

Can't you see I'm crying?
Can't you see we're crying?
Where's the new horizon?
Where's the new horizon?

How do you sleep?
How do you sleep?
How do you sleep?
(How do you sleep when the world is turning?)
How do you sleep?
(All that we built has come undone)
Enough is enough
(How do you sleep when the world is burning?)
How do you sleep?
(Everyone answers to someone)

Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me

Can't you see I'm crying?
(Can't you see we're crying?)
Can't you see we're crying?
Everyone answers to someone
