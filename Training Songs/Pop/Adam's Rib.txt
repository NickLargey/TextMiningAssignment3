Once upon a time
I was just a little bone
I was just a little tiny rib
and the rib cage was my home
Somedays I'd wonder how it would feel
to be my own person
to eat my own meals

I never had to make a plan
just be a little piece of a bigger man

And Adam rocked my world
I was his biggest fan
No such thing as being a girl
He had the whole world in his hands

Now that was the life
No worries no pain
Just stay in my place
and grow a little more each day
I never had to make a plan
just be a little piece of a bigger man

And Adam rocked my world
I was his biggest fan
No such thing as being a girl
He had the whole world in his hands

Then I started to wonder
What's this spell I might be under
It's time to break away
It's time to feed this hunger

Never had to take a stand
just be a little piece of a bigger man
