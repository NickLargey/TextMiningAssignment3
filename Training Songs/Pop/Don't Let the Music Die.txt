Yesterday when I was young
I played the game and never won
Thought rock and roll would bless
my soul forever.
Songs of love and ecstasy
Remind me how it used to be
I thought those days would never end
But now it seems I need a friend

I remember all those days gone by
I remember all their faces
The old familiar places

[Chorus]
Don't let the music die,
No our song could last forever
Don't let the music die,
Don't let the music die
And though we've said goodbye,
We could spend our lives together,
So as time goes by
Don't let the music die

Yesterday, the world was mine
I played the clown and Pantomime
Or was it just a dream that's gone
forever
Echoed voices from the past
Recall the songs I thought would last
And say "Those times will never die"
And the love we share's the reason why

I remember all those days gone by
I remember all their faces,
The old familiar places

[Chorus]

When we were young we had our time
And we would drink
sweet talking wine
but now that it's over
All the songs sound out of rhyme

[Chorus]
