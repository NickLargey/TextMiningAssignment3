The candles flicker in the fading light,
I sit alone and watch that lonely night.
I see you everywhere,
and I try desperately to hide.

Another Time, Another Place,
I see that old, familiar face,
and I try hard to catch your eye.
Another Road, Another Mile,
I see that old, familiar smile,
but you'll be with somebody new.

Another Night, Another Day,
I see you standing in my way,
I stop and say, "Hello, My friend,"
Another Place, Another Time,
You tell me you've been doin' fine,
and walk away from me once more

I try and run away from sad regrets,
the bitter wine won't help me to forget
that I locked up my heart,
and threw away the precious key.

Another Time, Another Place,
I see that old, familiar face,
and I try hard to catch your eye.
Another Road, Another Mile,
I see that old, familiar smile,
but you'll be with somebody new.

Another Night, Another Day,
I see you standing in my way,
I stop and say, "Hello, My friend,"
Another Place, Another Time,
You tell me you've been doin' fine,
and walk away from me once more

Another Night, Another Day,
I see you standing in my way,
I stop and say, "Hello, My friend,"
Another Place, Another Time,
You tell me you've been doin' fine,
and walk away from me once more!
