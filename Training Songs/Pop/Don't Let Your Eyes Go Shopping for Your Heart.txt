Don't let your eyes go shopping for your heart
They only see the things that are in view
A cover doesn't make a book a work of art
To know its worth you've got to read it through and through

You must realize that rule also applies
To romance when you seek a mate, that's true
Beware of love at sight, take your time, make sure it's right
Don't let your eyes go shopping for your heart
