What's that perfume that you wear?
It brings me back somewhere
To the anticipation
Before I kissed someone
It's got a sadness in it
Knowing how it ended
A promise of something so sweet
That never could be

And it smells so good
That sandalwood
The lavender
Lemon ginger
And I guess I still love her
But she's gone forever
And however hard that might feel
At least it was real
If it could hurt like that

Got a miniature shampoo bottle on my shelf
From when we stayed at a hotel
And one whiff of that and I'm back there with her
Coming out of the shower, she's still in bed fixing her hair
Says, "Let's go somewhere"
I can smell her sun lotion
From the window the jasmine
And the salt from the ocean

And it smells so good
That sandalwood
The vetiver
Pink pepper
And I guess I still love her
But she's gone forever
And however hard that might feel
At least it was real
If it could hurt like that

(Over and over, over and over
Over and over, head up, head up, head up!)

It smells so good
That sandalwood
The lavender
Lemon ginger
And I guess I still love her
But she's gone forever
And however hard that might feel
At least it was real
If it could hurt like that
