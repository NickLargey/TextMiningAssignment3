C'est si bon
Lovers say that in France
When they thrill to romance
It means that it's so good
C'est si bon
So I say to you
Like the French people do
Because it's oh so good
Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear,
Leads to only one thought
And the thought is this, dear!
C'est si bon
Nothing else can replace
Just your slightest embrace
And if you only would be my own for the rest my days
I will whisper this phrase
My darling, my darling
C'est si bon!
