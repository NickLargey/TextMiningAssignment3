If my friends should ask for me, 
Here at home is where I'll be
There's no one I care to see,
I'm breaking in a brand new broken heart
Now the heartaches have begun,
There's a job that must be done
I have no time for havin' fun,
I'm breaking in a brand new broken heart
Leave me alone and let me cry, cry, cry
There are tears that must be cried 
Till there's no more tears inside
Let me take the count of ten,
Then I'll bounce right back again
Let me be alone till then,
I'm breaking in a brand new broken heart
I'm breaking in a brand new broken heart
