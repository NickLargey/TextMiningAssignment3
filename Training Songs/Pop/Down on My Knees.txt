I've got a witness not too stable
It wouldn't get me very far
I've got one hand on the table
And one in the cookie jar
I've got sins that need eviction
From a temple that's a wreck
I've got a chain of contradiction
Hanging around my neck
So I go down, I go down, down
I go down on my knees

I feel the bitter winds grow colder
They are dancing with my pride
I've got a chip on my shoulder
Bigger than a mountainside
And these claws of human nature
Hold me tight within their clasp
I'm not worthy of forgiveness
But I just had to ask
So I go down, I go down, down
I go down on my knees

(Chorus)
Feed my hunger â€“ slake my thirst
For a spiritual rebirth
Light my darkness
Move in me
Make me more than what you see
As I go down on my knees

When I've all but killed the fire
And my soul's in desperate need
But I wallow in the mire of complacency
That's when I go down on my knees
I want to taste the fruit I'm missing
And yet I feast only on the bread
My desire's alive and kicking
But my drive is dead
So I go down on my knees

(Chorus)

You bear the weight of condemnation
Cleansing with the blood of truth
So with my humble acclamation
I want to give myself to you 
So I go down, I go down, down
I go down on my knees
I go down, I go down, yea
I go down on my knees
I go down, I go down, down
I go down on my knees
