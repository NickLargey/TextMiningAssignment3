Wake up tired, Monday mornings suck,
It's way too early to catch a bus,
Why conform without a fuss,
Daddy Daddy, no, I don't want to go to school, woo!

I don't need to read Billy Shakespeare,
Meet Juliet or Malvolio,
Feel for once what it's like to rebel now,
I want to break out, let's go!

Teachers treat us all like clones,
Sit up straight, take off your headphones,
I don't blame them, they get paid,
Money money, woo, lot's of money money, woo!

I don't need to read Billy Shakespeare,
Meet Juliet or Malvolio,
Feel for once what it's like to rebel now,
I want to break out, let's go!

Get out, get out, get out, get out, woo!
Get out, get out, get out, get out!
To skip or not to skip? that is the question.
Get out, get out, get out, get out, woo!
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out,
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out!

I don't need to read Billy Shakespeare,
Meet Juliet or Malvolio,
Feel for once what it's like to rebel now,
I want to break out, let's go!

I don't need to read Billy Shakespeare,
Meet Juliet or Malvolio,
Feel for once what it's like to rebel now,
I want to break out, let's go!

Get out, get out, get out, get out, woo!
Get out, get out, get out, get out, woo!
Feel for once what it's like to rebel now,
I want to break out, let's go!

Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out!
