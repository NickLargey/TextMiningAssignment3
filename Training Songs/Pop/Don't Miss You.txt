Was just the other day when you said to me
That you had enough
Told me that you wanna move on with your life
And now you sing to me the same old melody
That I?m still the one
You thought I?d hang around while you made up your mind

I used to say that you were everything
You got your way but not anymore

Did you think it would be that easy
Did you think I?d be back for more
Loving you was a big mistake 'cause I don?t miss you at all
Did you think I would wait forever
Baby like the others did before
Loving you was my mistake 'cause I don?t miss you at all

No, I don?t I don?t I don?t miss you

So here you are today trying to manipulate
But that won?t work this time
'cause baby don?t you know you?re the last thing on my mind
Not gonna hesitate don?t wanna recreate the dreams you broke in two
So I?ll pick up the pieces of my broken heart and be done

Did you think it would be that easy
Did you think I?d be back for more
Loving you was a big mistake 'cause I don?t miss you at all
Did you think I would wait forever
Baby like the others did before
Loving you was my mistake 'cause I don?t miss you at all

No, I don?t I don?t I don?t miss you

No, I don?t I don?t I don?t miss you
No, I don?t I don?t I don?t need you

I gottta move on with my life
'cause I don?t miss you at all

Did you think it would be that easy
Did you think I?d be back for more
Loving you was a big mistake 'cause I don?t miss you at all
Did you think I would wait forever
Baby like the others did before
Loving you was my mistake 'cause I don?t miss you at all
