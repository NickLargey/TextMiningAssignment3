There'll be a time when everyone is left alone and I'll have mine
There is no doubt when everyone has worn me out and gone
When everybody's had their fill, she'll be waiting, she's waiting still
And though she doesn't know, I know, I know she wouldn't mind

'Cause having someone believe in me, is all I need to know
And standing all alone, is not the way I want to go

And if I get to be a star, or maybe nowhere near that far
I know that either way, it doesn't matter much to her
And if I'm on my dying bed and suddenly, my life is bled away from me
I know, she'll shed a tear because she cares

'Cause having someone believe in me, is all I need to know
And standing all alone, is not the way I want to go

And if I get to be a star, or maybe nowhere near that far
I know that either way, it doesn't matter much to her
And if I'm on my dying bed and suddenly, my life is bled away from me
I know she'll shed a tear because she cares

'Cause having someone believe in me, is all I need to know
And standing all alone, is not the way I want to go
