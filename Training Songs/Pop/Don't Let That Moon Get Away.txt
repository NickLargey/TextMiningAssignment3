It's one of those nights for adventure
We ought to be recklessly gay
Who knows what we'll find, so if you're inclined
Don't let that moon get away

Your eyes have a way of revealing
The thoughts that you really should say
It may be romance, so while there's a chance
Don't let that moon get away

And don't let this meeting adjourn
And don't be so ready to go
But now is the right time to learn
What every young heart should know

These moments don't happen so often
It doesn't seem right to delay
If you feel a tune, whatever you do
Don't let that moon get away

It's one of those nights for adventure
We ought to be recklessly gay

Your eyes have a way of revealing
The thoughts that you really should say

And don't let this meeting adjourn
And don't be so ready to go
Now is the right time to learn
Look out!

These moments don't happen so often
I kinda think we shouldn't delay
If you feel it too, here's what you do
You better take advice from Torme
And don't let that moon get away
Don't you there let that moon get away
Baby, don't let that moon get away
It's one of those nights for adventure
