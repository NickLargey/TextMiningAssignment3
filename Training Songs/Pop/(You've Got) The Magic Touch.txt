I'm sorry for the things I've done 
I know that I'm the foolish one 
Now that I see who's to blame 
I'm so ashamed, I'm sorry 

I'm sorry for the things I've said 
Just like a child I lost my head 
I should have known from the start 
I'd break your heart, I'm sorry 

Please be kind and I know you'll find 
It's so easy to forgive 
Darling, wait for it's not too late 
Give our love a chance to live 

I know the heartaches you've been through 
I know for I've had heartaches, too 
There's nothing more I can do 
But say to you "I'm sorry" 

Please be kind and I know you'll find 
It's so easy to forgive 
Darling, wait for it's not too late 
Give our love a chance to live, oh live 

I know the heartaches you've been through 
I know for I've had heartaches, too 
There's nothing more I can do 
But say to you, "I'm sorry" 

(Darling, I'm truly sorry)
