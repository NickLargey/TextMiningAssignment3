Bubbles bubbles 
Why I my love affairs just bubbles
Whenever I fall if I give her a call
There's a busy line 
With my kinda luck I not only get stuck
But I lose my dime

There only troubles 
Troubles
And when I care the most they double
I get a hug and I know I should stop
Then comes a kiss and I float to the top
Right to the stars in the sky 
Then it's pop

Tumblin tumblin tumblin tumblin
Down I go 
It was a bubble 
Bubbles bubbles bubbles bubbles
Every boodily every time

I get a hug and I know I should stop
Then comes a kiss
And I float to the top
Right to the stars in the sky then it's pop

Tumblin tumblin tumblin tumblin
Down I go 
It was a bubble
Bubbles bubbles bubbles bubbles
Every boodily every time
