Cry, cry go cry your eyes out 
Now that your heart`s broken in two 
Cry, cry go cry your eyes out 
Baby I`m laughing at you 
 
You left me for a new love 
Too bad he was untrue 
So cry, cry go cry your eyes out 
You had it coming to you 
 
I`m so glad that you`re getting your share of misery 
He did to you exactly what you did to me 
So cry, cry go cry your eyes out 
See how it feels to be blue 
Cry, cry go cry your eyes out 
Baby I`m laughing at you 
 
(repeat 3x fading on 3rd) 
Oh cry, cry go cry your eyes out 
See how it feels to be blue 
And cry and cry go cry your eyes out 
Baby I`m laughing at you
