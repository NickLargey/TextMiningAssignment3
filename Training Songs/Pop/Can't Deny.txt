(Yeah yeah, hey baby)

I see the look inside your eyes
You'll relinquish yourself if I surely tried
But I see overwhelming pride
But here's something you just can't deny

Can't deny the way that you feel
(You feel)
Can't decide if your love is for real
(For real)
You just want to let your emotions slide
(Slide)
But here's something you just can't deny

Just show me, just show me
Just show me, just show me

(Yeah yeah, hey baby)

Is there something you want to say
Move closer you seem so far away
I can't forever wait for you
To confirm if your feelings are true

I see the look inside your eyes
You'll relinquish yourself if I tried
But I see overwhelming pride
But here's something you just can't deny

Can't deny the way that you feel
(You feel)
