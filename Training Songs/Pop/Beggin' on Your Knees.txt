You had it all
The day you told me
Told me you want me
I had it all
But let you fool me
Fool me completely

Yeah I was so stupid
To give you all my attention
'Cause the way you played me
Exposed your true intention

'Cause one day
I'll have you beggin' on your knees for me
Yeah one day
I'll have you crawling like a centipede
You mess with me
I'll mess with her
So I'll make sure you get what you deserve
Yeah one day
You'll be beggin' on your knees for me

So watch your back
'Cause you don't know when or where I could get you
I've set the trap and when I am done
Then you'll know what I've been through
So oh mister player do you feel like the man now
And I bet you're nervous 'cause this song makes you freak out

'Cause one day
I'll have you beggin' on your knees for me
Yeah one day
I'll have you crawling like a centipede
You mess with me
I'll mess with her
So I'll make sure you get what you deserve
Yeah one day
You'll be beggin' on your knees for me

I know I'm being bitter
But I'mma drive you under
'Cause you just don't, don't deserve happy ever after
But what you did to me, after you told me
You never felt that way it was only just a game

You had it all
And one day

And one day
I'll have you beggin' on your knees for me
(Beggin' on your knees for me)
Yeah one day
I'll have you crawling like a centipede
(Crawling like a centipede)
You mess with me
I'll mess with her
So I'll make sure you get what you deserve
Yeah one day
You'll be beggin' on your knees for me
