Have you ever wondered about our old nu-metal friends and what became of them?
Turns out I saw them a couple of days ago,
They were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing.

C'mon, can you count all the notches in your belt?
I'd rather not, let's just say I'm starving myself.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper,
I don't want no savior baby, I just wanna have a good time

Oh, oh, At least I'm not as sad as I used to be.

And they said,
"Hey Nate, yeah, it's been a while,
Are you gonna sing?"
And I began to smile and I said,
"You should've seen me a couple of years ago,
I was laughing and drinking and smoking and singing."

C'mon can you count all the loves that didn't last?
It's such a gas when you bring up the past.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper.
I don't want no savior baby
I just wanna get it out.

Oh oh, oh, at least I'm not as sad as I used to be.
Oh oh, oh, at least I'm not as sad as I used to be.
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be.

And they say we would've seen you two years ago
Had you stuck around or come out to a show,
But youth's taken over by rock and roll,
While we were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing

So I left, That is it. That's my life, nothing is sacred.
I don't keep friends,I keep acquainted, I'm not a prophet, But I'm here to profit.

That's s all,I'm gone! That's my life, nothing is sacred.
I don't fall in love, I just fake it.
I don't fall in love. I don't fall in love.
