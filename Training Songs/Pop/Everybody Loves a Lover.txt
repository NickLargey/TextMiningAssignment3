Everybody loves a lover
I'm a lover, baby, everybody loves me

I should worry, not for nothin'
Everybody loves me, yes they do
And I love everybody
Since I fell in love with you

Who's the most popular personality?
I can't help thinkin' it's no one else but me
Gee, I feel just about ten feet tall, havin' a ball
Guess ya might call me a Pollyanna

I should worry, not for nothin'
Everybody loves me, yes they do
And I love everybody
Since I fell in love with
Fell in love with
Fell in love with youuuuuuuuuu
