Not so far from here
There's a very lively atmosphere,
Everybody's going there this year,
And there's a reason,
The season opened last July,
Ever since the USA went dry,
Everybody's going there and I'm going too!

I'm on my way to Cuba,
That's where I'm going,
Cuba, that's where I'll stay,
Cuba, where wine is flowing,
And where dark eyed Stellas
Light their fella's panatellas.

Cuba, where all is happy,
Cuba, where all is gay!
Why don't you plan a wonderful trip
To Havana?  hop on a ship,
And I'll see you in C-U-B-A.

Take a friend's advice,
Drinking in a cellar isn't nice!
Anybody who has got the price
Should be a Cuban.

Have you been longing for a smile
That you haven't had for quite a while?
If you have, then follow me and I'll
Show the way!

Come on along to Cuba,
That's where I'm going,
Cuba, that's where I'll stay,
Cuba, where wine is flowing,
And where dark eyed Stellas
Light their fella's panatellas.

Cuba, where all is happy,
Cuba, where all is gay!
With so much scotch and rye on the table,
I'll drink till I won't be able
To see you in C-U-B-A!
