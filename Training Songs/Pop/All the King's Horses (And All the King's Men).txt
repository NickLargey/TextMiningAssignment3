She said she loved me, she told me a lie
She treated me just like a fool
And told all my friends that she'd laugh if I cried
Now, it's the talk of the school

[Chorus]
And all the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't bring our love back together again
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't bring our love back together again

I never dreamed that the love we knew
Wouldn't last for the rest of our years
But I realize now that we're through
True love's nothing but another word for tears

[Chorus]

I saw her at a dance last night
I noticed she came all alone
We danced the last dance, she held me real tight
And whispered, "Please take me home"

But all the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't bring our love back together again
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't bring our love back together again
