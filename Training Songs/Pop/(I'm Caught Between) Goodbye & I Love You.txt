I have something to tell you
And I know it won't be easy
I've been thinking these past few days
It might be time to leave
You're like a stranger
Then you're a lover
Never the same
Always hard to believe

(*) I'm caught between goodbye and I love you
Never knowing quite where I stand
I'm caught between goodbye and I love you
Falling both ways nowhere to land
So constantly stranded
I can't understant it
(understand)
This double life you've handed me
Is like the devil and the deep blue sea

If we go on much longer
If my doubts grow any stronger
Then I may have to let you go
If only to survive
Give me a reason
Why should I stay here?
(stay)
I've tried so hard
Just to keep love alive

Repeat (*)
