Body slam you to the ground
Messaging a chill
Curses make the head go round,
Brings a certain thrill.

Send you another world
Mesmerize your brain
It's the jewel of a pearl
Makes you go insane

And it's supposed To be love
Yes, it's supposed to be love
Well, it's supposed to be love
Say 'cause it's all 'cause of love

It's a sad and lonely song
Sour grapes and tears
Something dark is going on,
Going on for years

Body slam your lover down
Up against the wall
It's a sad and scary scene
With non grace at all

And it's supposed To be love
Yes, it's supposed to be love
Well, it's supposed to be love
Say 'cause it's all 'cause of love

Wonder how it came to be.
Things with me and you.
How we lost the way to love,
How we got so blue.

Body slam your partner down,
Fill 'em with regret
Who knows what the end will be.
It ain't over yet.

And it's supposed To be love
Yes, it's supposed to be love
Well, it's supposed to be love
Say 'cause it's all 'cause of love
