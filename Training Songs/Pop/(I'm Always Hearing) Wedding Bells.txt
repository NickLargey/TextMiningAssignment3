I don't think I'm crazy
My feet are on the ground
But I'm always hearing wedding bells
Whenever you're around
When I'm out with people
I try to lend an ear
But I'm always hearing wedding bells
And wishing you were here
I never thought I'd fall
But when I saw you how quickly I fell
And darling that's not all
Your kiss rang a wedding bell
If I'm only dreaming
You'll make my dreams come true
On the day I'm hearing wedding bells
Walking down the aisle with you

I never thought I'd fall
But when I saw you how quickly I fell
And darling that's not all
Your kiss rang a wedding bell
If I'm only dreaming
You'll make my dreams come true
On the day I'm hearing wedding bells
Walking down the aisle with you
