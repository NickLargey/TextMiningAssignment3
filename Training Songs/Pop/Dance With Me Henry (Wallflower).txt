(Hey baby, what do I have to do to make a hit with you?)
You gotta dance with me Henry (all right baby)
Dance with me Henry (don't mean maybe)
Rock with me Henry (any old time)

Talk to me Henry (don't change your mind)
Dance with me Henry (all right)
You better dance while the music goes on
Roll on, roll on, roll on

While the cats are ballin'
You better stop your stallin'
It's intermission in a minute
So you better get with it

Dance with me Henry
You better dance while the music goes on
Roll on, roll on, roll on
Oooooooo-wee

Henry, you ain't movin' me
You better feel that boogie beat
And get the lead out of your feet
You gotta dance with me Henry

Dance with me Henry
Rock with me Henry
Talk to me Henry
Dance with me Henry
You better dance while the music goes on

Roll roll roll
Roll roll roll
Rock rock rock
Rock rock rock
Roll roll roll
Roll on, roll on, roll on
Rock with me Henry (all right baby)

Dance with me Henry (don't mean maybe)
Rock with me Henry (any old time)
Dance with me Henry (don't change your mind)
Jump with me Henry (all right)
You better dance, dance
While the music goes on

Roll on
Roll on
Roll on
Roll on
Rock!
