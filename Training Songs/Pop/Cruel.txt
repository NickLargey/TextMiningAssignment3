Maybe I'm just kinda twisted
Maybe I need therapy
Could be I'm just plain old lovesick
Your body gotta come and rescue me

Want you there, want you home
I see lights on, pick up the phone
It's 3AM, but all of it's timeless to me
Oh

Maybe I should call you a stranger
Maybe I should call you less
I'm just feeling foolish 'cause I need somebody
And only a fool would take it like this

You can be cruel
You can be so cruel to me
Come on, baby, cruel
You can be cruel to me

Suffering from your addiction
Wish I was ten steps from you
Oh, now I don't want to play the victim here
But no, nobody's gonna love you like I do
Oh

Maybe I should call you a stranger
Maybe I should call you less
I'm just feeling foolish 'cause I need somebody
And only a fool would take it like this

You can be cruel
You can be so cruel to me
Come on, baby, cruel
You can be cruel to me

Want you there, want you home
I see lights on, pick up the phone
It's 3AM, but all of it's timeless to me
Oh

Maybe I should call you a stranger (no)
Maybe I should call you less (Maybe I should call you less)
I'm just feeling foolish 'cause I need somebody
And only a fool would take it like this (like this)

You can be (like this)
Cruel
You can be so cruel to me
Come on, baby, cruel
(Darling, you can be so cruel to me, now)
You can be cruel to me
