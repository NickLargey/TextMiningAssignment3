Yeah
You know what it is
It's your man Travis
Gym class heroes
Kelly rowland
Oh so beautiful
Baby girl, stay up all night
Now tell 'em, show 'em how we do
Here we go! oh!

It's five o'clock am
And the party is still going strong
There's a conversation in the corner
Tell a friend, bring everyone
(c'mon, let's go)
Cos the fm music is groovin'
Folks getting down, getting down in their stocking feet
Sleepy eyes are peeping
(they're watching baby)
From the window across the street

And it looks like daylight's gonna get me up again
(damn right and I'm lovin' every minute)
Most people like getting up when I'm just getting in
(i'll be back in three days like paris's jail sentence)
And oh, it's the only only time
It's the only time when I can unwind

I swore to myself time and time and time again
That I would give up the night-life
(yeah right)
Start laying in
But it ain't easy, no no
(no no no)
Saying no to my friends
(that's right)
Cos the real, cos the real set don't get started
Til everyone else is in

And it looks like daylight's gonna get me up again
(damn right and I'm lovin' every minute)
Most people like getting up when I'm just getting in
(i'll be back in three days like Paris's jail sentence)
And oh, it's the only only time
It's the only time when I can unwind

Hello world, good morning sunshine
Great to see you again
Homie, I'm doin' fine
Chasin' day dreams, you know still pursuing mine
Sleep is so foreign, tv is so boring
New york is New York
Travie is still aight
The freaks come out at night like a vampire
Nocturnal lurking
The daylight creeps up

And it looks like daylight's gonna get me up again
(damn right and I'm lovin' every minute)
Most people like getting up when I'm just getting in
(i'll be back in three days like Paris's jail sentence)
Daylight's gonna get me up again
(damn right and I'm lovin' every minute)
Most people like getting up when I'm just getting in
