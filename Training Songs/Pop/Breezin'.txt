I don't need a reason 
 I am just breezin' 
 Makin' changes as they come 
 Ain't gonna bother anyone 
 Give and let live 
 Love and be loved 
 We're workin' on a positive vibe 
 So let the love rise to the top 
 Up here where the breezes blow 
 Don't let the love flow over stop 
 We got to get it together 
 With everyone else 
 We can't make it to the positive side 
 Without some help 
 Breezin' 
 Let's flow 
 Breezin' 
 Let's flow 
 I'm ready to go 
 I don't need a reason 
 I don't need a reason 
 I'll hold up the roof, if you steady the walls 
 We'll sweep the floor, fix the house 
 Let the waves roll through the door 
 Yeah I'll hold up the roof, if you steady the walls 
 We'll sweept the floor, fix the house 
 Let the waves roll through the door 
 Send a message put up your antennae tonight 
 Get the message put up your antennae tonight 
 We got to get it together 
 With everyone else 
 We can't make it to the positive side 
 Without some help 
 This is the turning point 
 The point of no return- 
 We got to come together! 
 Give and let live 
 Love and be loved 
 I don't need a reason 
 I'm breezin' 
 I don't need a reason 
 I'm breezin' 
 I'm breezin'
