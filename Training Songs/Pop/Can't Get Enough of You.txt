There's nothing in the world that I'd like more
Than to be left standing outside your door
Where perhaps I might be, asked to come in
There I could very easily demonstrate
What now appears to be my fate
You see I'm hooked on something
And it's not heroin

Oh, I just can't get enough of you
No I can't get enough, what am, I gonna do
I've tried every trick in the book that's going
Now I've decided that they're not worth knowing
My predicament is as simple as this
I'm not satisfied and the reason is
I just can't get enough of you
My experience of life so far

Has been to say the least not the least bizarre
I mean I work for a living, 8 hours a day
I don't smoke or drink except for a little wine
The friends that I have are the genuine kind
I think I'm fairly rational in a moderate way
Yet I can't get enough of you
No I can't get enough, what am I gonna do
I've had other woman but they don't move me
You're the only one that can see right through me
What you've got I can't explain
Other than to tell you I have one complaint

I just can't get enough of you
I just can't get enough of you

No I can't get enough, what am I gonna do
Like Oliver Twist, said when he asked for more
I happen to like what you gave me before
My condition is rather unique
I'm suffering from the world's first lovely disease
I just can't get enough of you
