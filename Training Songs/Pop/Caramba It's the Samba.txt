Tonight is my night out for dancing,
There's a guy that I'm romancing,
I hope he falls for me before the night is through.
I can't wait till we start swaying,
What the heck is that they're playing?
Caramba! It's the samba, it's the one dance I can't do.

You better play a rumba for me,
'Cause I know he will adore me
When I begin to do a rumba shake or two.
I am waiting on the floor now,
Just another minute more now,
Caramba! It's the samba, it's the one dance I can't do.

When they play something dreamy,
You will see me waltz away from everyone,
And when I tango,
All the gang go
Off the floor to watch the fun!

Aye! There must be a million
Of the tunes that aren't Brazilian,
So I can't understand why they don't play a few!
Ah! The band's about to start now,
There'll be music in my heart now,
Caramba! It's the samba, it's the one dance I can't do.

Ho-ba! Ho-ba!
