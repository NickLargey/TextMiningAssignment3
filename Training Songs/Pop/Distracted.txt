All the time
The show was on my mind

The things that are runnin' through this young girl's
Head
When I get up in the morning, when I'm goin' to bed
When I'm drivin' in my car, when I'm talkin' on my
Cell'
Crammin' for a final when I'm watchin' TRL

I think about love
I get distracted
When I think about hookin' up with you
It gets all my concentration

But ooh, ooh
I go preoccupied
You got me in a daze
I get distracted

When I'm standin' in a line at the ATM
When I'm stirrin' my sugar in my caf√© mocha blend
When the radio is playin' a song like this
I float away suddenly dreamin' of your kiss

I know it's crazy livin' in this fantasy
But I don't know how to break this spell you put on me
Tryin' to stay focused on the things I'm supposed to
Do
But before I know it my attention's back on you

I think about love
I get distracted
When I think about hookin' up with you
It gets all my concentration

But ooh, ooh
I go preoccupied
You got me in a daze
I get distracted, yeah

Disconnected, yeah
Distracted, yeah (Can't help myself)
You got me in a daze

I know it's crazy livin' in this fantasy
But I don't know how to break this spell you put on me
Tryin' to stay focused on the things I'm supposed to
Do

I think about love
I get distracted
When I think about hookin' up with you
It gets all my concentration

But ooh, ooh
I go preoccupied
You got me in a daze (Come on, baby)
I get distracted, yeah
Disconnected, yeah (It's what I do, I think about you)
Distracted, yeah (Can't help myself)
Disconnected, yeah

I think about love
I get distracted
When I think about hookin' up with you
It gets all my concentration

But ooh, ooh
I go preoccupied (Preoccupied)
You got me in a daze (In  daze)
I get distracted, yeah
Disconnected, yeah
I get distracted
Disconnected, yeah (It's what I do, I think about you)
I get distracted
