All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
My two front teeth
Gee
If I could only have
My two front teeth
Then I could wish you
Merry Christmas

It seems so long
Since I could say
"Sister
Susie sitting
On a thistle"
Gosh, oh gee
How happy I'd be
If I could
Only whistle

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
My two front teeth
Gee
If I could only have
My two front teeth
Then I could wish you
"Merry Christmas"
