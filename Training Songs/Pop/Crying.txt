I was all right 
For a while
I could smile for a while
And then I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say hello
As you wished me well
You couldn't tell that
That I'd been crying

I thought that I 
Was over you
But it's true oh so true
I love you even more than I did before
But darlin' what can I do 
For you don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying 
Over you
Crying 
Over you

Yes now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
Oh over you

I was all right 
For a while
I could smile for a while
