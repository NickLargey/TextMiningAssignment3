Animals 
Wild rivers and waterfalls 
I can hear the planet 
Show a little respect 

Beautiful 
To everything that´s beautiful 
And if you want to save it all 
Show a little respect 

In the sun 
Another day is born 
While all the world is sleeping 
There is music in the dawn 

See the clouds 
Phantoms in the sky 
Changing as the wind blows 
Right before your eyes 

Through these creations 
We learn to understand 
The wonder o f life 
We're holding in our hands 

[Chorus] 
Animals 
Wild rivers and waterfalls 
I can hear the planet call 
Show a little respect 
There's a place 
A green and peaceful place 
A place without the borders 
To divide the human race 

It's been created 
In a billion years 
Don't tear it apart 
Don't drive the world to tears 

[Chorus] 

Animals 
Wild rivers and waterfalls 
I can hear the planet call 
Show a little respect 

Beautiful 
To everything that is beautiful 
And if you want to save it all 
Show a little respect 

In the name of progress 
Everybody´s gone too far 
In the name of money... 
Who do we think we are
