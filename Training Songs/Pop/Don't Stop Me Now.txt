Tonight I'm gonna have myself such a good time
I feel alive
And the world is turning inside out, yeah
And floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now, don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the skies
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me

I'm burnin' through the sky yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

So don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm having a good time, I don't wanna stop at all

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh explode

I'm burnin' through the sky yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me
Hey, hey, hey
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Ooh, ooh, ooh (don't you stop me now)
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me 
(Oh yeah) don't stop me, don't stop me (have a good time, good time)
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me (have a good time, good time)
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me
Ooh, there's no stopping me

I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

So don't stop me now
