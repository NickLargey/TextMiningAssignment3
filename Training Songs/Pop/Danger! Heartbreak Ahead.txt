Danger! Heartbreak ahead
Look out little fool you're not wise
Not wise to love so completely
Or fall for that look in his eyes
Danger! Heartbreak ahead
Be sure little heart for you know
Yes you know what happen to you before
There's danger, travel slow
Does his kiss really mean what you think it means?
Are the words that he whispers true?
Are you sure you understand the touch of his hand?
Does his touch mean too much to you?
Maybe, I could be wrong
But, go slow little fool, for it?s said
That love either finds you, or love either binds you
To the danger of a heartbreak ahead
