Come on, come on, come on,
Get in, oh baby!

Well I worked it out
I gotta say goodbye
I can see it clear as day
With a naked eye
Smells like thunder
You look like rain
And it's spelling out
Disaster is my name

Oh, that we could make it easy
We could do it right
'Cause you know the time has come
It must be done
We are going downhill
Downhill, downhill

[Chorus]
Come on, (come on) can you see the light (can you see the light)
Come on, (come on) you know it feels right
The door is open
Are you gonna take the ride
We're playing it all wrong
That's why I'm saying it
Come on, get in

Get in, get in, come on

Gotta do it friendly (gotta do it friendly)
Gotta do it soon (gotta do it soon)
Got to get this mean old beast
Out of the room (out of the room)
'Cause he's been greedy (he's been greedy)
And we've been blind (and we've been blind)
While we let him creep up on us
From behind

Oh but he's not gonna get me
He's not getting you
'Cause you know the time has come
It must be done
We are going downhill
Downhill, downhill

[Chorus]

(Get in, get in, get in)

I'll take the anger (she'll take the anger)
You take the pain (you take the pain)
And we'll promise that we
Won't go back again (go back again)
Oh 'cause the time (the time)
The time has come (time has come)
We could break these chains
And baby we could run

So keep your eyes on the road and
Keep your hands on the wheel
'Cause we know the time is right
We just might
Make it going downhill
Downhill, downhill

[Chorus: x2]

Get in, get in, come on
