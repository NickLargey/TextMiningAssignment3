Kiss you ‘till your lips are burned (uh-huh)
But then she’ll go and kiss somebody else

Bad blood, the girl's got bad blood

A-sneaky-sneaky
Well, I know her mother and it runs in the family
(Bop-she-bo, bop-she-bop)

Well she’s the kind of woman that’ll take you (uh-huh)
Take the money out of your hand (uh-huh)
She’s the kind of woman that’ll take your money, spend it on another man

The girl's got bad blood
The girl's got bad blood

I know her sister, and she lives across the street from me,
A-peeky-peeky
Well, I know her mother and it runs in the family
(Bop-she-bo, bop-she-bop)

Talkin' about a-lying and a-cheating (uh-huh)
She’s a lying cheating boss (uh-huh)
Talkin’ about mean mistreating, call her Miss Double-Cross

The girl's got bad blood
The girl's got bad blood

I know her cousin and he’s doin’ time in Tennessee
A-thiefy-thiefy
Well, I know her mother and it runs in the family

Bad blood, bad blood
Bad blood, bad blood...
