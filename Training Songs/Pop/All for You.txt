When you turned around and looked
Into my eyes
It was just the moment when
I realized
That my life had just begun
And my past faded away
All I do is hope and pray
That our love will always stay

Now my world is so alive
My dreams came true
You're the spirit that I need
It's all from you
Every moment that I'll live
My whole life through
Now I'll look into your eyes
And live for you

Now my world is so alive
My dreams came true
You're the spirit that I need
It's all from you
Every moment that I'll live
My whole life through
Now I'll look into your eyes
And live for you

All for you
When I look into your eyes
