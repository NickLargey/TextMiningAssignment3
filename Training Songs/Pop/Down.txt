Down
To the bottom
Hello
Is there anybody else here?

It's cold
And I'm so lonely
Hello
Is there anybody else here?

Hello
Can you throw me down a life-line
I'm so afarid of darkness
And down here it's just like night-time

(blblblblblblblbl)... 
And there isn't any hope for me
Unless this dream that seems so real
Is just a fantasy.
