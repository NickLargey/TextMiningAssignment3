Only a fool swallows every rule, paper calls protection
What we can and cannot use
Nothing belongs here, nothing realized â?? while I might
It only feels like feeding compromise
Happiness is something more than learning when to smile 

Once I thought that I could never heal enough but now I'm starting to receive it
All I want to do is get a message through, it's important to believe it 

After the healing had begun to climb, we were all so
Caught within ourselves we never really held the time
How can I feel what I just don't feel
How can I expect myself to recognise the one that's real
Hope can be closer beside you â?? if you make the room
