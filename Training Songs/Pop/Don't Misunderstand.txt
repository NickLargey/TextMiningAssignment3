You came to me
Saying:"are you ready
To close your eyes
Take off your disguise?"

(I) Said"I don't know
How far can this go?
Walking on a tightrope
Isn't my sort of dope
You see, It's way too much for me"

Don't misunderstand me please baby
So many things are often said in vain
Don't misunderstand me please baby
You can ask me again

Then evertything went wrong.
I never thought
Silence could be so strong,
Believe it or not.

You came to me
Saying "would you be
A funambulist?"
But it wasn't on my list
Of things to do
And you got angry too

Don't misunderstand me please baby
So many things are often said in vain
Don't misunderstand me please baby
You can ask me again

Don't misunderstand me please baby
So many things are often said in vain
So give me a hand and then maybe

Voices in my head saying yes and no
Feelings and emotions that I can't let go

Don't misunderstand me please baby
So many things are often said in vain
Don't misunderstand me please baby

Don't misunderstand
You must understand
