You wear a mask of burning gold
Your heart is wild but your touch is cold
I ask myself, are you my enemy
Or is this just a fire,
A fire that burns in you and me?
Two sides to every soul
And in my most unfaithful hour
I keep a vision in my mind of you
Am I forgiven?
Let me be forgiven
You wear your love much too thin
You push me away just to pull me in
I ask myself, is faith that way?
If I reason it, do I reason it all away?
Two sides to every soul
And in my most unfaithful hour
I keep a vision in my mind of you
Am I forgiven?
Let me be forgiven
There are times
When I feel alone
