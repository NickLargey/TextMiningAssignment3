Night and stars above that shine so bright
The myst'ry of their fading light
That shines upon our caravan

Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep
Across the sand so I may keep
This mem'ry of our caravan

This is so exciting, you are so inviting
Resting in my arms
As I thrill to the magic charms

Of you beside me here, beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert caravan

Night, night, night, night and stars above that shine so bright
The myst'ry of their fading light
That shines upon our caravan

Sleep upon my shoulders as we creep
Across the sand so I may keep
This mem'ry of our caravan

This is so exciting, you are so inviting
Resting in my arms
As I thrill to the magic charms

Of you beside me here, beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert caravan

You beside me here, beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert caravan
