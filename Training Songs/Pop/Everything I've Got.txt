I never worry I never fret
'Cause when I got you on my side you can bet
I got it all I'm standing so tall
And when I hold you in my arms
You know I'll never let you fall
When trouble comes to call

I will give you everything I've got
Don't you know
You know that I will love you a lot
Never let you go
Don't need nobody
Want nobody but you

Time's gonna come
When you're put to the test
And you and me girl
We won't be like the rest
We'll see it through
Just me and you
And when they ask us
We will say it's been tried and it's still true
We're still try'n' to prove

I will give you everything I've got
Don't you know
You know that I will love you a lot
Never let you go
Don't need nobody
Want nobody but you

I will give you everything I've got
Ev'rything I got
You know that I would love you
Love you a lot
Don't need nobody
Need no one but you
No one but you

I will give you everything I've got
Ev'rything I got
You know that I would love you
Love you a lot
Don't need nobody
Need no one but you
No one but you
