(Where are you?)

Where are you, now that I need you
Now that I want you so badly I could cry
Where are you (Where are you?)
Where did fate lead you (Where are you?)
Funny how I dreamed you'd still be standing by

I had you at my beck and call
I called you any time at all
I guess I took too much for granted
I never thought I'd lie awake and sigh
Where are you, now that I need you
Now that I love you so madly I could die
