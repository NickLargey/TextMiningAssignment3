Be an angel, be an angel and treat me real sweet
Be an angel and bless me with your love
Be an angel, be an angel, I kneel at your feet
Be an angel and touch me with your love

You're a joy and heaven on earth to me
You're all the poems in history

Be an angel, be an angel and make life complete
Be an angel and bless me with your love

You're a joy and heaven on earth to me
You're all the poems in history

Be an angel, be an angel and make life complete
Be an angel and bless me with your love
