Daydreaming, just daydreaming
Well, it's kind of fun for one who's all alone
Daydreaming, just daydreaming
Helps me find the joy, the boy I call my own
Night comes on, it's true I'm blue
My heart is with the sun
Dawn comes through, I glow
Although I know that lovers I've had none
Daydreaming, just daydreaming
Please don't mind if I just sigh and stay
Stay dreaming, daydreaming
Maybe small but it's all I've known

Lovers, I've had none
Daydreaming, just daydreaming
Please don't mind if I just sigh and stay
Stay dreaming, daydreaming
Maybe small but it's all I've known
