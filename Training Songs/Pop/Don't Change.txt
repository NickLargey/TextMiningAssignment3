I turned around and you were standing there
More than a little high
More than a little crazy
So beautiful I had to stare
And I knew you had the power to change me

Scarlet woman, you've come for me
Your timing's great, 'cause I've been
Waiting so long the only thing that I want to say
Now that you've got me, please
Don't change, don't change, don't, don't, no, no
Don't change my life oh yeah

You know I love you but I hate your friends
They got dollars but they ain't got sense
If a time, if a time comes and you go away
I hope I'd change and you'd stay the same

Scarlet woman, you've come for me
Your timing's great, 'cause I've been
Waiting so long the only thing that I want to say
Now that you've got me, please, please
Don't change, don't change, oh don't change
No, no don't change 
Don't change my life 

Don't change, don't change, don't change
Don't change, don't change, don't change
Don't change my life

Scarlet woman, you've come for me
Your timing's great, 'cause I've been
Waiting so long the only thing that I want to say
Now that you've got me, please, please
Don't change, don't change, oh don't change
Don't change, don't change 
Don't change my life 

Don't change, don't change 
Please don't change my life 
Don't change, don't change
