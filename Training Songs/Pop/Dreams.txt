Now dreams can be such funny things, they also can be sad 
The dream I had the other night made me feel so bad 
I saw my baby with a guy whose face I couldn't see 
& when he turned around, it wasn't me 

Dreams can be the answer to many people's prayer 
But to me the other night, they only brought despair 
If I could only see his face again 
I might've known where my baby could've been 

If dreams come true, as they sometimes do 
Then I'll be afraid to dream again 
In case she's with another & he's my friend 

So I hope when I'd awake out of that dream I'd find 
Nobody had taken her & I'd have peace of mind 
But a dream last night I was out of luck again 
So I suppose that everything's the same 
Yes a dream last night I was out of luck again 
So I suppose that everything's the same
