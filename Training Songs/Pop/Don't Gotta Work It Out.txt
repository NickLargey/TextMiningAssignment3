Baby, I've been wanting more of that, love you give
Oh it's good to be wrong
Baby, I'm gonna need a doctor's care
To help me through the night
Oh look what you've done

I don't know but I've been told the world outside is oh so cold
Late at night when you're alone
Do you think about me now that I'm gone?
When I'm on the road I often dream and think of you girl
And I hope that you do too

We don't, gotta work it out
'Cause no one's, gonna tell you where to find me
When you, you come looking for me
'Cause I've been walking out the door before you know it
And you better believe

Baby, gonna even the score
'Cause you've been giving that love, oh, all over town
Baby, you gonna need the doctor's care
To get you over me girl, look what you've done

I don't know but I've been told the world outside is oh so cold
Late at night when you're alone
Do you think about me now that I'm gone?
When I'm on the road I often dream and think of you girl
And I hope that you do too

We don't, gotta work it out
'Cause no one's, gonna tell you where to find me
When you, you come looking for me
'Cause I've been walking out the door before you know it
And you better believe

We don't, gotta work it out
'Cause no one's, gonna tell you where to find me
When you, you come looking for me
'Cause I've been walking out the door before you know it
And you better believe
