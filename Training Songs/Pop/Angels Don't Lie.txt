Someone told a story when
They said they saw you out again
But I know better
'Cause angels don't lie

Wonder why they pick on you
Those friends even tell me too
But I don't listen
'Cause angels don't lie

I convinced myself
That it can't be true
(Can't be true)
Whatever you deny
I'll believe 'cause I love you

I refuse to listen to
All those lies they tell on you
I know better
'Cause angels don't lie

I convinced myself
It just can't be true
(Can't be true)
Whatever you deny
I'll believe 'cause I love you

I refuse to listen to
All those lies they tell on you
I know better
'Cause angels don't lie
