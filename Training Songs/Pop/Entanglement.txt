Here we are
Blood pressure rising fast
Air electric
Conduct this orchestra

A micro utopia born
As the overture plays
This prelude to life long love
Our bodies entanglement takes
You all over me
Me all over you

Fearless heart
I’m gonna take care of you
Whether spark or spiral
I’ll pull the strength of suns

It’s home where you hold me
So show me no mercy
On islands of cotton
Taboos get forgotten
Our body entanglement wants
You all over me (me, me, me)
Me all over you (you, you, you)
You all over me

Oh, burst me into bloom I dare you to
Lose yourself in our embodiment
Ravage this palate of pinks and reds and
Dissolve into radiance

It’s home where you hold me
So show me no mercy
On islands of cotton
Taboos get forgotten
Our body entanglement wants
You all over me (me, me, me, me, me)
Me all over you, you, you, you
You all over
