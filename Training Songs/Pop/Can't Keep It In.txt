Don't know why, every time
I try to tell you how i feel about You
I really feel about You
I can't find words designed
that say exactly what You mean to me
Cause You mean so much to me
So I stop, I look Up
All I'm really tryin to say (is that)

There's something about the way 
I've been feeling lately
I've been walkin around with a great big smile
written on my face
How can it be I am burstin' at the seams 
I can't keep it in
I can dance, I can breathe
I can live what I believe
What's gonna stop the joy 
I've got, pouring out of me
Your love is so deep
It's overwhelming me
I can't keep it in

I can't hide, can't deny
that something's rising up 
from deep inside and I'm so satisfied
(its) plain to see what You mean
It's like a river that is runnin free
runnin to the sea
So I stop, look up
and thank You for another day

I wouldn't even dare to dream, that You could be so near to me
And All I ever want to be, is Yours
