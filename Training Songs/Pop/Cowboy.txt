Cold gray buildings where a hill should be
Steel and concrete closin' in on me
City faces haunt the places
I used to roam
Cowboy, cowboy, can't run, can't hide
Too late to fight now, too tired to try

Wind that once blew free
Now scatters dust to the sky
Cowboy, cowboy, can't run, can't hide
Too late to fight now, too tired to try
