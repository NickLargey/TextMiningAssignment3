All my love,
Came to nothing and oh, my love
When I woke up to find,
You were no longer mine.

All my love, thrown away 
After all this time
Now there's no place for me,
In the future you see.

I don't understand you,
I've done all I can do
Tell me how could 
I give you more,more than

[Repeat]
All my love
