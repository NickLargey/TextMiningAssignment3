Between the miles of open road
I lost sight of what might matter the most
I stumbled into the great unknown and found
That time won't slow down

I'm getting by with my collapsible lung
And it's a good time 100% of the time
And I'm like a ladder with a missing rung
And it's a slow climb headed back to the sky
And I'm feelin' backwards when I'm trying the most
And I hope haven't heard the last words from the holy ghost
Cause I think that I'm supposed to be
Well on my way by now

I'll do the twist with my replaceable hips
And turn you right round
Then dip you down to the ground
And now I wanna grow old and rub your tired limbs
And take it easy
Until we wither away
Until we wither away

Between the miles of open road
I lost sight of what might matter the most
I stumbled into the great unknown and found
That time can't slow down

To take a breath and then take it in
To think of places I'll go I haven't been
To pour my heart into everything I've found
Time won't slow down

Feelin' backwards
And I hope haven't heard the last words
No, no, no
Cause I think that I'm supposed to be
Well on my way-eh-eh! 
Eh eh! 
Wooo'
To pour my heart into everything I found

Between the miles of open road
I lost sight of what might matter the most
I stumbled into the great unknown and found
That time won't slow down

To take a breath and then take it in
To think of places I'll go I haven't been
