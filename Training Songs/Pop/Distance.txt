the sky has lost its color
the sun has turned to grey
at least that's how it feels to me
whenever you're away

i crawl up in a corner
as i watch the minutes pass
each one brings me closer to
the time when you'll be back
you're comin back

i can't take the distance
i can't take the miles
i can't take the time until the next time i see you smile
i can't take the distance
and i'm not ashamed
that i can't take a breath without seeing your name

but i can't breathe a hurricane 
and still be standing tall 
when all the dust has settled down
but i can't take the distance

i still believe in feelings
but sometimes i feel too much
i make believe you're close to me
but it ain't close enough
not nearly close enough

i can't take the distance
i can't take the miles
i can't take the time until the next time i see you smile
i can't take the distance
and i'm not ashamed
that i can't take a breath without seeing your name

but i can't breathe a hurricane and
still be standing tall 
when all the dust has settled down

i can't take the distance
i can't take the miles
i can't take the time until the next time i see you smile
i can't take the distance
and i'm not ashamed
that i can't take a breath without seeing your name
and i can't take the distance
the distance
