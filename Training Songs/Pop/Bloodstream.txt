Na na na na, oh oh
I’ve been spinning out for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I’ve been sitting here for ages
Ripping out pages
How'd I get so faded
How'd I get so faded
Oh no no don’t leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell when it kicks in
Tell when it kicks in

I’ve been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
Another could free my mind

This is how it ends, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
So tell me when it kicks in
No no no 
No no no 
No no no 

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line (I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line (broken hearted)
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line (I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line (broken hearted)

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line (I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line (broken hearted)
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line (I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind 
Calling out across the line (broken hearted)

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line (I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind 
Calling out across the line (tell me when it kicks in)
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line (tell me when it kicks in)

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line (tell me when it kicks in)
All the voices in my mind (no, no, no)
Calling out across the line (I saw scars)
All the voices in my mind (no, no, no)
Calling out across the line (tell me when it kicks in)

All the voices in my mind (no, no, no, no)
Calling out across the line (I saw scars)
All the voices in my mind (no, no, no, no)
Calling out across the line (tell me when it kicks in)
