Lullaby and good night
With roses bedight
Creep into thy bed
There pillow thy head
If God will thou shalt wake
When the morning doth break
If God will thou shalt wake
When the morning doth break

Lullaby and good night
Those blue eyes close tight
Bright angels are near
So sleep without fear
They will guard thee from harm
With fair dreamland's sweet charm
They will guard thee from harm
With fair dreamland's sweet charm
