I've fought it for a long time now
While drowning in a river of denial
I washed up, fixed up, picked up
All my broken things

'Cause you left me, police tape, chalk line
Tequila shots in the dark scene of the crime
Suburban living with a feeling that I'm giving up
Everything for you

Oh, oh, oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were o-o-over me? I think that I should go (go!)
And something's telling me to leave, but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I don't

It took a lot to take you home
One stupid call and I end up alone
Your made up, dressed up, messed up
Plans I set in stone

But you made me do it
And I don't like dancing in the alley
With a street rat night life
Can't keep living with a feeling that I'm giving up
Everything for you

Oh, oh, oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were o-o-over me? I think that I should go (go!)
And something's telling me to leave, but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I don't

Make a fool of myself when you hang around
When you're gone, I'm a match that's burning out
Could've been, should've done what I said I was going to (said that I would do)
But I never promised you (but I never promised you)
(Promised you, promised you, promised you, promised you)

Oh, oh, oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were o-o-over me? I think that I should go (go!)
It never took a fool to see the things that I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I do ya

Oh, oh, oh, how was I supposed to know ('cause you left me police scenes, chalk line)
That you were o-o-over me? I think that I should go (Tequila shots in the dark scene of the crime)
And something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I d-d-d
Damned if I do ya, damned if I don't
