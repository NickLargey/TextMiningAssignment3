You cut me down into little pieces
Before I could stand up
So I built a wall out of all my secrets
And now it's opened up
And I remember the cold, cold mornings
And I remember the rainy afternoons
When I was dreaming that I was 22
That I was twenty two

I wish I was older when I was young
But half the world's asleep
'Til the morning came and took me away
Now I'm longing
Oh I wish that I had found out faster
I never thought it was me they're after
When I was dreaming that I was 22
That I was twenty two

La da da, oh, oh

And I remember the cold, cold mornings
I never thought it was me they're wanting
When I was dreaming oh la da da
When I was dreaming oh oh oh
When I was dreaming that I was 22
That I was twenty two
