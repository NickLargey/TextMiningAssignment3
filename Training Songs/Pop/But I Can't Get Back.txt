Marigolds and tangerines
And lots of rusty window screens
Funny Paper, fountain pen
And patchwork things to cover in
Puppy dogs and potpourri
Oh won't you come and live with me

Tambourine and tape machine
And clippings from a magazine
No commitments, no demands
Just marmalade and music stands
Stay with me and spend some time
Just wish it so and we can rhyme

Scraps of paper, pot of glue
And I'll make funny things for you
Passing glance and passing touch
Understand not saying much
No beginning and no end
Come live with me and be my friend
