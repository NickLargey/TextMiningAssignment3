I got the bell bottom blues
'Cause my sweetie is a sailor
And he's sailin' somewhere on the sea
I got the bell bottom blues
'Cause I'm craxy 'bout a sailor
And I don't know when he's comin' back to me

I shake my head and refuse
When the fellas come a-callin'
And they want to take me on a date
I got the bell bottom blues
While the other girls are fallin'
I just sit around the livin' room and wait!

I wonder if he's lookin' at
The same moon I'm lookin' at
Every night I'm lookin' at the moon!
I know if he's prayin' for
The same thing I'm prayin' for
We'll be together soon!

I got the bell bottom blues
Just a-waitin' for a letter
Heaven knows I'm as lonely as can be!
I got the bell bottom blues
And I won't be feelin' better
Till my sailor boy comes sailin' home to me

I wonder if he's lookin' at
The same moon I'm lookin' at
Every night I'm lookin' at the moon!
I know if he's prayin' for
The same thing I'm prayin' for
We'll be together soon!

I got the bell bottom blues
Just a-waitin' for a letter
Heaven knows I'm as lonely as can be!
I got the bell bottom blues
And I won't be feelin' better
Till my sailor boy comes sailin' home to me
Till my sailor boy comes sailin' home to me
