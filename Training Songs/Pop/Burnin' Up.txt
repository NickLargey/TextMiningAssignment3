Walking through the fire, please don't let me go
Take me to the river, I need you to know

I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out
I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out

Hot in the kitchen like a thousand degrees
That's how I'm feeling when you're next to me
I got a fever, tell me, what did you do?
Temperature rising when I look at you, look at you

Subliminal, sex
Drippin' in, sweat
I'm losing my, breath
Look what I've, found
It's about to go, down
I want it right, now

Walking through the fire, please don't let me go
Take me to the river, I need you to know

I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out
I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out

I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out
I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out

I got the matches, you got the gasoline
Light up the floor like it's Billie Jean
The way we're movin' by the end of the song
They're gonna have to pull the fire, fire alarm

Subliminal, sex
Drippin' in, sweat
I'm losing my, breath
Look what I've, found
It's about to go, down
I want it right, now

Walking through the fire, please don't let me go
Take me to the river, I need you to know

2 Chainz!
Everything hot like it's fresh off the grill
Million dollar grill look fresh on the hill
Plus I'm 6'5", she need to step in some heels
Before you step up in here you need to step up your gear
Wish a Lamborghini had four doors
From the corner store to the corridor
Me and my homie on the damn floor
White girl in the middle, looking like an Oreo
(I'm burnin' up)
Roof on fire, we can burn up
Turn up for what nigga turn up
Mother fucker must ain't learned
Back in the day used to down with a burn coat
(I'm burnin' up)
Light got the Lord on the top floor
In a Ford, wearin' Tom Ford
Walk in the club and her ass start clappin'
Tell shawty I want a encore

Come put me out
Come and put me out
I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out

Come put me out
Come and put me out
I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out

I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out
I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out

I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out
I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out
