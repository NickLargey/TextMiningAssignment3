From Coney Island to The Sunset Strip
Somebody's gonna make a happy trip
Tonight, while the moon is bright
He's gonna have a bag of crazy toys
To give the groanies of the boys and girls
So dig, Santa comes on big

He'll come a callin' when the snows the most
When all your cats are sleepin' warm as toast
And you're gonna flip when Old Saint Nick
Takes a lick on the peppermint stick

He'll come a flyin' from a higher place
And fill the stockings by the fire place
So you'll, have a Yule that's cool

Yeah, from Coney Island to The Sunset Strip
Somebody's gonna make a happy trip
Tonight, while the moon is bright

Behind a reindeer with a blinking nose
He's lookin' groovy in his same ol' clothes
He's red, in his suped up sled

He’s on a mission and he will not shirk
Down the chimney, yeah, he gets to work
That Mr. C is H-O-T,
Santa won’t you light my Christmas tree?

He'll come a flyin' from a higher place
And fill the stockings by the fireplace
So you'll have a Yule that's cool

Have a Yule that's cool, ya’ll!
