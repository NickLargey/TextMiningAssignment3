Is that you?
Looks like you've changed your ways again
Is that you now?
It's funny how I can't remember

Well, I knew you better than that
At least I thought I knew you then
But what I know now
It's not always a happy ending

Hey, here comes that rainy day again
But hey, look at me, I don't feel like cryin
Hey, here comes that rainy day again
But hey, look at me, I don't feel like cryin?

Who said love is a game?
And who said love can be gambled, gambled away?

Is this me now?
Looks like I've changed my ways again
Is this me now?
Funny how you can't remember

Well, you know me better than that
At least you thought you knew me then
But what you know now
It's not always a happy ending

Yeah, but hey, here comes that rainy day again
And hey, look at me, I don't feel like cryin'
And hey, here comes that rainy day again
Hey, look at me, I don't feel like cryin', no

I don't feel like cryin', no
I don't feel like it
And hey, look at me, I don't feel like cryin', no
