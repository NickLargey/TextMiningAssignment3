I never should have let my guard down
I wish I never knew all the things I found out
[I wish I would have been more careful]
Then maybe I wouldn't 
Be running from misery (oh no)

In the beginning gave me everything I need and more
I'm tired of dealing 
Gotta figure out how to even the score
[It's payback, gotta make him feel it]
Playing with my feelings
Ladies I'm a tell it all

[Be on the lookout when he's coming to your area.
I fell in love with him once, girls, I'm telling ya]
I wish I knew what I know now
I swear it never would have went down

Dangerous
He'll steal your heart away,
Then run and play.
He's dangerous
Protect your heart,
He'll tear it apart.
Dangerous
He'll steal your heart away,
Then run and play.
He's dangerous
Protect your heart,
He'll tear it apart

I didn't see the crash that burnt the bridge
Didn't see the missile that sank my love-ship down
[Oh I felt the hit, it was as hard as a brick. It made me shift]
And left me damaged

Dealing with the pain was so hard
I can't believe the things that he did to leave me scarred
And now...
[It's pay back, gotta make him feel it]
He wish he never did it
But it's too late to turn it around

[Be on the lookout when he's coming to your area.
I fell in love with him once, girls, I'm telling ya]
I wish I knew what I know now
I swear it never would have went down

Dangerous
He'll steal your heart away,
Then run and play.
He's dangerous (dangerous)
Protect your heart,
He'll tear it apart.
Dangerous
He'll steal your heart away,
Then run and play.
He's dangerous
Protect your heart,
He'll tear it apart

I wish I never fell in love
And maybe it wouldn't hurt so much
Inside I try to keep it in
My heart is screaming for revenge

Caution before you cross that path
You never know what's up ahead
Don't let him trap you up and get your love
Because...
He's dangerous

Dangerous
He'll steal your heart away,
Then run and play.
He's dangerous
Protect your heart,
He'll tear it apart.
Dangerous
He'll steal your heart away,
Then run and play.
He's dangerous
Protect your heart,
He'll tear it apart (tear it apart)
Dangerous...
