Pack up all my care and woes
Here I go, singin' low
Bye bye, my blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet and honey, so is she
Bye bye, my blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
All the hard-luck stories they all hand me

So make the bed, honey, light the light
I'm coming home late tonight
Blackbird, oh, bye bye

Pack up all my cares and woes
Here I go, singin' low
Bye bye bye bye, bye bye blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet and honey, so is she
Bye bye, my blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
All the hard luck stories they all hand me

So make the bed, honey, light the light
I'm coming home late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye
