Picture sand in a storm
Picture grace when its gone
Its so hard to carry on
Gotta lose this heavy load

Picture beauty in a smile
Hold your breath for just a while
And you'll remember all you have
Remember:

You're not alone
You're not alone

Don't let it get you down
You'll feel it all around
There's a face begins to pass
Still feeling insecure
Sometimes we all must learn
Sometimes we don't know where to turn
Sometimes we all do wrong
I keep hearing the same old song.

When your head still falls to fail
You're creating what is real
And only anger doesn't pay
I have to learn to let things go
Only thinking what to say
Comes across another way
Then we're left misunderstood
Remember:

You're not alone
You're not alone

Don't let it get you down
You'll feel it all around
There's a face begins to pass
Still feeling insecure
Sometimes we all must learn
Sometimes we don't know where to turn
Sometimes we all do wrong
I keep hearing the same old song.
