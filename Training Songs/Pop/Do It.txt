Here again playing the lonely game
Blind as a fool who won't see
Suddenly taking control again
What could be happening to me

My only consolation
Is that someday you'll care
My source of inspiration
You don't get far when you're going nowhere

I can do it, do it, do it till the morning comes
Like the river fills the sea
I can do it,do it,do it like incessant drums
I can do it like the birds and the bees

Hestitate is there no end to it
So tired of living a lie
Time won't wait too late to start again
Wander while wondering why

My only consolation
Is that someday you'll care
Perverse sophistication
You won't get far if you're going nowhere

I can do it, do it, do it till the morning comes
Like the river fills the sea
I can do it, do it, do it like incessant drums
I can do it like the birds and the bees

I can do it, do it, do it till the morning comes
Like the river fills the sea
I can do it, do it, do it like incessant drums
I can do it like the birds and the bees

My only consolation
Is that someday you'll care
My source of inspiration
You don't get far if you're going nowhere

It's not infatuation
To hope that you're the one to care
My final consolation
You won't get far you're going nowhere

I can do it, do it, do it till the morning comes
Like the river fills the sea
I can do it, do it, do it like incessant drums
I can do it like the birds and the bees

I can do it, do it, do it till the morning comes
I can do it, do it, do it,do it
Here again playing the lonely game
Blind as a fool who won't see

Suddenly taking control again
What could be happening to me

My only consolation
Is that someday you'll care
My source of inspiration
You don't get far when you're going nowhere

I can do it, do it, do it till the morning comes
Like the river fills the sea
I can do it, do it, do it like incessant drums
I can do it like the birds and the bees

Hestitate is there no end to it
So tired of living a lie
Time won't wait too late to start again
Wander while wondering why

My only consolation
Is that someday you'll care
Perverse sophistication
You won't get far if you're going nowhere

I can do it, do it, do it till the morning comes
Like the river fills the sea
I can do it, do it, do it like incessant drums
I can do it like the birds and the bees

I can do it, do it, do it till the morning comes
Like the river fills the sea
I can do it, do it, do it like incessant drums
I can do it like the birds and the bees
