Scram, Sam
She ain't for you!

[Chorus]
I'm cuttin' in
I'm cuttin' in

Back off, Buster
Take your hands off, please
That's my baby that you're tryin' to squeeze
Man, you're dancin' with the gal I'm gonna win

[Chorus]

You're cuttin' out
You're cuttin' out

Take off, Johnny
Don't you mess with me
Touch my darlin', there'll be trouble, see
Move on over or my fist'll find your chin

[Chorus]

She's my everlovin'
And her lovin's true
Now don't you make no trouble
Scram, Sam
She ain't for you!

[Chorus]

Honey, honey
Come along with me
Feet are itchin' and my arms are free
Gonna swing ya till you don't know where you've been

[Chorus]

Find your own sweet dolly
If you think she's for you
Man, you're off your trolley
Back, Jack
The party's through!

[Chorus]

Honey, honey
Come along with me
Feet are itchin' and my arms are free
Gonna swing ya till you don't know where you've been

I'm cuttin' in!
