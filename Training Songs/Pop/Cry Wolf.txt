You couldn't wait for answers
You just had to try those wings
And all your happy ever afters
Didn't mean a thing

So, I'm not gonna try at all
To keep you from the flame
Just remember not to call
My name

When you cry wolf
Once too often
When you cry wolf
No, I won't come knockin'
When you cry wolf
I won't hear you anymore

If you start to stumble
If you start to crack
And if you're ever feeling humble
Don't look back

When you cry wolf
Once too often
When you cry wolf
No, I won't come knockin'
When you cry wolf
I won't hear you

You can try but you can't get me
Into the fire
'Cause I'm out of sympathy
And I can't walk this wire

So find yourself somebody new
To catch you when you fall
'Cause I got just one thing to say to you
And that's all

When you cry wolf
Once too often
When you cry wolf
No, I won't come knockin'
When you cry wolf
I won't hear you

Baby, baby, cry, cry, cry wolf
Don't cry me, baby, cry wolf

When you cry wolf
I won't hear you
Anymore
