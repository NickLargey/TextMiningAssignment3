She was just a young girl 
With the mind of a queen 
Her body bumpin' 
Do you know what I mean 
I tell ya somethin' 
It ain't the way that it seems 
'cause she said that she was eighteen 

My life means everything to me 
Ridin' 'round in chauffeured limousines 
No time for no one to get close to me 
But there she was at the bar 
Drinkin' "Sex on the Beach" 

This girl was one sore eyed remedy 
And then she said to me 

How about a time and a place 
We meet when it's sunny 
Miami, paradise 
I don't need your money 
We can walk in the sand hand in hand 
I can be your girl 
And you can be my man

Fast life, took her all around the world 
Didn't know, didn't care 
'cause she was my girl 
(One night) I bought her cars, some rings and furs 
I gotta say in a way 
I was fallin' for her 

This girl was one sore-eyed remedy 
And then she said to me 

Oh 
This girl was one sore-eyed remdy (Such a remedy) 
And then she said to me 
She is so in love with me, can't you see 
I'm in love with this girl 

'cause she said she was eighteen, yeah baby 
'cause she's my kinda girl
