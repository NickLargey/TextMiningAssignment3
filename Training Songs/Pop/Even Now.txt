Moon in the sky softly creeping
Over the time from above
And I lie awake hardly sleeping
So lonely for only your love

Even now each night I remember
Days of summer
When blossoms filled each bough
In the cold grey days of December
My darling I miss you even now

When will I see you again
Come to my arms where you belong
My world will be empty till then
For you are the words to my song

Even now each night I remember
Days of summer
When blossoms filled each bough
In the cold grey days of December
My darling I miss you even now

In the cold grey days of December
My darling I miss you even now
