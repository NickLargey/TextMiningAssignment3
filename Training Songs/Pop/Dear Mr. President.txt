Hey, woo
Hey, woo

Broken man and his wife with a child ain't got no hope
Outta work outta time, old man winter's comin' on

One meal ain't enough for three
is this the way its supposed to be
daddy just walked out mamma raisin' family

Hey put your foot down and take a look round
Don't like what you see
No No No No No No
Hey put your foot down and take a look round
Don't like what you see
No No No No No No

Hey, Woo
Hey, Woo

Get in line there's no jobs and the kids are shootin' dope
Outta work outta time mamma's startin' to loose hope, hope

It ain't enough to pray
When you got no place to stay
Daddy just walked out mamma raisin' family.

Hey put your foot down and take a look round
Don't like what you see
No No No No No No
Hey put your foot down and take a look round
Don't like what you see

No No No

Dear Mr. President

There is trouble on the streets
Now is the time and the test we must meet.
Dear Mr. President,
take a look around
Please Mr. President,

put your foot down

No No No

Hey, woo
