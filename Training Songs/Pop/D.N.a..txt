D.N.A 
Please sit down
Tell me what you got to say
Now there's a difference between truth and lies
I can check
I've got your DNA
Now look me right between the eyes
Tell me when I saw you 
And your new lady friend
What were you talking about 
When you laughed 
And your two cheeks met
What were you talking about

Let us talk
In the morning babe
I've got your DNA and the lie detect
How I thought I could change your babe 
All those flies buzzing round your head

Look at me
There's nothing new over there 
You've seen that stereo a thousand times 
Lift your head
And lift my spirits up 
Because you know
I'm dying deep inside
Don't you care about me
Are you looking for freedom
Is that what you're thinking about
Do you wanna hold me in your arms and kiss
Cos that's what I'm thinking about

Let us talk
In the morning babe
I've got your DNA and the lie detect
How I thought I could change your ways 
All those flies buzzing round your head

You got a brand new way of loving keeping the lights turned on
You keep a comb in your pocket and your shinny shiny shoes 
Yea don't touch the ground these days what's going on 
Yea you think I'm stupid cos I don't complain
Better sit your self down start talking fast
And if the lying don't kill you
The truth just might make you fade away
Fade away
Fade away
