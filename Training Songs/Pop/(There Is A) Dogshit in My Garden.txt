There is a dogshit in my garden
When I cut my grass
The dogshit is no longer in my garden
It is a-sittin on my footsole
Smell like a doggies ass
And that is not the smell of Elizabeth Arden.

You can have women and cookies and a strawberryt,
But there is nuthin' as bad as a doggie's shit.

No, no, no, no, no...
Ba-dab, ba-dab...

Og så siger vi,
Som om vi intet har høøøøørt:
