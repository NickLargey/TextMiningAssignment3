Anybody here seen my old friend Abraham?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
Oh, he freed a lot of people but the good they die young
I just looked around and he's gone, gone

Anybody here seen my old friend John?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
Oh, he freed lotta people but the good they die young
I just looked around and he's gone, gone, gone (gone), gone

Anybody here seen my old friend Martin?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed some people but the good they die young
I just looked around and he's gone, gone, gone, gone

Didn't you love the things that they stood for?
Didn't they try to find some good for you and me (for you and me)?
And we'll be free
Some day soon, it's gonna be one day

Anybody here seen my old friend Bobby?
Can you tell me, can you tell me me where he's gone?
I thought I saw him walkin' way over the hill
With Abraham, Martin, and John (Abraham, Martin and John, oh)
(Abraham, Martin and John) I thought I saw him walking
(Abraham, Martin and John) thought I heard them talking
(Abraham, Martin and John) about freeing the people
(Abraham, Martin, John) how to free the people
(Abraham, Martin and John) which ones to tell
(Abraham, Martin and John) and now they're all gone, gone, gone
Hallelujah
