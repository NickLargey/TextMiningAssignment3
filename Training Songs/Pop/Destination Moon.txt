Poor man take a trip in my rocket ship
We'll have a lovely afternoon
Kiss the world good-bye and away we'll fly
Our destination moon

We'll travel fast as a light to win, out of sight
The turf will be like a toy balloon
What a feel you'll get riding on my jet
A destination moon

Oh we'll go up, up, up, up
Straight to the moon, we two
High in the starry blue
I'll be out of this world with you

So when we steal in my space mobile
Supersonic honeymoon
Leave your past below, pull the switch let's go
Our destination moon

Oh we'll go up, up, up, up
Straight to the moon, we two
High in the starry blue
I'll be out of this world with you

So when we steal in my space mobile
A supersonic honeymoon
Leave your past below pull the switch let's go
Our destination, we'll fly high up in the sky
Destination, destination moon, woo
