Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years
Love you night and day,
Oh honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had?

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Oh babe think think what are you doing
You know my love for you will drive me to ruin 
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You feel blue you feel sad
And you'll miss the only pal you ever had 

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Oh babe think think what are you doing
You know my love for you will drive me to ruin
After you've gone, after you've gone away

I said away
