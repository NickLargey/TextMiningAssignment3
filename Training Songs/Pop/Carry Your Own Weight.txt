You can run if you want to
Desapear on an airplane
But you cant hide from yourself
You got to carry your own weight
By a ticky all alone train
If you think is your scape
But at the end of the day
You got to carry your own weight
Pasa la vida así, así
Para la vida, pasa
At the end of the day
You got to carry your own weight
Now you can run and you can think
That everybody is gonna give you
What you need but
At the end of the day

You got to carry your own weight
Yeah and you can run and you can also
Try to hide away from your responsibility
At the end of the day
You got to carry your own weight
Ay ay ay pasa la vida, pasa la vida
Pasa la vida, pa ti pa mi
Pasa la vida
You can run if you want to
Desapear on an airplane
But you cant hide from yourself
You got to carry your own weight
By a ticky all alone train
If you think is your scape
But at the end of the day
You got to carry your own weight
Pasa la vida así, así

Para la vida, pasa
At the end of the day
You got to carry your own weight
Waiting for me
At the end of the day
You got to carry your own weight
Cuz in the life there will be sufering
No matter if you run and no looking for
Love you maight no get enought
It´s and inside chap and it make it tuff
If you roof around the edges
They dont climb it up
You can hida but you cant seek
Remember that you are freak
Nobody gonna give you what you need
At the end of the day
You got to carry your own weight

You can run if you want to
Desapear on an airplane
But you cant hide from yourself
You got to carry your own weight
By a ticky all alone train

No matther witch path you take
You gotta be ok with be all alone
Your body is a tip you better go home
Is where you heart is beating
You are the only one who is bledding
All you need is the air you are breating
And you just keep dont believe on it

You and everything you do
The moon will shire on the dream come true
If theres a heart that you sustitute
Did you still got a lot a work to do
Así, así ni pa ti mi pa mi
Ni pa ti ni pa mi
Naci, naci, naci
By a ticky all alone train

But at the end of the day
You got to carry your own weight
Pasa la vida así, así
Para la vida, pasa
