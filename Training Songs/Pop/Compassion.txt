Rage is the rage
in these barbarous days
of bitterness spite and venom
of brilliant designs
of innocent minds
with nobody there 
to defend them
the terrible sights
and the star studded nights
the cathode lights
are so blinding

but there's something new
all the best people do
it's free and it's fun
and exciting

shalala compassion
yeah just compassion
shalala

tolerance lives
it's a gift you can give
to try to create understanding
I know that it's hard
when you're hurt
and you're scarred
and life is so weird
and demanding
I say live and let live
forget and forgive
that may be why I
am still standing
but there's a new style
it's so simple and wild
so stylish and free
and abandoned

shalala compassion
yeah just compassion
shalala

why is it me 
that you want to hurt?
I'd never raise a hand to you
I know that I'm
just a simple jerk
but I am the jerk
that loves you

shalala compassion
yeah just compassion
shalala

why is it me 
that you want to hurt?
I'd never raise a hand to you
I know that I'm
just a simple jerk
but I am the jerk
that loves you

tolerance lives
it's a gift you can give
to try to create understanding
I know that it's hard
when you're hurt and scarred
and life is so weird
and demanding
I say live and let live
forget and forgive
that's probably why I
am still standing

rage is the rage
in this barbarous age
of bitterness spite and venom
