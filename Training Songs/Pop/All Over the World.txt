All over the world 
People must meet and part 
There's someone like me 
Feeling a pain in their heart 

Some may meet again 
Under that same bright star 
If maybe some night 
You come back from afar 
Who cares if tonight 
I don't know where you are 

Are you thinking of me now 
Missing having me around 
If you have forgotten me 
My world will come tumbling down 

All over the world 
Others are sad tonight 
There's someone like me 
Watching the sun's fading light 

All over the sky 
There is the same warm glow 
Here under that star 
I'm wanting you to know 
Wherever you are 
That I still love you so
