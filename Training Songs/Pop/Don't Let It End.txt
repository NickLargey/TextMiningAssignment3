Today such a lonely day
I try to find my way
But you only you occupy my mind

And I try to understand the reason why
You're pushing me away
And I try to understand the reason why

Don't let it end, 'cause I can't pretend
I'm not gonna cry if you do
Don't let me go darlin' you know
My heart is breaking in two
Don't let it end why can't we mend
These wounds left open so long
Don't let it end 'cause I can't pretend
To stop loving you

Today I heard you calling me
But it's just the storm outside
And today I want you next to me
Your heart playing with my mind

And I try to understand the reason why
You're pushing me away
And I try to understand the reason why

Don't let it end, 'cause I can't pretend
I'm not gonna cry if you do
Don't let me go darlin' you know
My heart is breaking in two
Don't let it end why can't we mend
These wounds left open so long
Don't let it end 'cause I can't pretend

I know it's holding on too hard
Even if dreams have passed me by

Don't let it end, 'cause I can't pretend
I'm not gonna cry if you do
Don't let me go darlin' you know
My heart is breaking in two
Don't let it end why can't we mend
These wounds left open so long
Don't let it end 'cause I can't pretend
To stop loving you
