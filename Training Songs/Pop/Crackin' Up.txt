Oh girl you pick me up when I'm down
You take me to the top when you're round
And I don't think about the hard times but of you

[Chorus:]
And I ain't crackin' up
When I'm with you
And I ain't falling up
When I'm with you

So simple in my world
Like it should
When I'm with you sweet girl
I feel good
And I don't think about the hard times
But of you

[Chorus]

Oh girl you pick me up when I'm down
You take me to the top When you're round
And I don't think about the hard times but of you

[Chorus x2]
