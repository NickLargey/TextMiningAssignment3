If we ever write the play
We'd never need to rehearse
'Cause everything we say
Someone said it first
The light is fading
And so are we
We both need saving
We're just too tired of everything

And how long?
And how much pain?
Do we need to feel
Before we start again

Do we need to cry?
Before the tears grow cold
Before the lies run dry

Never live the dream
'Cause that's what dreaming's for
But everything we've done
Someone's done before
The bell is toning
For you and me
And I can't watch you drowning
But you won't take a hand from me

And how long?
And how much pain?
Do we need to feel
before we start again
And how long?
Do we need to cry?
Before the tears grow cold
Before the lies run dry

And I

I should've been there
I could've stopped this
Heart for you

And I
I didn't want this
I should've been there
I could've stopped this
Heart for you

And how long?
And how much pain?
Do we need to feel
before we start again
And how long?
Do we need to cry?
Before the tears grow cold
Before the lies run dry

I didn't want this
I didn't know it
I didn't want this
I didn't end it

I didn't want this
I didn't know it
I didn't want this
I didn't end it

And I
