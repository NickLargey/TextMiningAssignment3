Don't mind telling you, in my humble fash
That you thrill me through, with a tender pash,
When you said you care, 'magine my emoshe
I swore then and there, permanent devoshe,
You made all other men seem blah
Just you alone filled me with ahh

'S wonderful, 's marvellous
You should care for me!
'S awful nice, 's paradise,
'S what I love to see.

You've made my life so glamorous,
You can't blame me for feeling amorous!
Oh 's wonderful, 's marvellous,
That you should care for me!

'S magnifique, 's what I seek
You should care for me.
'S elegant, 's what I want,
'S what I love to see.

My dear, it's four leaved clover time,
From now on my heart's working overtime,
'S exceptional, 's no bagatelle,
That you should care for
That you should care for
That you should care for me
