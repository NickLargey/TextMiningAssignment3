You make me feel so precious
Like a sacred rose
But lately you’ve been feelin’
More of my thorns

You’re like a treasure island
And I’m lost at sea
I wanna get into your heart
But every chest needs a key

I’m feelin’ like we’re dynamite
Always ready to ignite
Our love is like a hurricane
And obviously you can’t be tamed

What’s right for you is wrong for me
It’s not how it’s supposed to be
And I can’t help feeling this way
Oh, I’m craving, I’m craving

You were like the waterfall
Falling from my eyes
I love to hate to hate to love you
You’re the dark side of paradise

I’m feelin’ like we’re dynamite
Always ready to ignite
Our love is like a hurricane
And obviously you can’t be tamed

What’s right for you is wrong for me
It’s not how it’s supposed to be
And I can’t help feeling this way
No, no, I’m craving, I’m craving
I’m craving, I’m craving

I never give it up, I won’t stop to fight
For what I know, I know, I know it’s right
They say people never change but I believe it’s not the way
(Oh, oh, oh) I’m craving

I’m feelin’ like we’re dynamite
Always ready to ignite
Our love is like a hurricane
And obviously you can’t be tamed

What’s right for you is wrong for me
It’s not how it’s supposed to be
And I can’t help feeling this way
No, no, I’m craving, I’m craving
I’m craving, I’m craving

What’s right for you is wrong for me
It’s not how it’s supposed to be
And I can’t help feeling this way
No, I’m craving
I’m craving
