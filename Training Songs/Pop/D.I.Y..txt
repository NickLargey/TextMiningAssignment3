Some girls lose their boys after years
Some lose them right at the start
Standing in line, it’s a question of time
Who’s gonna be the next broken heart
But my heart belonged to a love so strong
I would love him ‘til the day that I die
But I didn’t lose my love to the Lord above
I lost him to a D.I.Y.

D, she was so determined
to take him right out of my hands
I, if you’re idle enough
they can steal from the very first dance
Y, she was young and pretty
and young and pretty is better than I
But we gave them all our kisses
Now they found another Mrs
‘Cause we lost him to a D.I.Y.

Some women feel if you put her on a seal
it will keep your fella out of reach
But it ain’t no soul you can grab them from below
That’s a lesson every woman can teach
But my man was just the sort you could trust
You could look a fella right in the eye
If it wasn’t for deceiving
But suddenly he was leaving ‘cause we lost him to a D.I.Y.

D, she was so determined
to take him right out of my hands
I, if you’re idle enough
they can steal from the very first dance
Y, she was young and pretty
and young and pretty is better than I
But we gave them all our kisses
Now they found another Mrs
‘Cause we lost him to a D.I.Y.

L – A – D – I – E – S
Come on girls, if she’s wearing a dress
T – H – I – E and F
She got high heels and couldn’t care less
W – O – M – E – N
Come on girls, it’ll happen again
H – I – S – T – O – R – Y
Come on folks, I'ts just an ordinary guy

D, she was so determined
to take him right out of my hands
I, if you’re idle enough
they can steal from the very first dance
Y Y Y, she was young and pretty
and young and pretty is better than I
But we gave them all our kisses
Now they found another Mrs
‘Cause we lost him to a D.I.Y.
