One night is all it takes to fall for you
A single touch of your taste
To make me fall for you

One look from your eyes
Is what I'm dreaming of
Waking up by your smile
Is what I'm dreaming of

When the stars collide
We connect the dots in each others eyes
Shining so bright till we find the light
Shine so bright till we grow

Afterglow
Afterglow
Afterglow

Breathing without your breath
Will make me lose my mind
Your light is all I see in my dark times

'Cause when the stars collide
We connect the dots in each others eyes
Shining so bright till we find the light
Shine so bright till we glow

Afterglow
Afterglow
Afterglow

If you love somebody
If you love someone
Wait around for the perfect moment to come
You helped me fly
When I was heavy I was down and now I
Will lift you up and pull you closer to mine
When I was heavy I was down and now I
Will lift you up and pull you closer to mine

We connect the dots till we find the light
Shining so bright till the stars collide
We connect the dots till we find the light
Shine so bright till we glow
