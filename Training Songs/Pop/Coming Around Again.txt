I been sitting in the darkness
But the sunlight's creeping in
Now the ice is slowly melting
In my soul and in my skin
All the good times my friend
Are coming around again
Oh yeah

I been thinking reminiscing
Of better nights and better days
Hiding in a refuge
Of memories I've made
I got a feeling within
It's coming around again

[Chorus]
(It's coming around again)
We been so long waiting
For the all time high
We got a damn good reason
To put your troubles aside
And all your winter sorrows hang 'em out to dry
Throw it away
Gotta throw it away
All the colorful days my friend
Are coming around again

That's right
Yeah yeah mmm

I got someone waiting for me
It's been so long since we met
And I may not be your salvation but I'll offer nonetheless
And if like me you wanna take that chance
It's coming around again
Ooh yeah

[Chorus]

Yeah yeah mmm

I can feel a change of fortune
No more riding on my love
Feel the weight is off my shoulders
As my feet become unstuck
And all the good times on which we do depend
Oh it's coming around again

[Chorus]
