I've been so many places in my life and time 
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes. 
I lighted up my life on stages 
With ten thousand people watching 
But we're alone now 
And I'm singing this song for you. 

I know your image of me is what I hope to be 
I treated you unkindly 
But darling, can't you see 
No one's more important to me 
But darling, can't you please see through me 
'Cause we're alone now 
And I'm singing this song for you. 

Chorus: 
You taught me precious secrets 
Of the truth witholding nothing 
You came out in front and I was hiding 
Now's I'm so much better 
And if my words don't come together 
Listen to the melody 
'Cause my love is in there hiding. 

I love you in a place where there's no space or time 
I love you for in my life 
You're a friend of mine 
When my life is over 
We were alone 
And I was singing this song for you. 

Chorus 

I love you in a place where there's no space or time 
I love you -- In my life, you're a friend of mine 
When my life is over 
We were alone and I was singing this song for you 

We were alone and I was singing this song for you.
