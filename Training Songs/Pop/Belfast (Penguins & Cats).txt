I've got a ticket to the fast city
Where the bells don't really ring
Getting off the plane the cold air
Rushes like bullets through my brain,

And I'm divided
Between penguins and cats
But it's not about what animal you've got
It's about being able to fly,
It's about dying nine times

Walked on Broadway
Going up to falls
Where the old man I used to know
The paintings on the walls of release
Are colorful but are no Matisse

And I'm divided
Between penguins and cats
But it's not about what animal you've got
It's about being able to fly,
It's about dying nine times

It's about being able to fly,
It's about dying nine times
