Don't think I'm not aware
Of all these things you did.
Do behind my back.
'Cause nobody gets you like I-I do.

Lip-stick on your collar there.
Perfume all around your hair.
Can't deny the fact that nobody BS's like you.

I believed you till.
I recognized the symptoms.
Look what we have become, Oh.
I know what happens now.
Baby there's no crown, just you and me.
I'm checking, checking, checking ya out.

We kiss and we fight.
Push away, pull me tighter.
We're up, and we're down.
Dancin' round this encounter.
This ain't no disco window night.
Stop dancin' around.
You love me, you hate me.
You need me, you play me.
Stop dancin' around.

You fight, You're fake, hustle me you're mistaken.
The beats turn around, face to face, hearts are breakin'.
This ain't no disco window night.
Stop dancin' around'.

Stop dancin' around
Stop dancin' around, the truth.

Uh oh.
Uh ah ohhhh.
Uh ohhh.
Uh uh ohhh.

It's time that we come clean.
Exactly was does it mean?
That I can turn you on, Nobody makes me feel like you do.

It's like a bad disease.
That makes me want to please.
My arm is going soft, cause nobody BS's like you.
I believed you till.
I recognized the symptoms.
Look what we have become, Oh.
I know what happens now.
Baby there's no crown, just you and me.
I'm checking, checking, checking ya out.

We kiss and we fight.
Push away, hold me tighter.
