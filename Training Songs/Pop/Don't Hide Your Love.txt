There ain't a lot that I know, but what I do goes to show
You know it's never enough-oh, it's never enough
I take it in and let it out, 'cause baby that's what it's about
Either I'm in your way, or back in your arms again, arms again
Let me in now

[Chorus]
Don't hide your love (baby don't hide)
Your pride is all that you're thinkin' of
Don't hide your love 'cause there ain't time enough

Same old song in a brand new dress-I grow so bored, I acquiesce
Tell me what can I do, to bring you back to me, back to me
Gotta bring it back now

[Chorus]

Oh, don't walk away-I need you to stay
You've got to believe there's more than this
Oh how will I know, if you're letting go
I want what you're wanting more or less

Today I'm out, tomorrow in-I'm feelin' upside down again
You know it's so hard to tell, oh it's so hard to tell
I'll try to see beyond the rain, to where we see light again
You know it's here in my heart-its burning bright for you, bright for you
You gotta bring it home now

[Chorus: x2]
