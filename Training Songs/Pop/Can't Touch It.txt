Just past eleven o'clock, roll up in the club
Wanna rock the spot
Girls out, 'bout to bubble it up
Boys take a look, see what you can't touch

Seven jeans and a Prada bag
Six inch heels, how ya liking that?
Working it out, he's checking it out
I'm gonna knock him down, round after round

I can feel the base line jumping
Watch out there's my song

Ladies, let me see your hands up in the air
Ladies, show 'em what you got
Shake it all around, yeah, yeah

E yo, you wanna little of this?
You want a little, wanna little of this?
E yo, you wanna little of this?
You want a little, wanna little of this?

Once you think you think you got it
You can't touch it

I'm not what you think I am
You ain't gon' get what you think you can
Oh no, you ain't the man
You might be fine but I don't give a damn

'Cause I'm here with my girls tonight
No strings attached, no guys required
Wanna let my hair down, get out on the town
DJ turn it up nice an' loud

I can feel the base line jumping
Watch out there's my song

Ladies let me see your hands up in the air
Ladies show 'em what you got
Shake it all around, yeah, yeah

E yo, you wanna little of this?
You want a little, wanna little of this?
E yo, you wanna little of this?
You want a little, wanna little of this?

Once you think you think you got it
You can't touch it
