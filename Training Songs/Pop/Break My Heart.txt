You break my heart, you break my heart
You break my heart, you break my heart heart
You break my heart, you break my heart
You break my heart, you break my heart heart

I know we’re not together
I know we grew apart
But I can’t ignore this feeling
It’s like a tattoo on my heart

And I can’t stop thinking about you
Love up with somebody else
It’s too much, every night in bed
And I can’t quit thinking about you
If ain’t doing the things that we did doesn’t make you feel safe

‘Cause you with him
Drives me mad, I did nothing wrong
‘Cause you with him
Hurts so bad, now my love is gone

So why you wanna?
You break my heart, you break my heart
So why you wanna?
You break my heart, you break my heart heart
So why you wanna?
You break my heart, you break my heart
So why you wanna?
You break my heart, you break my heart heart

A painter bought our picture
And he diss off you away
If you’re confused I’m doing better
What the hell am I meant to say?

And I can’t stop thinking about you
Love up with somebody else
It’s too much, every night in bed
And I can’t quit thinking about you
If ain’t doing the things that we did doesn’t make you feel safe

‘Cause you with him
Drives me mad, I did nothing wrong
‘Cause you with him
Hurts so bad, now my love is gone

So why you wanna?
You break my heart, you break my heart
So why you wanna?
You break my heart, you break my heart heart
So why you wanna?
You break my heart, you break my heart
So why you wanna?
You break my heart, you break my heart heart

Every time I think about it
I get that extra tack
But I know that I gotta reset
Nothing I do or say will bring you back
And I can leave the door wide open
Hopin one day you walk right through
But I can stand a second right now
Thinking you enjoy him fucking you
He’s fucking you, he’s fucking you

‘Cause you with him
Drives me mad, I did nothing wrong
‘Cause you with him
Hurts so bad, now my love is gone

So why you wanna?
You break my heart, you break my heart
So why you wanna?
You break my heart, you break my heart heart
So why you wanna?
You break my heart, you break my heart
So why you wanna?
You break my heart, you break my heart heart
