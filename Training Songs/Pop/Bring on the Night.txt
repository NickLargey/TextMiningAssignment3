I read the book you read, tasted the words you said
Our story is darkening with time
One fading afternoon
The leaves dried in your car, no picture understood
But I had a feeling I would cry, you hid it all from me
And I'll miss you forever
Let's hope we've always summer

Yeah bring on the night, I don't care
Turn on the dark, I'm not scared
Spirit money to a flame
Ask that I'll see you again (that I'll see you again)
Yeah bring on the night, I don't care
Turn on the dark, I'm not scared
Wherever it is you left me behind
I'll follow you down the path of my broken heart

Flowers on Edith Grove, wilt like a love note
Every day I'm passing by, I say a little prayer
And I'll miss you forever
Let's hope we've always summer

Yeah bring on the night, I don't care
Turn on the dark, I'm not scared
Spirit money to a flame
Ask that I'll see you again (that I'll see you again)
Yeah bring on the night, I don't care
Turn on the dark, I'm not scared
Wherever it is you left me behind
I'll follow you down the path of my broken heart

And I'll miss you forever
Let's hope we've always summer

Yeah bring on the night, I don't care
Turn on the dark, I'm not scared
Spirit money to a flame
Ask that I'll see you again (that I'll see you again)
Yeah bring on the night, I don't care
Turn on the dark, I'm not scared
Wherever it is you left me behind
I'll follow you down the path of my broken heart
