Livin' for tomorrow
Lost within a dream
Tryna find the answer to the question
And it seems that love makes the world feel good

Singin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the rain
Let the sun shine through to lift your spirit once again
'Cause love makes the world feel good

Chasing after rainbows
Somewhere in the sky

And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah

And it feels so good

Riding on a rhythm, of hearts that beat as one
This feels like forever
And we've only just begun
'Cause love makes the world feel good

Holding on the memories
Where smiles are still alive
Look into the future and it's happiness inside
'Cause love makes the world feel good

Walking through my past life
Where the days are full of joy

And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah

And it feels so good
