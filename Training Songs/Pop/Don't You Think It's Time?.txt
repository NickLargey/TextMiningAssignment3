Don't you think its time, 
Time to start anew 
Time for changing views 
Time for making up your mind 

Don't you think its time, 
Time for moving on 
Time for growing strong, 
Time to leave the past behind 

You've been on my mind, 
Oh you've been on my mind
You've been on my mind, 
Oh you've been on my mind

Don't you think its time, 
Time for quell and fear 
Time for a new year 
Time for meaning what you say 

Don't you think its time, 
Time for easing doubt 
Time for reaching out 
Time to open up your eyes 

You've been on my mind, 
Oh you've been on my mind
You've been on my mind, 
Oh you've been on my mind

Don't you think its time, 
Time for trusting more 
Without keeping score 
Time to let forgiveness out 

Don't you think its time, 
Time for showing grace 
Time for having faith 
Time to make more of this time 

You've been on my mind, 
Oh you've been on my mind
You've been on my mind, 
Oh you've been on my mind
