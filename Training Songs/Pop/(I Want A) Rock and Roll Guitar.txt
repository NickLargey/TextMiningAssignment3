SPOKEN:A ho ho ho......It was the night before Christmas and 
everthing was real quiet. So I thought I'd take myself a little 
walk at Christmas Eve Night. I was makin' it on down the street, 
when to my surprise I saw this little bitty cat with big old 
tears in his eyes. Now I could see he was standin' in front of 
this music store and looked real brought down. I could hear what 
he was sayin', he didn't know I was around...he say.....

I want a rock an' roll guitar
With a big bass string
I want a rock an' roll guitar
So I can play the thing

I wanna be on t.v.
Like a rock an' roll star
I want Santa Claus to bring me
A rock an' roll guitar

SPOKEN: ha ha ha.....so-a I walked over to him-a 'cause I understand.
I, I thought I'd cheer him up so I say, "Look-a-here little man,
A-you don't want no rock an' roll guitar, you want a six gun like
the Lone Ranger has, so you can run around sayin'-a hi ho Silver,
Kimo sabe, and all that cowboy jazz. Or how would you like old Santa 
to bring you a little dump truck so you could go around a-dumpin' 
things".....And he say, "Man, I don't want no dumptruck, I want 
somethin' that swings".....He say.....

SPOKEN: Ha, ha, wait a minute there, wait a minute, hold on, hold on 
I say. I say, hold on there little fellow, ah why don't you be like 
the little chicks and cats and wish for a space helmet or a 
rocketship or something wild like that? And you know what he say? He 
say....."Look here dad, I don't want no plane or no train or nothin' 
square like that, that ain't the lick for me. Wwhen I awake this 
whole place is gonna shake, 'cause you know what I want under my 
Christmas tree!"....He say.....
