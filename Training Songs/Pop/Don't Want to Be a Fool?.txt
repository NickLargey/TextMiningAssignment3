Love, what have you done? Oh, wow
I was sure up to now that she was a friend
I stayed 'till the end (don't be a fool again)
I once believed that love was fair
But I don't anymore, she said I'm a bore

My heart hit the floor (don't be a fool anymore)
Each time around
I tell myself it's the game of love
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love
Well, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again
So I'll say to the end
I just don't wanna be a fool (don't want to be a fool)
Said I don't wanna be a fool ever again

Whenever a fool's in love he doesn't know he's to blame
He's caught in the game
It all ends up the same (he doesn't feel the shame)
He looks at love in a diff'rent way
It breaks his heart ev'rytime they all turn out strange

But he'll never change (he's never gonna change)
Next time around I'll tell myself it'll be better than before
I won't look back
There'll be no one tearing my heart out anymore
I just decided I can't let nobody fool me again
So I'll swear to the end

I just don't wanna be a fool (don't wanna be a fool)
Said I don't wanna be a fool (ever again)
No way (I mean no more) never again (ooh, no never)
I can't be a fool, can't be, no way, no way, no way
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a fool, no

I can't love anybody (I can't love nobody)
Walking on a one way street (any way, any way any, way no)
If I don't (if I don't) find somebody (somebody body)
That'll be alright with me (know, I know it'll be alright now)

'Cause I decided not to let nobody kill me again
So I'll say to the end

I just don't wanna be a fool (don't wanna be a fool)
Said I don't wanna be a fool (don't wanna be a fool) ever, ever again
(Don't wanna a fool can't be a fool)
Don't wanna be a fool (don't wanna be a fool) ever again
(I don't wanna be a fool) never oh never oh never again
(Don't wanna be a fool) can't be a fool
