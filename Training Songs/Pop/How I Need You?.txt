I want you now and forever
That's why did you do it!
I miss you now that you've gone
I'm not a type of girl to mess around with!
I just called to say, I really love
You should have thought of that before!
And girl, I do regret
Every single word that I said.
The night is so empty without you
And loneliness's falling upon my mind
I'm trying to touch you in my dreams
My heart is crying baby

Oh, how I need you
Oh, how I need you

I'm waiting every night time
My nights have been so lonely since you've been gone
I'll kiss you and hold you tight
I dream about this feeling every night
What I mean is: girl, I really changed now
I'd really love to believe you!

I swear to you, I do! Girl, I'll never make you blue
The night is so empty without you
And loneliness's falling upon my mind
I'm trying to touch you in my dreams
My heart is crying baby

Oh, how I need you
Oh, how I need you
