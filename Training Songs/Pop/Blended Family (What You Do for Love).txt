Hey I might not really be your mother
That don't mean that I don't really love ya
And even though I married your father
That's not the only reason I'm here for ya

I think you're beautiful
I think you're perfect
I know how hard it gets
But I swear it's worth it, worth it

That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
'Cause there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family, but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love

I know it started with a little drama
I hate you had to read it in the paper
But everything's alright with me and ya Mama
Baby everybody here you know adores ya

I think it's beautiful
I think it's perfect
I know how hard it gets
But I swear it's worth it, worth it

That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
'Cause there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family, but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love, love

For love, for love
I think it's, my real my true love
'Cause you're my baby, rejoice daily
I believe love could bring us closer than blood

I remember having four step-moms at nine
Loved Christmas time and birthday was fly
Hit my sisters just for dinner 'cause the cookin' was bomb
Her mothers supper made me love her like she took me to prom (uh)
And shoutout to my sisters on welfare
Flacko care, nobody else care
And shoutout to the step-sisters and step-brothers
And god-sisters, who eventually slept with us
Real love, but you doin' it right, alright
I'm here for you
Everything's alright, alright

That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love (That's just what you do)
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us (For you baby)
It may not be easy
This blended family but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love, love

That's just what you do (for love)
For love of the babies (for love)
We're a blended family (for love)
And it's alright (for love)
Said it's alright!
I'll be here forever
