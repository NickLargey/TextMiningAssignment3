If I were Lord Byron,
I'd write you, sweet siren,
A poem inspirin',
A killer diller-oo

Too bad, I'm no poet,
I happen to know it,
But anyway,
Here's a roundelay,

That I wrote last night about you.
You are to me ev'rything,
My life to be, ev'rything,
When in my sleep you appear,

Fair skies of deep blue appear,
Each time our lips touch again,
I yearn for you, oh, so much again,
You are my fav' right star,

My haven in heaven above
You are ev'rything I love
