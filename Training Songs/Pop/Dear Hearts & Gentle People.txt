I love those dear hearts and gentle people who live in my hometown
I love those dear hearts and gentle people who never ever let you down
They read the good book from Friday to Monday that's how the weekend goes
I've got a dreamhouse I'll build there one day with picket fence and rambling rose
I feel so welcome each time that I return till my happy heart's laughing like a clown
I love those dear hearts and gentle people who live and love in my hometown
