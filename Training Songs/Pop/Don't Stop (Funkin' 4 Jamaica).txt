There ain't nothing u can do with the man, 
Except for shake yo ass and clap yo hands, 
Bob yo head and move your feet, 
I ain't the type of rapper just to ride the beat!

I take the roof,the house and knock out your tyres, 
Its the funk in here 
Let mystikal move you and Mariah sing 

Chorus-MC: 
Don't Stop baby(Mystikal ad-libs:shake yo ass),

Baby i'm into you(get on the floor), 
Don't Stop baby(shake yo ass), 
Its extasy(shake the whole grill),

and move yo feet) 

Mystikal: 
Heads up,Look out,its bout to go down, 
And what they didn't know about me then, I bet they know now, 
I'm bout to prove my fame, 
So just get out the way and let me do the thing, 
Its on tonight, 
I'm known to be more vulgar than the garbage ____ 
You can't stop the train, 
You ain't got no unbrella so get your ass out the rain, 
You ain't louder than this! 
I'm like a bowl of gumbo,you ain't hotter than this, 
I'm what they play in the club, 
I keep them moving till i leave, thats what they paying me for, 
You already know what i do, 
So have my money and my munchies and my cigar too, 
I'm known for bringing the heat, 
Ain't nobody cutting up but MC now MC 

Chorus-MC: 
Don't Stop baby(shake yo ass), 
Its extasy(watch yoself),

Baby i'm into you(oh oooo,oh-ooooo) 
Don't Stop baby,

Mystikal: 
Go head _____ and party, 
Mix that with that dark but don't waste that on my Jordans, 
Keep laughing till your moth tired, 
Go ahead and lit something up but take that ciggarette outside, 
Get on the floor, 
Its another number one debut for sure, 
Now say it ain't real, 
And if i ain't a fool why you can't keep still sing 

Bridge-MC: 
I'm feeling, 
And i gotta get in the beat, 
Jamaican funk thats what it was, 
O-oh let it get into you 

Chorus-MC: 
Don't Stop baby, 
Its extasy, 
Turn me up a little higher,

Don't Stop baby, 
Its extasy, 
Turn me up a little higher 
Baby light my fire, 
Tell me every little thing you want to do 
I just want to love ya
