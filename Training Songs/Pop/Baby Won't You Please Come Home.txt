Baby, won't you please come home
'Cause you've left your daddy all alone
I have tried in vain
Never no more to call your name

Since you left, you broke your daddy's heart
That will never make us part
Every hour in the day
You can hear me say
Oh, baby, baby, please come on home
Come on home to your daddy, will you, darling, please

Since you left, you broke your daddy's heart
That will never make us part
Every hour in the day
You can hear me say
Oh, baby, won't you please come home to your loving daddy
Oh, baby won't you please come home
