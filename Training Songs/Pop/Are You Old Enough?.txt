Ten years in the jailer's eye
An' I'm thinkin' 'bout my baby
Looking at my life go by
Falling in the streets I'm broke
An' I'm laughing at the poor man
Talking to the blind man

See the lady in the street car lights
Got a whole lot to lose
Television and the red red wine
So won't you tell me
Won't you tell me the truth

Are you old enough
Are you old enough
Are you old enough
Are you old enough
Are you old enough oo oo
Are you old enough oh oh

Time goes and here we stand
Laughing at the side show
Sinking in the quick sand
The other side of another world
Scratch my back go the coloured girls
Yeah, oh yeah

I just wanted to kiss someone
I got the moondog blues
You just happened to be standing there
So won't you tell me
Won't you tell me the truth

Are you old enough
Are you old enough
Are you old enough
Are you old enough
Are you old enough oo oo
Are you old enough oh oh

See the lady in the street car lights
Got a whole lot to lose
Television and the red red wine
So won't you tell me
Won't you tell me the truth

Are you old enough
Are you old enough
Are you old enough
Are you old enough
Are you old enough oo oo
Are you old enough oh oh
