Angels of mercy, there's so much to do
The heavens are gray overhead

Angels of mercy, they're calling to you
So march with your crosses of red

March where the darkness shuts out the light
March where there is no dawn

Angels of mercy, the world's covered with night
But your mercy goes marching on
Angels of mercy through darkest night
Your mercy goes marching on
