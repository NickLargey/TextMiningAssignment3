I hear the clock, I hear the rain
 I'm all alone
 Why am I here and you are there?
 I miss you so
 
 I wish that you were here with me
 I need to breathe the air you breathe
 
 [Chorus]
 'cause your blood is my blood
 I feel it in my heart that we'll be together
 And your god is my god
 Your love has made me a believer
 
 All through the night I stay awake
 And think of you
 If love is deep then it will keep
 I know it's true, I know it's true
 I never felt so sure before
 But I don't doubt it anymore
 
 [Chorus]
 'cause your blood is my blood
 I feel it in my heart that we'll be together
 And your god is my god
 Your love has made me a believer (A believer)
 
 I believe in the way I feel
 I believe our love is real
 I believe in the dream we share
 I feel it everywhere
 I believe in the way we touch
 I never felt so much love
 
 Your love has made me a believer
 Your love has made me a believer
 
 [Chorus]
 'cause your blood is my blood
 I feel it in my heart that we'll be together
 And your god is my god
 Your love has made me a believer
 A believer, a believer, a believer
 
 'cause your blood is my blood
 I feel it in my heart
 Your god is my god
 
 Your love has made me a believer
