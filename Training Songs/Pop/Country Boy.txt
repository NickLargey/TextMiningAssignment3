when I was born as I recall  the preacher didn't hold out any hope at all  he looked at me all pink and skin  thought he'd better dip me in the bath again    I scuffed my shins on bigger things  people throwin' rocks at the angel's wings  but through it all I stood tall  even when my back was up against the wall    the devil's daughter keep a calling out my name  I so sincerely want to cross the road and play the game    raise your hands, jump for joy  let's hear it for the country boy  raise your hands, jump for joy  let's hear it for the country boy    so I grow'd up became a man  took my daddy's teachings all across the land  the journey's long but I must be strong  and try to tell the difference 'tween right and wrong    the devil's daughter keep a calling out my name  I've been to heaven! now I'm never gonna see things the same    raise your hands, jump for joy  let's hear it for the country boy  raise your hands, jump for joy  let's hear it for the country boy
