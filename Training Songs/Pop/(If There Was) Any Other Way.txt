Sorry, I know I'm late
Guess I lost all track of time
Started walking and couldn't stop
Turning it over in my mind
Tried to make some sense of it
Trying to make the pieces fit
I thought I covered my tracks so well
But now he says he knew about it from the start
 
Yeah, he knew about us all along
If there was any other way
No, don't you think I've tried to find it?
Don't you think I want to stay?
If there was any other way
No, there's no way out of this
There just ain't any other way
 
Mmmm
Maybe I'd better be leaving now
But there's something 
I want you to understand before I go
Sometimes we don't have a choice 
When we think and break the rules
I just have to see you, darlin'
One more time if only just to say goodbye
 
'Cause he knew about us all the time
If there was any other way
No, don't you think I've tried to find it?
Don't you think I want to stay?
If there was any other way 
No, there's no way out of this
There just ain't any other way
 
I never wanted it to be like this
I never meant to get serious
And now the thought of losing you 
Takes some getting used to
 
If there was any other way
No, don't you think I've tried to find it?
Don't you think I want to stay?
If there was any other way 
No, there's no way out of this
There just ain't any other way

If there was any other way
No, don't you think I've tried to find it?
Don't you don't think I want to stay?
