I came here from Dixie, right from the solid south,
I came here from Dixie, right from the solid south,
I was happy down here, now I'm down in the mouth!

I was walkin' on air way down in Tennessee,
I say I was walkin' on air way down in Tennessee,
Now I'm floatin' on air through the courtesy of NBC.

Life was easy, life was fine,
Until I lost that man of mine,
I can't forgive him for leaving me behind,
Got an ache in my heart and the blues on my weary mind.

Now there's just one blues to cure my misery,
Yes, yes there's just one blues to cure my misery,
The Lower Basin Street Blues is the only blues for me!
