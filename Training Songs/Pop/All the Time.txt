All The Time, I knew it All The Time,
From the moment that you came in view,
I could truthfully have said
"I love you."

I could see, that this was meant to be,
So if love is shining in my eyes,
It should come as no surprise.

How sweet and fresh the mornings come,
As I wake from my dream of you,
And the dream of you running through my heart,
Makes my day happy too.

Love has wings, and other magic things,
To the heavens we could climb,
If we could be together,
All The Time.

Musical repeat of a stanza. Then;

Love has wings, and other magic things,
To the heavens we could climb,
If we could be together,
All The Time
