Take him in, who's warm and gentle
Confidential, sentimental
That's the guy who'll open up your diamond eyes

He will be there when you're cryin'
Bravely tryin', self denyin'
He can wipe the tears from your sweet diamond eyes

Cara Mia mine, the stars are gonna shine forever
Cara Mia mine, the moon is lookin' down on you

Lend your heart, beg steal or borrow
Lend your heart again tomorrow
Cara Mia why should diamond eyes be blue
Repeat

Lady fair, your sigh's infection
And he's wishin' for nights of passion
Look around and see the world through diamond eyes

Love's the game, it's in your favour
It's got the flavour, for modern behaviour
Take the cards and deal the hand with diamond eyes

Cara Mia mine, the stars are gonna shine forever
Cara Mia mine, the moon is lookin' down on you

Cara Mia mine, the stars are gonna shine forever
Cara Mia mine, the moon is lookin' down on you

Lend your heart, beg steal or borrow
Lend your heart again tomorrow
Cara Mia why should diamond eyes be blue
Repeat
