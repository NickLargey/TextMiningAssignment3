I want to be just everything
More than you need
I want to hear you call
Nothing but me
I'd be lost on my own
A bird on the wing
Heaven knows like a bird
I see everything
I want to play on night to night
The world on a string
You look at me
And I wonder what goes on
All that money could buy
All of those things
I could never be sure
Where to begin
Friday night in the rain
Somebody new
Better now babe never
Take it from me
I got nothing but no
So many times
Hold it out to me now
Broken in two
