Baby, don't be mad at me!

If I made you cry, I'm sorry,
Baby, don't be mad at me!
If I told a lie, forgive me,
Baby, don't be mad at me!

I know that I was wrong,
But I've paid for my mistake;
Won't you string along?
Give a broken heart a break!

I love only you, believe me,
Baby, please be glad at me,
Baby, don't be mad at me!
