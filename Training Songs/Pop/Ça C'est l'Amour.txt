When suddenly you you sight
Someone for whom you yearn
Ca c'est l'amour
And when to your delight
She loves you in return
Ca c'est l'amour

Then dawns a dreary day
Your darling goes away
And all is over, you are sure
But oh, when she returns
And loves you as before
You take her in your lonely arms
And want her even more
Ca c'est l'amour
