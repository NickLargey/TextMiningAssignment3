Alone
Why must I be alone
I've spent so many hours with you
How can I be alone

Alone
Why must I dream alone
Our dreams were meant for us to share
How can I dream alone

There's such a thing a forgiving
So why can't you forgive
There's such a thing as forgetting
So can't you forgive and forget

Apart
Why must we be apart

Let's put our hearts together
And never be alone

There's such a thing a forgiving
So why can't you forgive
There's such a thing as forgetting
So can't you forgive and forget

Apart
Why must we be apart
Let's put our hearts together
And never ever be alone
