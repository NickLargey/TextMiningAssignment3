Don't gamble with love 
It's only for fools 
So play by the rules 
Don't gamble with love 

Oh don't gamble with love 
You will lose it for sure 
There'll be no cure 

When you gamble with love 
You can gamble your house, gamble your car 
Gamble your hopes just as far 
As the stars up above 
But don't you gamble with love 

Don't gamble with love 
It's only for fools 
So play by the rules 
Don't gamble with love
[Repeat]
