Do you believe in magic?
In a young girls heart
How the music can free her
Whenever it starts

And it's magic
If the music is groovy
It's makes you feel happy like an old time movie

I'll tell ya about the magic
It'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout rock n roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's just band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen
It'll start with a smile
It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping
And you can't seem to find
How you got there
So just blow your mind

Do you believe in magic?
Come along with me
We'll dance until morning, just you and me
And maybe, if the music the right
I'll meet ya tomorrow
So late at night

We'll go a dancin' baby then you'll see
All the magic's in the music and the music's in me, yeah

Do you believe in magic? Yeah.
Believe in the magic in a young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of rock n roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Oh, talkin' bout magic

Do you believe like I believe?
Do you believe in magic?

Do you believe like I believe?
Do you believe in magic?
