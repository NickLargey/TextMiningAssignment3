I tried to run away,
Somehow I couldn't to stay
You reached to hold my hand,
You led me to the promised land.

There we were all alone, there were
No telephones. we only had each
Other's eyes. and I feel now,
There were the best days
Of my life, hey yeah, yeah!

Where did you find their place?
Had we arrived in space?
Here we are kings and queens.
You know exactly what I mean.

Now we are all alone
There are no danger zones
We only have each other's smiles
And I feel now

They were the best days of my life
Hey yeah, yeah! yes, I feel now,
They were the best days of my life.

The astonishment, written on my face,
As a beauty, it has me dazed.
Of the scenery, I was so impressed,
By the way the paradise was smartly dressed

Hey yeah, yeah!
I tried to disappear,
From all my aches and feras
But now I close my eyes and journey

To this paradise
So beautiful, simply wonderful
I sit down and take my time
'Cause I feel now,

They were the best days
Of I'm convinced now
They were the best days of my life

Best days [Repeat: x 3]

They were the best days, best days
Best days, they were the best days,
Bets days, best days, they
They were the best days¡­
