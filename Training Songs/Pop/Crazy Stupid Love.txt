I’ve been looking everywhere and wishing on stars
There may never be a love as fucked up as ours
It might be crazy, but so are we
Tonight give me that crazy stupid love

Yeah, young and wild with our foot on the gas
One night and we gonna make it last
You in that dress the music on blast
And that attitude that I love so bad
We don’t care what they believe in
'Cause we live everyday like the weekend
Party till the morn and rage for no reason
Us against the world, I ain’t leavin’

I’ve been looking everywhere and wishing on stars
There may never be a love as fucked up as ours
It might be crazy, but so are we
Tonight give me that crazy stupid love

Oh whoa wishin’ on stars
Oh whoa as fucked up as ours
It might be crazy, but so are we
Tonight give me that crazy stupid love

We could be wild, we could be one
Livin’ it up till the night is done
We could spike the punch and run
We could light it up for fun
We could be groovy, losin’ our mind
We could make a movie, get looney
Just move it move it, love the way you do it do it

We’re so young
We should run away
And let’s play dumb
Take it all the way
We don’t care what they believe in
'Cause we live everyday like the weekend
Party till the morn and rage for no reason
Us against the world I ain’t leavin’

I’ve been looking everywhere and wishing on stars
There may never be a love as fucked up as ours
It might be crazy, but so are we
Tonight give me that crazy stupid love

Oh whoa wishin’ on stars
Oh whoa as fucked up as ours
It might be crazy, but so are we
Tonight give me that crazy stupid love

Let's get a little crazy
Oh

I’ve been looking everywhere and wishing on stars
There may never be a love as fucked up as ours
It might be crazy, but so are we
Tonight give me that crazy stupid love

Oh whoa wishin’ on stars
Oh whoa as fucked up as ours
It might be crazy, but so are we
Tonight give me that crazy stupid love

I’ve been looking everywhere and wishing on stars
There may never be a love as fucked up as ours
It might be crazy, but so are we
Tonight give me that crazy stupid love
