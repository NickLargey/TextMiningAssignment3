Well now, Mrs. Bones, don't forget to say no, baby
While I'm with your Uncle Sam
I'll be missing you so, baby
That's the kinda guy I am
Other boys may call your number
But if they take you to tea
Don't be thrillin' while I'm drillin'
Remember, you belong to me
Don't forget to say no, babe
If they want a kiss goodnight
Just remember it's no, baby
If they want to hold you tight
While I'm out to train, don't you entertain
Remember you're not the USO
Till I've returned, baby
Don't forget to say no
Don't forget to go voo-dee, voo-dee, doodle-dee, da-da
Dee-doo, doodle-dee, da-da, doodle-doodle-dee-dah-dah-dah
Other boys may call your number
But if they take you to tea
Don't be charmin' while I'm armin'
Remember you belong to me
Don't forget to no, babe
If they want a kiss goodnight
Just remember it's no, baby
If they want to hold you tight
And if you want to please while I'm overseas
Do a blackout from head to toe
Till I've returned, baby
Don't forget to say no

Don't forget to no, babe
If they want a kiss goodnight
Just remember it's no, baby
If they want to hold you tight
Now while I'm out to train, don't you entertain
Remember you're not the USO
Till I return, babe
Don't forget to say no, no, no, no, no
Don't forget to say no, babe
