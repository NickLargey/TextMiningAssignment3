'Cause I don't wanna be alone
I just wanna go back home 
Every time I hear that song, I feel alone 
Watch these people look so happy all around 
My friends are gone
I'm all alone, all alone, alone alone alone 

I don't wanna know what's a life without fun
I don't give a shit 'cause I'm under the sun 
I don't understand why people wanna (?)
You won't see me cry 'cause we're just kool kids

I don't care, put my dreams in the air 
I don't care, I'll fight them I swear 
I don't care, put my dreams in the air 
I don't care, I'll fight them I swear 

In the air, in the air, in the air 
(Fight them I swear) 

Girlz and Drugz 
That's what we live for, that's why we live 
Girlz and Drugz 
That's what we live for, that's why we live 
That's what we live for, that's why we live 

Every time I see that smile, my life is yours 
Next time we kiss the sky, the sky will know 
If love is not the lie you're looking for 
I will let you fly alone and go
Alone and go
I will let you fly alone and go 

Let me love, let me love
Let me love, let me love 
And we can walk, walk tonight
And we can talk, talk all night long 
And you can sleep, sleep with me
If you miss me 

Fly like a bird, you know all about it
Staying with me, we rock the party
You're in my mind when my world goes down 

Fly like a bird, you know all about it
Staying with me, we rock the party
You're in my mind, everything's alright 

Turn up the music, kick up the wave 
Turn up the music, keep that wave

I'm here 'cause I never count hours
Inhale life, like I smell flowers
