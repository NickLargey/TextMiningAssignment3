He dances overhead 
 On the ceiling, near my bed, 
 In my sight, through the night. 
 I try to hide in vain 
 Underneath my counter pane; 
 There's my love up above. 
 I whisper "go away my lover 
 It's not fair," 
 But I'm grateful to discover 
 He's still there. 
 I love my ceiling more 
 Since it is a dancing floor 
 Just for my love.
