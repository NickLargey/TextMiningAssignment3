Don't sweetheart me if you don't mean it 
 Don't talk sweet words if they're not true 
 Don't tear my heart like it was paper 
 Because my heart loves only you 
 You can't go round sweethearting others 
 And then pretend that I'm yours exclusively 
 Love must be true, mean what you're saying 
 Unless you do, don't sweetheart me
