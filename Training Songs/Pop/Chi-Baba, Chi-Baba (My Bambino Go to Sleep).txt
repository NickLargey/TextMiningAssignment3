Many a year ago in old Sorrento
A certain ditty was quite the thing
Whenever a mother rocked her baby in Sorrento
This little ditty she used to sing

[Chorus: x2]
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
An' chi-lawa kook-a la goombah
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
My bambino go to sleep!

All the stars are in the skies ready to say "goodnight"
Can't you see your doll is sleepy, too?
Close your drowsy little eyes, mama will hold you tight
While she sings a lullaby to you:

[Chorus]

(Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa, and chi-lawa)
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
An' chi-lawa kook-a la goombah (la goombah!)
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
My bambino go to sleep!

(Chi, chi, chi-baba!)
Chi, chi, chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
An' chi-lawa kook-a la goombah (la goombah!)
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
My bambino go to sleep! 

All the stars are in the skies ready to say "goodnight, goodnight"
Can't you see your doll is sleepy, too?
Close your drowsy little eyes, mama will hold you tight
While she sings a lullaby to you, ever so sweetly! 

[Chorus]

Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
My bambino go to sleep!
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
My bambino
Go to sleep!
