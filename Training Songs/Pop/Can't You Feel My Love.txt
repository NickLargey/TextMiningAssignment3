I have this picture(?) in the moonlight
Just look straight into my eyes
I could not stop myself from dreaming
As she appeared ????? the sky

I go up and down now, I can feel the heatwave
I can't stop ????? my freedom with my dreams

Can't you feel my love (And I don't know how to say it)
Oh oh oh oh (And I don't know what to do)
Can't you feel my love (And I don't know how to say it)
Oh oh oh oh (Don't know how to get to you)

Came into the situation
I think ????? kinda fair
But that should be a big frustration
'Cause there is something in the air

I go up and down now, I can feel the heatwave
I can't stop ????? my freedom with my dreams

Can't you feel my love (And I don't know how to say it)
Oh oh oh oh (And I don't know what to do)
Can't you feel my love (And I don't know how to say it)
Oh oh oh oh (Don't know how to get to you)

Believe me, I don't want to hurt you
Don't lose your spare time over me
But I'm in love, come on the rescue
I ????? and set me free

I go up and down now, I can feel the heatwave
I can't stop ????? my freedom with my dreams

Can't you feel my love
Oh oh oh oh
Can't you feel my love (And I don't know how to say it)
Oh oh oh oh (Don't know how to get to you)
