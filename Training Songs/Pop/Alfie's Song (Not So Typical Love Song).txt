Fake young when we met
Everything seemed alright
Like children sing on the sidewalk
Cut straight through the moonlight

how I love those days we didn't get out of bed
Left your taste in my mouth
Your strange voice in my head

Oh, I wanna hear it again
'Cause back then we were caught in a love song so loud, oh yeah
No not so typical love song
'Cause it hurt us again and again
So sang that I really need you so bad, oh yeah
No not so typical love song
'Cause it hurt us again and again

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
La, la, la, la, la
Okay look out

You'd leave the cities and chase bullet holes
That's actually star light
And in those rare moments you and I were brilliant
We were gonna be alright

But god I loved those days we couldn't get out of bed
Left your taste in my mouth
All your words in my head

And now I wanna hear it again
'Cause back then we were caught in a love song so loud, oh yeah
No not so typical love song
'Cause it hurt us again and again
So sang that I really need you so bad, oh yeah
No not so typical love song
'Cause it hurt us again and again, woo

Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, so bad, oh yeah
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

One, two, three, four
I wanna be alright
I wanna be alright
I wanna be alright with my baby tonight
I wanna be alright
I wanna be alright
I wanna be alright with my baby tonight, oh yeah
So sang that I really need you so bad, oh yeah
No not so typical love song
'Cause it hurt us again and again
