Don't go out in the rain you're gonna melt, sugar
Oh no come and sit down near the fire for a spell, sugar
Oh oh please take your shoes off and make yourself comfortable
The weather's miserable and you're so kissable

(It's getting late) why don't you wait
(It's after one) we've just begun
(She's got to go) oh no no no, please don't go

Don't go out into the rain
You're gonna melt, sugar
Oh no, come and sit here by the fire for a spell, sugar
Oh ho, the house is ours now that everybody's gone
And while the telly's on we should be having fun

(It's getting late) why don't you wait
(It's after one) we've just begun
(She's got to go) oh no no no, please don't go

Don't go out into the rain
You're gonna melt, sugar
Oh no, come and sit here by the fire for a spell, sugar oh oh

(It's getting late) why don't you wait
(It's after one) we've just begun
(She's got to go) oh no no no, don't be insane
