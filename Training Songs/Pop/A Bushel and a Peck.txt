I love you a bushel and a peck
A bushel and a peck and a hug around the neck
A hug around the neck and a barrel and a heap
A barrel and a heap and I'm talkin' in my sleep

About you, about you
'Cause I love you a bushel and a peck
You bet your purdy neck I do
A doodle oodle oh 
A doodle oodle oodle oh doo

I love you a bushel and a peck
A bushel and a peck though you make my heart a wreck
Make my heart a wreck and you make my life a mess
Make my life a mess, yes a mess of happiness

About you, about you
'Cause I love you a bushel and a peck
You bet your purdy neck I do
A doodle oodle ooh doo
A doodle oodle oodle ooh doo

I love you a bushel and a peck
A bushel and a peck and it beats me all to heck
It beats me all to heck, how I'll never tend the farm
Never tend the farm when I wanna keep my arm

About you, about you
'Cause I love you a bushel and a peck
You bet your purdy neck I do
A doodle oodle ooh
A doodle oodle oodle oh doo

A doodle oodle oodle oh doo
A doodle oodle ooh doo doo
