I've walked in the fields, and I’ve trod light for days
Seems I’ll do that old rag, takes me all kinds of ways
Except the way I’d be headed if I knew where I was going
But I’m from the country, and it’s better not knowing

And I’ve only got so near (Illuminate me)
And I’ve only gone so far (Illuminate me)
And I’ll walk another country mile
I’ll see another star

The poplars, and willows, and birds pass me by
The mould of the earth to the space in the sky
Free from my roots and I’m lost in the wind
Wind on the mountain, and the mountain’s my friend

And I’ve only got so near (Illuminate me)
And I’ve only gone so far (Illuminate me)
And I’ll walk another country mile
I’ll see another star

Hemlock and yew have me toeing the line
Questions come knocking, I’ll answer in time
But the seams of the soil unravel with ease
Nose to the road and I’m painfully free

And I’ve only got so near (Illuminate me)
And I’ve only gone so far (Illuminate me)
And I’ll walk another country mile
I’ll see another star

Call me the wind in the hole
Blowing my way to the call
I’ll dust up the days 'til I’ve gone every way
No less and I’ve never wanted more, more, more

Lost on the bough in a golden refrain
Sleep goes away and the day comes again
But the rain on my cap has me chasing a roof
I’ll be this young choice 'til I’m long in the tooth

And I’ve only got so near (Illuminate me)
And I’ve only gone so far (Illuminate me)
And I’ll walk another country mile
I’ll see another star

And I’ve only got so near (Illuminate me)
And I’ve only gone so far (Illuminate me)
And I’ll walk another country mile
I’ll see another star

Illuminate me
Illuminate me
