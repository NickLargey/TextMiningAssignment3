I wanna go where you go, do what you do
Love when you love then I'll be happy
Smile when you smile then I'll be happy.

I wanna sigh when you sigh, cry when you cry
I'll follow you sweetheart and share your little love nest
I wanna go where you go, do what you do
Love when you love then I'll be happy.
If you go north or south, if you go east or west 

(I wanna go where you go, do what you do)
Love when you love then I'll be happy
(I wanna sigh when you sigh, cry when you cry)
Smile when you smile then I'll be happy.

I wanna go where you go, do what you do
I'll follow you sweetheart and share your little love nest
If you go north or south, if you go east or west
Love when you love then I'll be happy...
