It might be the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
Cause baby you've been on my mind

I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down
Don't get upset, I am not pleading
Or saying I can't forget you
Well it don't even matter who you awaken with tomorrow
Cause baby you've been on my mind

When you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror
Oh you know I won't be next to you
You know I won't be near
I'll just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on her mind

It might be the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
Cause baby you've been on my mind

Baby you've been on my mind

Baby you've been on my mind
