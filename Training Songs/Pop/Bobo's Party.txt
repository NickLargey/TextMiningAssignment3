Once I bought a curious bottle, 
Once I bought a bottle for fun. 
Tell me what you gonna do with the bottle 
When the curiousity's done. 
Well I brought it out to the Bo Bo's party 
Then I got it in to the company, 
Then I brought it up to the boys in the backroom, 
They got the knack to tune in on me, 
Then I brought it up to the boys in the backyard. 
I find it hard to hold on me, 
I find it hard to hold, I find it hard to hold, 
I find it hard to hold on me, I find it hard to hold on me, 
I find it hard to hold, hard to hold, hard to hold. 
 
You know, I've been bad, but 
I would be good instead. 
Ah, if my man did half of the things that he said, 
I wouldn't have to go to the Bo Bo's party 
I wouldn't have to go to the company, 
I wouldn't have to go to the boys in the backroom, 
With their knack to tune in on me, 
I wouldn't have to go to the boys in the backyard. 
I find it hard to hold on me, 
I find it hard to hold, I find it hard to hold, 
I find it hard to hold on me, I find it hard to hold on me, 
I find it hard to hold, hard to hold, hard to hold. 
 
You know, I've been bad, but 
I would be good instead. 
Ah, if my man did half of the things that he said, 
I wouldn't have to go to the Bo Bo's party 
I wouldn't have to go to the company, 
I wouldn't have to go to the boys in the backroom, 
With their knack to tune in on me, 
I wouldn't have to go to the boys in the backyard. 
I find it hard to hold on me, 
I find it hard to hold on me, 
I find it hard to hold.
