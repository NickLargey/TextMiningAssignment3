Well, now, it takes more than a Robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
Well, it takes two hearts a cookin' to make a fire grow
And baby, you've got what it takes, yeah

And it takes a lot of woman to knock me off my feet
And baby, you've got what it takes

I said, "Mm, mm, mm, uh huh, mm, mm, mm
Ah, ah, hah, mm, mm"

Because it takes more than an effort to stay away from you
It'd take more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true

But it takes somebody special to make me say, "I do"
(Oh, yeah)
And baby, you've got what it takes
Ah, ah, hah, mm, mm, uh huh, mm, mm, mm

You know you've got just what it takes
Because it takes, you're back in my spot again, honey
(Oh yeah, I like your spot)
To stay away from you

It takes more than a lifetime, daddy
To prove that I'll be true, now it's you

But, it takes somebody special
(Like me, baby)
To make me say, "I do"
And baby, you've got what it takes, say it again

C'mon, let's do it one more time, all right?
And baby, you've got what it takes
One more time, Brook
And baby, you've got what it takes
