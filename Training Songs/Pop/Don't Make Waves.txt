Oh let our hearts go free,
If you wanna love me,
Oh then don't, don't make waves

If you feel uneasy,
And you can't trust me,
And you don't believe me,
Then you're in too deep,
'Cause you take my love,
And you give me nothing,
Oh holding on is only right,
Love will never make it overnight

So please don't, don't make waves,
Let love run smoothe babe
Oh let our hearts go free,
If you wanna love me
Oh then don't, don't make waves

If you feel abandoned,
On a restless sea,
And if you're still uncertain,
Can't you let it be,
'Cause the tide will turn,
If we stay together,
Oh holding on is only right,
Love will never make it if we fight

So please don't, don't make waves,
Let love run smooth babe
Oh let our hearts go free,
If you wanna love me
Oh then don't, don't make waves

Oh let our hearts go free yeah,
If you wanna love me, love me baby,
Oh then don't, don't make waves,
Are you listenin' baby
Don't, don't, don't make waves
