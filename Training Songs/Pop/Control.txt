Well it started as a game
Using pleasure, using pain
We got higher and higher that way
But it didn't work today

Even though it felt so right
Nothing's permanent in life
So it's useless to hold on so tight

Well you gotta
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Ooh oh oh

Give it up
Give it up
Ooh oh oh

Give it up
Give it up
You lost control
'Cause nothing stays around too long

So now everything has changed
And your heart's been rearranged
Until nothing we've known here remains
And you say you shouldn't stay

As you're taking off your clothes
You think it's love and I suppose
It's just you endlessly needing control

Well you gotta
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Ooh oh oh

Give it up
Give it up
Ooh oh oh

Give it up
Give it up
You lost control
'Cause nothing stays around too long

Nothing stays around too long
Nothing stays around too long
You lost control
You gotta give it up
