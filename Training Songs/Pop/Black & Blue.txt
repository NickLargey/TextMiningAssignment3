[Barry:]
There are no stars tonight,
There are no words to say
I feel my soul losing you

[Phyllis:]
Where did the good times go,
Baby what can we do
Color our love

[Both:]
Black and blue, Black and blue

[Phyllis:]
When our hearts were young,
Clinging to each other
Moonlight used to glow

[Both:]
When our hearts were young,
Then there was no other

[Barry:]
Why'd we let it go
Down on the avenue,
You can forget your name

[Both:]
Paint pretty pictures,
False and true

[Barry:]
Picture what we've become

[Phyllis:]
Running is all we do
Color our love

[Both:]
Black and blue, Black and blue

[Phyllis:]
Looks like a storm tonight

[Barry:]
Look like a storm tonight

[Phyllis:]
A storm is overdue

[Barry:] A storm is overdue
[Phyllis:]
Color our love

[Barry:]
Color our love

[Both:]
Black and blue, Black and blue, Oh
