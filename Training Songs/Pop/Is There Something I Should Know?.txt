Please, please tell me now
Please, please tell me now
Please, please tell me now
Please, please tell me now

I made a run, I run out yesterday
Tried to find my mountain hideaway
Maybe next year, maybe no go

I know you're watching me every minute of the day, yeah
I've seen the signs and the looks and pictures
That give your game away, yeah

There's a dream that strings the road
With broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say

Please, please tell me now
Is there something I should know?
Is there something I should say?
That would make you come my way
Do you feel the same 'cause you don't let it show (ooh)

People stare and cross the road from me
And jungle drums they all clear the way for me
Can you read my mind, can you see in the snow
And fiery demons all dance when you walk through that door
Don't say you're easy on me, you're about as easy as a nuclear war

There's a dream that strings the road
With broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say

Please, please tell me now
Is there something I should know?
Is there something I should say?
That would make you come my way
Do you feel the same 'cause you don't let it show

Please, please tell me now
Is there something I should know? (please, please tell me now)
Is there something I should say? (please, please tell me now)
That would make you come my way (please, please tell me now)

Please, please tell me now
Can you see what makes me blow? (please, please tell me now)
Can you see how much I die? (please, please tell me now)
Every time it passes by (please, please tell me now)

Please, please tell me now
What it takes to make you show (please, please tell me now)
Is there something I should know? (please, please tell me now)
Is there something I should say? (please, please tell me now)
