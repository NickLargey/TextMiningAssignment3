(J. Astrop, S. Fox)

Do you want me baby
Do you want my love?
Do you want me baby
Do you want my love?

So many questions demanding answers
Is the writing on the wall
Do you want me
The way I want you
Do you hold this love up
Or do we let it fall
Forever knowing
You're the one now
Ever growing in my heart
Feel the pressure
That we are under
For this love to fall apart
We should make a start

Do you want me baby
Do you want my love?
Are we taking it for granted
Do we call the whole thing off

If you want me baby
Got to let me know
Do you want me baby
Or do I let you go

It's so peculiar
How emotion takes you higher
Than the furthest star above
When two lovers kiss
Do they wonder
Whether this is infatuation
Or is it really love?

Do you want me baby
Do you want my love?
Are we taking it for granted
Do we call the whole thing off

If you want me baby
Got to let me know
Do you want me baby
Or do I let you go...
