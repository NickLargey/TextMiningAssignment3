It's hard to know just what to do in times like these
It's hard to know just what to say
And I'm just sitting here just asking myself why
It's good to know you feel the same 

And I believe
I want to be your everything
And anything you need. 

[Chorus]
Don't cry for us tonight
Don't cry we'll be all right
If I could I'd be by your side
Don't cry for us 

You know that I'd give anything to watch you sleep
I can picture you just lying there
We don't need to say the words
Cause they don't mean a thing
You know you're not alone when someone cares. 

And I believe
You are still my anything
And everything I need

[Chorus]

Built of steel, we may seem weak
and rusted
But in times like these we've always won
and trusted
in ourselves 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

It's hard to know just what to do in times like these
It's hard to know just what to say
