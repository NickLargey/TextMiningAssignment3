I'm here to just confirm what I've been
Really always sayin'
About modern jazz
It's the savior of the nation
And I'll believe it if you do too
The rhythm and blues
Like bird
When he thought of this melody
The message he played on his horn
Was the steady confirmation
That he discovered
The sound that makes the music be free
This may sound unstable
But I know I'm able to concentrate in song to you
My lyrics may go fast
Sometimes a word may get past folks
But so I keep it swingin'
I know I've got to stay true
So like the bird I'm gonna say that jazz is always
A happiness groove
So come on and I'll confirm it
'cause certainly the bird that I heard
Made the word of confirmation
