I want someone who lives up to this grandeur in my head
And you don’t do much to sell me I’d be best with you instead.
I hate the way I feel, but I don’t think I can change.
I just breathe you each day.

Are we only damaging the little we have left?
Both of us swimming in the same polluted mess.
Are we too damaged now to possibly connect?
To honestly connect?

A lot of time’s been wasted putting off doing the work.
If we both step up to own it then I’ll take what’s coming first.
Of everything you say, it’s the truth that really hurts.
But how could that be worse?

Are we only damaging the little we have left?
Both of us swimming in the same polluted mess.
Are we too damaged now to possibly connect?
To ever reconnect?

I’ll say when I’m ready.
You’ll know when I’m ready.
When I’m ready (are we only damaging, damaging)
When I’m ready (are we only damaging, damaging)

Are we only damaging the little we have left?
Both of us swimming in the same polluted mess.
Are we too damaged now to possibly connect?
To honestly connect?
