Just because I'm kind and gentle,
Slightly sentimental,
Honey, I'm a fool for you!
Don't be so mean to me baby,
'Cause baby's so good to you!

Could you go and leave me cryin'
Without even tryin'?
You must be made of stone!
Don't be so mean to me baby,
'Cause baby's so all alone!

Just because you know I love you,
And I've love you for so long,
Please don't try to take advantage,
'Cause I believe that love can do no wrong!

When you tell me that you love me,
Think the whole world of me,
Then turn around and say we're through,
Don't be so mean to me baby,
'Cause baby's so good for you!

When you tell me that you love me,
Think the whole world of me,
Then turn around and say we're through,
Don't be so mean to me baby,
'Cause baby's so good for you!
You're the meanest man in town,
Oh, how you bring me down!
Don't be so mean to baby!
