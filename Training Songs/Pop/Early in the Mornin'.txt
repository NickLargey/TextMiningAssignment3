I long to touch You like the rising sun 
Early in the morning 
Early in the morning 
I want to feel Your warmness by My side 
Early in the morning 
Early in the morning 

So come and lay by Me and stay by Me 
Don't be afraid to open up Your love and let Me in 
Let Me in 
I've needed One like You to love Me too 
Early in the morning 
Early in the morning 

I want to be where You are 
I want to see You as You are 
I've needed One like You to love Me too 
Early in the morning 
Early in the morning 

I long to touch You like the rising sun 
Early in the morning 
Early in the morning 
I want to feel Your warmness by My side 
Early in the morning 
Early in the morning 

Early in the morning, early in the morning 
Early in the morning, early in the morning
