Bury a jar of shaosing
When the girl is born
Surely you know the wine will age
Till sheâ€™s fully grown

Don't fly into the night
Soon enough the world will end
While the lantern is right

I could find a good time girl in Chinatown, Chinatown
Dancing in my shoes
See the eastern ladies walk in Chinatown
Chinatown, chain me down, Chinatown

Maybe, I'll drink your jasmine tea
Then I'll hurry home
Surely you know the likes of me
Should be left alone

Why they like me for?
Soon enough the world will end
If I answer the door

I could find a good time girl in Chinatown, Chinatown
Dancing in my shoes
See the eastern ladies walk in Chinatown
Chinatown, chain me down, Chinatown

Look at the tall pagoda through
Through your window pane
Watching it by your dragon night
On a cocoa day

You'll discover the white
Orchids in my humble moon
While the lantern is right

I could find a good time girl in Chinatown, Chinatown
Dancing in my shoes
See the eastern ladies walk in Chinatown
Chinatown, chain me down, Chinatown
