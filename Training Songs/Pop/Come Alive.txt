What ever happen to your child-like wonder
Whatever happened to your heartfelt faith
You used to live your life with such a hunger
What ever happened to those days

Your smile use to tell a beautiful story
But every life takes a few wrong turns
And now you hide your heart afraid that you're too far beyond repair
Oh but I am his

[Chorus]
Bring your broken heart to me 
Lift it up and you will see
That love can make a heart that's barely beating
Come alive come alive

My love is stronger than your weakest moment
My grace is greater than your worst mistake
No matter where you've been
I'm waiting at here end of every road

[Chorus]

Close your eyes, let me love you, I'm by your side

[Chorus]

Even when it all goes wrong there's no such thing as too far gone
And love can make a hear that's barley beating
Come alive come alive
Close your eyes let me love you I'm by your side
Come alive come alive come alive come alive
