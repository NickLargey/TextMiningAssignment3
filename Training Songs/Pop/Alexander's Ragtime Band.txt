Come on and hear, come on and hear
Alexander's Ragtime Band
Come on and hear, come on and hear
It's the best band in the land
He can play a bugle call 
like you never heard before
That's just the bestest band what am, oh honey lamb

Come on along, come on along
Let me take you by the hand
Up to the man, up to the man
Who's the leader of the band
And if you want to hear 
the Swanee River played in ragtime
why won't you come right up in here
Alexander's Ragtime Band

Come on and hear Alexander's Ragtime Band

Come on and hear Alexander's Ragtime Band
