You thought you had me, didn't you?
When you lied to my face, I could see the truth
With every step with the way I knew
How you fooled me, boo

Guess you didn’t know that you were my favorite entertainer
I watch you, and laugh and f*ck with you
Don't you take me for a fool
In this game, I own the rules
You were my favorite entertainer
I watch you, I laugh and we fake it too
Don't you take me for a fool
I’ma show you a thing or two

Never seen you comin', I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down
Never seen me comin', I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down

Thought that you were smarter
I'm ashamed for you
I knew it right away when you stopped lovin' me
It happened when your touch wasn't enough for me

Thought that you should know that
You were my favorite entertainer
I watch you, and laugh and f*ck with you
Don’t you play me for a fool
In this game, I own the rules
You were my favorite entertainer
I watch you, I laugh and we fake it too
Don’t you take me for a fool
I'ma show you a thing or two

Never seen you comin’, I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down
Never seen me comin', I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down

Know it’s harder to take, and let's face it
No one's playing your games, let's face it
I'm bein' straight up
I know a fake love when I see it anyway
I'ma turn you down when you need me anyway, anyway, anyway

Never seen you comin', I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down
Never seen me comin', I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down

I know you need me the most
The most, the most
