Paul Kelly (Mushroom)
Don't start me talking or I'll tell everything I know
Don't start me talking I'll spill the beans for sure
Right before your eyes
I'll blow it all open wide
Don't start me talking
Don't start me talking 'cause once I get the itch
Don't start me talking I just have to scratch

First a little slow
Then I start to flow
Don't start me talking
Cheers all you cheers
Help me if I fall
Cheers all you cheers
God bless you all
Don't start me talking or I'll have it all my way
Don't start me talking 'cause night will turn to day

Stars will run and hide
Strong men weep a tide
So don't start me talking
Cheers all you cheers
Help me find a wall
Cheers all you cheers
God bless you all
