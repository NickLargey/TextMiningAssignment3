Oh, my soul
 Sometimes we don't know what to do
 We work so hard
 Being tough on our own
 But now it's me and you
 Let's give it up
 Sad bones
 Cause we all fall on hard times
 But you don't have to stand up all alone
 Just put your hand in mine

 Climb on
 A back that's strong
 Hey hey
 You can git' what you want
 Climb on
 A back that's strong

 If you could save me
 A place in heaven
 With a clean well-lighted room
 I'll muscle up to Armageddon
 And I'll wave to you darlin'
 Be home soon
 And if you could show me
 The story of love
 I would write it
 Again and again
 And then you could be
 The woman you need
 If you just let me be
 The man that I am

 Oh, I don't know
 Sometimes we try too hard to see
 But we got one down now
 One more to go
 That's when you say
 To me
