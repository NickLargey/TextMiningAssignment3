Oh, the measure of her man
Is in a woman's eyes
She can make him something special
If she tries

From the moment she that she gives herself
Her life is not the same
It's a woman way to live
So she proudly takes his name

For a woman's life is empty
Until she finds her man
It's a woman way to give all that she can

And she'll watch him chase his dreams
And never look back to complain
'Cause it's a woman's way to give
When giving is all she's got to gain

When a woman loves a man
There's no greater thing on earth
And each time with him is always like the first

And when a woman's gives a child to you
You made yourself a name
That's a woman way to love
And for love she bears the pain

Sometimes I stop and wonder why she did it all for me
And then I realize she's who she wants to be

And without her here I'd never be the man I am today
So I try to make her smile
A little more each day

And I silently give thanks for her
For her woman's way
And I silently give thanks for her
For her woman's way
