Are you afraid of me?
Well, are you afraid of me?

What are you trying to do to me, do to me?
What are you trying to prove to me, to prove to me?
There's something you're not saying but your actions say enough
And I don't know what's really going on

Well, are you afraid of me?
(Are you... afraid, are you afraid of me?)
Well, are you afraid of me?
(Are you... afraid, are you afraid of me?)

I leave a message every night but you don't call me
The only times we ever talk you're in a hurry
I know my reputation doesn't help you sleep at night
Well, lately, baby, I feel I don't know you

Well, are you afraid of me?
(Are you... afraid, are you afraid of me?)
Well, are you afraid of me?
(Are you... afraid, are you afraid of me?)

I, I thought we were the same but now you play this game
You're young, no fun; and you're making me crazy

Well, are you afraid of me?
(Are you... afraid, are you afraid of me?)
Well, are you afraid of me?
(Are you... afraid, are you afraid of me?)
Are you afraid of me?
(Are you... afraid, are you afraid of me?)
Are you afraid of me?
(Are you... afraid, are you afraid of me?)
