(Martin Plaza)
I wouldn't speak ill of you
That would be unfair
I could not do that again
Someone's always there, someone's always there
Offer me a role, with dignity,
Offer me control with dignity,
Offer me a role, won't you offer me control.
Why do you pretend
To be so naive
Give me one excuse
For being allowed to breathe
Offer me a role.
Don't wanta be a big wheel
But I sure won't be a slave
Don't wanta be a big wheel
But I sure won't be a slave,
Won't be a slave.
I have you alone, you alone to thank
You taught me how to swim,
When you made me walk the plank.
Offer me a role,
Won't you offer me control,
Offer me control.
Don't wanta be a big wheel
But I sure won't be your slave
Don't wanta be a big wheel
But I sure won't be your slave...
