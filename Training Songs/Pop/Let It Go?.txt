Once I saw a promised land
Wrapped in many shades of green
But I sat and watched the world go by
Confused by all the things I've seen

Should I stand up, say what's on my mind
Point my finger at the wrong I find
Let it linger till another time
Or let it go?

I've seen forests turn to fields of sand
To satisfy a rich man's greed
Now the tears that fall upon this land
Won't help to grow a nation's needs

Should I shout out from the highest tower
Should I take it to the highest power
Show the plague that turns a whole world sour
Or let it go?

I seek comfort in a sea of fools
And wrap their lies around for protection
But if lies were any answer at all
We're just adding to this world infection

Can I turn and smile and kiss it away?
Leave it lying for another day
Should I fall down on my knees and pray
Or let it go?

There's a passion that destroys all the caring (ah-ah, ah-ah)
And walks across the flowers of affection (ah-ah, ah-ah)
Breaks them down into the soil we are sharing (ah-ah, ah-ah)
And leaves us with this life of rejection (ah-ah, ah-ah)

Am I strong enough to stand my ground? (ah-ah, ah-ah)
Lift my head and show the strength I've found (ah-ah, ah-ah)
Try to keep from hell or heaven bound (ah-ah, ah-ah)
Or let it go?

Don't let it go

Should I shout out from the highest tower
Should I take it to the highest power
Show the plague that turns a whole world sour
Or let it go?
