As long as I'm singing, 
There's a bell up in my brain that's ringing,
Makin' a crazy 'ding dong'.
And if this band don't desert me,
Then there's nothin' in the world can hurt me,
Long as I'm singing my song.

Give me trumpets legato, 
Put some saxes with 'em,
Strings pizzicato and some rhythm.
As long as I'm singing,
Then the world's all right and everything's swingin'
Long as I'm singing my song.

Making music is more to me than a pleasure,
'cause me and music, 
We go together like notes in a measure.
As long as I'm singing,
Then the world's all right and everything's swingin'
Long as I'm singing my song.
