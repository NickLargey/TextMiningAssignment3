Well, you can stay all night if you want to
You can hang out with all of his friends
You can go and meet his mother and father
Hmm, you better make sure that's where it ends

'Cause baby, there's one thing that you gotta know:
Let him read your palm and guess your sign
Let him take you home and treat you fine
But baby -
Don't let him waste your time
Don't let him waste your time

'Cause the years fly by in an instant
And you wonder what he's waiting for
Oh, then some skinny bitch walks by in some hot pants
And he's a-running out the door

So remember that one thing that you gotta know:
Let him read your palm and guess your sign
Let him take you home and treat you so fine
But baby -
Don't let him waste your time
Don't let him waste your time

You ain't getting no younger
And you've got nothing to show
So tell him that it's now or never
And then -
Go go go go go

He can have his space
Yeah, he can take his time
Now he can kiss you where the sun don't shine
Oh baby -

Don't let him waste your time
Don't let him waste your time
Don't let him waste your time
Don't let him waste your time
Don't let him waste your time

No, don't let him waste your time
No, don't let him waste your time
No, don't let him waste your time
No, don't let him waste your time
