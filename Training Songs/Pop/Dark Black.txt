I remember colors painted in my eyes
Green was for the springtime, blue the summer skies
And now the skies have darken, the white clouds turn to grey
What a way to break a heart, you took all the colors away

Dark black is the color of my life
Since you’ve been gone
Since you’ve been gone
Oh if you come back
Make my whole world bright
Since you’ve been gone
Dark black is the color of my life

I remember visions, you taught me how to see
The world of your colors was right there in front of me
Oh but what good is a rainbow, if the picture’s in black and in white
Oh what good is a future when there’s not a color inside

Since you’ve been gone
Since you’ve been gone
Oh if you come back
Make my whole world bright
Since you’ve been gone
Dark black is the color of my life
Dark black
Dark black
