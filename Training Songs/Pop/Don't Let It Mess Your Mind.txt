Once upon a lonely time, though not so long ago,
You used to be a super-star, you used to steal the show.
But now you must be satisfied with singin' on the street
And watch the world go passin' by, that once was at your feet.
 
Baby don't let it mess your mind, no,
Sadness ain't a feelin' that becomes you.
Baby don't let it mess your mind, no,
Remember life will always love you.
 
In and out of circles all the time we seem to waste,
to make our plans and find that all our plans have been erased.
We've had a little money and we made a little time,
And soon we'll grow forgetful of all we've left behind.
 
Baby don't let it mess your mind, no,
Sadness ain't a feelin' that becomes you.
Baby don't let it mess your mind, no no no no,
Remember life will always love you.
 
Baby don't let it mess your mind, no,
Sadness ain't a feelin' that becomes you.
Baby don't let it mess your mind, oh no no no no no no,
Remember life will always love you.
