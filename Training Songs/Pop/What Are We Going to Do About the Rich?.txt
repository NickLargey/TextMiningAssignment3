What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
Come on, well come on!

They say democracy is simply very bad for business
While deploring student protests in the middle of Hong Kong
They insist the people have to work on zero contracts everywhere
So profit margins grow and shares are very strong
But one group that they never take to task
And one question that they never seem to ask

Is what are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
Come on, well come on!

They're buying football clubs today with absolute impunity
And so much of the media to give themselves the power
To destroy the very notion and the feeling of community
While poisoning the public discourse hour by hour
But although it never seems to make it into hansard
The question at some point must still be answered

Oh, what are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
Come on, well come on!

What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
Come on, well come on!

They're avoiding paying taxes while the welfare state collapses
Their extravagance and arrogance, their lack of tact to balance this
Their lawyers and their attitude, the scale of their ingratitude
They only give to charity for maximum publicity

What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
Come on, well come on!

What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
Come on, well come on!
