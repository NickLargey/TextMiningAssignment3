I'm asking you to tell me why
You leave me as often as you do
Am I to be your used to be
Can I be losing you?

I tell myself, I've got to know
But every part of me is saying, no
Don't answer me, don't answer me
I'm so afraid you'll say you want me to go

Why can't I be happy
To be with you now and then?
For now and then's better
Than never again

I don't know why I'm asking you
When I know what it may be leading to
Don't answer me, don't answer me

Not if you're gonna tell me that we're through
Don't answer me, oh, don't answer me
For I'll be left with nothing if I lose you
