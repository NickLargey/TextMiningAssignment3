My mom gave me a nickel to buy a pickle
But I didn't buy a pickle I bought some choo'n gum
Chew chew chew choo'n gum
How I love choo'n gum
Well I'm crazy over choo'n gum
I chew chew chew
My aunt gave me a quarter
For soda water
But I didn't buy no water
I bought some choo'n gum
Chew chew chew choo'n gum
How I love choo'n gum
Well I'm crazy over choo'n gum
What can I do
I chew all day the way it seems
I'm even blowing bubbles in my dreams
My pop gave me a dollar
To buy a collar
Well you should have heard him holler
When I bought choo'n gum
Chew chew chew chew chew choo'n gum
How I love choo'n gum
I'm crazy over choo'n gum
I chew chew chew
I chew the day the way it seems
I'm even blowing bubbles in my dreams
My pop gave me a dollar
To buy a collar
Well you should have heard him holler
When I bought choo'n gum
Chew chew chew chew chew choo'n gum
How I love choo'n gum
I'm crazy over choo'n gum
I chew chew and chew
