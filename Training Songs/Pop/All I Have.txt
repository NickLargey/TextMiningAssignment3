Here we go at it three years later
Will you help me to dream it all up again
Tired of the same song everyone's singing
Rather be lost with you instead

Don't you come around here
Come around here anymore
Dragging my fears
Dragging my fears
Out the door
All I have
All I have
All I have
Well, you know it's yours
Every breathe
Every step
Every moment
I'm looking for
All I have
All I have
All I have
Is yours
And you watch my heart break a little bit more
My heart break a little bit more

Is it cold yet in New York City?
'Round here the trees been blowing off bare
Everyone's talking about change on the airwaves
I still got you on my breathe

Don't you come around here
Come around here anymore
Dragging my fears
Dragging my fears
Out the door
All I have
All I have
All I have
Well, you know it's yours
Every breathe
Every step
Every moment
I'm looking for
All I have
All I have
All I have
Is yours
And you watch my heart break a little bit more
My heart break a little bit more

Oh I still trying to do my hardest
Pick us all up from the fall oh
Off the little corner of the darkness
Just a crack the light in the middle of it all

All I have
All I have
All I have
Well, you know it's yours
Every breathe
Every step
Every moment
I'm looking for
All I have
All I have
All I have
Is yours
And you watch my heart break a little bit more
My heart break a little bit more
My heart break a little bit more
Watching my heart break a little bit more
My heart break a little bit more
My heart break a little bit more

Little bit more
Little bit more
Little bit more
