Be still my beating heart
There's so much time
Allow yourself to mend
Trying to be strong when weak
You break if you don't bend
It's a long night
But it's alright
Don't give yourself away

Change comes when it does
We all grow up when we do
You can ask yourself questions
You can struggle for truth
Can't hurry the harvest
Can't hurry the harvest

I was holding you so close
So much was meant to be
I thought I heard your voice
But let you go
You took so much of me
Oh my darling, my little one
Did it have to be this way

Change comes when it does
We all grow up when we do
You can ask yourself questions
You can struggle for truth
Can't hurry the harvest
Can't hurry the harvest

I'll plant a seed and watch it flower
Seasons will change
Colours will turn
Nothing remains the same
Can't hurry the harvest

Change comes when it does
We all grow up when we do
You can ask yourself questions
You can struggle for truth
Can't hurry the harvest
Can't hurry the harvest
