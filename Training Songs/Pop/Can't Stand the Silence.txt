I wanna stand up, take a bow
Sit down and work it out
I'm the last person in this world
Who wants to see you hurt
Is this the interval, or the end
If we don't talk we can't reconcile
What we really need,
What we know is right

I can't stand the silence
I can't stand the silence
Anymore.
I can't stand the silence
I can't stand the silence
That we're going through

We gotta work this out
Before it goes too far
We gotta work this out
Too many have taken a fall
We have to know what we're fighting for
We gotta work this out

If you're searching for reasons
Follow the signs
Keep running in my direction
Or we'll run out of time
I know it's not easy
But we've come this far
Forgiveness is a revelation
Let me love you now
For who we are

I can't stand the silence
I can't stand the silence
That we're going through

We gotta work this out
Before it goes too far
We gotta work this out
Too many have taken the fall
We have to know what we're fighting for
We gotta work this out

Oohohoo help me work this out!

Oohohoo help me work this out!

Oohohoo help me work this out!

Oohohoo

I can't stand the silence
I can't stand the silence
Anymore
