Who's The King? 
You're like the King of Rock & Roll 
Filled with a soul and all fucked up on Demerol 
Like the King 
you're only headed for the ground 
Your own Graceland  Your body never found 

I smell a rat up the back 
But no a former champion 
The hardest man alive's in an Indiana prison 
What does Donnie do about that? 
He lets his main man rot 
As his pockets grow fat 

Don't snooze,ya gotta make your moves 
Nobody move, nobody gets hurt 

Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt 
But still Rodney King got treated like dirt 
And why can't we all get along 
Why get along with the cops 
They beat ya like a dog 

Jumpin high with pride 
in the red, white & blue 
Was it the thrills, the spills 
Of the Rocket cycle dude 
The King dare devil 
Took it to another level, 
Evil Knievel, a well paid rebel
