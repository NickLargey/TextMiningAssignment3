Tear dimmed remembrance 
In a womb of time
Breath upon me
Possessed by the passion
Fate will set you free
Infertile
Chased be the precious 
When flesh is an enemy
Fair weather man 

Step aside from the way of a better man than you
So you fall at his feet he's the one who betrays you
It's the servants devotion for the decay
Stand up

There are no flowers on your grave
There are no chains
There I keep chanting for the forgotten name

Why you feel so empty
And still have everything
It's fulfillment
I've got more companions
When I'm all alone
Flesh is fetching
