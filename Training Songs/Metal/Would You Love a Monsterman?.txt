Fire at will, will, will, will
Fire at will! 
Yeah, I would kill! 
Yeah, I would freeze the hell over just to get a chill 
Yeah, I would slay! 
Yeah, I would maim! 
Yeah, I would vanish in thin air and reappear again 

Be right in the squares, yeah I would be sincere 
Yeah, I would lie! 
Yeah, I would lie! 
Yeah, I would be there waking up the dead to get a thrill

I say yeah! I say yeah! 

Would you love a monsterman? 
Could you understand, 
the Beauty of the beast? 
I would do it all for you 
Would you do it all, do it all for me? 

Take your time, you´ll be fine 
Yeah, there is nothing wrong with this
you ain´t committing crime 
You don´t know why 
It passed you by 
You search for something never found along these lines 

Someday you may turn around and terrify 
You can´t deny
You crucify! 
would you get down in the gutter swalloing your pride

I say yeah! I say yeah! 
Would you love a monsterman? 
Could you understand, 
the Beauty of the beast? 
I would do it all for you 
Would you do it all, do it all for me? 

All that you get is less than you deserve 
Leaving for now, someday I may return 

(Huaaow) 
Would you love a monsterman? 

Would you love a monsterman? 
Could you understand, 
the Beauty of the beast? 
I would do it all for you 
Would you do it all, do it all for me? 

Would you love a monsterman? 
Could you understand, 
the Beauty of the beast? 
I would do it all for you 
Would you do it all, do it all for me?
